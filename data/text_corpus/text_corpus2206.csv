11030,in the subsurface irrigation management of extensively cropped vegetables uniform crop growth requires the maintenance of uniform soil water suction at the root zone across a field moreover a fixed value of suction that is suitable for crop growth should be maintained however accounting for the temporal and spatial changes in the suction is beyond human capability using hydrus 2d this study modeled a spinach field in tsukuba japan which is irrigated by subsurface irrigation pipes the subsurface pipes were located 55 cm below the soil surface the pipes were placed 150 cm apart belt shaped water shielding sheets were installed beneath the pipes irrigation was empirically managed the measured physical soil properties of the spinach field were input into the model as initial values and then calibrated using the irrigation data and observed soil water suction across the field the calibrated model was further verified by comparing the simulated and other observed suctions after model verification several scenarios were created by varying the given conditions 1 the intervals of subsurface irrigation pipes 2 the depths at which the irrigation pipes were located 3 the existence of a water shielding sheet beneath the irrigation pipes and 4 the shape of the water shielding sheet these scenarios were compared and the optimal scenario which facilitates equal soil water suction that is close to the suction required for the growth of spinach was selected keywords hydrus subsurface irrigation inverse solution optimization spinach 1 introduction designing a subsurface irrigation system is a daunting task this is primarily because the infiltration area of the irrigated water is invisible variances in the soil water profile depending on the distance from a subsurface irrigation pipe causes crops to grow unevenly especially in the subsurface irrigation management of extensively cropped vegetables such as spinach powell and wright 1993 hanson et al 1996 camp et al 1997 sasaki et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to maintain even soil water suction in the horizontal direction furthermore the suction should be maintained at a fixed value that is suitable for crop growth although tracking the temporal and special changes of the suction is not possible these days hydrus a software for simulating water movement in soil is often used to examine the management of irrigation systems skaggs et al 2010 dabach et al 2013 phogat et al 2013 elnesr et al 2014 the institute of vegetable and tea science in tsukuba japan has performed tests on spinach and lettuce plantings using a subsurface irrigation system designed for extensively cropped vegetables the subsurface irrigation can save labors to remove and install irrigation facilities which is needed at irrigation methods with sprinkler or tube when farmer uses tiller and harvester since growing period of leaf vegetables is short this labor saving merit is a great advantage of the subsurface irrigation in addition the subsurface irrigation can reduce the risk of sunburn and diseases while sprinkling increases them by wetting and splashing of mud this irrigation system has also been introduced to fields in the okinawa miyazaki ibaraki and miyagi prefectures in japan as a new irrigation method for extensively cropped vegetables however the design of this irrigation system is not based on any calculation therefore the development of a better design is required this study attempted to optimize the design of the subsurface irrigation system for vegetables which is installed in a field belonging to the institute of vegetable and tea science using hydrus as a tool to consider the temporal and spatial changes in the soil water suction 2 methodology 2 1 site the field under study was located in the institute of vegetable and tea science tsukuba japan at lat 36 1 n and long 140 6 e it was covered by a clear plastic sheet ceiling 9 m wide by 20 m long therefore rain didn t reach the soil surface but the temperature of the air was equal to that of the open air subsurface irrigation pipes with lengths of 16 4 m were installed at depths of 55 cm and at intervals of 150 cm along with a water shielding sheet as shown in fig 1 the soil of the field under study was andosol the annual mean precipitation was 1282 9 mm y 1 and the annual mean air temperature was 13 8 c spinach was disseminated on march 23 2016 at the density of 10 cm and harvested on may 03 2016 2 2 measurement of the physical soil properties the soil was sampled at depths of 5 15 25 35 and 45 cm by 100 cm3 core samplers 50 mm in diameter and 51 mm in height after sampling the soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity porosity and water retention curve were measured the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the falling head method the porosity was measured using the oven drying method and the water retention curve was determined using the inverse solution function in hydrus 1d rassam and simunek 2003 the inverse solution was found by fitting the observed data which was obtained through the hanging water column and evaporation methods peters and durner 2008 to the durner model durner 1994 2 3 observation of soil water suction the suction of soil water was observed using tensiometers which were placed at depths of 20 cm as same to general depth of tensiometer in japan and points 10 and 60 cm away from the subsurface pipe as shown in fig 1 measurements were conducted at 10 min intervals from march 23 2016 to may 03 2016 we custom made the observation equipment using a negative pressure sensor htvn 100kp 01 v s6vl sensez corporation tokyo japan microcomputer arduino uno rev3 arduino scarmagno italy and memory card sd card shield v4 seeed technology co ltd shenzhen china 2 4 modeling the field under study the field under study was modeled using hydrus 2d rassam and simunek 2003 the time unit of the model was set to h and all time variable conditions were input as hourly data as shown in fig 1 the soil was divided to five layers and the initial values of the physical soil properties were set to pre determined values according to the depth of each layer as shown in section 2 2 the upper boundary of the domain was set to the atmospheric conditions which specified the hourly potential transpiration and potential evaporation the potential transpiration and evaporation were calculated from the potential evapotranspiration data which were calculated based on the observed meteorological data and leaf area index using following equation ritchie 1972 t p e t p 1 e x p 0 82 l a i e p e t p t p where tp is the potential transpiration etp is the potential evapotranspiration lai is the leaf area index and ep is the potential evaporation the leaf area index parameter was obtained from the soil and water assessment tool input output file documentation neitsch et al 2009 and calculated by the cumulative temperature of a given day the potential evapotranspiration data was obtained from meteocrop db naro 2017 the lower boundary of the domain was set to the free drainage conditions at a depth of 200 cm from the soil surface the water shielding sheet was designed using the outline of the soil dimension and the outline was set to the no flux boundary the subsurface pipe was set to the variable flux boundary which changed hourly according to the irrigation data collected by the flowmeter at ten minute intervals the depth of the root zone was set to 30 cm and the root water uptake model was set to the feddes model feddes et al 1978 with its parameters set to the following values p0 value of the pressure head below which roots start to extract water from the soil 10 cm p0pt value of the pressure head below which roots extract water at the maximum possible rate 25 cm p2h value of the limiting pressure head below which roots can no longer extract water at r2h 400 cm p2l value of the limiting pressure head below which roots can no longer extract water at r2l 600 cm p3 value of the pressure head below which root water uptake ceases 8000 cm r2h potential transpiration rate 0 0208 cm hr 1 and r2l potential transpiration rate 0 0042 cm hr 1 the soil hydraulic model was calibrated as follows with the durner model because the soil of the field under study was well aggregated andosol the observation points were the locations of the tensiometers placed across the study field at first the initial soil suction was set as that observed at the study field on march 23 it was then initialized by simulating the soil water redistribution using the observed atmospheric and irrigation conditions from march 23 to april 11 so that the soil water distribution of the soil dimension of the model approached the actual soil dimension secondly the values of the soil physical properties at each soil layer were calibrated using the inverse solution function in hydrus 2d the inverse solution was executed so that the soil physical properties correspond with the observed soil water suctions at the 2 points the observed meteorological data and the observed irrigation data from april 12 to april 28 calibration period until the correlation coefficient r2 of the inverse solution reached 0 8 2 5 validation of the field model the field model in which the physical soil properties were calibrated using observed soil water suctions during the calibration period was validated using the rmse root mean square error between the calculated and observed from april 29 to may 3 soil water suctions since the soil water suctions were calculated based on the observed meteorological and irrigation data the low value of rmse indicates that the calibrated field model can reproduce the soil water flux between the subsurface irrigation pipes at the actual field 2 6 choosing of the optimal irrigation scenario the design of the field model was varied the details of these scenarios are shown in figs 2 4 it was assumed that the best suction for the root zone of spinach was pf 2 2 it is thought to be between pf2 0 and pf2 4 and that the soil water distribution in the root zone would be horizontally uniform at pf 2 2 to evaluate the uniformity observation points were set at horizontal intervals of 10 cm and depths of 20 cm in the field model as shown in fig 5 the equality was quantified by the following equation r m s e 2 2 1 i m t m i t 1 i m t m ψ i t 158 2 where rmse2 2 is the index of equality more equal at lower value i is the number of given observation points t is the given hour im is the maximum number of observation points tm is the final time of scenario ψi t is the suction of a given observation point at a given hour and 158 is the suction of pf2 2 in cmh2o low rmse2 2 indicates that the suction of each observation point is close to pf2 2 which indicates that the value of each suction is temporally and spatially close to a constant each scenario was initialized by simulating the soil water redistribution using the observed meteorological and irrigation data with calibrated physical soil properties each scenario was then executed using the observed meteorological and irrigation data from april 12 to may 3 in the scenarios designed to examine the optimal horizontal interval of the subsurface irrigation pipes the irrigation data was magnified according to the ratio of the interval of given scenario to 150 cm which was the interval at the study field these irrigation data were collected using a flowmeter using the value of rmse2 2 as an indicator the scenario that can maintain the soil water suction more uniformly temporally and spatially and close to the suitable suction for spinach growth was selected as the optimal one the method used was not multiple objective optimization each object was optimized independently 3 results 3 1 observation fig 6 shows the observed soil water suctions at a depth of 20 cm and at points 10 cm and 60 cm away from the subsurface pipe measured irrigation data and potential evaporation data the observed soil water suctions fluctuated daily these fluctuations are thought to be the effects of the diurnal range in temperature as the tensiometers were not covered by heat insulators the observed data were divided into three periods a warming period from march 23 to april 11 a calibration period from april 12 to april 28 and a validation period from april 29 to may 3 3 2 calibration fig 7 shows the soil water suctions estimated by the calibrated field model at a depth of 20 cm and points 10 cm and 60 cm away from the subsurface pipe and the soil water suction observed during the calibration period the correlation coefficient r2 of the inverse solution was 0 84849 and the value of rmse was 0 006 the calibrated soil physical properties of each soil layer in the field model are shown in table 1 the following figures depict the calibrated soil water movement from april 19 to april 21 fig 8 expresses the soil water suction and fig 9 expresses the soil water flux after irrigation event 3 3 validation the rmse between the estimation and observation was 15 66 cmh2o in soil water suction during the validation period irrigation was conducted on april 28 as shown in fig 7 the estimated and observed soil water suctions both reflect the irrigation on april 28 and change with time therefore it appears that this calibrated field model can estimate field wide soil suctions 3 4 horizontal interval of subsurface irrigation pipes with regard to the horizontal intervals between the subsurface irrigation pipes the estimated soil water suctions of the observation points in the field model were calculated for each interval scenario as shown in fig 10 soil water suctions lower than 158 cmh2o mean wetter than the best suction pf2 2 and suctions higher than 158 cmh2o mean dryer than the best suction in each scenario the observation point closest to the irrigation pipe has the lowest suction while the farthest point has the highest suction in the scenario of wider subsurface irrigation pipe intervals the soil water suction of the nearest observation point to the irrigation pipe became lower due to the larger amount of irrigation water the rmse2 2 was smaller in scenarios with narrower intervals of subsurface irrigation pipes as shown in fig 11 from this point of view it is apparent that narrower pipe intervals allow soil water distribution to be more uniform examples are shown in fig 12 the rmse2 2 of the scenario of 100 cm pipe intervals is 24 cmh2o while that of the scenario of 200 cm pipe intervals is 34 cmh2o this indicates that the soil water suctions at the root zone in the scenario involving 100 cm pipe intervals is closer to pf 2 2 than that in the scenario involving 200 cm pipe intervals 3 5 depth of irrigation pipe and existence of shielding sheet with regard to the depth of the irrigation pipe and the existence of the shielding sheet the estimated soil water suctions of the field model observation points were calculated for each depth scenario of subsurface irrigation pipes as shown in fig 13 each depth scenario was calculated under both conditions with and without the water shielding sheet the rmse2 2 at depths of 45 55 and 65 cm with the water shielding sheet were 39 28 and 25 cmh2o while the rmse2 2 of the scenarios at depths of 45 55 and 65 cm without the water shielding sheet were 31 35 and 56 cmh2o respectively the rates of deep percolation loss in the abovementioned scenarios were 23 2 23 8 24 1 23 6 24 5 and 26 0 respectively 3 6 shape of the shielding sheet the soil water suctions at the observation points in the field model were estimated for each shielding sheet shape scenario the estimated suctions in the calibration and validation periods were averaged as shown in fig 14 the soil water suction for the present shape scenario was wetter than that for the other scenarios at all observation points its average suction was 153 cmh2o at all observation points while those of the scenarios shape 1 shape 2 and shape 3 were 161 160 164 cmh2o respectively the rmse2 2 of the present shape scenario was 28 3 cmh2o while those of scenarios shape 1 shape 2 and shape 3 were 29 2 29 5 and 29 0 cmh2o respectively 4 discussion 4 1 examination of superior subsurface irrigation system design at the institute of vegetable and tea science wider horizontal intervals are economically preferred in the construction of subsurface irrigation systems as reported in section 3 4 a narrower interval allows for a more uniform distribution of irrigation water and the field wide soil water suction becomes closer to pf2 2 the current 150 cm interval at the institute of vegetable and tea science is thought to be too wide because the average root zone suctions during cropping season are pf2 11 at the point closest to the subsurface pipe and pf2 25 at the point farthest from the subsurface pipe wet and dry stresses both disturb crop growth but wet stress would not be imposed to crops in any interval scenarios for which soil suctions are more than pf2 0 considering dry stress the soil suction at the point farthest from the subsurface pipe increases to more than pf2 2 for intervals that are wider than 120 cm as shown in fig 15 an interval of 100 cm is therefore recommended the soil suction in the root zone is drier than pf2 2 for scenarios without the shielding sheet moreover the deep percolation loss of irrigated water is slightly smaller in scenarios with the sheet than in those without therefore the shielding sheet which is currently installed at the institute of vegetable and tea science should be left intact to keep the root zone at pf2 2 and conserve irrigation water in scenarios with the shielding sheet a greater depth is related to a smaller rmse2 2 value in scenarios without the shielding sheet a shallower depth is related to smaller rmse2 2 value when the shielding sheet is left intact as recommended above a depth of 65 cm is thought to be better than the current depth of 55 cm at the institute of vegetable and tea science the rmse2 2 of the current shape of the shielding sheet at the institute of vegetable and tea science is smaller than that of other shape scenarios therefore the current shape of the shielding sheet at the institute of vegetable and tea science is optimal 4 2 issues on optimization the indicator rmse2 2 was proposed for the comparison of scenarios however a better indicator of the equability of soil water distribution of the field wide root zone and the deviance of soil water suction from the optimal suction is necessary as shown in fig 16 scenario a which has larger rmse2 2 value has a high equability of soil water distribution however scenario b which has smaller rmse2 2 value has a low equability of soil water distribution tolerance is another issue related to the indicator to distribute irrigation water perfectly uniformly across a field wide root zone is impossible some tolerance must be predefined before optimization as shown in fig 16 scenario c which has a high equability of soil water distribution facilitates crop growth within the allowable range for harvesting however scenario d which has a low equability of soil water distribution will not allow crop growth within the allowable range for harvesting this threshold of equability of soil water distribution should be prepared as a chart for each crop moreover an ideal indicator should account for the effect of deep percolation loss and the cost of installing a subsurface irrigation system in this study each object was optimized independently however the multiple objective optimization method is needed to design the best subsurface irrigation system 5 conclusions desirable values of each factor 100 cm intervals 65 cm depths with a water shielding sheet such as the current one was determined independently for the subsurface irrigation field at the institute of vegetable and tea science however defining the best indicator for comparing the scenario results remains an issue further studies in the fields of horticulture agricultural engineering and economics will help define the indicator note that these recommended conditions are affected by soil type climate condition irrigation intensity and crop type and are therefore applicable only for our studied field

both disturb crop growth but wet stress would not be imposed to crops in any interval scenarios for which soil suctions are more than pf2 0 considering dry stress the soil suction at the point farthest from the subsurface pipe increases to more than pf2 2 for intervals that are wider than 120 cm as shown in fig 15 an interval of 100 cm is therefore recommended the soil suction in the root zone is drier than pf2 2 for scenarios without the shielding sheet moreover the deep percolation loss of irrigated water is slightly smaller in scenarios with the sheet than in those without therefore the shielding sheet which is currently installed at the institute of vegetable and tea science should be left intact to keep the root zone at pf2 2 and conserve irrigation water in scenarios with the shielding sheet a greater depth is related to a smaller rmse2 2 value in scenarios without the shielding sheet a shallower depth is related to smaller rmse2 2 value when the shielding sheet is left intact as recommended above a depth of 65 cm is thought to be better than the current depth of 55 cm at the institute of vegetable and tea science the rmse2 2 of the current shape of the shielding sheet at the institute of vegetable and tea science is smaller than that of other shape scenarios therefore the current shape of the shielding sheet at the institute of vegetable and tea science is optimal 4 2 issues on optimization the indicator rmse2 2 was proposed for the comparison of scenarios however a better indicator of the equability of soil water distribution of the field wide root zone and the deviance of soil water suction from the optimal suction is necessary as shown in fig 16 scenario a which has larger rmse2 2 value has a high equability of soil water distribution however scenario b which has smaller rmse2 2 value has a low equability of soil water distribution tolerance is another issue related to the indicator to distribute irrigation water perfectly uniformly across a field wide root zone is impossible some tolerance must be predefined before optimization as shown in fig 16 scenario c which has a high equability of soil water distribution facilitates crop growth within the allowable range for harvesting however scenario d which has a low equability of soil water distribution will not allow crop growth within the allowable range for harvesting this threshold of equability of soil water distribution should be prepared as a chart for each crop moreover an ideal indicator should account for the effect of deep percolation loss and the cost of installing a subsurface irrigation system in this study each object was optimized independently however the multiple objective optimization method is needed to design the best subsurface irrigation system 5 conclusions desirable values of each factor 100 cm intervals 65 cm depths with a water shielding sheet such as the current one was determined independently for the subsurface irrigation field at the institute of vegetable and tea science however defining the best indicator for comparing the scenario results remains an issue further studies in the fields of horticulture agricultural engineering and economics will help define the indicator note that these recommended conditions are affected by soil type climate condition irrigation intensity and crop type and are therefore applicable only for our studied field 
11031,the traditional flood irrigation system has led to overexploitation of ground water and low nitrogen n use efficiency in north western india maize based systems with lower irrigation requirement are being advocated as an alternate to rice based systems to address the issues of declining water table bed planting of crops straw mulching and drip irrigation are known to save precious irrigation water and improve n use efficiency and grain yields to this effect a two year field experiment was conducted with annual wheat maize rotation on permanent bed system to evaluate the effect of surface drip irrigation residue management and n application on crop and water productivity maize and wheat under drip irrigation with residue retention system showed significant grain yield increase of 13 7 and 23 1 compared to furrow irrigation with no residue respectively surface drip irrigation with residue retention saved 88 mm and 168 mm of water and increased water productivity by 66 and 259 in wheat and maize on permanent beds compared to the conventional furrow irrigation system with residue removal respectively similarly fertigation at 10 day interval with five splits in wheat and seven splits in maize under drip irrigation system increased the mean n recovery efficiency by 16 5 and 29 compared to furrow irrigation in wheat and maize respectively keywords drip irrigation nitrogen use

total rainfall received during 2014 and 2015 seasons was 420 7 and 535 4 mm respectively 2 3 treatments and experimental design a raised bed planting system with 0 675 m wide beds were used and the crops were planted on top 0 375 m wide of the beds and irrigation applied in the furrows 0 30 m wide the experiment was started with wheat november april as the first crop in 2013 and succeeded by maize june to october the experiment was set up as a split plot design with three irrigation and residue management treatments to both wheat and maize table 1 as the main blocks and four n rates 0 60 90 and 120 kg ha 1 as subplot treatments to both the crops details of the treatments are included in table 1 each subplot size was 81 m2 4 05 m wide and 20 m long there were thus six beds for each treatment combination 2 4 formation of permanent raised beds and crop geometry before establishment of the cover crop of maize in may 2013 disc plough was used to break hard pan if any followed by the use of two runs of cultivator to prepare the field thereafter field was levelled using a laser assisted land levelling system in the last week of june 2013 fresh raised beds 20 cm high were made with a bed planter and well fertilized 120 kg n 26 kg p and 25 kg k ha 1 maize crop was planted on the top of beds in the first week of june and harvested in the third week of october 2013 the permanent beds pbs were prepared in the month of june before the planting of non experimental maize crop in 2013 season while two rows of wheat spaced at 20 cm were planted on top of each bed one row of maize was seeded in the centre of each bed at a plant to plant spacing of 20 cm seed rate of 100 kg and 20 kg ha 1 was used for wheat and maize respectively the pbs were not tilled but were reformed in the furrows without disturbing the top of the bed before planting of each crop traffic was confined to the furrows and narrow wheel tractor tyres were used for all operations 2 5 drip irrigation system and water management the surface drip system consisted of polyethylene laterals of 16 mm in diameter laid parallel to crop rows and each lateral served two rows of wheat and one row of maize lateral spacing was taken as 0 675 m one lateral in the centre of each bed with in line emitters drippers of 1 6 l h 1 capacity at 0 3 m apart the source of irrigation was good quality ground water using tube well installed at about 30 m depth for precise water application a 15 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipeline was installed at 0 6 m depth with an outlet at the one corner of the experimental field the pipeline made of pvc was connected to a tube well with a water meter supplied by dasmesh mechanical works india and fitted at the outlet pipe of the water source to calculate the amount of irrigation water applied irrigations under surface drip and furrow irrigation system to maize and wheat were based on soil moisture potential smp of 35 kpa at 15 cm depth to monitor smp gauge type soil tensiometers irrometer riverside california were installed with the centres of the ceramic cups at 15 cm depth in each plot the furrow irrigated wheat and maize received 100 mm of irrigation water at 5 7 days prior to seeding then all the wheat treatments received a common irrigation 50 mm in flood irrigated and 10 12 mm in drip irrigation treatments at the crown root initiation stage 21 25 days after sowing das subsequent irrigations to both wheat and maize were applied to different treatment plots whenever smp decreased to 35 1 kpa in fi treatments irrigation water was delivered to each plot one at a time using pvc pipe to avoid conveyance losses irrigations to each treatment were controlled manually from a manifold that has a flow meter in drip irrigated treatments the irrigation water was allowed to completely wet the surface of bed which varied from 10 to 13 mm for each irrigation in both wheat and maize the flood irrigated treatments received about 500 mm of water for subsequent irrigations and the irrigation was stopped when water just reached the end of the furrow in each plot all the laterals from the experimental plots were removed before seeding of each crop to facilitate movement of tillage reformation of beds and seeding operations and were laid immediately thereafter 2 6 crop and fertilizer management 2 6 1 maize the maize hybrid pmh 1 was sown using double disc drilling machine fitted with inclined plate seed metering mechanism seed was treated with gaucho imidacloprid 600 fs 6 0 ml per kg seed before planting for protection against attack of shoot fly and with bavistin carbendazim at 3 g per kg seed for protection against various fungal diseases recommended doses of 26 kg p and 25 kg k ha 1 were drill applied at seeding as di ammonium phosphate dap single super phosphate in case of no n control and muriate of potash mop respectively under fertigation n was applied as urea after accounting n added through dap at seeding in seven equal splits starting at 20 days of sowing at 10 day interval a venturi injector was used for fertilizer application through the laterals in drip irrigation treatments and suction was created due to the difference between its upstream and downstream pressures it draws stock solution into water line at the desired injection rate herbicide atrataf 50 w p atrazine at 1 25 kg ha 1 was applied as pre emergence for controlling the wide leaf weeds one inter cultivation was done at knee high stage with the tractor operated re shaper which besides checking weed growth provided good aeration to plant roots tank mix solution of chloropyriphos 20 ec and endosulfan thiodone 0 03 were sprayed once in the standing crop to control stem borer and termite infestation respectively 2 6 2 wheat wheat variety hd 2967 was sown with a seed rate of 100 kg ha 1 in second week of november each year seed was treated with chloropyriphos 20ec 400 ml per100 kg seed mixed in 5 l of water to control termite attack recommended doses of 26 kg p and 25 kg k ha 1 were applied at sowing as in case of maize after drilling basal dose of n as dap remaining n was applied as urea in each experimental unit through fertigation in five equal splits starting at 25 days after sowing at 10 day interval tank mix solution of total sulfosulfuron metsulfuron at 16 g ha 1 was applied to control of phalaris minor weed at 25 30 days after sowing all other management operations were conducted according to standard practice pesticides and herbicides were applied as and when needed 2 7 crop residue management maize was harvested manually at cob height and lower part of standing stover about 50 was retained in the residue r plots in the no residue r treatments maize was harvested at the ground level and all of the stover was removed from the plots wheat was manually harvested leaving 18 20 cm long stubbles 20 25 of the total residue in r plots to simulate farmers practice while crop was harvested at the ground level in r plots removing the entire residue the load of maize stover and n added were similar 5 5 mg ha 1 and 34 1 kg n ha 1 in wheat 2013 14 because well fertilized maize crop was grown as cover crop in the previous season table 2 in 2014 15 amount of maize stover added in di r ranged from 3 7 mg ha 1 in no n control to 6 8 mg ha 1 in 120 kg n ha 1 the corresponding values for total n addition were 14 6 and 43 7 kg n ha 1 table 2 in maize mean averaged for two yrs amount of wheat stubbles retained in di r ranged from 1 4 mg ha 1 in no n control to 2 6 mg ha 1 in 120 kg n ha 1and the corresponding values for n addition were 5 4 and 14 5 kg ha 1 table 2 2 8 data collection 2 8 1 yield and yield attributes number of spikes in wheat was recorded in two 1 m long adjoining rows at two randomly selected spots within each plot at maturity and the data are recorded as spike density m 2 simultaneously 10 spikes were randomly selected within each plot for measuring average spike length in maize 10 plants were randomly selected from each plot to count total number of cobs and the average number of cobs per plant is recorded thousand kernel grain weights dry weight basis of maize and wheat were measured from a subsample collected from the bulk grain sample collected from each treatment at the time of harvest the central area 13 5 m2 of the plot four central5 m long beds from each subplot was manually harvested and threshed using plot threshers and grain and straw weights and moisture content were measured grain yields of maize and wheat are expressed at 14 5 and 12 moisture content respectively straw stover yields are expressed on dry weight basis 2 8 2 irrigation water productivity iwp the irrigation water productivity was calculated by the formula reddi and reddy 2006 iwp y iw where iwp irrigation water productivity kg m 3 y grain yield kg ha 1 iw total irrigation water applied cm to the crop 2 9 plant analysis for n the plant samples from 1 m long two rows of wheat and 0 9 m long two rows of maize were collected from two randomly selected spots within each plot at two growth stages of wheat maximum tillering and physiological maturity and two growth stages of maize knee high and physiological maturity wheat biomass samples at maturity were separated into grain and straw and maize biomass samples were separated into grain stover and cob cores all the samples were first partially dried under the sun and then in electric oven at 60 c for 48 h plant and cob cores samples were ground in wiley mill and passed through 32 mesh size sieve grain samples were ground in small grinding mill total n content in the grain and plant samples was estimated by modified micro kjeldhal s method westerman 1990 2 10 calculations the n uptake was calculated by multiplying the n content with the respective biomass yields the agronomic efficiency of applied n aen kg yield increase per kg n applied and crop recovery efficiency of applied n ren kg

for different parameters were analysed with the help of analysis of variance anova technique gomez and gomez 1984 for split plot design using sas 9 1 software sas institute cary nc there was homogeneity of error variance in the two years of study therefore statistical analysis of pooled data was performed treatment differences were compared at 5 level of significance 3 results irrigation method and n rates showed significant effects on all the parameters studied in both wheat and maize the interaction effects of irrigation method x rate of n application were generally non significant except on water productivity in wheat and water productivity and nue aen and ren in maize when interaction effects were non significant main effects of different treatments are reported in the tables and discussed in the following sections 3 1 yield and yield attributes of wheat drip irrigation with surface residue retention di r significantly p 0 05 increased spike density in wheat by 4 6 and 7 1 as compared to di r and fi r respectively table 3 spike density and spike length increased significantly with increasing n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1 application of 120 kg n ha 1 increased spike density and spike length by 47 8 and 4 compared to no n control respectively irrigation method and residue management showed no significant effect on spike length of wheat table 3 thousand grain weight tgw was significantly influenced by irrigation method and residue management and application of fertilizer n table 3 drip irrigation with residue di r and without residue mulch di r significantly increased tgw by about 2 compared to fi r table 3 tgw increased significantly by 2 5 and 4 1 at 90 and 120 kg n ha 1 compared to no n control respectively the data presented in table 4 show that grain yield increased significantly by 13 7 and 7 9 under di r and di r compared to the fi r 3 65 mg ha 1 respectively a similar trend was observed in straw yield of wheat residue mulch showed no significant effect on grain and straw yields of wheat under di system nitrogen application significantly influenced the grain and straw yields and significant response to n application was observed up to 90 kg n ha 1 irrespective of irrigation method and residue retention the grain yield obtained with the application of 90 kg ha 1 was 86 8 higher as compared to the no n application 2 51 mg ha 1 similarly application of 90 kg n ha 1 increased the straw yield by about 90 as compared to no n control 3 2 yield and yield attributes of maize irrigation method and residue management did not influence number of cobs per plant table 3 the mean number of cobs per plant increased significantly with n application up to 120 kg n ha 1 table 3 at 120 kg n ha 1 number of cobs per plant were 20 9 higher compared to no n control irrigation method and residue management as well as different levels of n showed significant influence on the cob length and kernel weight in maize table 3 cob length was higher by 5 6 under di r as compared to fi r treatment but it was on a par with di r significant increase in cob length was observed up to 90 kg ha 1 increasing cob length by 20 1 as compared to the no n application thousand kernel weight tkw was 6 8 higher under di r compared to the fi r but was on a par with di r the tkw increased with increased n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1 which increased tkw by 19 6 compared with no n control table 3 the pooled analysis of two years of data showed that mean grain and stover yields of maize were significantly affected by irrigation method residue management and n application table 4 grain yield was 23 1 and 11 9 higher under di r and di r compared to fi r treatment 4 63 mg ha 1 respectively the corresponding increase in stover yield was 19 8 and 10 8 unlike wheat residue mulch r under di system significantly increased both grain and stover yields of maize compared no mulch grain yield increased significantly up to 120 kg n ha 1 increasing grain yield by 97 2 over no n control unlike grain yield significant response in stover yield was observed up to 90 kg n ha 1 which increased the stover yield by 75 4 over no n control table 4 3 3 nitrogen uptake the total n uptake by wheat at maximum tillering and maturity grain straw was significantly higher under di r and di r compared to fi r while total n uptake at maturity under di r was significantly higher compared to di r table 5 total n uptake at both the growth stages increased significantly with increasing n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1and the increase at maximum tillering and maturity was 194 and 151 over no n control respectively nitrogen uptake by maize was significantly affected by irrigation method residue management and n application at both the growth stages i e knee high and maturity table 5 n uptake at knee high and maturity stages was 27 3 and 33 3 higher under di r compared to fi r treatment respectively total n uptake under di r compared to di r was significantly higher by 13 3 at maturity table 5 total n uptake of wheat at both the growth stages increased with increasing n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1 the increase in n uptake at 120 kg n ha 1was 134 and 147 compared to no n application at knee high and maturity stages respectively 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency irrigation method and residue management showed significant effect on aen and ren in maize only table 6 the ren in maize was significantly higher in di r as compared to the fi r treatment it increased from 66 2 in fi r to 85 4 in di r however ren under di system was not influenced by residue mulch in wheat aen was maximum 24 3 kg grain kg 1 n at 90 kg n ha 1 which decreased significantly at both 60 and 120 kg n ha 1 rates table 6 like wheat application of 90 kg n ha 1 gave about 11 higher ren as compared to both 60 kg and 120 kg n ha 1 the aen and ren in maize differed significantly among all the irrigation methods and residue management treatments at 60 kg n ha 1 the significant interaction effect between irrigation method and n rate in maize showed that aen and ren were significantly higher under di r compared to di r at n60 but the differences were non significant at n90 and n120 table 7 3 5 irrigation water use and water productivity wheat under di r required 12 mm and 88 mm lesser amount of irrigation water during its whole growing season compared with fi r respectively table 8 the irrigation water use in maize was 164 mm and 188 mm higher under fi r compared to di r and di r respectively table 8 irrigation water productivity iwp in both wheat and maize was significantly influenced by irrigation method residue management and n application in wheat iwp under di r and di r was significantly higher by 48 5 and 65 9 compared to the fi r 1 32 kg m 3 respectively surface residue r in di system significantly increased the iwp compared to no residue r application of 90 kg n ha 1 significantly increased the iwp by 86 3 compared to no n control and there was no further increase in iwp at 120 kg n ha 1 table 8 the iwp in maize under the di r 5 85 kg m 3 was significantly higher by 37 6 and 259 compared to the di r and fi r respectively like wheat iwp in maize increased significantly up to n90 4 62 kg m 3 which was 87 higher compared with no n control the significant interaction effects observed between irrigation method and n level suggested that wp in fi r system differed significantly in maize as well as wheat as compared to di r or di r at the same level of n application table 9 the iwp in wheat at n60 under fi r was similar to that at n0 under di r but was significantly lower than di r at n0 in maize iwp was significantly higher under di r at n60 compared to n120 under fi r and di r 4 discussion 4 1 grain yields and n use efficiency better supply of water and n resulted in 25 30 higher yields of wheat and maize under di both r or r system compared to fi r table 4 consistent with our results wang and zhou 2013 reported 39 higher maize yield with drip irrigation as compared to surface irrigation surface retention of crop residues in di r provided improved soil moisture and thermal regimes for better crop growth singh et al 2016 the increase in cob length in maize and spike density in wheat contributed towards higher grain yields under di r compared to di r system the higher grain yield under di as compared to fi might be ascribed to improved soil moisture and nutrient availability due to frequent and small application of water and nutrient n near the crop root zone many other researchers have also reported yield advantage from residue mulch compared to no mulch in maize and wheat under irrigated conditions parihar et al 2016 sepat and rana 2013 verhulst et al 2011 grahmann et al 2016 retention of crop residues as mulch is important in realizing full benefits from drip irrigation system wang and zhou 2013 reported 39 higher maize yield with drip irrigation as compared to surface irrigation with retention of crop residues under permanent beds on permanent beds wheat responded to the application of 90 kg n ha 1 irrespective of irrigation method compared to 120 kg n ha 1 reported under flat planting under the similar soil and climate conditions in the same region table 4 yadvinder singh and bijay singh 2001 lower n losses and thereby higher nue under pb probably resulted in response of wheat to lower n rate majeed et al 2015 limon ortega et al 2000 this effect was however not recorded in case of maize which may be attributed to the use of high yielding hybrid cultivar requiring higher n rate compared to the use of low yielding composite maize cultivar used in the previous studies the increase in grain yields and total n uptake resulted in significantly higher aen and ren under di system compared to fi system the fertigation is reported to minimize n losses through leaching and denitrification due to application of small n doses along with less irrigation amount in several splits yolcu and cetin 2015 in our study ren is markedly higher for both wheat and maize on pb compared to that reported values of 45 50 for conventionally sown maize and wheat crops ladha et al 2005 the calculated values of ren at 90 kg n ha 1 in wheat and 120 kg n ha 1 in maize are as high as 64 and 74 irrespective of irrigation system respectively table 6 the values of ren under di r were as high as 64 for wheat and 85 for maize the higher uptake of n under the di system was associated with greater biomass production and lower loss of applied fertilizer compared to flat planting system yadvinder singh et al 2015 suggested that both timing and method of n application are important to increase nue in zero till wheat with surface residue retention 4 2 irrigation water productivity iwp the higher iwp observed in drip irrigation as compared to the furrow irrigation was mainly due to reduction in losses of irrigation water through percolation and evaporation the increase in wp is the resultant of both increase in yield and saving in irrigation water earlier studies showed that drip irrigation can reduce irrigation water use for maize production by 25 55 lamm et al 1995 lamm and trooien 2003 consistent with the results from our study large irrigation water savings in drip irrigation system compared to flood irrigation in wheat were reported by chen et al 2015 the surface retention of crop residues in wheat and maize on pb reduced the water requirement by conserving soil moisture through reduction in evaporation loss singh et al 2011 gathala et al 2013 jat et al 2015 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study from south asia reporting the evaluation of surface drip irrigation system in the annual double cropping system the study showed that surface drip irrigation with residue retention is highly effective in terms of increasing yields and water productivity over the current furrow irrigation in maize wheat system on permanent beds due to reported low losses of n under pb system n use efficiency in maize and wheat was generally higher than that reported under conventional flat system grain yields of maize and wheat responded to 90 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg n ha 1 irrespective of method of irrigation this suggested the need for optimum scheduling of fertigation in relation to crop n uptake pattern to increase nue the recovery efficiency of applied n was markedly higher under surface drip fertigation compared to conventional furrow irrigation and removal of crop residues in permanent bed wheat maize system more such studies are needed under different soil types and climates so as to scale up the technology in suitable areas across south asia to ensure the efficient use of irrigation water and fertilizer and to attain higher economic gains from farming mottaleb and mohanty 2015 argued that overall the profitability from the farming activity in south asia has been declining drip irrigation fertilizer

11031,the traditional flood irrigation system has led to overexploitation of ground water and low nitrogen n use efficiency in north western india maize based systems with lower irrigation requirement are being advocated as an alternate to rice based systems to address the issues of declining water table bed planting of crops straw mulching and drip irrigation are known to save precious irrigation water and improve n use efficiency and grain yields to this effect a two year field experiment was conducted with annual wheat maize rotation on permanent bed system to evaluate the effect of surface drip irrigation residue management and n application on crop and water productivity maize and wheat under drip irrigation with residue retention system showed significant grain yield increase of 13 7 and 23 1 compared to furrow irrigation with no residue respectively surface drip irrigation with residue retention saved 88 mm and 168 mm of water and increased water productivity by 66 and 259 in wheat and maize on permanent beds compared to the conventional furrow irrigation system with residue removal respectively similarly fertigation at 10 day interval with five splits in wheat and seven splits in maize under drip irrigation system increased the mean n recovery efficiency by 16 5 and 29 compared to furrow irrigation in wheat and maize respectively keywords drip irrigation nitrogen use

wage rates has reduced the overall profitability from the farming activity in south asia mottaleb and mohanty 2015 in india about 70 of the water consumed in agriculture is used to cultivate transplanted rice barker et al 1999 high water input and low water productivity of conventional irrigated rw systems has led to the depletion of surface and ground waters in the igp of india which inspired to work on the development of new crop management technologies to counter the alarming situation yadvinder singh et al 2014 irrigated rice production requires about 2500 l of water to produce 1 kg of grains and it loses a larger amount of water through evapotranspiration and soil percolation due to its cultivation practice bouman 2009 kukal and aggarwal 2002 the consequences of intensive water resource mobilisation for intensive rw production system has led to extreme depletion of ground water resources in igp of south asia particularly in north west india humphreys et al 2010 perveen

most important cropping system of india yadav et al 2016 conventional flat planting is commonly used for growing mw system in south asia and the crops are irrigated by flood irrigation the flood irrigation system leads to inefficient use of both irrigation water and applied nitrogen n in contrast bed planting of maize and wheat not only saves water but improves n use efficiency nue and grain yield for example majeed et al 2015 showed that wheat planting on beds produced 15 1 higher grain yield than flat planting at the same n rate similarly bed planting increased the n uptake and recovery efficiency of n by 25 0 and 29 8 respectively the nue depends on method source and timing of fertilizer application and crop planting methods using drip irrigation method savings in water usage and increase in wheat yield and water productivity have been reported by wang et al 2013 and chen et al 2015 drip fertigation increased the use efficiency of applied nutrients compared to flood irrigation

total rainfall received during 2014 and 2015 seasons was 420 7 and 535 4 mm respectively 2 3 treatments and experimental design a raised bed planting system with 0 675 m wide beds were used and the crops were planted on top 0 375 m wide of the beds and irrigation applied in the furrows 0 30 m wide the experiment was started with wheat november april as the first crop in 2013 and succeeded by maize june to october the experiment was set up as a split plot design with three irrigation and residue management treatments to both wheat and maize table 1 as the main blocks and four n rates 0 60 90 and 120 kg ha 1 as subplot treatments to both the crops details of the treatments are included in table 1 each subplot size was 81 m2 4 05 m wide and 20 m long there were thus six beds for each treatment combination 2 4 formation of permanent raised beds and crop geometry before establishment of the cover crop of maize in may 2013 disc plough was used to break hard pan if any followed by the use of two runs of cultivator to prepare the field thereafter field was levelled using a laser assisted land levelling system in the last week of june 2013 fresh raised beds 20 cm high were made with a bed planter and well fertilized 120 kg n 26 kg p and 25 kg k ha 1 maize crop was planted on the top of beds in the first week of june and harvested in the third week of october 2013 the permanent beds pbs were prepared in the month of june before the planting of non experimental maize crop in 2013 season while two rows of wheat spaced at 20 cm were planted on top of each bed one row of maize was seeded in the centre of each bed at a plant to plant spacing of 20 cm seed rate of 100 kg and 20 kg ha 1 was used for wheat and maize respectively the pbs were not tilled but were reformed in the furrows without disturbing the top of the bed before planting of each crop traffic was confined to the furrows and narrow wheel tractor tyres were used for all operations 2 5 drip irrigation system and water management the surface drip system consisted of polyethylene laterals of 16 mm in diameter laid parallel to crop rows and each lateral served two rows of wheat and one row of maize lateral spacing was taken as 0 675 m one lateral in the centre of each bed with in line emitters drippers of 1 6 l h 1 capacity at 0 3 m apart the source of irrigation was good quality ground water using tube well installed at about 30 m depth for precise water application a 15 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipeline was installed at 0 6 m depth with an outlet at the one corner of the experimental field the pipeline made of pvc was connected to a tube well with a water meter supplied by dasmesh mechanical works india and fitted at the outlet pipe of the water source to calculate the amount of irrigation water applied irrigations under surface drip and furrow irrigation system to maize and wheat were based on soil moisture potential smp of 35 kpa at 15 cm depth to monitor smp gauge type soil tensiometers irrometer riverside california were installed with the centres of the ceramic cups at 15 cm depth in each plot the furrow irrigated wheat and maize received 100 mm of irrigation water at 5 7 days prior to seeding then all the wheat treatments received a common irrigation 50 mm in flood irrigated and 10 12 mm in drip irrigation treatments at the crown root initiation stage 21 25 days after sowing das subsequent irrigations to both wheat and maize were applied to different treatment plots whenever smp decreased to 35 1 kpa in fi treatments irrigation water was delivered to each plot one at a time using pvc pipe to avoid conveyance losses irrigations to each treatment were controlled manually from a manifold that has a flow meter in drip irrigated treatments the irrigation water was allowed to completely wet the surface of bed which varied from 10 to 13 mm for each irrigation in both wheat and maize the flood irrigated treatments received about 500 mm of water for subsequent irrigations and the irrigation was stopped when water just reached the end of the furrow in each plot all the laterals from the experimental plots were removed before seeding of each crop to facilitate movement of tillage reformation of beds and seeding operations and were laid immediately thereafter 2 6 crop and fertilizer management 2 6 1 maize the maize hybrid pmh 1 was sown using double disc drilling machine fitted with inclined plate seed metering mechanism seed was treated with gaucho imidacloprid 600 fs 6 0 ml per kg seed before planting for protection against attack of shoot fly and with bavistin carbendazim at 3 g per kg seed for protection against various fungal diseases recommended doses of 26 kg p and 25 kg k ha 1 were drill applied at seeding as di ammonium phosphate dap single super phosphate in case of no n control and muriate of potash mop respectively under fertigation n was applied as urea after accounting n added through dap at seeding in seven equal splits starting at 20 days of sowing at 10 day interval a venturi injector was used for fertilizer application through the laterals in drip irrigation treatments and suction was created due to the difference between its upstream and downstream pressures it draws stock solution into water line at the desired injection rate herbicide atrataf 50 w p atrazine at 1 25 kg ha 1 was applied as pre emergence for controlling the wide leaf weeds one inter cultivation was done at knee high stage with the tractor operated re shaper which besides checking weed growth provided good aeration to plant roots tank mix solution of chloropyriphos 20 ec and endosulfan thiodone 0 03 were sprayed once in the standing crop to control stem borer and termite infestation respectively 2 6 2 wheat wheat variety hd 2967 was sown with a seed rate of 100 kg ha 1 in second week of november each year seed was treated with chloropyriphos 20ec 400 ml per100 kg seed mixed in 5 l of water to control termite attack recommended doses of 26 kg p and 25 kg k ha 1 were applied at sowing as in case of maize after drilling basal dose of n as dap remaining n was applied as urea in each experimental unit through fertigation in five equal splits starting at 25 days after sowing at 10 day interval tank mix solution of total sulfosulfuron metsulfuron at 16 g ha 1 was applied to control of phalaris minor weed at 25 30 days after sowing all other management operations were conducted according to standard practice pesticides and herbicides were applied as and when needed 2 7 crop residue management maize was harvested manually at cob height and lower part of standing stover about 50 was retained in the residue r plots in the no residue r treatments maize was harvested at the ground level and all of the stover was removed from the plots wheat was manually harvested leaving 18 20 cm long stubbles 20 25 of the total residue in r plots to simulate farmers practice while crop was harvested at the ground level in r plots removing the entire residue the load of maize stover and n added were similar 5 5 mg ha 1 and 34 1 kg n ha 1 in wheat 2013 14 because well fertilized maize crop was grown as cover crop in the previous season table 2 in 2014 15 amount of maize stover added in di r ranged from 3 7 mg ha 1 in no n control to 6 8 mg ha 1 in 120 kg n ha 1 the corresponding values for total n addition were 14 6 and 43 7 kg n ha 1 table 2 in maize mean averaged for two yrs amount of wheat stubbles retained in di r ranged from 1 4 mg ha 1 in no n control to 2 6 mg ha 1 in 120 kg n ha 1and the corresponding values for n addition were 5 4 and 14 5 kg ha 1 table 2 2 8 data collection 2 8 1 yield and yield attributes number of spikes in wheat was recorded in two 1 m long adjoining rows at two randomly selected spots within each plot at maturity and the data are recorded as spike density m 2 simultaneously 10 spikes were randomly selected within each plot for measuring average spike length in maize 10 plants were randomly selected from each plot to count total number of cobs and the average number of cobs per plant is recorded thousand kernel grain weights dry weight basis of maize and wheat were measured from a subsample collected from the bulk grain sample collected from each treatment at the time of harvest the central area 13 5 m2 of the plot four central5 m long beds from each subplot was manually harvested and threshed using plot threshers and grain and straw weights and moisture content were measured grain yields of maize and wheat are expressed at 14 5 and 12 moisture content respectively straw stover yields are expressed on dry weight basis 2 8 2 irrigation water productivity iwp the irrigation water productivity was calculated by the formula reddi and reddy 2006 iwp y iw where iwp irrigation water productivity kg m 3 y grain yield kg ha 1 iw total irrigation water applied cm to the crop 2 9 plant analysis for n the plant samples from 1 m long two rows of wheat and 0 9 m long two rows of maize were collected from two randomly selected spots within each plot at two growth stages of wheat maximum tillering and physiological maturity and two growth stages of maize knee high and physiological maturity wheat biomass samples at maturity were separated into grain and straw and maize biomass samples were separated into grain stover and cob cores all the samples were first partially dried under the sun and then in electric oven at 60 c for 48 h plant and cob cores samples were ground in wiley mill and passed through 32 mesh size sieve grain samples were ground in small grinding mill total n content in the grain and plant samples was estimated by modified micro kjeldhal s method westerman 1990 2 10 calculations the n uptake was calculated by multiplying the n content with the respective biomass yields the agronomic efficiency of applied n aen kg yield increase per kg n applied and crop recovery efficiency of applied n ren kg

for different parameters were analysed with the help of analysis of variance anova technique gomez and gomez 1984 for split plot design using sas 9 1 software sas institute cary nc there was homogeneity of error variance in the two years of study therefore statistical analysis of pooled data was performed treatment differences were compared at 5 level of significance 3 results irrigation method and n rates showed significant effects on all the parameters studied in both wheat and maize the interaction effects of irrigation method x rate of n application were generally non significant except on water productivity in wheat and water productivity and nue aen and ren in maize when interaction effects were non significant main effects of different treatments are reported in the tables and discussed in the following sections 3 1 yield and yield attributes of wheat drip irrigation with surface residue retention di r significantly p 0 05 increased spike density in wheat by 4 6 and 7 1 as compared to di r and fi r respectively table 3 spike density and spike length increased significantly with increasing n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1 application of 120 kg n ha 1 increased spike density and spike length by 47 8 and 4 compared to no n control respectively irrigation method and residue management showed no significant effect on spike length of wheat table 3 thousand grain weight tgw was significantly influenced by irrigation method and residue management and application of fertilizer n table 3 drip irrigation with residue di r and without residue mulch di r significantly increased tgw by about 2 compared to fi r table 3 tgw increased significantly by 2 5 and 4 1 at 90 and 120 kg n ha 1 compared to no n control respectively the data presented in table 4 show that grain yield increased significantly by 13 7 and 7 9 under di r and di r compared to the fi r 3 65 mg ha 1 respectively a similar trend was observed in straw yield of wheat residue mulch showed no significant effect on grain and straw yields of wheat under di system nitrogen application significantly influenced the grain and straw yields and significant response to n application was observed up to 90 kg n ha 1 irrespective of irrigation method and residue retention the grain yield obtained with the application of 90 kg ha 1 was 86 8 higher as compared to the no n application 2 51 mg ha 1 similarly application of 90 kg n ha 1 increased the straw yield by about 90 as compared to no n control 3 2 yield and yield attributes of maize irrigation method and residue management did not influence number of cobs per plant table 3 the mean number of cobs per plant increased significantly with n application up to 120 kg n ha 1 table 3 at 120 kg n ha 1 number of cobs per plant were 20 9 higher compared to no n control irrigation method and residue management as well as different levels of n showed significant influence on the cob length and kernel weight in maize table 3 cob length was higher by 5 6 under di r as compared to fi r treatment but it was on a par with di r significant increase in cob length was observed up to 90 kg ha 1 increasing cob length by 20 1 as compared to the no n application thousand kernel weight tkw was 6 8 higher under di r compared to the fi r but was on a par with di r the tkw increased with increased n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1 which increased tkw by 19 6 compared with no n control table 3 the pooled analysis of two years of data showed that mean grain and stover yields of maize were significantly affected by irrigation method residue management and n application table 4 grain yield was 23 1 and 11 9 higher under di r and di r compared to fi r treatment 4 63 mg ha 1 respectively the corresponding increase in stover yield was 19 8 and 10 8 unlike wheat residue mulch r under di system significantly increased both grain and stover yields of maize compared no mulch grain yield increased significantly up to 120 kg n ha 1 increasing grain yield by 97 2 over no n control unlike grain yield significant response in stover yield was observed up to 90 kg n ha 1 which increased the stover yield by 75 4 over no n control table 4 3 3 nitrogen uptake the total n uptake by wheat at maximum tillering and maturity grain straw was significantly higher under di r and di r compared to fi r while total n uptake at maturity under di r was significantly higher compared to di r table 5 total n uptake at both the growth stages increased significantly with increasing n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1and the increase at maximum tillering and maturity was 194 and 151 over no n control respectively nitrogen uptake by maize was significantly affected by irrigation method residue management and n application at both the growth stages i e knee high and maturity table 5 n uptake at knee high and maturity stages was 27 3 and 33 3 higher under di r compared to fi r treatment respectively total n uptake under di r compared to di r was significantly higher by 13 3 at maturity table 5 total n uptake of wheat at both the growth stages increased with increasing n rate up to 120 kg n ha 1 the increase in n uptake at 120 kg n ha 1was 134 and 147 compared to no n application at knee high and maturity stages respectively 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency irrigation method and residue management showed significant effect on aen and ren in maize only table 6 the ren in maize was significantly higher in di r as compared to the fi r treatment it increased from 66 2 in fi r to 85 4 in di r however ren under di system was not influenced by residue mulch in wheat aen was maximum 24 3 kg grain kg 1 n at 90 kg n ha 1 which decreased significantly at both 60 and 120 kg n ha 1 rates table 6 like wheat application of 90 kg n ha 1 gave about 11 higher ren as compared to both 60 kg and 120 kg n ha 1 the aen and ren in maize differed significantly among all the irrigation methods and residue management treatments at 60 kg n ha 1 the significant interaction effect between irrigation method and n rate in maize showed that aen and ren were significantly higher under di r compared to di r at n60 but the differences were non significant at n90 and n120 table 7 3 5 irrigation water use and water productivity wheat under di r required 12 mm and 88 mm lesser amount of irrigation water during its whole growing season compared with fi r respectively table 8 the irrigation water use in maize was 164 mm and 188 mm higher under fi r compared to di r and di r respectively table 8 irrigation water productivity iwp in both wheat and maize was significantly influenced by irrigation method residue management and n application in wheat iwp under di r and di r was significantly higher by 48 5 and 65 9 compared to the fi r 1 32 kg m 3 respectively surface residue r in di system significantly increased the iwp compared to no residue r application of 90 kg n ha 1 significantly increased the iwp by 86 3 compared to no n control and there was no further increase in iwp at 120 kg n ha 1 table 8 the iwp in maize under the di r 5 85 kg m 3 was significantly higher by 37 6 and 259 compared to the di r and fi r respectively like wheat iwp in maize increased significantly up to n90 4 62 kg m 3 which was 87 higher compared with no n control the significant interaction effects observed between irrigation method and n level suggested that wp in fi r system differed significantly in maize as well as wheat as compared to di r or di r at the same level of n application table 9 the iwp in wheat at n60 under fi r was similar to that at n0 under di r but was significantly lower than di r at n0 in maize iwp was significantly higher under di r at n60 compared to n120 under fi r and di r 4 discussion 4 1 grain yields and n use efficiency better supply of water and n resulted in 25 30 higher yields of wheat and maize under di both r or r system compared to fi r table 4 consistent with our results wang and zhou 2013 reported 39 higher maize yield with drip irrigation as compared to surface irrigation surface retention of crop residues in di r provided improved soil moisture and thermal regimes for better crop growth singh et al 2016 the increase in cob length in maize and spike density in wheat contributed towards higher grain yields under di r compared to di r system the higher grain yield under di as compared to fi might be ascribed to improved soil moisture and nutrient availability due to frequent and small application of water and nutrient n near the crop root zone many other researchers have also reported yield advantage from residue mulch compared to no mulch in maize and wheat under irrigated conditions parihar et al 2016 sepat and rana 2013 verhulst et al 2011 grahmann et al 2016 retention of crop residues as mulch is important in realizing full benefits from drip irrigation system wang and zhou 2013 reported 39 higher maize yield with drip irrigation as compared to surface irrigation with retention of crop residues under permanent beds on permanent beds wheat responded to the application of 90 kg n ha 1 irrespective of irrigation method compared to 120 kg n ha 1 reported under flat planting under the similar soil and climate conditions in the same region table 4 yadvinder singh and bijay singh 2001 lower n losses and thereby higher nue under pb probably resulted in response of wheat to lower n rate majeed et al 2015 limon ortega et al 2000 this effect was however not recorded in case of maize which may be attributed to the use of high yielding hybrid cultivar requiring higher n rate compared to the use of low yielding composite maize cultivar used in the previous studies the increase in grain yields and total n uptake resulted in significantly higher aen and ren under di system compared to fi system the fertigation is reported to minimize n losses through leaching and denitrification due to application of small n doses along with less irrigation amount in several splits yolcu and cetin 2015 in our study ren is markedly higher for both wheat and maize on pb compared to that reported values of 45 50 for conventionally sown maize and wheat crops ladha et al 2005 the calculated values of ren at 90 kg n ha 1 in wheat and 120 kg n ha 1 in maize are as high as 64 and 74 irrespective of irrigation system respectively table 6 the values of ren under di r were as high as 64 for wheat and 85 for maize the higher uptake of n under the di system was associated with greater biomass production and lower loss of applied fertilizer compared to flat planting system yadvinder singh et al 2015 suggested that both timing and method of n application are important to increase nue in zero till wheat with surface residue retention 4 2 irrigation water productivity iwp the higher iwp observed in drip irrigation as compared to the furrow irrigation was mainly due to reduction in losses of irrigation water through percolation and evaporation the increase in wp is the resultant of both increase in yield and saving in irrigation water earlier studies showed that drip irrigation can reduce irrigation water use for maize production by 25 55 lamm et al 1995 lamm and trooien 2003 consistent with the results from our study large irrigation water savings in drip irrigation system compared to flood irrigation in wheat were reported by chen et al 2015 the surface retention of crop residues in wheat and maize on pb reduced the water requirement by conserving soil moisture through reduction in evaporation loss singh et al 2011 gathala et al 2013 jat et al 2015 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study from south asia reporting the evaluation of surface drip irrigation system in the annual double cropping system the study showed that surface drip irrigation with residue retention is highly effective in terms of increasing yields and water productivity over the current furrow irrigation in maize wheat system on permanent beds due to reported low losses of n under pb system n use efficiency in maize and wheat was generally higher than that reported under conventional flat system grain yields of maize and wheat responded to 90 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg n ha 1 irrespective of method of irrigation this suggested the need for optimum scheduling of fertigation in relation to crop n uptake pattern to increase nue the recovery efficiency of applied n was markedly higher under surface drip fertigation compared to conventional furrow irrigation and removal of crop residues in permanent bed wheat maize system more such studies are needed under different soil types and climates so as to scale up the technology in suitable areas across south asia to ensure the efficient use of irrigation water and fertilizer and to attain higher economic gains from farming mottaleb and mohanty 2015 argued that overall the profitability from the farming activity in south asia has been declining drip irrigation fertilizer

mississippi state covers approximately 14 25 4 104 ha of the mississippi total crop land usda nrcs 2015 fig 1 the planting area of soybean and corn at the site individually accounts for 11 and 35 of the mississippi s total arable crop land usda nass 2016 average annual precipitation in this region amounts to 1 307 mm and approximately 60 of annual total precipitation is concentrated in fallow season during october through april feng et al 2016 around 40 of annual total precipitation is amounted to summer crops growth period from may through september however most of the annual rain water was either lost by surface runoff or deep percolation in the farmland during winter and early spring anapalli et al 2018 feng et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 eroded soils are wide spread largely due to intensive rainstorms which are characterized by low ph high bulk density low organic matter contents high penetration resistance and little aggregate stability soil survey staff 1999 in addition the summer crop productivity at the site was frequently restrained by rainfall variability over the last several decades feng et al 2018 mallakpour and villarini 2015 panagopoulos et al 2014 decreasing water loss from runoff and subsurface drainage and enhancing soil water storage for the subsequent crop production is one of the main objectives of conservation management practices under climate variation conditions abazi et al 2013 basche et al 2016a dietzel et al 2016 wallace 2000 daniel 2015 cover crops ccs have been widely cultivated to bridge the winter period between two cropping seasons incorporating cover crops into summer crop rotations can affect the soil water relations throughout the year by 1 influencing infiltration and runoff of precipitation dabney 1998 kaspar et al

use patterns for the subsequent crops unger and vigil 1998 gabriel et al 2014 in a silt loam soil runoff was reduced by 50 in corn growing season incorporating rye secale cereals l cc in a wet year wendt and burwell 1985 and it was decreased by 44 in soybean growing season incorporating chickweed cc zhu et al 1989 blanco canqui et al 2015 summarizes that runoff was reduced by 62 in a silt loam soil under ccs compared with no ccs in a dry year kahimba et al 2008 has noted that planting berseem clover cc enhanced subsurface drainage by 14 allowed earlier planting in oats avena sativa l average annual subsurface drainage was reduced by 10 in field cultivated with rye cc compared to no rye cc in a 5 yr corn and soybean cropping system in central iowa qi et al 2011b however annual infiltration and runoff were not changed by a rye cc planting winter cc improves soil water storage for the subsequent crops if the winter cc is terminated before the supplemented soil water is lost as evapotranspiration joyce et al 2002 however some researches indicated that ccs did not enhance soil water availability for the following crops basche and delonge 2017 daigh et al 2014 few studies have demonstrated that the effect of ccs on soil water dynamics was mainly related to rainfall distribution and amount during crop development periods blanco canqui et al 2015 basche et al 2016b reasonable assessment of soil water mass balance components under cc based cropping systems will promote a better understanding of ccs effects on soil water availability for cash crops basche et al 2016b however it is generally difficult to measure hydrological variables such as runoff drainage and crop evapotranspiration in farmland mainly because these are substantially affected by uncertainties as soil type climate and rainfall availability additionally these field observations are time consuming and laborious a one dimensional processed based and field scale agricultural systems model rzwqm root zone water quality model was firstly released by usda agricultural research service in the early 1990s ahuja et al 2000 later the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat crop growth modules ceres maize wheat and cropgro soybean were incorporated into the previous rzwqm and became rzwmq2 current version 4 00 ma et al 2012 it was capable of simulating the effects of tillage crop residue irrigation fertilization and crop management on crop production and hydrological cycle e g ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2012 malone et al 2017 the simulator provides a promising approach to assess soil water dynamics and crop yield in a corn and soybean rotation with winter cereal rye ccs as reported by deb et al 2012 li et al 2008 and malone et al 2014 in central iowa u s long term simulations demonstrated that a rye cc incorporated into corn and soybean rotation increased annual crop evapotranspiration by 5 and reduced annual subsurface drainage by 11 but it did not change rainfall runoff and infiltration amount qi et al 2011b at the same site the rzwmq dasst simulation indicated that adding a rye cc on a cropping system reduces annual subsurface drainage by 22 51 on a fine loamy soil li et al 2008 singer et al 2011 analysis of crop wue is not only related to evapotranspiration but also requires the estimation of grain yield winter cereal cover crop such as rye or wheat tends to be more effective than legumes in improving crop production because both are frost resistant parkin et al 2006 corn grain yield were increased by 10 16 with rye cc compared to no rye cc kramberger et al 2009 reese et al 2014 however kessavalou and walters 1997 indicated that planting rye cc decreases corn yield by 20 few studies showed that planting rye cover crop did not affect corn yield in long term corn and soybean cropping system basche et al 2016b qi et al 2011b li et al 2008 tonitto et al 2006 soybean yield is not often affected by rye cc because soybean is a legume fixing atmospheric nitrogen de bruin et al 2005 other studies showed that soybean yield decreased by 15 65 with rye cc gabriel et al 2012 singer and kohler 2005 the specific aims of this study were to 1 determine and quantify whether planting cc reduce surface runoff and deep percolation in a corn soybean rotation using rzwqm2 2 investigate whether planting cc improve soil water storage for subsequent cash crops in the continuous multiple years cropping system and 3 determine the change in yield and wue under a cc based cropping system in a humid northeastern

https www wunderground com history airport ktup 35 km east of the site a 1 8 m soil profile was divided into seven horizons the physical properties for each layer including soil volumetric water content at 1 3 and 15 bars particle size distribution and bulk density were measured at the beginning of the experiment table 2 saturated conductivity k sat was estimated based on bulk density field capacity water content at 1 3 bar and particle size distribution ahuja et al 2000 these parameters were used in the modeling and k sat and soil volumetric water content 1 3 bar were calibrated for good agreement between observed and simulated hydrological variables prior to model running the default soil moisture at field capacity for each layer was used but calibrated later so as to ensure model predicted soil moisture to match the observed soil moisture better by the simulation values well the albedos of dry soil and wet soil were used as 0 11 and 0 21 in this study post et al 2000

soybean residual properties such as age of surface residue 60 d and c n ratio 30 1 were measured and used as model input parameters measured soil no3 n and nh4 n at 0 3 m depth were used in the model simulation table 2 because no3 n and nh4 n was not available in layers deeper than 0 3 m the concentration from 0 3 to 1 2 m was obtained from field measurements in the southern mississippi and the

implemented dssat crop growth modules to obtain a good fit between the simulated and observed yield biomass and lai the physiological parameters of the crops were calibrated in the rzwmq2 table 3 for the corn crop the soil root growth factors srgfs from upper layer to sublayer within assigned layers in turn were adjusted to 1 0 1 0 0 3 0 07 0 07 0 03 0 01 0 01 and 0 01 to fit the crop growth and the moisture measurements respectively qi et al 2011b the default srgfs for soybean and wheat were used in the simulation 2 4 model performance and testing to evaluate the model performance in comparison to measured soil moisture crop above ground biomass yield and evapotranspiration under plots with or without cover crop we adopt relative root mean squared error rrmse modeling efficiency ef nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent error pe these statistical criteria are defined as follows rrmse 100 o i 1 n p i o i 2 n ef 1 0 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 pe 100 p i o i o i where n is the number of observations p i and o i are the simulated and observed values and ō is the mean of all observations the ef value is ranging from to1 where ef 1 indicates a perfect match between observed and simulated values and ef 0 indicates that the average of measured values is a better predictor than the simulation moriasi et al 2007 for the yield total plant aboveground biomass and lai the model was considered as satisfactory if pe is within 15 hanson 1999 model simulations exhibit the performance as satisfactory if rrmse is 30 liu et al 2011 these statistical criteria were frequently used to assess simulation performance of hydrological variables and crop growth in a cc based cropping system li et al 2008 malone et al 2014 qi et al 2011b 2 5 long term rzwqm2 simulations the calibrated and validated model was used to predict the long term effects of a winter wheat on hydrological variables and crop wue defined as grain yield per unit of evapotranspiration in a rainfed and no tilled corn soybean rotation in mississippi blackland prairie the historical weather data during 1938 2017 at the site was input to the rzwmq2 two scenarios with wheat cover crop and without wheat cover crop were used for simulations to make field operations were close to local field management practices as shown in table 1 corn and soybean were planted on 15 april and 15 may respectively and were harvested on 10 september and 8 october cover crop wheat was planted on 10 october and terminated on 9 april the seeding rates for corn soybean and wheat were the same as the field experiment the application date for synthetic n 190 kg n ha 1 was assumed on 10 may in even numbered corn years to assess the effectiveness of wheat cover crop on annual runoff and drainage under different rainfall patterns annual total rainfall in a seasonal year was classified to dry normal and wet years using frequency analysis method as described by feng et al 2018 wang et al 2009 and zhang et al 2016 a seasonal year was defined as a period from planting cover crop to 1 d before planting cover crop next year as a result there were 20 wet years 39 normal years and 21 dry years 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather data collected during the experiment and simulation periods during the experimental periods annual total precipitation over 4 seasonal years from 2014 to 2017 ranged from 1 131 mm to 1 635 mm and averaged 1335 mm fig 2 the precipitation for cash crop growth periods in 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 was 614 703 318 and 498 mm which accounted for corresponding annual total precipitation of 50 6 43 0 23 3 and 44 0 mean 41 approximately 47 of total precipitation 630 mm was allotted to cover crop growth periods across 4 seasonal years mean monthly total rainfall across 4 seasonal years ranged from 26 mm to 162 mm the largest monthly rainfall was june 243 mm in 2014 october 250 mm in 2015 december 222 mm in 2016 and december 175 mm in 2017 correspondingly the lowest monthly rainfall was august 15 mm september 5 mm september 6 mm and october 2 mm annual average air temperature was 17 5 c over the experiment and had a maximum value of 18 6 c in 2016 and a minimum value of 16 4 c in 2014 annual total precipitation averaged 1 373 mm in the past 8 decades of seasonal years 1938 2017 fig 3 in wet years 0 rainfall probability 25 annual precipitation ranged from 1 562 to 2 053 mm and from 1 120 to 1 545 mm in normal years 25 rainfall probability 75 and from 821 to 1181 mm in dry years 75 rainfall probability 100 average annual precipitation across wet years was 34 9 446 mm higher than that across normal years and 69 0 701 mm higher than across all dry years for wet years during winter wheat cc growth periods the largest precipitation was 1 240 mm and the lowest was 767 mm and with a mean value of 943 mm which was responsible for 54 7 of annual total precipitation correspondingly the mean value of annual total precipitation during cc growth period in normal or dry years 749 mm and 557 mm accounted for 58 7 and 56 4 of average annual total precipitation average total precipitation during wheat cc growth period took up 55 of average annual total precipitation for wet years annual precipitation during summer cash crops growth period was within a range of 374 862 mm and 267 697 mm in normal years and 101 578 mm in dry years annual total precipitation during cash crops growth periods had a mean value of 487 mm which was 36 annual total precipitation approximately 9 of annual total rainfall was in a period from harvesting cash crop to planting cover crop 3 2 model calibration and validation plant physiological parameters and soil related physical and chemical properties were calibrated as described above in the material and methods according to calibration order of plant phenology soil moisture soil mineral nitrogen and crop biomass and yield in the rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 here we focused on the simulated outputs and measured values in the cc calibration of model or ncc validation of model in 4 yr field experiment 3 2 1 crop growth and yield the model simulated well in predicting lai for corn and soybean in the calibration and validation plots in 2016 and 2017 fig 4 for the calibration plots in 2017 the model slightly overestimated crop lai for soybean because intensive rainfall 519 mm occurred during the crop growth season in may through september fig 2 leaf senescence in the late growth phase of corn after cc in 2016 seems to be too responsive to the combination of higher temperatures and lower precipitation during july to september leading to a too steep decline of lai across two years the rrmse ef and pe values for measured and simulated lai in the calibration plots were 25 0 7 and 15 respectively table 5 in the validation plots the model also slightly overestimated the lai in 2016 and simulated lai well in 2017 in general the rrmse ef and pe values for ncc plots were 15 0 8 and 15 respectively as shown in fig 5 grain yield for corn and soybean was simulated as satisfactory in cropping system in the calibration plots the largest measured and simulated biomass and yield for corn under cc system were in 2014 respectively and the lowest were in 2016 while 380 mm of rainfall was recorded during june and july in 2014 only 190 mm of rainfall at the same period was reported in 2016 fig 2 the model underestimated corn yield by 12 5 in 2014 and overestimated the soybean yield by 11 6 in 2017 the simulated corn yield in 2016 and the simulated soybean yield in 2015 were within the range of observed corn and soybean yields standard deviation corn yield was underestimated by 7 2 and the soybean yield was overestimated by 8 5 when across two years li et al 2008 also reported overestimated soybean yield by rzwqm dssat qi et al 2011b found that the corn yield was overestimated in the 4 yr of corn and soybean system in general the ef rrmse values for yield were higher than 0 8 and less than 15 across four years in the cc system table 5 in the validation plots the simulated yield was within range of measured values standard deviation with a rrmse of less than 15 and an ef of more than 0 8 simulated aboveground biomass was in satisfactory agreement with the measured data except for soybean in 2017 in the validation plots fig 5 the pe values for corn and soybean were 11 8 and 22 1 respectively the rrmse values were nearly 15 and less than 10 the largest measured and simulated wheat cover crop biomass was in 2014 and the lowest was in 2015 in the calibration plots the model showed a good match between predicted and measured cc wheat biomass over the 4 years 1 624 kg ha 1 versus 1 527 kg ha 1 wheat biomass was simulated with a pe of 6 an ef of more than 0 8 and an rrmse of less than 10 in short the calibrated and validated rzwm2 model was considered to be acceptable in modeling crop growth and yield in the corn and soybean rotation system with and without cc in the site 3 2 2 soil water content as shown in fig 6 the change in simulating soil water content swc at 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers were generally similar compared with measured value for the calibration and validation plots in the calibration plots the values of rrmse and pe were individually 16 and 10 between simulated and observed swc from 0 to 30 cm depth the modeling performance for simulated swc was worse than that for simulated yield biomass and lai and showed a negative ef for 0 30 cm since the model slightly underpredicted the inter annual variability of swc in the validation plots predicted swc at 0 15 cm was 16 less than observations and simulated swc at 15 30 cm was 7 less than measured simulated swc from 0 to 30 cm under validation plots were in good agreement with measured values with a rrmse 15 and ef 0 5 underestimation of swc at the end of the 2016 season could be the reason for the steep decline of simulated corn lai in 2016 fig 4 deeper soil layers are contributing to the water availability for crops having a strong impact on crop growth kirkegaard et al 2007 estimated a beneficial effect of available subsoil water on wheat yield even under moderate water stress at an efficiency of 59 kg ha 1 grain yield per mm subsoil water uptake and came to the conclusion that relatively small amounts of subsoil water can be highly valuable to grain yield therefore the underestimation of swc in the upper layers and overprediction of leaf senescence in the late corn growth phase might indicate that rzwqm does not correctly distribute soil water uptake by crop roots over depth which might be related to the root distribution function over depth wu and kersebaum 2008 3 2 3 soil water balance components because there was no available data regarding soil water balance components for cc and ncc plots we simulated et deep percolation and runoff during cash crop growth periods in table 5 and compared them with previous study results in the ncc plots the et ranged from 452 mm to 566 mm mean 529 mm and runoff ranged from 14 to 71 mm mean 34 mm during cash crop growth periods the largest and lowest runoff for ncc system were 71 mm in soybean growth period in 2015 a normal year and 14 mm in corn growth period in 2016 a dry year and averaged 34 mm across 4 yr for the long term weather data collected from mississippi blackland prairie feng et al 2018 found that simulated runoff using stella software during the corn growth periods ranging from 0 to 55 mm in 31 yr dry years and it was ranged from 0 to 120 mm for soybean growth periods in 60 normal years simulated et ranged from 448 to 549 mm mean 511 mm for the cc plots these simulated et values were within a range reported by zhang et al 2016 and tang et al 2017 in the central mississippi compared to ncc system simulated evaporation in 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 summer growing seasons under cc system was decreased by 25 10 14 and 23 mean 18 respectively qi et al 2011b found that rzwqm dasst simulated actual evaporation was reduced by on average 21 42 mm in april to june when cc was incorporated into corn and soybean system simulated deep percolation was within 54 205 mm for the ncc plots mean values of percolation were accounted 21 of rainfall in the ncc plots which was accord with 18 25 reported by liu et al 2011 and zhang et al 2016 therefore the rzwqm2 simulated et and deep percolation during cash crop growth periods were comparable to the range demonstrated by previous study results the model was considered to estimate soil hydrological balance in the mississipp blackland prairie 3 3 long term impacts on rainfall percolation and runoff as shown in table 6 planting cc in the corn and soybean rotation system relative to ncc scenario reduced annual percolation by on average 6 36 mm as simulated by rzwqm2 during 1938 2017 simulated value was 7 mm higher than that reported by qi et al 2011b and 16 mm than that reported by tribouillois et al 2018 these differences in simulated percolation between the study and others were mainly related to cc aboveground growth and its effect on et in this study the simulated and measured cover crop biomass lowered to previous studies fig 5 qi et al 2011b there was a better positive linear regression between cover crop aboveground biomass and annual et and a negative linear regression between cover crop biomass and annual percolation in the cropping system tribouillois et al 2018 therefore the increase of annual et was an attributor to the reduction of annual percolation while annual runoff was not changed based on soil water budget under cc system simulated runoff under cc system was not different from that under ncc system which is line in simulated results reported by qi et al 2011b in central iowa and by gu 2018 in north china plain in the rzwqm2 model there were same model input parameters related to soil and crop modules except cc wheat s physiological parameters in the ncc and cc scenarios and the model did not consider the effects of cover crop growth on soil surface sealing surface roughness and macropore flow capacity ahuja et al 2000 malone et al 2003 so simulated rainfall runoff did not change under cc system when comparing ncc system table 4 the model is needed to be improved for further reasonable estimation of surface runoff from rainfall or irrigation in the cc based cropping system in the future to compare these differences in percolation and runoff under different rainfall patterns we further conducted the impact of wet normal and dry years fig 7 across 21 wet years simulated annual deep percolation ranging from 225 to 1165 mm for the ncc system and ranged from 191 to 1151 mm for the cc system average annual deep percolation under cc scenario was 4 34 mm less than under no cc scenario in wet years 771 mm versus 805 mm in normal years annual deep percolation in the plots with a wheat cc was decreased by 6 32 mm when compared to the plots with no wheat cc 532 mm versus 564 mm the simulated deep percolation in the cc scenarios in dry years was reduced by 12 43 mm compared to no cc scenarios 317 mm versus 361 mm over the continuous 3 yr lysimeter experiment on silty loam soil in the beltsville agricultural research center meisinger and ricigliano 2017 the percolation for the plots with wheat cover crop was reduced by 103 mm 220 mm versus 333 mm in a dry year and 82 mm 726 mm versus 808 mm in a wet year and 76 mm 491 mm versus 567 mm in a normal year the rainfall density and duration was probably responsible for the difference between simulated results and field measurements annual runoff in the plots with wheat cc was same as values in the plots without wheat cc in a wet normal or dry year for both systems the largest and lowest annual runoffs were 268 5 and 28 4 mm and annual and daily runoffs were 165 mm and 0 45 mm within 20 wet years fig 7 annual runoff ranged from 0 to 105 mm and had a mean value of 37 8 mm in 19 dry years and it ranged from 0 to 187 mm and had a mean value of 88 0 mm in 40 normal years approximately 9 of the total annual rainfall 124 mm was lost to runoff in the whole model period in rzwmq2 simulation study for fine silty loam runoff was responsible for around 10 loss of annual total precipitation thorp et al 2008 qi et al 2011b because the runoff is equal to the difference between rainfall and infiltration in the rzwqm2 gu 2018 malone et al 2003 thus the annual infiltration amount was also not changed by a wheat cc 3 4 long term impacts on soil water storage across long term series of historical weather data simulated soil water storage during cash crop growth period under cc treatment for the 0 1 8 m depth was lower compared to ncc treatment when cc terminated fig 8 the possible reason for this was related to rainfall distribution two months before termination for the field measurements planting cover crop reduced soil water storage for the 0 0 3 m depth under dry season in april through may 35 mm and increased soil water storage under intensive rainfall in april through may 230 335 mm basche et al 2016b after cover crop termination the soil water storage under cc scenario was generally higher than under ncc scenario for the main crops growth period especially within two months after cc terminated there was significantly higher soil water storage and plant available water with rye cc over a 7 yr cropping system while maintaining high crop yields basche et al 2016b in general the soil water storage under the cc system was higher than under ncc from cc termination to cash crops harvesting compared to plots without cc larger reductions in surface evaporation for the plots with wheat cc were responsible for an increase in soil water storage fig 8 because there was less rain during crop reproductive growth period in august through september in the northeastern mississippi vories and evett 2014 storing more soil moisture at the early stage of crop growth could alleviate rainfall deficit stress feng et al 2016 and improve plant nitrogen uptake sharma et al 2011 long term simulation showed that annual crop n uptake increased by 54 kg ha 1 in the site data not shown and by 42 60 kg ha 1 by a cover crop in the corn and soybean rotation li et al 2008 qi et al 2011b 3 5 long term impacts on crop et yield and wue as shown in table 6 average annual actual transpiration increased by 138 mm and average annual actual evaporation was reduced by 102 mm by a wheat cc in 1938 2017 the increase in annual et under cc system was thus 36 mm 5 higher than under ncc system for the cash crop growth period planting cc decreased actual evaporation by 24 6 during corn growth period and by 24 1 during soybean growth period compared to corresponding actual evaporation simulated in plots under ncc fig 9 the terminated cc residue with glyphosate application could reduce evaporation from soil and residue by 21 in april through june in a lysimeter study qi and helmers 2010 and according to a computer simulation study in central iowa qi et al 2011a for the plots with ncc simulated et in the corn growth period was within 233 648 mm and averaged 497 mm during the 80 years simulation period this simulation result was within a range of 457 660 mm reported by mississippi state university cooperative extension service 2018 however predicted et in the corn growth season ranged from 223 to 606 mm for the cc treatment the lowest et simulated using rzwqm2 was in 2012 because of 100 mm of rainfall during the corn growth period under rainfed conditions the corn et for ncc scenarios was 6 6 31 mm higher than corn et for cc scenarios planting cc lead to soybean et decrease of 3 7 19 mm when compared to soybean et simulated under ncc treatment however it is concluded that planting cc increased transpiration by 15 on average during main crops growth periods larger aboveground biomass in plots with cc was illustrated by the model results because there was minor difference in grain yield between two scenarios for wet normal or dry years we summarized averaged yield for long term climatic weather conditions corn and soybean grain yields in the cc plots did not significantly improve respectively when compared to ncc plots 6 700 kg ha 1 versus 6 668 kg ha 1 3 172 kg ha 1 versus 3 131 kg ha 1 under rainfall patterns including dry and wet years recent studies demonstrated that main crop yields were not significantly different between treatments with or without rye cc in continuous 4 7 yr field measurements basche et al 2016b li et al 2008 possible reason for this might be that there was no difference in nitrogen application rate between cc and ncc treatments although a minor reduction in et while maintaining higher crop yield were reported for the cc system the grain wue for corn and soybean were thus improved by 6 4 and 5 0 respectively the grain wue for cash crop was improved in the cereal cc system than in the ncc system as summarized by blanco canqui et al 2015 sanders et al 2018 therefore introducing winter wheat cc in a cropping system is a promising approach to increase crop productivity by restraining soil surface evaporation and maintaining higher crop yields in the humid northeast mississippi although the study site is located in the humid and warm mississippi environment the frequency of drought events during the summer season is expected to increase based on 60 years of historical weather data in the southeastern u s li et al 2012 the changes in dry events during summer growing season in the region are predicted to increase feng et al 2018 iqbal et al 2018 in eastern mississippi 61 of 90 years were moderate dry 32 were severe drought and 11 were extreme drought vories and evett 2014 especially in august and september monthly rainfall deficit amount ranged from 22 to 62 mm between may and october feng et al 2016 resulting in frequent limitations of cash crop growth and yield by periods of soil water deficit during crop reproductive growth stages zhang et al 2016 wue could be a critical index for effective use of rainfall in the rainfed cropping system at the site besides pumping water from this shallow aquifer more than its natural recharge level has led to significant aquifer depletion threatening water availability opportunities for irrigation in this region in the future anapalli et al 2018 using cc could store more rainwater for cash crop growth period and then reduce irrigation amount while maintaining higher grain yield this field management could alleviate the risk for the environment as reduction of irrigation by crops recent studies demonstrated that replacement of fallow season with cc in the cropping system is a practical strategy for favorable crop yield wue and better environment in humid environment with hot summer under climate variation dietzel et al 2016 because three different rainfall patterns were considered for the whole simulation the modeling results are more representative to provide a reasonable assessment of cc effects on crop yield crop water consumption and wue the study also provides a promising reference method to assess the benefits of cc in terms of rainfall water budgets and crop water productivity in cropping system for similar temperate regions under long term climate variation 4 conclusions on the base of a 4 yr comprehensive field data set in the northeast mississippi the rzwqm2 model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated with the calibrated and validated model the long term change in soil water balance components crop yield and grain wue were reasonably assessed in a no tilled and rainfed corn soybean rotation including wheat cc annual surface runoff was not affected by cc when comparing simulated values with the ncc plots across the wet normal and dry years the simulated annual deep percolation under cc system was 36 mm 6 less than under ncc system simulated annual actual evapotranspiration under cc system was 36 mm 5 higher than under ncc system over the whole long term simulation wheat crop residue cover increased main crop transpiration for corn and soybean by 15 on average and led to surface evaporation reduction of 24 on average thus improving soil water storage for promoting crop production long term simulation demonstrated that wue for corn and soybean was improved by 6 on average largely attributed to a reduction of surface evaporation while maintaining higher yields long term use of winter wheat cc if managed similarly can reduce deep percolation and increase soil water storage as well as improve precipitation use efficiency without sacrificing cash crop growth in maize and soybean crop rotations in subtropical agro systems acknowledgements the research was funded by

11032,incorporating cover crops into row crop production systems can affect soil water dynamics and crop production however the effect of this practice has not been well investigated in the northeast mississippi usa we calibrated and validated the cropping system model root zone water quality model rzwqm2 using 4 yr 2014 2017 field data in the humid mississippi blackland prairie and also used this

evapotranspiration in a rainfed and no tilled corn zea mays l and soybean glycine max l cropping system compared to no cover crop scenarios long term simulation demonstrates that average annual percolation under the cover crop system was decreased by 36 mm average annual actual evapotranspiration were 36 mm higher under cover crop system than no cover crop system simulated annual runoff for cover crop scenario was not different from values simulated for no cover crop scenario predicted actual evaporation during cash crop growth periods under cover crop plots was 25 less than under no cover crop plots due to mulch cover when averaged over the whole modeling period compared with no cover crop scenarios the estimated crop evapotranspiration under cover crop scenario was reduced by 6 6 31 mm during corn growth period and by 3 7 19 mm during soybean growth period yearly predicted crop yields for corn and soybean did not improve respectively in the cover crop based cropping system compared to the plots with no cover crop the simulation of wue for corn and soybean were respectively improved by 6 4 1 49 kg m 3 versus 1 40 kg m 3 and by 5 0 0 63 kg m 3 versus 0 60 kg m 3 for the plots with cover crop largely due to the decrease in surface evaporation without sacrificing crop growth these results suggest that long term use of wheat cover crop to summer crops rotation is a promising practice to decrease deep percolation and restrict surface evaporation and also improved crops wue in the corn and soybean rotation in subtropical agro system abbreviations c cover crop ncc

cultivation approach in the southeastern u s where these two crops are often not restricted by soil and water resources usda nass 2014 mississippi blackland prairie located in the northeast mississippi state covers approximately 14 25 4 104 ha of the mississippi total crop land usda nrcs 2015 fig 1 the planting area of soybean and corn at the site individually accounts for 11 and 35 of the mississippi s total arable crop land usda nass 2016 average annual precipitation in this region amounts to 1 307 mm and approximately 60 of annual total precipitation is concentrated in fallow season during october through april feng et al 2016 around 40 of annual total precipitation is amounted to summer crops growth period from may through september however most of the annual rain water was either lost by surface runoff or deep percolation in the farmland during winter and early spring anapalli et al 2018 feng et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 eroded soils are wide spread largely due to intensive rainstorms which are characterized by low ph high bulk density low organic matter contents high penetration resistance and little aggregate stability soil survey staff 1999 in addition the summer crop productivity at the site was frequently restrained by rainfall variability over the last several decades feng et al 2018 mallakpour and villarini 2015 panagopoulos et al 2014 decreasing water loss from runoff and subsurface drainage and enhancing soil water storage for the subsequent crop production is one of the main objectives of conservation management practices under climate variation conditions abazi et al 2013 basche et al 2016a dietzel et al 2016 wallace 2000 daniel 2015 cover crops ccs have been widely cultivated to bridge the winter period between two cropping

wendt and burwell 1985 and it was decreased by 44 in soybean growing season incorporating chickweed cc zhu et al 1989 blanco canqui et al 2015 summarizes that runoff was reduced by 62 in a silt loam soil under ccs compared with no ccs in a dry year kahimba et al 2008 has noted that planting berseem clover cc enhanced subsurface drainage by 14 allowed earlier planting in oats avena sativa l average annual subsurface drainage was reduced by 10 in field cultivated with rye cc compared to no rye cc in a 5 yr corn and soybean cropping system in central iowa qi et al 2011b however annual infiltration and runoff were not changed by a rye cc planting winter cc improves soil water storage for the subsequent crops if the winter cc is terminated before the supplemented soil water is lost as evapotranspiration joyce et al 2002 however some researches indicated that ccs did not enhance soil water availability for the following crops basche and delonge 2017 daigh et al 2014 few studies have demonstrated that the effect of ccs on soil water dynamics was mainly related to rainfall distribution and amount during crop development periods blanco canqui et al 2015 basche et al 2016b reasonable assessment of soil water mass balance components under cc based cropping systems will promote a better understanding of ccs effects on soil water availability for cash crops basche et al 2016b however it is generally difficult to measure hydrological variables such as runoff drainage and crop evapotranspiration in farmland mainly because these are substantially affected by uncertainties as soil type climate and rainfall availability additionally these field observations are time consuming and laborious a one dimensional processed based and field scale agricultural systems model rzwqm root zone water quality model was firstly released by usda agricultural research service in the early 1990s ahuja et al 2000 later the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat crop growth modules ceres maize wheat and cropgro soybean were incorporated into the previous rzwqm and became rzwmq2 current version 4 00 ma et al 2012 it was capable of simulating the effects of tillage crop residue irrigation fertilization and crop management on crop production and hydrological cycle e g ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2012 malone et al 2017 the simulator provides a promising approach to assess soil water dynamics and crop yield in a corn and soybean rotation with winter cereal rye ccs as reported by deb et al 2012 li et al 2008 and malone et al 2014 in central iowa u s long term simulations demonstrated that a rye cc incorporated into corn and soybean rotation increased annual crop evapotranspiration by 5 and reduced annual subsurface drainage by 11 but it did not change rainfall runoff and infiltration amount qi et al 2011b at the same site the rzwmq dasst simulation indicated that adding a rye cc on a cropping system reduces annual subsurface drainage by 22 51 on a fine loamy soil li et al 2008 singer et al 2011 analysis of crop wue is not only related to evapotranspiration but also requires the estimation of grain yield winter cereal cover crop such as rye or wheat tends to be more effective than legumes in improving crop production because both are frost resistant parkin et al 2006 corn grain yield were increased by 10 16 with rye cc compared to no rye cc kramberger et al 2009 reese et al 2014 however kessavalou and walters 1997 indicated that planting rye cc decreases corn yield by 20 few studies showed that planting rye cover crop did not affect corn yield in long term corn and soybean cropping system basche et al 2016b qi et al 2011b li et al 2008 tonitto et al 2006 soybean yield is not often affected by rye cc because soybean is a legume fixing atmospheric nitrogen de bruin et al 2005 other studies showed that soybean yield decreased by 15 65 with rye cc gabriel et al 2012 singer and kohler 2005 the specific aims of this study were to 1 determine and quantify whether planting cc reduce surface runoff and deep percolation in a corn soybean rotation using rzwqm2 2 investigate whether planting cc improve soil water storage for subsequent cash crops in the continuous multiple years cropping system and 3 determine the change in yield and wue under a cc based cropping system in a humid northeastern

validated model was used to predict the long term effects of a winter wheat on hydrological variables and crop wue defined as grain yield per unit of evapotranspiration in a rainfed and no tilled corn soybean rotation in mississippi blackland prairie the historical weather data during 1938 2017 at the site was input to the rzwmq2 two scenarios with wheat cover crop and without wheat cover crop were used for simulations to make field operations were close to local field management practices as shown in table 1 corn and soybean were planted on 15 april and 15 may respectively and were harvested on 10 september and 8 october cover crop wheat was planted on 10 october and terminated on 9 april the seeding rates for corn soybean and wheat were the same as the field experiment the application date for synthetic n 190 kg n ha 1 was assumed on 10 may in even numbered corn years to assess the effectiveness of wheat cover crop on annual runoff and drainage under different rainfall patterns annual total rainfall in a seasonal year was classified to dry normal and wet years using frequency analysis method as described by feng et al 2018 wang et al 2009 and zhang et al 2016 a seasonal year was defined as a period from planting cover crop to 1 d before planting cover crop next year as a result there were 20 wet years 39 normal years and 21 dry years 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather data collected during the experiment and simulation periods during the experimental periods annual total precipitation over 4 seasonal years from 2014 to 2017 ranged from 1 131 mm to 1 635 mm and averaged 1335 mm fig 2 the precipitation for cash crop growth periods in 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 was 614 703 318 and 498 mm which accounted for corresponding annual total precipitation of 50 6 43 0 23 3 and 44 0 mean 41 approximately 47 of total precipitation 630 mm was allotted to cover crop growth periods across 4 seasonal years mean monthly total rainfall across 4 seasonal years ranged from 26 mm to 162 mm the largest monthly rainfall was june 243 mm in 2014 october 250 mm in 2015 december 222 mm in 2016 and december 175 mm in 2017 correspondingly the lowest monthly rainfall was august 15 mm september 5 mm september 6 mm and october 2 mm annual average air temperature was 17 5 c over the experiment and had a maximum value of 18 6 c in 2016 and a minimum value of 16 4 c in 2014 annual total precipitation averaged 1 373 mm in the past 8 decades of seasonal years 1938 2017 fig 3 in wet years 0 rainfall probability 25 annual precipitation ranged from 1 562 to 2 053 mm and from 1 120 to 1 545 mm in normal years 25 rainfall probability 75 and from 821 to 1181 mm in dry years 75 rainfall probability 100 average annual precipitation across wet years was 34 9 446 mm higher than that across normal years and 69 0 701 mm higher than across all dry years for wet years during winter wheat cc growth periods the largest precipitation was 1 240 mm and the lowest was 767 mm and with a mean value of 943 mm which was responsible for 54 7 of annual total precipitation correspondingly the mean value of annual total precipitation during cc growth period in normal or dry years 749 mm and 557 mm accounted for 58 7 and 56 4 of average annual total precipitation average total precipitation during wheat cc growth period took up 55 of average annual total precipitation for wet years annual precipitation during summer cash crops growth period was within a range of 374 862 mm and 267 697 mm in normal years and 101 578 mm in dry years annual total precipitation during cash crops growth periods had a mean value of 487 mm which was 36 annual total precipitation approximately 9 of annual total rainfall was in a period from harvesting cash crop to planting cover crop 3 2 model calibration and validation plant physiological parameters and soil related physical and chemical properties were calibrated as described above in the material and methods according to calibration order of plant phenology soil moisture soil mineral nitrogen and crop biomass and yield in the rzwqm2 ma et al 2012 here we focused on the simulated outputs and measured values in the cc calibration of model or ncc validation of model in 4 yr field experiment 3 2 1 crop growth and yield the model simulated well in predicting lai for corn and soybean in the calibration and validation plots in 2016 and 2017 fig 4 for the calibration plots in 2017 the model slightly overestimated crop lai for soybean because intensive rainfall 519 mm occurred during the crop growth season in may through september fig 2 leaf senescence in the late growth phase of corn after cc in 2016 seems to be too responsive to the combination of higher temperatures and lower precipitation during july to september leading to a too steep decline of lai across two years the rrmse ef and pe values for measured and simulated lai in the calibration plots were 25 0 7 and 15 respectively table 5 in the validation plots the model also slightly overestimated the lai in 2016 and simulated lai well in 2017 in general the rrmse ef and pe values for ncc plots were 15 0 8 and 15 respectively as shown in fig 5 grain yield for corn and soybean was simulated as satisfactory in cropping system in the calibration plots the largest measured and simulated biomass and yield for corn under cc system were in 2014 respectively and the lowest were in 2016 while 380 mm of rainfall was recorded during june and july in 2014 only 190 mm of rainfall at the same period was reported in 2016 fig 2 the model underestimated corn yield by 12 5 in 2014 and overestimated the soybean yield by 11 6 in 2017 the simulated corn yield in 2016 and the simulated soybean yield in 2015 were within the range of observed corn and soybean yields standard deviation corn yield was underestimated by 7 2 and the soybean yield was overestimated by 8 5 when across two years li et al 2008 also reported overestimated soybean yield by rzwqm dssat qi et al 2011b found that the corn yield was overestimated in the 4 yr of corn and soybean system in general the ef rrmse values for yield were higher than 0 8 and less than 15 across four years in the cc system table 5 in the validation plots the simulated yield was within range of measured values standard deviation with a rrmse of less than 15 and an ef of more than 0 8 simulated aboveground biomass was in satisfactory agreement with the measured data except for soybean in 2017 in the validation plots fig 5 the pe values for corn and soybean were 11 8 and 22 1 respectively the rrmse values were nearly 15 and less than 10 the largest measured and simulated wheat cover crop biomass was in 2014 and the lowest was in 2015 in the calibration plots the model showed a good match between predicted and measured cc wheat biomass over the 4 years 1 624 kg ha 1 versus 1 527 kg ha 1 wheat biomass was simulated with a pe of 6 an ef of more than 0 8 and an rrmse of less than 10 in short the calibrated and validated rzwm2 model was considered to be acceptable in modeling crop growth and yield in the corn and soybean rotation system with and without cc in the site 3 2 2 soil water content as shown in fig 6 the change in simulating soil water content swc at 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers were generally similar compared with measured value for the calibration and validation plots in the calibration plots the values of rrmse and pe were individually 16 and 10 between simulated and observed swc from 0 to 30 cm depth the modeling performance for simulated swc was worse than that for simulated yield biomass and lai and showed a negative ef for 0 30 cm since the model slightly underpredicted the inter annual variability of swc in the validation plots predicted swc at 0 15 cm was 16 less than observations and simulated swc at 15 30 cm was 7 less than measured simulated swc from 0 to 30 cm under validation plots were in good agreement with measured values with a rrmse 15 and ef 0 5 underestimation of swc at the end of the 2016 season could be the reason for the steep decline of simulated corn lai in 2016 fig 4 deeper soil layers are contributing to the water availability for crops having a strong impact on crop growth kirkegaard et al 2007 estimated a beneficial effect of available subsoil water on wheat yield even under moderate water stress at an efficiency of 59 kg ha 1 grain yield per mm subsoil water uptake and came to the conclusion that relatively small amounts of subsoil water can be highly valuable to grain yield therefore the underestimation of swc in the upper layers and overprediction of leaf senescence in the late corn growth phase might indicate that rzwqm does not correctly distribute soil water uptake by crop roots over depth which might be related to the root distribution function over depth wu and kersebaum 2008 3 2 3 soil water balance components because there was no available data regarding soil water balance components for cc and ncc plots we simulated et deep percolation and runoff during cash crop growth periods in table 5 and compared them with previous study results in the ncc plots the et ranged from 452 mm to 566 mm mean 529 mm and runoff ranged from 14 to 71 mm mean 34 mm during cash crop growth periods the largest and lowest runoff for ncc system were 71 mm in soybean growth period in 2015 a normal year and 14 mm in corn growth period in 2016 a dry year and averaged 34 mm across 4 yr for the long term weather data collected from mississippi blackland prairie feng et al 2018 found that simulated runoff using stella software during the corn growth periods ranging from 0 to 55 mm in 31 yr dry years and it was ranged from 0 to 120 mm for soybean growth periods in 60 normal years simulated et ranged from 448 to 549 mm mean 511 mm for the cc plots these simulated et values were within a range reported by zhang et al 2016 and tang et al 2017 in the central mississippi compared to ncc system simulated evaporation in 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 summer growing seasons under cc system was decreased by 25 10 14 and 23 mean 18 respectively qi et al 2011b found that rzwqm dasst simulated actual evaporation was reduced by on average 21 42 mm in april to june when cc was incorporated into corn and soybean system simulated deep percolation was within 54 205 mm for the ncc plots mean values of percolation were accounted 21 of rainfall in the ncc plots which was accord with 18 25 reported by liu et al 2011 and zhang et al 2016 therefore the rzwqm2 simulated et and deep percolation during cash crop growth periods were comparable to the range demonstrated by previous study results the model was considered to estimate soil hydrological balance in the mississipp blackland prairie 3 3 long term impacts on rainfall percolation and runoff as shown in table 6 planting cc in the corn and soybean rotation system relative to ncc scenario reduced annual percolation by on average 6 36 mm as simulated by rzwqm2 during 1938 2017 simulated value was 7 mm higher than that reported by qi et al 2011b and 16 mm than that reported by tribouillois et al 2018 these differences in simulated percolation between the study and others were mainly related to cc aboveground growth and its effect on et in this study the simulated and measured cover crop biomass lowered to previous studies fig 5 qi et al 2011b there was a better positive linear regression between cover crop aboveground biomass and annual et and a negative linear regression between cover crop biomass and annual percolation in the cropping system tribouillois et al 2018 therefore the increase of annual et was an attributor to the reduction of annual percolation while annual runoff was not changed based on soil water budget under cc system simulated runoff under cc system was not different from that under ncc system which is line in simulated results reported by qi et al 2011b in central iowa and by gu 2018 in north china plain in the rzwqm2 model there were same model input parameters related to soil and crop modules except cc wheat s physiological parameters in the ncc and cc scenarios and the model did not consider the effects of cover crop growth on soil surface sealing surface roughness and macropore flow capacity ahuja et al 2000 malone et al 2003 so simulated rainfall runoff did not change under cc system when comparing ncc system table 4 the model is needed to be improved for further reasonable estimation of surface runoff from rainfall or irrigation in the cc based cropping system in the future to compare these differences in percolation and runoff under different rainfall patterns we further conducted the impact of wet normal and dry years fig 7 across 21 wet years simulated annual deep percolation ranging from 225 to 1165 mm for the ncc system and ranged from 191 to 1151 mm for the cc system average annual deep percolation under cc scenario was 4 34 mm less than under no cc scenario in wet years 771 mm versus 805 mm in normal years annual deep percolation in the plots with a wheat cc was decreased by 6 32 mm when compared to the plots with no wheat cc 532 mm versus 564 mm the simulated deep percolation in the cc scenarios in dry years was reduced by 12 43 mm compared to no cc scenarios 317 mm versus 361 mm over the continuous 3 yr lysimeter experiment on silty loam soil in the beltsville agricultural research center meisinger and ricigliano 2017 the percolation for the plots with wheat cover crop was reduced by 103 mm 220 mm versus 333 mm in a dry year and 82 mm 726 mm versus 808 mm in a wet year and 76 mm 491 mm versus 567 mm in a normal year the rainfall density and duration was probably responsible for the difference between simulated results and field measurements annual runoff in the plots with wheat cc was same as values in the plots without wheat cc in a wet normal or dry year for both systems the largest and lowest annual runoffs were 268 5 and 28 4 mm and annual and daily runoffs were 165 mm and 0 45 mm within 20 wet years fig 7 annual runoff ranged from 0 to 105 mm and had a mean value of 37 8 mm in 19 dry years and it ranged from 0 to 187 mm and had a mean value of 88 0 mm in 40 normal years approximately 9 of the total annual rainfall 124 mm was lost to runoff in the whole model period in rzwmq2 simulation study for fine silty loam runoff was responsible for around 10 loss of annual total precipitation thorp et al 2008 qi et al 2011b because the runoff is equal to the difference between rainfall and infiltration in the rzwqm2 gu 2018 malone et al 2003 thus the annual infiltration amount was also not changed by a wheat cc 3 4 long term impacts on soil water storage across long term series of historical weather data simulated soil water storage during cash crop growth period under cc treatment for the 0 1 8 m depth was lower compared to ncc treatment when cc terminated fig 8 the possible reason for this was related to rainfall distribution two months before termination for the field measurements planting cover crop reduced soil water storage for the 0 0 3 m depth under dry season in april through may 35 mm and increased soil water storage under intensive rainfall in april through may 230 335 mm basche et al 2016b after cover crop termination the soil water storage under cc scenario was generally higher than under ncc scenario for the main crops growth period especially within two months after cc terminated there was significantly higher soil water storage and plant available water with rye cc over a 7 yr cropping system while maintaining high crop yields basche et al 2016b in general the soil water storage under the cc system was higher than under ncc from cc termination to cash crops harvesting compared to plots without cc larger reductions in surface evaporation for the plots with wheat cc were responsible for an increase in soil water storage fig 8 because there was less rain during crop reproductive growth period in august through september in the northeastern mississippi vories and evett 2014 storing more soil moisture at the early stage of crop growth could alleviate rainfall deficit stress feng et al 2016 and improve plant nitrogen uptake sharma et al 2011 long term simulation showed that annual crop n uptake increased by 54 kg ha 1 in the site data not shown and by 42 60 kg ha 1 by a cover crop in the corn and soybean rotation li et al 2008 qi et al 2011b 3 5 long term impacts on crop et yield and wue as shown in table 6 average annual actual transpiration increased by 138 mm and average annual actual evaporation was reduced by 102 mm by a wheat cc in 1938 2017 the increase in annual et under cc system was thus 36 mm 5 higher than under ncc system for the cash crop growth period planting cc decreased actual evaporation by 24 6 during corn growth period and by 24 1 during soybean growth period compared to corresponding actual evaporation simulated in plots under ncc fig 9 the terminated cc residue with glyphosate application could reduce evaporation from soil and residue by 21 in april through june in a lysimeter study qi and helmers 2010 and according to a computer simulation study in central iowa qi et al 2011a for the plots with ncc simulated et in the corn growth period was within 233 648 mm and averaged 497 mm during the 80 years simulation period this simulation result was within a range of 457 660 mm reported by mississippi state university cooperative extension service 2018 however predicted et in the corn growth season ranged from 223 to 606 mm for the cc treatment the lowest et simulated using rzwqm2 was in 2012 because of 100 mm of rainfall during the corn growth period under rainfed conditions the corn et for ncc scenarios was 6 6 31 mm higher than corn et for cc scenarios planting cc lead to soybean et decrease of 3 7 19 mm when compared to soybean et simulated under ncc treatment however it is concluded that planting cc increased transpiration by 15 on average during main crops growth periods larger aboveground biomass in plots with cc was illustrated by the model results because there was minor difference in grain yield between two scenarios for wet normal or dry years we summarized averaged yield for long term climatic weather conditions corn and soybean grain yields in the cc plots did not significantly improve respectively when compared to ncc plots 6 700 kg ha 1 versus 6 668 kg ha 1 3 172 kg ha 1 versus 3 131 kg ha 1 under rainfall patterns including dry and wet years recent studies demonstrated that main crop yields were not significantly different between treatments with or without rye cc in continuous 4 7 yr field measurements basche et al 2016b li et al 2008 possible reason for this might be that there was no difference in nitrogen application rate between cc and ncc treatments although a minor reduction in et while maintaining higher crop yield were reported for the cc system the grain wue for corn and soybean were thus improved by 6 4 and 5 0 respectively the grain wue for cash crop was improved in the cereal cc system than in the ncc system as summarized by blanco canqui et al 2015 sanders et al 2018 therefore introducing winter wheat cc in a cropping system is a promising approach to increase crop productivity by restraining soil surface evaporation and maintaining higher crop yields in the humid northeast mississippi although the study site is located in the humid and warm mississippi environment the frequency of drought events during the summer season is expected to increase based on 60 years of historical weather data in the southeastern u s li et al 2012 the changes in dry events during summer growing season in the region are predicted to increase feng et al 2018 iqbal et al 2018 in eastern mississippi 61 of 90 years were moderate dry 32 were severe drought and 11 were extreme drought vories and evett 2014 especially in august and september monthly rainfall deficit amount ranged from 22 to 62 mm between may and october feng et al 2016 resulting in frequent limitations of cash crop growth and yield by periods of soil water deficit during crop reproductive growth stages zhang et al 2016 wue could be a critical index for effective use of rainfall in the rainfed cropping system at the site besides pumping water from this shallow aquifer more than its natural recharge level has led to significant aquifer depletion threatening water availability opportunities for irrigation in this region in the future anapalli et al 2018 using cc could store more rainwater for cash crop growth period and then reduce irrigation amount while maintaining higher grain yield this field management could alleviate the risk for the environment as reduction of irrigation by crops recent studies demonstrated that replacement of fallow season with cc in the cropping system is a practical strategy for favorable crop yield wue and better environment in humid environment with hot summer under climate variation dietzel et al 2016 because three different rainfall patterns were considered for the whole simulation the modeling results are more representative to provide a reasonable assessment of cc effects on crop yield crop water consumption and wue the study also provides a promising reference method to assess the benefits of cc in terms of rainfall water budgets and crop water productivity in cropping system for similar temperate regions under long term climate variation 4 conclusions on the base of a 4 yr comprehensive field data set in the northeast mississippi the rzwqm2 model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated with the calibrated and validated model the long term change in soil water balance components crop yield and grain wue were reasonably assessed in a no tilled and rainfed corn soybean rotation including wheat cc annual surface runoff was not affected by cc when comparing simulated values with the ncc plots across the wet normal and dry years the simulated annual deep percolation under cc system was 36 mm 6 less than under ncc system simulated annual actual evapotranspiration under cc system was 36 mm 5 higher than under ncc system over the whole long term simulation wheat crop residue cover increased main crop transpiration for corn and soybean by 15 on average and led to surface evaporation reduction of 24 on average thus improving soil water storage for promoting crop production long term simulation demonstrated that wue for corn and soybean was improved by 6 on average largely attributed to a reduction of surface evaporation while maintaining higher yields long term use of winter wheat cc if managed similarly can reduce deep percolation and increase soil water storage as well as improve precipitation use efficiency without sacrificing cash crop growth in maize and soybean crop rotations in subtropical agro systems acknowledgements the research was funded by

11033,early detection of plant water status is essential to optimize crop water use and to implement water savings methods such as precision irrigation this study investigated the potential of using crop reflectance indices to detect water stress in order to improve irrigation of bell pepper capsicum annuum l grown under greenhouse conditions spectral data were acquired from bell pepper plants with five different irrigation regimes namely 100 80 60 40 and 20 of plant available water in a completely randomized design plant stress parameters including stomatal conductance gs canopy temperature tc relative water content rwc yield and volumetric soil moisture content smc were concurrently measured with spectral data acquisition from the plants throughout the growing season various reflectance indices including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi photochemical reflectance index centered at 570 nm pri570 photochemical reflectance index centered at 553 nm pri553 normalized pri prinorm water index wi and wi ndvi were obtained from the spectral data the relationships between these crop reflectance indices and the water stress indicators were statistically examined at the five irrigation levels the results revealed that pri553 wi rdvi prinorm and wi ndvi were the most useful indices for detecting water stress in bell pepper plants the findings of this study show promise of using a proximal method for assessing water stress and to improve water management of high value vegetable crops grown under greenhouse conditions keywords crop water stress irrigation scheduling bell pepper plants spectral reflectance indices water management 1 introduction conventional methods of scheduling irrigation such as soil moisture monitoring are laborious time consuming and require large number of soil moisture sensors to account for spatial heterogeneity of soil properties ihuoma and madramootoo 2016 an alternative method of irrigation scheduling is to directly monitor the plant water status through the physiological responses of plants to water stress water stressed plants absorb more radiant energy than is required for their photosynthetic activities thereby exceeding their photosynthetic demand the plants dissipate this excess energy as chlorophyll fluorescence and heat to avoid damage to the photosynthetic pigment rossini et al 2013 also plants undergoing water stress close their stomata to conserve water which closes the pathway for the exchange of oxygen water and carbon dioxide as a result water stress causes a drop in photosynthetic activities which reduces growth and development of crops dangwal et al 2015 stomatal closure also results in decreases in the transpiration rate and evaporative cooling thereby increasing the leaf temperature this concept was used by idso et al 1981 to develop the crop water stress index cwsi for tracking water stress in crops with the aid of infrared thermometers recently researchers have utilized high resolution airborne thermal sensors to detect differences in canopy temperature for monitoring water stress in plants berni et al 2009a 2009b gonzalez dugo et al 2013 osroosh et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2012 as leaf temperature is a direct indicator of plant transpiration however leaf temperature does not account for changes in photosynthetic pigments in water stressed crops zarco tejada et al 2013 and is limited in estimating plant water status due to variations in environmental temperature and humidity chung et al 2018 within the past few years studies have investigated alternative narrow band hyperspectral indices for detecting crop water stress panigada et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 this approach relies on the absorption and scattering of light which controls the spectral features of plant leaves to provide reliable quantitative and timely information on crop stress in a cost effective manner previous studies have investigated several spectral vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi photochemical reflectance index pri570 normalized pri prinorm water index wi wi ndvi and normalized water index nwi for monitoring water stress in crops a comprehensive review of reflectance indices for assessing plant water status and scheduling irrigation has been outlined in ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 however most of the studies focused on various species of tree and cereal crops dangwal et al 2015 magney et al 2016 panigada et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 and their findings cannot be adopted for estimating water status in vegetable crops due to differences in their physiological characteristics while crop reflectance measurements have been widely investigated for crops grown under open field conditions the same cannot be said for high value vegetable crops grown under greenhouse conditions meanwhile reflectance indices for open field production may not be suitable for the greenhouse since plant water stress is influenced by a combination of environmental conditions microclimate root conditions and plant genetic traits katsoulas et al 2016 therefore there is need to investigate crop reflectance indices that can be applied for early assessment of plant water stress to improve the productivity and yields of high value vegetable crops grown under greenhouses most vegetable crops such as bell pepper have high water demand and are susceptible to water stress kirnak et al 2003 showed that water stress adversely affects the physiological and nutritional development of bell pepper to achieve optimal bell pepper production supplemental irrigation is required to ensure adequate water supply during their growth cycle olanike and madramootoo 2014 yildirim et al 2012 zotarelli et al 2011 however climate change drought and rising water demands from non agricultural sectors are limiting the availability of fresh water resources for irrigation therefore precise irrigation scheduling is essential to optimize irrigation water use improve crop yield and avoid excessive irrigation that may result in yield or water loss afzal et al 2017 or leaching of agricultural nutrients that would degrade soil and water implementation of this strategy requires information on plant water status ali 2011 the objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of spectral vegetation indices for detecting water stress for optimizing irrigation water management in greenhouse grown bell pepper plants specifically the objectives were to i evaluate and compare various spectral vis for monitoring water stress in bell pepper plants ii test different pri formulations for detecting water stress in bell pepper plants by changing the normalization bands from 530 nm to 570 nm iii determine the relationship between vis and water stress of bell pepper 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and irrigation treatments this research was conducted in the greenhouse at macdonald campus of mcgill university ste anne de bellevue quebec canada the study area lies between latitude 45 26 17 n and longitude 73 56 17 w with an elevation of 36 m the greenhouse with a dimension of 8 m x 7 m x 5 m was covered with single pane tempered glass that allows 95 of light transmission the greenhouse roof was inclined at an angle of 37 to the horizontal bell pepper cultivar red knight seedlings were transplanted on august 26 2016 into 25 pots 18 l each and one plant per pot using soil from the horticultural research centre of mcgill university each pot had a depth of 32 cm and diameter of 27 cm the soil was a sand clay loam with sand silt and clay content of 48 22 and 30 respectively usda nrcs 2000 field capacity of 33 and permanent wilting point of 17 by volume the pots were placed on 330 150 150 mm bricks which were randomly positioned in the greenhouse at a spacing of 0 6 m by 0 6 m a water tap was affixed to the bottom of the pots so that excess water could be drained and measured with a volumetric flask the pots were saturated and allowed to drain out for 24 h so that the soil water content was at field capacity before the plants were transplanted the experiment was arranged in a completely randomised design with the five 5 water treatment levels of 100 80 60 40 and 20 of plant available water as treatments irrigation applications were based on the soil s plant available water awc defined as the difference between the field capacity and permanent wilting point of the soil and soil moisture content smc in each pot was continuously measured with soil moisture sensors the water treatment levels for each treatment 100 80 60 40 and 20 awc were used as the upper irrigation threshold while the lower irrigation threshold was set at 10 depletion of awc for each treatment irrigation was initiated when the smc in the pots depleted to its requisite moisture treatment threshold value and was terminated when the upper trigger 100 80 60 40 and 20 awc moisture content was attained the volume of water applied to each pot during irrigation was determined as the product of the irrigation duration and the flow rate per pot while the equivalent irrigation depth applied at each irrigation event for each pot was determined as the product of the volumetric water content and the plant rooting depth high quality irrigation water was applied through a drip system with emitters placed in each pot the drip system consisted of pressure compensating emitters with a discharge of 2 l h 1 and the flow rates were calibrated in the greenhouse irrigation was uniformly applied to all treatments at the beginning of transplanting based on 100 replenishment of water in the plant root zone to field capacity for plants to be well established thereafter the various irrigation treatments were implemented until harvest replenishment of soil water at the five water application levels was done using continuous time domain reflectometers tdr cs625 water content reflectometer campbell scientific inc ut usa installed vertically at a depth of 30 cm in the middle of each pot to correspond with the plant rooting depth jaria and madramootoo 2013 tdr readings were calibrated with gravimetric soil moisture measurements and the sensors were installed with the aid of an insertion guide following the procedures articulated in the sentek manual sentek sensor technologies 2003 the soil moisture sensors were connected to data loggers model cr205 6 campbell scientific inc ut usa the data was scanned every 5 min and recorded every 15 min hourly and daily data were retrieved from the cr205 6 using a laptop computer and loggernet software from campbell scientific inc fertilizer applications were based on guidelines for greenhouse production provided by the technicians in the horticulture research centre the plants were fertilized biweekly with 20 20 20 n p k water soluble fertilizer at a rate of 4 kg of n hectare this was changed to calcium nitrate after the first fruits were noticed and later changed to potassium nitrate when the fruits were approaching maturity 2 2 measurements daily air temperature relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit were measured using a campbell scientific psychrometer campbell scientific logan ut usa installed in the greenhouse evapotranspiration et in the greenhouse was estimated during the growing

with handheld infrared thermometry set at an emissivity of 0 95 w m ² evett et al 2000 fluke 572 model fluke corporation everett wa the instrument was held 30 cm above the plant canopy and directed at the leaf of the bell pepper plant with a laser point of the instrument set at an angle of 90 to the horizontal orta et al 2002 four infrared thermometer measurements were made when the plant canopy covered about 80 of the pot area the temperature of the stressed and non stressed plants was determined from canopy temperature data four north south east and west viewing directions were considered and average temperatures obtained measurements were made between 11 00 and 15 00 h to ensure maximum solar intensity when the sun was shining directly on the plants as adopted by aladenola and madramootoo 2014 stomatal conductance was measured during the growing period using a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor ltd lincoln ne three 3 healthy fully sunlit leaves were selected and stomatal conductance was measured on the leaves using the li 6400 and the averages calculated leaf relative water content rwc was measured at each stage of plant growth by selecting the youngest fully expanded leaves from one representative crop in each treatment the leaf samples were enclosed in a sealed plastic bag and kept in a cooler at 5 c until they reached the laboratory fresh weight fw was recorded using an analytical balance and the samples were immersed in distilled water for 72 h blotted and weighed to obtain the turgid weight tw finally leaf samples were dried at 72 c in an oven until constant dry weight dw was achieved the rwc was calculated according to eq 2 as adopted in previous studies on crop water stress colombo et al 2008 wang et al 2015 bell pepper plants were harvested about 4 four times after maturity and the total and marketable yield were measured and recorded 2 r w c f w d w t w d w 100 2 2 2 spectral data acquisition and processing a miniature fibre optic spectrometer stellar net inc usa which measures reflectance in the 200 1150 nm spectral range was used to measure canopy reflectance the spectrum is characterized by a 0 5 nm spectral resolution and was calibrated before each reading was taken the calibration process involved holding the probe at 45 to a white standard reference at a distance of about 60 mm to optimize the integration time typically set at 50 ms recording dark current and then obtaining target reflectance all canopy spectral measurements were taken under clear sky conditions between 11 00 and 15 00 h to ensure maximum solar intensity when the sun was shining directly on the plants as conducted in similar studies zhao et al 2017 the spectrometer was positioned at a height of 30 cm from the plant canopy so that it viewed only the plant canopy five leaves were measured in every pot and four scans were averaged in every measurement considering four north south east and west viewing directions the measurements were carried out five times 16 and 21 september 10 18 and 25 october 2016 during the flowering and maturity stages of the crops when the crops are more susceptible to water stress due to the absorption of atmospheric water signal background and light scattering effects the spectral reflectance contains substantial interference noise zhao et al 2017 which must be eliminated as it affects the smoothness of the spectral curve the most commonly used smoothing algorithms include the moving average method fitting polynomial method wavelet transform and various regression smoothing methods based on the recommendations of previous research zhao et al 2017 the 7 point weighted moving average method was used to smooth the spectral curve in this research this algorithm enhances the smoothness of the spectral curve while keeping all the spectral details intact to ensure the extraction of suitable wavelengths the spectral indices used in this study were obtained from the optical reflectance measurements from each treatment and are presented in table 1 the reflectance indices were divided into three 3 the xanthophyll pigment indices related to photosynthetic pigment changes the structural greenness indices related to the canopy structure and biomass and the water indices related to the water content of the plant canopy 2 3 statistical analysis the pearson correlation ratio was used to describe the effects of irrigation levels on the stress indicators tc rwc gs given that the correlation ratio η2 is defined as 3 η 2 σ 2 σ y 2 w h e r e σ 2 x n x x 2 x n x a n d σ y 2 x i n x y x i 2 n where each observation is yxi x indicates the five irrigation levels and i indicates an observation nx is the number of observations in category x ȳx is the mean of the category x and ȳ is the mean of the whole population the correlation ratio assumes values in the interval 0 1 and indicatȳes how the data variance is explained by the factor irrigation a correlation ratio close to 1 implies that all the data variance is explained by the factor irrigation one way analysis of variance anova was conducted on the vegetation indices and field data using proc glm general linear

probability level the relationship between the vegetation indices ndvi osavi rdvi pri570 pri553 prinorm wi wi ndvi and stress indicators tc rwc gs total marketable yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and soil moisture content were evaluated by ordinary least square ols regression analysis 3 results 3 1 crop evapotranspiration and soil water content daily mean temperature relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit in the greenhouse ranged from 19 to 28 c 60 to 86 and 0 31 to 1 51 kpa respectively during the plant growing season the total seasonal etc was approximately 135 to 222 mm and the total water applied for each treatment ranged from 45 to 168 mm as shown in table 2 the difference between the etc and total water applied represents water storage in the pot the etc increased generally with irrigation water amount and was higher during the flowering and maturity stages of plant growth as these corresponded to the periods when the crops required more water for their physiological development daily volumetric soil water content for various irrigation treatments are shown in fig 1 the soil water content generally decreased with decreasing water application with 100 and 20 awc resulting in the highest and lowest values of soil water content respectively soil water contents for 20 40 and 60 awc were relatively low throughout the growing season the 80 awc was not statistically different from full irrigation treatment 100 awc but was significantly different from other treatments 3 2 effects of irrigation on marketable yield effects of irrigation treatments on marketable yield of the plants are shown in fig 2 the total marketable yield ranged from 0 40 to 0 59 kg plant 1 for 20 and 100 awc treatments respectively the highest mean marketable yield was obtained from 100 awc treatment 0 59 kgplant 1 while the least marketable yield was obtained from 40 awc treatment 0 40 kg plant 1 the average yield from the full irrigation treatment 100 awc was statistically different from the yield obtained from the 40 and 20 awc but not significantly different from the yield obtained from 80 and 60 awc which implies that water stress below 60 awc treatment caused evident decrease in crop yield 3 3 water stress indicators the mean of all the measured stress indicators generally decreased as irrigation water application decreased table 3 the leaf temperature showed the highest correlation ratio η2 0 93 which implies that the irrigation treatments explained most of the tc variance the results show that 100 and 20 awc had the average lowest and highest leaf temperatures the 100 awc was not statistically different from the 80 awc but was significantly different from the 60 40 and 20 awc this indicates that water stress affected the leaf temperature of the plants the stomatal conductance had a high value of correlation ratio η2 0 82 indicating that the variance in gs was explained by the irrigation treatments administered in the study the leaf relative water content was weakly affected by the irrigation levels η2 0 42 compared to the tc and gs there is a linear relationship between the leaf temperature and stomatal conductance with r2 0 86 p 0 0001 this indicates that stomatal conductance increased linearly with decreases in leaf temperature also the rwc is linearly correlated with tc having an r2 0 51 p 0 01 3 4 crop spectral reflectance the spectral signatures of the plant leaves obtained from the spectrometer from various treatments are shown in fig 3 a the plant canopy reflectance varied among various water treatment regimes and displayed similar trends throughout the entire growing season the spectral signature follows a similar pattern for each of the treatments with the 100 awc and 20 awc recording the highest and lowest reflectance values in the visible spectral range 400 700 nm respectively the spectral reflectance curves show peaks near 550 and 668 nm and trough near 680 nm the stressed crops exhibited higher reflectance values within the visible spectral range as shown in fig 3 b the measured values of canopy reflectance were used to calculate the spectral vegetation indices shown in table 1 3 4 1 crop reflectance indices the reflectance indices identified for monitoring water stress in this study were distinctly correlated with canopy temperature stomatal conductance relative water content yield and volumetric soil water content the relationship between various reflectance indices and canopy temperature tc obtained from the different water treatment levels is shown in fig 4 analysis of the results revealed that all the crop reflectance indices considered in this experiment were significantly correlated with tc however the pri553 wi ndvi and prinorm showed the most significant correlation with tc r2 0 82 p 0 001 0 80 p 0 001 and 0 73 p 0 001 respectively the greenness indices ndvi rdvi and osavi were significantly related to tc r2 0 5 p 0 01 0 62 p 0 001 and 0 63 p 0 01 respectively fig 5 shows the relationship between various vegetation indices and stomatal conductance gs of the plants the result showed the correlation between gs and wi ndvi and rdvi r2 0 52 p 0 01 0 51 p 0 01 and 0 73 p 0 001 respectively the osavi and wi ndvi were weakly correlated with gs r2 0 32 p 0 05 and 0 42 p 0 05 respectively similarly prinorm and pri553 showed significant correlations with gs r2 0 70 p 0 001 and 0 62 p 0 001 respectively and pri570 was correlated with gs r2 0 42 p 0 01 the coefficient of determination of the linear relationships between all the reflectance indices and stress parameters are summarized in table 4 the results show that the water indices wi ndvi and wi showed the strongest correlation with crop yield r2 0 76 p 0 001 and 0 69 p 0 001 respectively also there were significant correlations between the greenness indices and crop yield r2 0 53 p 0 01 0 62 p 0 001 and 0 62 p 0 01 for ndvi rdvi and osavi respectively the pri553 and pri570 showed weak correlations with crop yield r2 0 41 p 0 01 and 0 30 p 0 05 respectively while the prinorm showed a strong correlation with crop yield r2 0 62 p 0 01 the structural indices showed no significant correlation with the rwc of bell pepper specifically pri with reference wavelength of 553 nm pri553 showed a good correlation with water stress indicators considered in this experiment with r2 0 72 p 0 05 0 62 p 0 001 0 82 p 0 001 0 41 p 0 001 for rwc gs tc and yield respectively the water index showed a strong correlation with the plant stress parameters r2 0 89 p 0 01 0 52 p 0 01 0 66 p 0 01 and 0 69 p 0 001 for rwc gs tc and yield respectively the wi ndvi was significantly correlated with rwc gs tc and yield with r2 0 69 p 0 05 0 43 p 0 05 0 80 p 0 001 0 76 p 0 001 respectively ndvi rdvi osavi and prinorm were not significantly correlated with rwc while the pri570 pri550 pri553 wi and wi ndvi were correlated with the rwc with r2 0 44 p 0 05 0 30 p 0 01 0 72 p 0 05 0 89 p 0 01 and 0 69 p 0 05 respectively table 4 also showed that the ndvi rdvi osavi pri570 pri550 prinorm pri553 wi and wi ndvi were correlated with crop et with r2 0 47 p 0 001 0 62 p 0 001 0 43 p 0 5 0 61 p 0 01 0 56 p 0 01 0 73 p 0 001 0 63 p 0 01 0 61 p 0 01 and 0 77 p 0 001 respectively there was no significant difference between 100 and 80 awc for most of the indices however all the reflectance indices showed significant differences when the soil moisture content depletes below 40 awc which implies that the indices detected changes in plant water status table 5 shows the correlations between various indices indices of the same group tend to show higher statistical significance with each other apart from ndvi other structural indices rdvi and osavi were significantly correlated with each other while ndvi was only correlated with prinorm the xanthophyll pigment indices all showed significant correlations with each other and with the xanthophyll and water indices based on the results shown in table 4 the pri553 showed the best potential for detecting water stress in greenhouse grown bell pepper plants with r2 0 82 p 0 001 and the relationship between water stress levels and the index is shown in eq 4 4 w a t e r s t r e s s 0 007 p r i 553 0 17 4 discussions 4 1 effects of water stress on yield the irrigation treatments implemented in this experiment caused a moderate to severe water stress on the plants and this caused a reduction in photosynthetic efficiency of the leaf pigments as reflected in reduced yields of the stressed plants the lowest crop yield was obtained from the 40 awc and resulted in a yield loss of 32 compared to the optimum yield this indicates that the depletion of soil water content to 40 awc caused severe water stress that adversely affected the crop yield water application at 60 awc resulted in a yield loss of 17 compared to the optimum yield and this justifies the need for supplemental irrigation 4 2 effects of irrigation treatment on crop reflectance the stressed plants exhibited high reflectance values within the visible spectrum usually plant pigments absorb radiance in the visible spectral range but reflect most radiance in the near infrared nir range this spectral reflectance pattern is affected by plant stress due to reduced efficiency of the photosynthetic pigments leading to increased reflectance in the visible band and decreased reflectance in the nir band based on this concept structural indices such as ndvi were calculated and have been used by researchers to estimate biomass leaf area index and yield of various crop species jones 2004 2007 rossini et al 2013 panadiga et al 2014 huang et al 2014 leroux et al 2016 recent studies utilize ndvi to map crop cover for estimation of crop coefficients kc used in the conventional fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and for irrigation scheduling jones 2012 ndvi has also shown a linear relationship with the basal crop coefficient for et kcb because kcb mainly depends on the dynamics of plant canopies greenness biomass and lai several other researchers have used ndvi to predict kcb for several other crops allen et al 2005 irmak et al 2011 kamble et al 2013 kullberg et al 2017 which makes it useful for estimating crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation 4 3 effects of water stress on crop reflectance indices an evaluation of the reflectance indices for detecting water stress in bell pepper revealed that the pri553 had the best correlation with leaf temperature and stomatal conductance making the index a valuable tool for monitoring water stress in bell pepper plants basically water stressed plants close their stomatal leading to increased leaf temperature to dissipate excess excitation energy detected as changes in leaf xanthophyll pigment eq 4 showed an inverse relationship between plant water stress levels and pri553 a xanthophyll pigment index with the pri index reducing as plant water stress decreases our result agrees with previous studies that used the xanthophyll pigment indices to detect water stress berni et al 2009a 2009b dangwal et al 2015 leroux et al 2016 panigada et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 suárez et al 2010 zarco tejada et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 the relationship between pri and water stress can be explained by the role of the xanthophyll pigments in dissipating excess heat that occurs when plants are stressed and the functional interaction between eco physiological indicators of water stress in plants peñuelas et al 2011 at the beginning of water stress rwc decreases stomata close and tc increases concurrently with a reduction in photosynthesis pigment activities prasad et al 2008 which is detected by variations in pri the pri570 proposed in previous studies to minimize structural effects hernández clemente et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2012 showed weak correlations with rwc and gs in our study and therefore not suitable for monitoring water status in bell pepper plants the strong correlation between the prinorm and gs implies that water stress induced changes in xanthophyll pigment previous studies showed improved capacity of prinorm to detect water stress because it is more sensitive to dynamic changes in vegetation compared to other greenness indices evain et al 2004 garbulsky et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2013 again the physiological processes of bell pepper plants were differently affected by water stress during the plant s growth stages the diurnal course of tc is strongly related to the regulation of stomatal opening and other aspects of crop physiology gonzalez dugo et al 2014 in non stressed plants tc reduced as the day progressed due to the increased evaporative demand causing the transpiration rate to also increase in this experiment water stress significantly affected leaf temperature with the non stressed and fully stressed treatments recording the least and highest tc values respectively this affirms the assertion that water stress leads to a reduction in transpiration thereby causing an increase in leaf temperature compared to non stressed plants idso et al 1982 this concept has been adopted by several researchers who used crop water stress index cwsi to evaluate water stress in various crops aladenola and madramootoo 2014 jones 2010 nielson and gardner 1988 osroosh et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2012 payero and irmak 2006 sezen et al 2014 their studies demonstrated that tc is sensitive to water stress and relies on stomatal closure as an early indicator of water deficits our irrigation treatments resulted in changes in canopy structure detected by the variations in the structural indices with different water treatment levels the significant relationship between the greenness indices and gs shows that water stress adversely affected the leaf pigment structures leading to variations in ndvi and rdvi among various treatments this may be the effect of accumulated water stress on the plant physiology and the structural indices detected these changes in plant leaves rinaldi et al 2014 obtained significant correlation between ndvi and plant biomass and yield which is consistent with our study other studies obtained good correlation between ndvi and plant water content genc et al 2011 kim et al 2010 marino et al 2014 koksal 2011 attributed these findings to the effects of water stress on the crop canopy that may have caused changes in leaf structure and composition gago et al 2015 demonstrated that the greenness indices are more related to the plant biomass than its dynamic physiological status in our study good correlations between plant water status and structural indices were obtained during the late maturity stage of the plants by then the effects of water stress on the plants were already established this presents a limitation on the use of structural indices for monitoring plant water stress and scheduling irrigation most of the indices investigated in this study showed strong correlation with crop yield apart from pri570 and pri533 as shown in table 4 previous researchers reported high correlation between ndvi and biomass chlorophyll leaf area and yield jones et al 2007 koksal 2011 liu et al 2004 jones et al 2004 explained that although ndvi may be a good indicator of nitrogen content and biomass it provides a medium estimate of plant water content usually ndvi is not significantly correlated with stomatal conductance which is affected by variations in environmental conditions such as vapour pressure deficit and air temperature but it is strongly correlated to leaf area index lai aguilar et al 2012 magney et al 2016 the relationship between ndvi and lai could be explored to monitor the effects of water stress on crop yield and provide appropriate information of the spatial and temporal variations in water stress levels and plant water requirements for precise irrigation water management the significant correlation between prinorm and crop yield indicates that the index prinorm captured the effect of water stress on the photosynthetic pigment of the plant which could have been responsible for the reduced crop yield of the stressed plants the index generates a normalization that considers the chlorophyll content using the red edge index r700 r670 which is sensitive to chlorophyll content and canopy leaf area reduction rdvi induced by stress also the significant correlation between most of the reflectance indices and crop et is indicative of the potential usefulness of the indices for improving agricultural water management as crop et is one of the best indicators of water stress the correlation between wi ndvi and tc indicates that the index detected changes in plant canopy structure induced by water stress in most plants water index reflects water absorption in the mesophyll pigment and tends to increase as leaf rwc increases previous studies had observed significant relationships between wi and rwc amatya et al 2012 genc et al 2011 jones and vaughan 2010 kittas et al 2016 and this supports the use of water index for predicting plant water status in our study the crop reflectance indices and rwc were not significantly correlated this is because bell pepper like most isotropic crops tends to maintain a stable leaf water status under a declining soil moisture condition and changing evaporative demand however the strong correlation between tc and gs showed in fig 6 indicates that gs is a better indicator of water status in bell peppers than rwc 5 conclusions the present study evaluated the sensitivity of spectral vegetation indices for monitoring water stress in greenhouse grown bell pepper plants the results indicated that water stress adversely affected crop yield with the yield decreasing as irrigation water decreases generally irrigation applications below 80 available water content caused significant decrease in crop yield the spectral vegetation indices were sensitive to different water stress levels in bell pepper plants our results indicate that the photochemical reflectance indices centered at 553 nm pri553 water index wi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi normalized photochemical reflectance index prinorm and the ratio of water index to normalized difference vegetation index wi ndvi were the most useful indices for detecting water stress in bell pepper plants though it was challenging to select a single index as the best indicator of water status the pri553 showed strong correlations with all stress indicators previous studies suggested the use of photochemical reflectance indices centered at 570 nm pri570 for monitoring water status of various plant species cultivated under open field conditions but our results demonstrated that the pri553 was better than the pri570 when correlated to all water stress indicators in the greenhouse nevertheless it is important to note that leaf biophysical and biochemical effects on physiochemical reflectance index during the growing season could affect the use of the index for detecting water stress therefore integration of several crop reflectance indices using advanced data management tools are required to improve crop water stress monitoring and optimize irrigation water management it is recommended that future research should focus on the integration of thermal and spectral vegetation indices to precisely estimate plant water status real time analysis of these data which could be integrated into a crop water stress model would provide a vital tool for greenhouse crop growers to aid in decision making and optimization of agricultural water use it is further recommended that prospective irrigation scheduling models test and validate the above mentioned spectral indices for

11033,early detection of plant water status is essential to optimize crop water use and to implement water savings methods such as precision irrigation this study investigated the potential of using crop reflectance indices to detect water stress in order to improve irrigation of bell pepper capsicum annuum l grown under greenhouse conditions spectral data were acquired from bell pepper plants with five different irrigation regimes namely 100 80 60 40 and 20 of plant available water in a completely randomized design plant stress parameters including stomatal conductance gs canopy temperature tc relative water content rwc yield and volumetric soil moisture content smc were concurrently measured with spectral data acquisition from the plants throughout the growing season various reflectance indices including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi photochemical reflectance index centered at 570 nm pri570 photochemical reflectance index centered at 553 nm pri553 normalized pri prinorm water index wi and wi ndvi were obtained from the spectral data the relationships between these crop reflectance indices and the water stress indicators were statistically examined at the five irrigation levels the results revealed that pri553 wi rdvi prinorm and wi ndvi were the most useful indices for detecting water stress in bell pepper plants the findings of this study show promise of using a proximal method for assessing water stress and to improve water management of high value vegetable crops grown under greenhouse conditions keywords crop water stress irrigation scheduling bell pepper plants spectral reflectance indices water management 1 introduction conventional methods of scheduling irrigation such as soil moisture monitoring are laborious time consuming and require large number of soil moisture sensors to account for spatial heterogeneity of soil properties ihuoma and madramootoo 2016 an alternative method of irrigation scheduling is to directly monitor the plant water status through the physiological responses of plants to water stress water stressed plants absorb more radiant energy than is required for their photosynthetic activities thereby exceeding their photosynthetic demand the plants dissipate this excess energy as chlorophyll fluorescence and heat to avoid damage to the photosynthetic pigment rossini et al 2013 also plants undergoing water stress close their stomata to conserve water which closes the pathway for the exchange of oxygen water and carbon dioxide as a result water stress causes a drop in photosynthetic activities which reduces growth and development of crops dangwal et al 2015 stomatal closure also results in decreases in the transpiration rate and evaporative cooling thereby increasing the leaf temperature this concept was used by idso et al 1981 to develop the crop water stress index cwsi for tracking water stress in crops with the aid of infrared thermometers recently researchers have utilized high resolution airborne thermal sensors to detect differences in canopy temperature for monitoring water stress in plants berni et al 2009a 2009b gonzalez dugo et al 2013 osroosh et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2012 as leaf temperature is a direct indicator of plant transpiration however leaf temperature does not account for changes in photosynthetic pigments in water stressed crops zarco tejada et al 2013 and is limited in estimating plant water status due to variations in environmental temperature and humidity chung et al 2018 within the past few years studies have investigated alternative narrow band hyperspectral indices for detecting crop water stress panigada et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 this approach relies on the absorption and scattering of light which controls the spectral features of plant leaves to provide reliable quantitative and timely information on crop stress in a cost effective manner previous studies have investigated several spectral vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi photochemical reflectance index pri570 normalized pri prinorm water index wi wi ndvi and normalized water index nwi for monitoring water stress in crops a comprehensive review of reflectance indices for assessing plant water status and scheduling irrigation has been outlined in ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 however most of the studies focused on various species of tree and cereal crops dangwal et al 2015 magney et al 2016 panigada et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 and their findings cannot be adopted for estimating water status in vegetable crops due to differences in their physiological characteristics while crop reflectance measurements have been widely investigated for crops grown under open field conditions the same cannot be said for high value vegetable crops grown under greenhouse conditions meanwhile reflectance indices for open field production may not be suitable for the greenhouse since plant water stress is influenced by a combination of environmental conditions microclimate root conditions and plant genetic traits katsoulas et al 2016 therefore there is need to investigate crop reflectance indices that can be applied for early assessment of plant water stress to improve the productivity and yields of high value vegetable crops grown under greenhouses most vegetable crops such as bell pepper have high water demand and are susceptible to water stress kirnak et al 2003 showed that water stress adversely affects the physiological and nutritional development of bell pepper to achieve optimal bell pepper production supplemental irrigation is required to ensure adequate water supply during their growth cycle olanike and madramootoo 2014 yildirim et al 2012 zotarelli et al 2011 however climate change drought and rising water demands from non agricultural sectors are limiting the availability of fresh water resources for irrigation therefore precise irrigation scheduling is essential to optimize irrigation water use improve crop yield and avoid excessive irrigation that may result in yield or water loss afzal et al 2017 or leaching of agricultural nutrients that would degrade soil and water implementation of this strategy requires information on plant water status ali 2011 the objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of spectral vegetation indices for detecting water stress for optimizing irrigation water management in greenhouse grown bell pepper plants specifically the objectives were to i evaluate and compare various spectral vis for monitoring water stress in bell pepper plants ii test different pri formulations for detecting water stress in bell pepper plants by changing the normalization bands from 530 nm to 570 nm iii determine the relationship between vis and water stress of bell pepper 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and irrigation treatments this research was conducted in the greenhouse at macdonald campus of mcgill university ste anne de bellevue quebec canada the study area lies between latitude 45 26 17 n and longitude 73 56 17 w with an elevation of 36 m the greenhouse with a dimension of 8 m x 7 m x 5 m was covered with single pane tempered glass that allows 95 of light transmission the greenhouse roof was inclined at an angle of 37 to the horizontal bell pepper cultivar red knight seedlings were transplanted on august 26 2016 into 25 pots 18 l each and one plant per pot using soil from the horticultural research centre of mcgill university each pot had a depth of 32 cm and diameter of 27 cm the soil was a sand clay loam with sand silt and clay content of 48 22 and 30 respectively usda nrcs 2000 field capacity of 33 and permanent wilting point of 17 by volume the pots were placed on 330 150 150 mm bricks which were randomly positioned in the greenhouse at a spacing of 0 6 m by 0 6 m a water tap was affixed to the bottom of the pots so that excess water could be drained and measured with a volumetric flask the pots were saturated and allowed to drain out for 24 h so that the soil water content was at field capacity before the plants were transplanted the experiment was arranged in a completely randomised design with the five 5 water treatment levels of 100 80 60 40 and 20 of plant available water as treatments irrigation applications were based on the soil s plant available water awc defined as the difference between the field capacity and permanent wilting point of the soil and soil moisture content smc in each pot was continuously measured with soil moisture sensors the water treatment levels for each treatment 100 80 60 40 and 20 awc were used as the upper irrigation threshold while the lower irrigation threshold was set at 10 depletion of awc for each treatment irrigation was initiated when the smc in the pots depleted to its requisite moisture treatment threshold value and was terminated when the upper trigger 100 80 60 40 and 20 awc moisture content was attained the volume of water applied to each pot during irrigation was determined as the product of the irrigation duration and the flow rate per pot while the equivalent irrigation depth applied at each irrigation event for each pot was determined as the product of the volumetric water content and the plant rooting depth high quality irrigation water was applied through a drip system with emitters placed in each pot the drip system consisted of pressure compensating emitters with a discharge of 2 l h 1 and the flow rates were calibrated in the greenhouse irrigation was uniformly applied to all treatments at the beginning of transplanting based on 100 replenishment of water in the plant root zone to field capacity for plants to be well established thereafter the various irrigation treatments were implemented until harvest replenishment of soil water at the five water application levels was done using continuous time domain reflectometers tdr cs625 water content reflectometer campbell scientific inc ut usa installed vertically at a depth of 30 cm in the middle of each pot to correspond with the plant rooting depth jaria and madramootoo 2013 tdr readings were calibrated with gravimetric soil moisture measurements and the sensors were installed with the aid of an insertion guide following the procedures articulated in the sentek manual sentek sensor technologies 2003 the soil moisture sensors were connected to data loggers model cr205 6 campbell scientific inc ut usa the data was scanned every 5 min and recorded every 15 min hourly and daily data were retrieved from the cr205 6 using a laptop computer and loggernet software from campbell scientific inc fertilizer applications were based on guidelines for greenhouse production provided by the technicians in the horticulture research centre the plants were fertilized biweekly with 20 20 20 n p k water soluble fertilizer at a rate of 4 kg of n hectare this was changed to calcium nitrate after the first fruits were noticed and later changed to potassium nitrate when the fruits were approaching maturity 2 2 measurements daily air temperature relative humidity and vapour pressure

with handheld infrared thermometry set at an emissivity of 0 95 w m ² evett et al 2000 fluke 572 model fluke corporation everett wa the instrument was held 30 cm above the plant canopy and directed at the leaf of the bell pepper plant with a laser point of the instrument set at an angle of 90 to the horizontal orta et al 2002 four infrared thermometer measurements were made when the plant canopy covered about 80 of the pot area the temperature of the stressed and non stressed plants was determined from canopy temperature data four north south east and west viewing directions were considered and average temperatures obtained measurements were made between 11 00 and 15 00 h to ensure maximum solar intensity when the sun was shining directly on the plants as adopted by aladenola and madramootoo 2014 stomatal conductance was measured during the growing period using a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor ltd lincoln ne three 3 healthy fully sunlit leaves were selected and stomatal conductance was measured on the leaves using the li 6400 and the averages calculated leaf relative water content rwc was measured at each stage of plant growth by selecting the youngest fully expanded leaves from one representative crop in each treatment the leaf samples were enclosed in a sealed plastic bag and kept in a cooler at 5 c until they reached the laboratory fresh weight fw was recorded using an analytical balance and the samples were immersed in distilled water for 72 h blotted and weighed to obtain the turgid weight tw finally leaf samples were dried at 72 c in an oven until constant dry weight dw was achieved the rwc was calculated according to eq 2 as adopted in previous studies on crop water stress colombo et al 2008 wang et al 2015 bell pepper plants were harvested about 4 four times after maturity and the total and marketable yield were measured and recorded 2 r w c f w d w t w d w 100 2 2 2 spectral data acquisition and processing a miniature fibre optic spectrometer stellar net inc usa which measures reflectance in the 200 1150 nm spectral range was used to measure canopy reflectance the spectrum is characterized by a 0 5 nm spectral resolution and was calibrated before each reading was taken the calibration process involved holding the probe at 45 to a white standard reference at a distance of about 60 mm to optimize the integration time typically set at 50 ms recording dark current and then obtaining target reflectance all canopy spectral measurements were taken under clear sky conditions between 11 00 and 15 00 h to ensure maximum solar intensity when the sun was shining directly on the plants as conducted in similar studies zhao et al 2017 the spectrometer was positioned at a height of 30 cm from the plant canopy so that it viewed only the plant canopy five leaves were measured in every pot and four scans were averaged in every measurement considering four north south east and west viewing directions the measurements were carried out five times 16 and 21 september 10 18 and 25 october 2016 during the flowering and maturity stages of the crops when the crops are more susceptible to water stress due to the absorption of atmospheric water signal background and light scattering effects the spectral reflectance contains substantial interference noise zhao et al 2017 which must be eliminated as it affects the smoothness of the spectral curve the most commonly used smoothing algorithms include the moving average method fitting polynomial method wavelet transform and various regression smoothing methods based on the recommendations of previous research zhao et al 2017 the 7 point weighted moving average method was used to smooth the spectral curve in this research this algorithm enhances the smoothness of the spectral curve while keeping all the spectral details intact to ensure the extraction of suitable wavelengths the spectral indices used in this study were obtained from the optical reflectance measurements from each treatment and are presented in table 1 the reflectance indices were divided into three 3 the xanthophyll pigment indices related to photosynthetic pigment changes the structural greenness indices related to the canopy structure and biomass and the water indices related to the water content of the plant canopy 2 3 statistical analysis the pearson correlation ratio was used to describe the effects of irrigation levels on the stress indicators tc rwc gs given that the correlation ratio η2 is defined as 3 η 2 σ 2 σ y 2 w h e r e σ 2 x n x x 2 x n x a n d σ y 2 x i n x y x i 2 n where each observation is yxi x indicates the five irrigation levels and i indicates an observation nx is the number of observations in category x ȳx is the mean of the category x and ȳ is the mean of the whole population the correlation ratio assumes values in the interval 0 1 and indicatȳes how the data variance is explained by the factor irrigation a correlation ratio close to 1 implies that all the data variance is explained by the factor irrigation one way analysis of variance anova was conducted on the vegetation indices and field data using proc glm general linear model procedure of sas software version 9 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa and significance of differences among treatments were separated using fisher s least significant difference lsd at a 5 probability level the relationship between the vegetation indices ndvi osavi rdvi pri570 pri553 prinorm wi wi ndvi and stress indicators tc rwc gs total marketable yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and soil moisture content were evaluated by ordinary least square ols regression analysis 3 results 3 1 crop evapotranspiration and soil water content daily mean temperature relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit in the greenhouse ranged from 19 to 28 c 60 to 86 and 0 31 to 1 51 kpa respectively during the plant growing season the total seasonal etc was approximately 135 to 222 mm and the total water applied for each treatment ranged from 45 to 168 mm as shown in table 2 the difference between the etc and total water applied represents water storage in the pot the etc increased generally with irrigation water amount and was higher during the flowering and maturity stages of plant growth as these corresponded to the periods when the crops required more water for their physiological development daily volumetric soil water content for various irrigation treatments are shown in fig 1 the soil water content generally decreased with decreasing water application with 100 and 20 awc resulting in the highest and lowest values of soil water content respectively soil water contents for 20 40 and 60 awc were relatively low throughout the growing season the 80 awc was not statistically different from full irrigation treatment 100 awc but was significantly different from other treatments 3 2 effects of irrigation on marketable yield effects of irrigation treatments on marketable yield of the plants are shown in fig 2 the total marketable yield ranged from 0 40 to 0 59 kg plant 1 for 20 and 100 awc treatments respectively the highest mean marketable yield was obtained from 100 awc treatment 0 59 kgplant 1 while the least marketable yield was obtained from 40 awc treatment 0 40 kg plant 1 the average yield from the full irrigation treatment 100 awc was statistically different from the yield obtained from the 40 and 20 awc but not significantly different from the yield obtained from 80 and 60 awc which implies that water stress below 60 awc treatment caused evident decrease in crop yield 3 3 water stress indicators the mean of all the measured stress indicators generally decreased as irrigation water application decreased table 3 the leaf temperature showed the highest correlation ratio η2 0 93 which implies that the irrigation treatments explained most of the tc variance the results show that 100 and 20 awc had the average lowest and highest leaf temperatures the 100 awc was not statistically different from the 80 awc but was significantly different from the 60 40 and 20 awc this indicates that water stress affected the leaf temperature of the plants the stomatal conductance had a high value of correlation ratio η2 0 82 indicating that the variance in gs was explained by the irrigation treatments administered in the study the leaf relative water content was weakly affected by the irrigation levels η2 0 42 compared to the tc and gs there is a linear relationship between the leaf temperature and stomatal conductance with r2 0 86 p 0 0001 this indicates that stomatal conductance increased linearly with decreases in leaf temperature also the rwc is linearly correlated with tc having an r2 0 51 p 0 01 3 4 crop spectral reflectance the spectral signatures of the plant leaves obtained from the spectrometer from various treatments are shown in fig 3 a the plant canopy reflectance varied among various water treatment regimes and displayed similar trends throughout the entire growing season the spectral signature follows a similar pattern for each of the treatments with the 100 awc and 20 awc recording the highest and lowest reflectance values in the visible spectral range 400 700 nm respectively the spectral reflectance curves show peaks near 550 and 668 nm and trough near 680 nm the stressed crops exhibited higher reflectance values within the visible spectral range as shown in fig 3 b the measured values of canopy reflectance were used to calculate the spectral vegetation indices shown in table 1 3 4 1 crop reflectance indices the reflectance indices identified for monitoring water stress in this study were distinctly correlated with canopy temperature stomatal conductance relative water content yield and volumetric soil water content the relationship between various reflectance indices and canopy temperature tc obtained from the different water treatment levels is shown in fig 4 analysis of the results revealed that all the crop reflectance indices considered in this experiment were significantly correlated with tc however the pri553 wi ndvi and prinorm showed the most significant correlation with tc r2 0 82 p 0 001 0 80 p 0 001 and 0 73 p 0 001 respectively the greenness indices ndvi rdvi and osavi were significantly related to tc r2 0 5 p 0 01 0 62 p 0 001 and 0 63 p 0 01 respectively fig 5 shows the relationship between various vegetation indices and stomatal conductance gs of the plants the result showed the correlation between gs and wi ndvi and rdvi r2 0 52 p 0 01 0 51 p 0 01 and 0 73 p 0 001 respectively the osavi and wi ndvi were weakly correlated with gs r2 0 32 p 0 05 and 0 42 p 0 05 respectively similarly prinorm and pri553 showed significant correlations with gs r2 0 70 p 0 001 and 0 62 p 0 001 respectively and pri570 was correlated with gs r2 0 42 p 0 01 the coefficient of determination of the linear relationships between all the reflectance indices and stress parameters are summarized in table 4 the results show that the water indices wi ndvi and wi showed the strongest correlation with crop yield r2 0 76 p 0 001 and 0 69 p 0 001 respectively also there were significant correlations between the greenness indices and crop yield r2 0 53 p 0 01 0 62 p 0 001 and 0 62 p 0 01 for ndvi rdvi and osavi respectively the pri553 and pri570 showed weak correlations with crop yield r2 0 41 p 0 01 and 0 30 p 0 05 respectively while the prinorm showed a strong correlation with crop yield r2 0 62 p 0 01 the structural indices showed no significant correlation with the rwc of bell pepper specifically pri with reference wavelength of 553 nm pri553 showed a good correlation with water stress indicators considered in this experiment with r2 0 72 p 0 05 0 62 p 0 001 0 82 p 0 001 0 41 p 0 001 for rwc gs tc and yield respectively the water index showed a strong correlation with the plant stress parameters r2 0 89 p 0 01 0 52 p 0 01 0 66 p 0 01 and 0 69 p 0 001 for rwc gs tc and yield respectively the wi ndvi was significantly correlated with rwc gs tc and yield with r2 0 69 p 0 05 0 43 p 0 05 0 80 p 0 001 0 76 p 0 001 respectively ndvi rdvi osavi and prinorm were not significantly correlated with rwc while the pri570 pri550 pri553 wi and wi ndvi were correlated with the rwc with r2 0 44 p 0 05 0 30 p 0 01 0 72 p 0 05 0 89 p 0 01 and 0 69 p 0 05 respectively table 4 also showed that the ndvi rdvi osavi pri570 pri550 prinorm pri553 wi and wi ndvi were correlated with crop et with r2 0 47 p 0 001 0 62 p 0 001 0 43 p 0 5 0 61 p 0 01 0 56 p 0 01 0 73 p 0 001 0 63 p 0 01 0 61 p 0 01 and 0 77 p 0 001 respectively there was no significant difference between 100 and 80 awc for most of the indices however all the reflectance indices showed significant differences when the soil moisture content depletes below 40 awc which implies that the indices detected changes in plant water status table 5 shows the correlations between various indices indices of the same group tend to show higher statistical significance with each other apart from ndvi other structural indices rdvi and osavi were significantly correlated with each other while ndvi was only correlated with prinorm the xanthophyll pigment indices all showed significant correlations with each other and with the xanthophyll and water indices based on the results shown in table 4 the pri553 showed the best potential for detecting water stress in greenhouse grown bell pepper plants with r2 0 82 p 0 001 and the relationship between water stress levels and the index is shown in eq 4 4 w a t e r s t r e s s 0 007 p r i 553 0 17 4 discussions 4 1 effects of water stress on yield the irrigation treatments implemented in this experiment caused a moderate to severe water stress on the plants and this caused a reduction in photosynthetic efficiency of the leaf pigments as reflected in reduced yields of the stressed plants the lowest crop yield was obtained from the 40 awc and resulted in a yield loss of 32 compared to the optimum yield this indicates that the depletion of soil water content to 40 awc caused severe water stress that adversely affected the crop yield water application at 60 awc resulted in a yield loss of 17 compared to the optimum yield and this justifies the need for supplemental irrigation 4 2 effects of irrigation treatment on crop reflectance the stressed plants exhibited high reflectance values within the visible spectrum usually plant pigments absorb radiance in the visible spectral range but reflect most radiance in the near infrared nir range this spectral reflectance pattern is affected by plant stress due to reduced efficiency of the photosynthetic pigments leading to increased reflectance in the visible band and decreased reflectance in the nir band based on this concept structural indices such as ndvi were calculated and have been used by researchers to estimate biomass leaf area index and yield of various crop species jones 2004 2007 rossini et al 2013 panadiga et al 2014 huang et al 2014 leroux et al 2016 recent studies utilize ndvi to map crop cover for estimation of crop coefficients kc used in the conventional fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and for irrigation scheduling jones 2012 ndvi has also shown a linear relationship with the basal crop coefficient for et kcb because kcb mainly depends on the dynamics of plant canopies greenness biomass and lai several other researchers have used ndvi to predict kcb for several other crops allen et al 2005 irmak et al 2011 kamble et al 2013 kullberg et al 2017 which makes it useful for estimating crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation 4 3 effects of water stress on crop reflectance indices an evaluation of the reflectance indices for detecting water stress in bell pepper revealed that the pri553 had the best correlation with leaf temperature and stomatal conductance making the index a valuable tool for monitoring water stress in bell pepper plants basically water stressed plants close their stomatal leading to increased leaf temperature to dissipate excess excitation energy detected as changes in leaf xanthophyll pigment eq 4 showed an inverse relationship between plant water stress levels and pri553 a xanthophyll pigment index with the pri index reducing as plant water stress decreases our result agrees with previous studies that used the xanthophyll pigment indices to detect water stress berni et al 2009a 2009b dangwal et al 2015 leroux et al 2016 panigada et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 suárez et al 2010 zarco tejada et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 the relationship between pri and water stress can be explained by the role of the xanthophyll pigments in dissipating excess heat that occurs when plants are stressed and the functional interaction between eco physiological indicators of water stress in plants peñuelas et al 2011 at the beginning of water stress rwc decreases stomata close and tc increases concurrently with a reduction in photosynthesis pigment activities prasad et al 2008 which is detected by variations in pri the pri570 proposed in previous studies to minimize structural effects hernández clemente et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2012 showed weak correlations with rwc and gs in our study and therefore not suitable for monitoring water status in bell pepper plants the strong correlation between the prinorm and gs implies that water stress induced changes in xanthophyll pigment previous studies showed improved capacity of prinorm to detect water stress because it is more sensitive to dynamic changes in vegetation compared to other greenness indices evain et al 2004 garbulsky et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2013 again the physiological processes of bell pepper plants were differently affected by water stress during the plant s growth stages the diurnal course of tc is strongly related to the regulation of stomatal opening and other aspects of crop physiology gonzalez dugo et al 2014 in non stressed plants tc reduced as the day progressed due to the increased evaporative demand causing the transpiration rate to also increase in this experiment water stress significantly affected leaf temperature with the non stressed and fully stressed treatments recording the least and highest tc values respectively this affirms the assertion that water stress leads to a reduction in transpiration thereby causing an increase in leaf temperature compared to non stressed plants idso et al 1982 this concept has been adopted by several researchers who used crop water stress index cwsi to evaluate water stress in various crops aladenola and madramootoo 2014 jones 2010 nielson and gardner 1988 osroosh et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2012 payero and irmak 2006 sezen et al 2014 their studies demonstrated that tc is sensitive to water stress and relies on stomatal closure as an early indicator of water deficits our irrigation treatments resulted in changes in canopy structure detected by the variations in the structural indices with different water treatment levels the significant relationship between the greenness indices and gs shows that water stress adversely affected the leaf pigment structures leading to variations in ndvi and rdvi among various treatments this may be the effect of accumulated water stress on the plant physiology and the structural indices detected these changes in plant leaves rinaldi et al 2014 obtained significant correlation between ndvi and plant biomass and yield which is consistent with our study other studies obtained good correlation between ndvi and plant water content genc et al 2011 kim et al 2010 marino et al 2014 koksal 2011 attributed these findings to the effects of water stress on the crop canopy that may have caused changes in leaf structure and composition gago et al 2015 demonstrated that the greenness indices are more related to the plant biomass than its dynamic physiological status in our study good correlations between plant water status and structural indices were obtained during the late maturity stage of the plants by then the effects of water stress on the plants were already established this presents a limitation on the use of structural indices for monitoring plant water stress and scheduling irrigation most of the indices investigated in this study showed strong correlation with crop yield apart from pri570 and pri533 as shown in table 4 previous researchers reported high correlation between ndvi and biomass chlorophyll leaf area and yield jones et al 2007 koksal 2011 liu et al 2004 jones et al 2004 explained that although ndvi may be a good indicator of nitrogen content and biomass it provides a medium estimate of plant water content usually ndvi is not significantly correlated with stomatal conductance which is affected by variations in environmental conditions such as vapour pressure deficit and air temperature but it is strongly correlated to leaf area index lai aguilar et al 2012 magney et al 2016 the relationship between ndvi and lai could be explored to monitor the effects of water stress on crop yield and provide appropriate information of the spatial and temporal variations in water stress levels and plant water requirements for precise irrigation water management the significant correlation between prinorm and crop yield indicates that the index prinorm captured the effect of water stress on the photosynthetic pigment of the plant which could have been responsible for the reduced crop yield of the stressed plants the index generates a normalization that considers the chlorophyll content using the red edge index r700 r670 which is sensitive to chlorophyll content and canopy leaf area reduction rdvi induced by stress also the significant correlation between most of the reflectance indices and crop et is indicative of the potential usefulness of the indices for improving agricultural water management as crop et is one of the best indicators of water stress the correlation between wi ndvi and tc indicates that the index detected changes in plant canopy structure induced by water stress in most plants water index reflects water absorption in the mesophyll pigment and tends to increase as leaf rwc increases previous studies had observed significant relationships between wi and rwc amatya et al 2012 genc et al 2011 jones and vaughan 2010 kittas et al 2016 and this supports the use of water index for predicting plant water status in our study the crop reflectance indices and rwc were not significantly correlated this is because bell pepper like most isotropic crops tends to maintain a stable leaf water status under a declining soil moisture condition and changing evaporative demand however the strong correlation between tc and gs showed in fig 6 indicates that gs is a better indicator of water status in bell peppers than rwc 5 conclusions the present study evaluated the sensitivity of spectral vegetation indices for monitoring water stress in greenhouse grown bell pepper plants the results indicated that water stress adversely affected crop yield with the yield decreasing as irrigation water decreases generally irrigation applications below 80 available water content caused significant decrease in crop yield the spectral vegetation indices were sensitive to different water stress levels in bell pepper plants our results indicate that the photochemical reflectance indices centered at 553 nm pri553 water index wi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi normalized photochemical reflectance index prinorm and the ratio of water index to normalized difference vegetation index wi ndvi were the most useful indices for detecting water stress in bell pepper plants though it was challenging to select a single index as the best indicator of water status the pri553 showed strong correlations with all stress indicators previous studies suggested the use of photochemical reflectance indices centered at 570 nm pri570 for monitoring water status of various plant species cultivated under open field conditions but our results demonstrated that the pri553 was better than the pri570 when correlated to all water stress indicators in the greenhouse nevertheless it is important to note that leaf biophysical and biochemical effects on physiochemical reflectance index during the growing season could affect the use of the index for detecting water stress therefore integration of several crop reflectance indices using advanced data management tools are required to improve crop water stress monitoring and optimize irrigation water management it is recommended that future research should focus on the integration of thermal and spectral vegetation indices to precisely estimate plant water status real time analysis of these data which could be integrated into a crop water stress model would provide a vital tool for greenhouse crop growers to aid in decision making and optimization of agricultural water use it is further recommended that prospective irrigation scheduling models test and validate the above mentioned spectral indices for

11034,the application of soil mulching is widely used to improve crop productivity within semi arid regions of china but little is known when using a crop rotation system in the sub humid drought prone regions as to whether the mulching practice may perform as well as in semi arid regions a field study was conducted during two consecutive cycles of a wheat triticum aestivum l maize zea mays l cropping system within the yangling district of northwest china to evaluate the effects of different mulch cultivation practices on soil water contents and soil temperatures em50 probes crop yields and water use efficiency wue four treatments were evaluated 1 a flat plot without mulch control treatment ck 2 a flat plot with straw mulch sm 3 a flat plot with plastic film mulch pm and 4 a ridge furrow planting with film mulch over the ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow psm all mulch treatments significantly improved grain yields and wue of the winter wheat and summer maize in comparison with ck the highest grain yields and wue occurred in the psm treatment over the two wheat maize cycles the average soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil layer was 3 82 2 25 and 1 31 higher under the psm pm and sm treatments respectively in comparison to the ck treatment although the soil mulching practices insignificantly changed the total crop evapotranspiration et with a small quantity compared with non mulched treatment they tended to reduce non productive soil evaporation e and increase productive plant transpiration t all mulching treatments increased the soil temperature of the winter wheat from the seedling to the regreening stages and helped prevent freeze damage the psm and sm treatments effectively inhibited the excessive soil temperature rise during the growth stage for summer maize the psm treatment resulted in favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions that increased the grain yields and water use efficiency of winter wheat and summer maize therefore we concluded that ridge furrow planting with film mulch over ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow is an effective management practice to increase yields and wue in a winter wheat summer maize crop rotation within this sub humid drought prone region keywords ridge furrow with mulch wheat maize cycles soil water and temperature yield water use efficiency sub humid drought prone areas of china 1 introduction water stress directly limits crop growth and grain yieldsin a manner that significantly affects economic development and food security turner 2004 mupangwa et al 2008 in the last 50 years rainfall has decreased in some parts of china due to a warming climate zhang et al 2014 that has caused a severe shortage in the available water resources for agricultural production the sub humid drought prone areas are main dry land agricultural production areas in china annual rainfall in this area ranges from 400 to 600 mm which indicates that the area has more water for agriculture compared to the arid areas within china xiaoli et al 2012 however due to the continental monsoon climate 70 of the rainfall within the sub humid drought prone areas is concentrated in june and september annual precipitation in the region is higher than in arid and semi arid areas but the uneven distribution of rainfall has become the main limitation to the sustainable development of agriculture in the sub humid drought prone areas xie et al 2005 bu et al 2013 liu et al 2014a b thus the improved utilization of limited seasonal rainfall resources through reductions in inefficient water consumption and increased water utilization efficiency is urgently needed there are many proven mulching techniques to entrap and conserve rainwater such as plastic film mulch straw mulch and ridge furrow mulch plastic film mulch has proven to be a useful method for increasing grain yields in agricultural areas where irrigation is not available and has been widely utilized for crop growth in dryland areas yan et al 2006 liu et al 2009 mulch provides favorable soil conditions for crop growth that reduces the effects of drought stress and improves water collecting capacity mulch has been shown to reduce the relative rate of evaporation in evapotranspiration in a manner that enhances crop yields and water use efficiency dong et al 2009 bu et al 2013 however a large portion of this plastic is left on the field which have obvious negative effects on the environment and soil structure in terms of water nutrient transport and crop growth that resulted in decreased crop yields briassoulis 2006 liu et al 2014a b straw mulch has also been shown to reduce the needed quantities of chemical fertilizers wang et al 2013 as it helps increase soil organic matter and improves soil structure gami et al 2009 straw mulching is one effective practice that may comprehensively utilize the agricultural wastes and improve soil water conditions zhao et al 2009 zhang et al 2009a b c in addition the application of straw in agriculture will improve the agricultural ecological environment because the need of open field straw burning has been reduced or eliminated the incorporation of straw was beneficial for the improvement of soil nutrients wagner et al 2007 straw mulch was shown to raise the soil temperature in the cold season and reduce soil temperature in the hot season and help keep soil temperature stable chen et al 2007 other researchers have found that straw mulching resulted in frozen wheat seeding conditions that negatively influenced germination especially for relatively cold climate conditions gao et al 2009 ridge and furrow plantings were an efficient way to collect rainfall and promote root growth within northwest china han et al 2004 zhang et al 2007a b ridge furrow planting with film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow can help regulate water availability during critical growth stages improve soil temperatures save water resources and bring increases in crop yields and farmer s income li et al 2013a b therefore ridge and furrow planting with mulches has become a somewhat commonly used practice for farmers within semi arid regions of the loess plateau qin et al 2015 assessed the effects of soil mulch on maize and wheat using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries they demonstrated that soil mulching significantly increased yields wue yield per unit water and nitrogen use efficiency nue yield per unit n of maize and wheat but that the effects of mulching tended to decrease with increased water inputs these types of mulching practices are being rapidly developed and adopted in arid and semi arid areas where rainfall is low unpredictable and infrequent and in areas that typically utilize a crop fallow system of wheat or maize within the sub humid drought prone areas of china these sub humid areas have similar meteorological characteristics to semi arid areas and typically undergo drought stress during the cropping season that results in reduced crop productivity information is limited when using a crop rotation system in the sub humid drought prone regions whether the mulching practice would perform as well as in semi arid regions hence it is our hypothesis that soil mulching in the sub humid drought prone regions that use a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system may increase wue through the highly efficient use of precipitation and improve crop yields in a similar manner that occurs in semi arid regions therefore the present study was conducted for a rainfed wheat maize rotation system within a sub humid drought prone region of china that has similar meteorological characteristics to semi arid areas and typically undergo drought stress during the cropping season we tested four planting patterns 1 flat plot without mulch control treatment ck 2 flat plot with straw mulch sm 3 flat plot with plastic film mulch pm 4 ridge furrow planting with film mulch over the ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow psm the purposes of present study were 1 to evaluate the effects of different mulching cultivation systems on soil water use soil temperature and crop growth and yields in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system so as to provide a scientific basis for agricultural management and 2 to identify the optimal type of mulch cultivation system the ultimate goal of this study was to promote the effective use of soil water under different mulch cultivation systems in sub humid drought prone regions of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2015 at an irrigation experimental station adapted for the study of water saving irrigation and agriculture in yangling shaanxi china 34 20 n 108 24 e 521ma s l the site is located in a sub humid climatic zone the mean annual temperature was 13 0 c and mean annual

automated weather station fig 1 the average annual maximum and minimum temperatures were 19 6 and 9 2 c during the period of 2013 2014 and 19 7 and 9 2 c during the period of 2014 2015 the total precipitation for 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 was 683 5 and 526 9 mm respectively the precipitation was 303 2 and 243 0 mm for the wheat seasons and was 380 3 and 283 9 mm for the maize seasons the soil texture was a silty clay loam composing by 8 sand 75 silt and 17 clay in 0 10 cm soil layer the soil properties within the upper 20 cm of soil were as follows in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the four planting patterns conducted during the experiment were 1 a flat plot without mulch control treatment ck 2 a flat plot with straw mulch sm 3 a flat plot with plastic film mulch pm and 4 a ridge furrow planting with film mulch over the ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow psm the experiment was arranged in a randomized design with three replicates each experimental plot was 5 m long and 2 m wide within the sm treatment the wheat straw covered the soil surface at the rates of 4000 kg ha 1 within the pm treatment the plastic film 1 5 m width 0 01 mm thickness that was a transparent and impermeable film was mulched onto the flat surface the wheat straw was applied annually after the wheat was harvested within the psm treatment the ridges 60 cm width and 15 cm height were mulched using a plastic film 1 m width and 0 01 mm thickness that was a transparent and impermeable film the furrows 60 cm width were used for planting crops and were mulched by wheat straw 4000

with a row spacing of 60 cm and a 40 cm spacing between plants within rows the crop planting details for all four treatments over the two wheat maize rotations are listed in table 2 the chemical fertilizers were applied in all treatments at rates of 120 kg n ha 1 and 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 before wheat planting and an additional urea 30 kg n ha 1 was applied to the soil surface during the elongation stage the chemical fertilizers were applied in all treatments at rates of 225 kg n ha 1 and 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 before maize planting 2 3 sampling measurements and data analysis 2 3 1 soil water and soil temperature during the growing season of wheat and maize the volumetric soil moisture contents smc were measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico iph tdr germany li et al 2015 2004 with soil water measurements at 0 1 m intervals within the 0 1 m soil layer and at 0 2 m intervals within the 1 2 m soil layer the soil moisture content profiles were measured once in a week and the probes were placed in the middle of the planting rows an em50 american gene company data logger and soil moisture capacitance probes environmental logging system usa were used to dynamically monitor the soil water and soil temperatures during the growing season of winter wheat and summer maize soil water contents and temperatures were measured hourly at soil depths of 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm with the em50 soil sensors and then averaged as daily values the sensors were installed in the middle of the plant rows in the horizontal position one measurement site was located at the center of each plot to minimize variations caused by the soil profile and soil structure the soil was vertically excavated layer by layer at 10 cm intervals the excavated soil from each layer was separately placed and then backfilled in turn after all sensors were installed the soil water storage was calculated with the following equation 1 w i 1 n w i h i 10 where w mm soil water content wi soil volumetric moisture content in each different soil layer hi cm soil depth n soil layers the total evapotranspiration et rate was calculated with the following equation 2 et p i d r δw where p mm precipitation i mm irrigation d mm deep percolation r mm surface runoff δw the soil water storage change in 0 200 cm soil depth in this experimental field irrigation was not used for any of the plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the soil surface so the upward flow into the root zone was considered to be negligible li et al 2013a excess soil moisture conditions were not observed at the experimental field level during the study so the deep percolation was assumed to be insignificant the water use efficiency wue was calculated with the following equation 3 wue y et where wue water use efficiency y kg ha 1 grain yield and et mm total evapotranspiration during crop growth season 2 3 2 biomass and yield measurements the progress of wheat and maize growth was recorded at physiological growth stages throughout the study the plant height and above ground dry matter were measured at all the growing stages after seedling emergence the above ground biomass was weighed after which the plant samples were heated at 105 for one hour and then dried at 75 to constant weight at the crop harvesting stage the wheat yield and biomass were calculated by a 1 m2 area located within the middle of the plots and the maize yield and biomass were calculated by randomly selecting ten plants in the central portion of each plot 2 3 3 interactions between soil water and temperature in yield and wue the effects of multiple variables and possible interactions between variables on yield and wue were calculated with the following equation 4 y a b1

results of soil water storage shown in fig 2 indicate the mulch treatments generally increased soil water storage particularly within the 0 200 cm soil layer compared with the ck treatment over the two wheat and maize growing seasons the average soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil depth over the two wheat maize cycles in comparison to the ck treatment was 3 82 2 25 and 1 31 higher under the psm pm and sm treatments respectively the psm treatment had the highest values of soil water storage over the two rotation cycles the soil water storage under sm treatment was relatively higher than under the ck treatment over the two rotation cycles but the differences were not significant during the early wheat growth stage seeding jointing stage the average soil water storage within the 0 2 0 m depth over the two rotation cycles was significantly p 0 05 increased in comparison to the ck treatment by 6 70 4 96 and 3 37 under the psm pm and sm treatments respectively during the wheat jointing maturity stage there were no significant differences in the soil water storage among the planting patterns at the time of harvest there were slightly reduced values of soil water storage for all the treatments with the exception of the 2014 summer maize the lack of treatment effects in soil water storage during the 2014 summer maize harvest season was possibly due to the relatively higher precipitation 38 mm in 2013 2014 wheat 24 mm in 2014 2015 maize 211 40 mm in 2014 maize 80 mm in 2015 maize during the grain filling stage after rainfall events the soil water storage under the mulch treatments were generally higher especially for the psm treatment when compared with the no mulch treatment the data showed that precipitation had large impacts on the soil water storage and the highest soil water contents were recorded for the psm treatment in comparison to the pm sm and ck treatments results of the soil water contents swc fig 3 showed that the mulching treatments increased the swc within the 0 80 cm soil profile compared with the ck treatment during the early growing seasons of both wheat and maize during the jointing grain filling stages the swc within 120 160 cm soil profile under the mulching treatments was generally lower in comparison to the ck treatment the swc reductions indicated that under the mulching treatments more water was utilized from the deeper soil layer than under the ck treatment at the maturity stage in maize there were no significant differences in swc between treatments but differences occurred in winter wheat such that the psm treatment having had the highest swc within the 20 60 cm soil depths 3 2 evapotranspiration the trends of evapotranspiration et soil evaporation e and transpiration t among the different planting patterns are illustrated for the two winter wheat and summer maize rotation cycles in fig 4 the soil evaporation e was large during the seeding regreening stages for winter wheat and the seeding stage for summer maize such that there was decreased e with increasing crop canopy the mulch treatments tended to have greater transpiration than the ck treatment during the two wheat maize seasons the mean seasonal transpiration within the psm pm sm and ck treatments accounted for 73 2 69 6 61 9 and 49 1 of the evapotranspiration for winter wheat respectively and 78 3 74 6 70 0 and 57 8 of the evapotranspiration for summer maize respectively the mean evapotranspiration within the psm pm and sm treatments was increased in comparison to the no mulch treatment by 19 92 14 34 and 11 39 mm respectively there were no differences in evapotranspiration between the pm and sm treatments over the two cropping cycles the et of the ck treatment was significantly higher compared with the mulching practices during the early growth periods i e wheat and maize seeding stages fig 4 and was attributed to the soil almost remaining bare for the ck treatment and soil evaporation from a bare soil surface would be expected to dominate the et the psm treatment had the most significant effects on reducing the e in comparison to the ck treatment with reductions of 20 23 mm and 37 15 mm in the mean soil evaporation during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter wheat seeding stages respectively and by 19 36 mm and 28 19 mm during the 2014 and 2015 summer maize seeding stages respectively with the growth of crops higher et values were observed for the mulch treatments due to the greater transpiration the evapotranspiration at the jointing stage for wheat and maize were significantly greater for the mulch treatments in comparison to the ck treatment the mulch and control treatments displayed reduced values of et during the maturity stage for both wheat and maize since there were reductions in crop transpiration use during the maturity stage 3 3 soil temperatures the dynamic changes of the soil temperatures within the upper 15 cm soil depth during the growth periods present similar patterns for the different mulch treatments in the winter wheat and summer maize of both crop growth years fig 5 the soil temperatures were significantly influenced by daily air temperatures and varied in similar patterns among the different mulch treatments figs 1 and 5 when compared with the ck treatment the soil temperatures were increased by an average of 1 23 c under the pm treatment and was reduced by a mean of 0 43 c and 1 02 c under the psm and sm treatments respectively during the two wheat maize growth seasons the mulch treatments displayed higher soil temperatures than the ck treatment during the 0 100 days after sowing for winter wheat during the mid to late growth periods of winter wheat relatively higher soil temperatures were displayed under the ck treatment compared with the mulch planting treatments during the entire summer maize growth season the soil temperatures for each of the treatments presented the following trend pm ck psm sm it was generally concluded that the effects of the mulch treatments on the soil temperatures decreased with increased summer maize growing diurnal changes of soil temperature at the stages of seeding and grain filling in the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons are shown in fig 6 the patterns of diurnal soil temperature change were similar for both the seeding and grain filling stages of wheat and maize however the amplitude of the variations in soil temperatures were greater during the seeding stage compared with the variations that occurred during the grain filling stage irrespective of whether the seeding stage or grain filling stage except for the wheat grain filling stage the pm treatment exhibited the greatest amplitudes in diurnal variations of soil temperatures followed by ck psm and sm the diurnal changes of soil temperatures at the wheat grain filling stage for each of the procedures presented the following trend ck pm psm sm these differences may be attributed to the crop canopy being smaller under the ck treatment during the wheat grain filling stage compared with the mulched treatments which allowed more solar radiation to intercept the ground surface during the seeding stage the amplitude of the soil temperature variations under the psm pm sm and ck treatments were 2 9 6 7 1 5 and 5 6 c during the wheat growing season respectively and 1 3 4 1 1 1 and 3 7 c during the maize growing season respectively during the grain filling stage the amplitude of the soil temperature variations under the psm pm sm and ck treatments were 1 1 1 4 0 9 and 1 7 c during the wheat growing season respectively and 1 6 2 9 1 2 and 2 3 c during the maize growing season respectively 3 4 wheat and maize biomass the dynamic process of aboveground biomass accumulation for the wheat and maize crops are presented in fig 7 the biomass production kg ha 1 increased gradually for all mulching treatments during the two wheat maize growth seasons and reached maximum values at the crop maturity stages the biomass accumulation over the two growth seasons was higher under the psm treatment with a trend that was followed by the pm sm and ck treatments especially during the late growth stages during jointing i e 160 days after sowing to the maturity stage of the wheat growth season during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 seasons the biomass accumulation significantly increased in comparison to the control treatment by 34 3 53 1 and 51 1 78 1 for the psm treatment respectively by 32 1 45 3 and 41 6 84 5 for the pm treatment respectively and by 14 6 24 2 and 16 9 24 3 for the sm treatment respectively there were no significant differences in biomass accumulation between the psm and pm treatments during either wheat growth season during tasseling 50 days after sowing to the maturity stages of maize growth seasons in 2014 and 2015 the biomass accumulation significantly increased in comparison to the control treatment by 44 0 75 8 and 72 6 74 5 with the psm treatment respectively by 31 0 48 6 and 46 4 60 6 with the pm treatment respectively and by 21 8 47 2 and 35 7 68 0 with the sm treatment respectively 3 5 grain yields and wue the grain yields of winter wheat were significantly influenced by the different mulch treatments for the two growth seasons table 4 the two year mean wheat yields for each of the treatments followed the trend psm pm sm ck the wheat yields under the psm pm and sm treatments were significantly increased in comparison to the control treatment during 2013 2014 by 26 5 19 7 and 8 0 respectively and in 2014 2015 by 51 8 42 4 and 42 3 respectively there were no significant differences in wheat crop yields between the psm and pm treatments the sm treatment yield value was not significantly different from the ck treatment value during the 2013 2014 winter wheat growing season similarly the two year mean wheat aboveground biomass yield was highest under the psm treatment and the lowest under the ck treatment the psm and pm treatments displayed statistically increased biomass in comparison to the biomass production for the ck treatment there were no significant differences in mean biomass production between the sm and ck practices p 0 05 the value of et under the mulching treatments were higher than under the ck treatment during the two year winter wheat growth seasons table 4 and seemed to be in agreement with the higher biomass production and yields for the mulching treatments however there were no significant differences in et between the mulching treatments and the ck treatment for the 2014 2015 growth season during the winter wheat growth seasons the values of wue were significantly increased under the mulching treatments when compared to the wue values for the ck treatment the values of wue under the psm pm and sm treatments compared to the wue values under the ck treatment were increased in the 2013 2014 wheat growth season by 19 6 11 7 and 1 4 respectively and in the 2014 2015 wheat growth season by 49 9 36 0 and 40 0 respectively table 4 the wue value under the sm treatment was not significantly different from the wue value under the ck treatment during the 2013 2014 wheat growth season in addition the wue values for any of the mulching treatments were not significantly different from each other within the 2013 2014 wheat growth season table 4 the psm pm and sm treatments significantly increased the 2014 and 2015 maize grain yields in comparison to the ck treatment by 75 2 65 1 and 59 6 respectively and 49 1 40 2 and 28 9 respectively table 5 the grain yields under the mulching treatments were not significantly different from each other during the two seasons the total annual dry biomass of the maize crop increased in comparison to values for the ck treatment dramatically by 44 0 31 0 and 37 1 during 2014 and by 72 6 60 6 and 37 1 during 2015 for the psm pm and sm treatments respectively however the biomass yields between the psm pm and sm treatments were not statistically different in 2014 p 0 05 the two year summer maize et was the highest under the psm treatment and was the lowest under the ck treatment table 5 the two year summer maize et value for each growth period was not significantly different the psm pm and sm treatments significantly increased the maize wue in comparison to the ck treatment with increased values of 67 6 61 6 and 55 8 in 2014 respectively and 42 1 37 5 and 27 0 in 2015 respectively table 5 the wue values under the mulching treatments were not significantly different from each other for the two maize growth seasons 3 6 interactions between soil water and temperature in yield and wue results of the statistical analysis of the effects of mulching on soil water and temperature and their interactions during the wheat maize growing season on yield are summarized in table 6 all the mulching treatments had significant and positive effects on wheat and maize yields wheat and maize yields were positively related to soil water content but not related to soil temperature the interactions between soil water and temperature were not significant in the analysis of the wheat and maize yields the wue of wheat and maize was not significantly related to the soil water content and temperature and the interactive effects were also not found to be significant table 7 the wue of wheat and maize was significantly and positively related to mulching treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulch on soil water most of the precipitation occurs in the form of low intensity precipitation events within the semi humid drought prone areas of china the precipitation quantities delivered in this manner cannot satisfy the normal growth of crops and a smaller quantity of rainfall occurs as intensive rainstorm events that usually cause surface runoff chen et al 2015 the soil surface mulch practices e g ridge furrow mulch plastic film mulch and straw mulch may reduce the evaporation losses from the soil surface it is very important to improve the conditions of soil moisture and the thermal regime in dry land agriculture kouwenhoven et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 in our study the mulch treatments significantly increased the 0 200 cm soil water storage during the early crop growing stages fig 2 the psm pm and sm treatments significantly increased the average 0 200 cm soil water storage in comparison to the ck treatment by 39 5 35 8 and 19 7 cm during the two year wheat early growth stage i e seeding regreening respectively and by 54 6 35 9 and 32 5 cm during the two year maize early growth stage i e seeding respectively it has been reported for a similar study in a dryland region with a semi arid climate that more soil water was lost from the ck practice because of intense soil surface evaporation by direct solar radiation in the early growth seasons bu et al 2013 mulch treatments have been shown to collect rainfall into the soil reduce soil surface evaporation and increase soil moisture within the soil profile li et al 2013a b during the jointing maturity stages there were no significant differences in the soil water storage between the mulching treatments and the non mulch treatments our study indicated that mulching treatments increased the swc within the 0 80 cm soil profile compared with the ck treatment in the early growing season of wheat and maize fig 3 in the jointing grain filling stages however the swc within the 120 160 cm soil profile under the mulching treatments were generally lower than under ck treatment the soil water storage for the ck treatment was even higher when compared with the mulching treatments at specific crop growth stages such as during the 2013 2014 wheat jointing stage the 2014 2015 wheat grain filling stage and the 2014 maize tasseling stage fig 2 these results were similar to the results reported by xiaoli et al 2012 and li et al 2016 within the same area the differences in their study were primarily attributable to the early establishment period of the winter wheat and summer maize that caused a stronger transpiration from the crop canopy and more water consumption from the soil layer for the mulching treatments in comparison to the ck treatment li et al 2004 all the mulching treatments would be expected to increase the value of soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil layer during the wheat and maize early growth stages however the mulching treatments caused differences in soil water storage the current study indicated that the psm treatment showed the most significant impacts on soil water storage followed by pm and sm treatments some explanations for that result are that i the sm treatment conserved soil water and reduced soil evaporation but the effects were less than the values for the psm and pm treatments ii the pm treatment may help conserve rainfall but some water might have evaporated directly from the flat surface of the plastic film so that only minimal amounts of water reached the crop roots when frequent but small rainfall events occurred during the crop growth stages zhao et al 2009 and iii the psm treatment increased soil moisture contents by the accumulation of water from light precipitation events and preserved excess water from intense rainfall events jia et al 2006 han et al 2004 demonstrated that the psm treatment was better in a semi arid climate for the utilization of water from minimal rainfall events and that utilization was the critical reason the psm treatment maximized the soil water resources in comparison to soil under conventional flat planting for all crop growing seasons thus the psm treatment may have helped decrease the consumption of groundwater by providing improved utilization of limited precipitation and may have helped resolve the water scarcity problem that limits sustainable agriculture production within the region 4 2 effects of mulch on soil water evapotranspiration within the rainfed agricultural regions it is essential to reduce the water loss caused by evaporation to improve the soil moisture conditions liu et al 2016 evapotranspiration and its components evaporation and transpiration are significant basic terms of the water balance in these ecosystems wang et al 2015 ding et al 2013 previous studies have shown that mulching treatments may effectively restrain soil evaporation promote less stressful plant transpiration and may help preserve water resources by improved water use the conservation of water is an important process to help facilitate crop vegetative and reproductive growth fang et al 2009 zhu et al 2000 in our study the mulching treatments displayed different impacts on water consumption during the wheat and maize growth seasons fig 4 when compared with the ck treatment the et of the mulching treatments were similar during the wheat and maize early growth stages and became more significant in wheat and maize during the mid to late growth stages during the seeding stages the ck treatment did not effectively harvest the rainfall but allowed rapid evaporation of the soil moisture from the bare soil surface while the mulching treatments reduced soil evaporation by providing increased soil surface cover over time in consideration of an increased crop growth canopy the soil evaporation might be continuously decreased and its contribution to et losses accordingly decreased the plant transpiration would be increased with the flourish of the plant canopy fig 4 the mulching treatments displayed a more significant crop canopy than the ck treatment as implicated by the more significant biomass fig 7 which would have resulted in increased et during the wheat and maize mid to late growth stages during the maturity stage the et of the mulching treatments was lower than the ck treatment because of the expedited crop development under the mulching treatments especially under the psm treatment these et values were also likely affected by the temporal distribution of rainfall huang et al 2003 showed that if there were a relative quantity of precipitation that occurred during the wheat and maize growth stages the soil evaporation would correspondingly be increased under the control treatment and decreased under the mulch treatments because of the soil surface cover provided by the mulch this phenomenon proved the implication that the et of the ck treatment was higher during periods with precipitation that occurred during the wheat heading stage in 2013 2014 the maize grain filling stage in 2014 and the maize grain tasseling stage in 2015 fig 4 4 3 effects of mulch on soil temperature the results of each mulching treatment on the soil temperature were different between the winter wheat and summer maize fig 5 at the early growth stage of wheat 0 100 days after seeding the influence on soil temperature followed the trend of pm psm sm ck treatments whereas at the later growth stage the effects on soil temperature followed the trend of ck pm psm sm treatments these patterns indicated that the mulching treatments increased the soil temperatures from the seeding to regreening stages for winter wheat these results agreed with the reports of zhang et al 2009a b c and li et al 2016 who also indicated that soil temperatures under mulching treatments were higher when the weather was colder and were lower when the weather was warmer compared with a conventional flat planting there are several explanations that help explain these results i during the early cooler periods the crop canopy was small under the mulching treatments which allowed the majority of the cover material to collect solar radiation and the surface soil temperature to rise more rapidly gao et al 2009 gan et al 2013 it has been suggested that the topsoil was insulated by straw mulching when the weather was colder wang et al 2015 the soil temperature under the psm treatment was lower in comparison with the pm treatment and higher in contrast with the sm treatment and was perhaps due to the interaction of the plastic film mulching and straw mulching chen et al 2015 ii during the warm period the mulching treatments and shading from the increased crop canopy effectively reduced large quantities of solar radiation that reached the ground surface therefore the lower soil temperatures under the mulching treatments were recorded which also agreed with the conclusions of gan et al 2013 nevertheless during the summer maize growth periods the mulching treatment effects on soil temperature followed the treatment trend of pm ck psm sm the plastic film mulching treatment raised the soil temperature by blocking the sensible heat exchange between the surface soil and air during the majority of the crop growth stage liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013 therefore the highest soil temperatures were observed under the pm treatment the lowest soil temperatures were observed under the sm treatments throughout the entire summer maize growth period it has been shown that straw mulch on the soil surface forms a physical barrier that could block the solar radiation and prevent water and heat exchange between the soil and atmosphere thereby decreasing soil temperature during summer maize growth seasons kar and kumar 2007 similarly there seemed to be interactions between the plastic film and straw mulch as the soil temperature under the psm treatment was lower when compared with the pm treatment and was higher when compared with the sm treatment the pattern of diurnal soil temperature changes was similar for both the seeding and grain filling stages of wheat and maize however the amplitude of the soil temperature variations was greater during the seeding stage compared with variations during the grain filling stage fig 6 it has been shown that the mulching treatments had greater effects on soil temperature when the crop canopy was small so the wheat maize yields and wue were not significantly related to the mean soil temperatures of the entire growth season moreover li et al 2013a b found that the soil temperature at depths of 5 25 cm under the dual mulching of ridges with plastic film and furrows with straw was always lower than that under single mulching with plastic film the pm treatment exhibited the greatest amplitude in diurnal soil temperature variations followed by the ck psm and sm treatments except during the wheat grain filling stage we came to a similar conclusion in this study that compared with plastic film mulching straw mulching on furrows could reduce the diurnal soil temperature variations the psm treatment could increase the soil temperature during the over wintering regreening stages for winter wheat and effectively inhibited the excessive temperature rise during the growth stage for summer maize thereby improving crop growth and yields 4 4 effects of mulch on crop growth and yield the aboveground biomass accumulation seemed to be the most closely associated with soil water and soil temperature conditions during the different crop growth stages liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2009a b c zhang et al 2017a b these stages have been shown to be correlated with evaporation interception moisture infiltration and sunlight capture and conversion payero et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2010 the mulching treatments likely enhanced the accumulation of biomass by improving the soil water and heat status to accelerate crop growth under the mulching treatments in such a manner that would result in more rapid crop development ma et al 2008 during our study the mulching treatments brought higher aboveground crop growth during the different crop growth stages in comparison to the ck treatment with the highest values under the psm treatment followed by the pm and sm treatments fig 7 these differences were thought to be primarily because the soil water and soil temperatures were lower under the sm treatment than under the psm and pm treatments during the early crop growth stages this delay was thought to have restricted the crop growth that occurred during the middle and late stages there were no significant differences between the psm and pm treatments during the entire wheat growing season which may be attributed to the similar soil water fig 2 and soil temperature status fig 5 the mulching treatments in our study insignificantly affected the total plant et in comparison to the no mulching treatments but the mulching treatments seemed to have effectively reduced soil surface evaporation and increased effective crop transpiration ding et al 2018 these differences significantly accelerated the growth of the crop canopy and resulted in the significantly increased aboveground biomass values that are displayed in tables 4 and 5 oweis and hachum 2006 reported similar research findings in studies with both maize and wheat the rainfall during the first wheat maize rotation cycle 683 5 mm was more than the rainfall which occurred during the second cycle 526 9 mm but the yields were less for the second cycle than the yields for the first cycle for almost all the treatments listed in tables 4 and 5 a probable reason for these yield differences may be that the rainfall distribution pattern was uneven during the first cycle and waterlogging stress may have occurred at various crop growth stages zang et al 2017a b please note that one third of the precipitation occurred during the 2013 2014 winter wheat heading stage and that more than a half of the precipitation happened in 2014 during the summer maize grain filling stage the crop was evidently not able to sufficiently use the rainfall during the grain filling stage it has been reported for a similar study in a semi arid region that more than normal amounts of precipitation were lost through evaporation and that the excessive rainfall may have caused waterlogging stress on crops tan et al 2010 in addition there were also periods of severe short term droughts and higher temperatures during the 2014 summer maize early growth stage all of these factors may have led to a decrease in crop yields additional mulch in crop furrows has been shown to increase the maize yields by approximately 20 within the semi arid area of the loess plateau li et al 2001 qin et al 2015 assessed the effects of soil mulch on maize and wheat using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries they demonstrated that straw mulching increased mean wheat and maize yields by 20 within arid and semi arid areas plastic mulching increased mean wheat yields by 15 and mean maize yields by 60 within arid and semi arid areas over the two years of our study the mean wheat yields and wue increased in comparison to the control by 39 15 and 34 7 under the psm treatment respectively by 31 0 and 23 9 under the pm treatment respectively and by 25 2 and 20 7 under the sm treatment respectively tables 4 and 5 over the two years of our study the mean maize yield and wue increased in comparison to the control by 62 2 and 54 9 under the psm treatment respecitively by 52 7 and 49 6 under the pm treatment respectively and by 44 3 and 41 4 under the sm treatment respectively therefore it is consistent with our hypothesis that soil mulching within the sub humid drought prone regions that use a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system increased the wue through the highly efficient utilization of precipitation that resulted in improved crop yields in the same manner as has been observed for semi arid regions the highest grain yields and wue occurred for the psm treatment over the two wheat maize rotation systems although soil water consumption characteristics under the psm treatment in our experiment were similar to the pm and sm treatments the crop yields under the psm treatment were increased in comparison to crop yields under the pm and sm treatments over the two wheat and maize crop growth seasons the psm treatment may result in increased soil water by reducing soil evaporation and accumulating light rain to infiltrate into the deep soil layers zhang et al 2007a b which may offer moisture necessary for key growth stages of the crop li et al 2004 the psm treatment in our study had more favorable soil temperature conditions which could help avoid freezing during the over wintering stage for the winter wheat and help abate the high temperatures that potentially cause crop damage during the summer maize growth season wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a b the psm treatment promoted crop growth and achieved better crop growth targets that affected both biomass and grain yields the water use efficiency wue helps explain factors which affect crop yield and evapotranspiration liu and siddique 2015 zhang et al 2008a b reported that the mulching treatments were a useful means of increasing the wue hu et al 2014 noted that the psm treatment significantly increased the utilization rate of rainfall improved soil moisture and increased the wue attributes corresponding to a reduced evapotranspiration rate this observation is consistent with the results of our study given the fact that although the et was similar for all the mulching treatments for the two years of both wheat and maize growth the wue under the psm treatment was higher as influenced by the higher crop yields than the yields observed for the other mulching treatments tables 4 and 5 5 conclusions all mulching treatments had significant and positive effects on wheat and maize yields wheat and maize yields were positively related to soil water content but not with soil temperature the wue of wheat and maize was not significantly related to either soil water content or temperature and the interactive effects were also not significant the beneficial effects of mulching on soil primarily occurred during the sowing to jointing stages of both wheat and maize this benefit was primarily reflected in the fact that mulching may reduce soil evaporation and help regulate soil temperature when the crop canopy is small thus promoting the growth of plants in later growth stages and increasing the crop yields the two years average wheat yields and wue under the mulching treatments increased in comparison to the control treatment by 25 2 39 1 and 20 7 34 1 respectively the two years average maize yields and wue under the mulching treatment increased in comparison to the control treatment by 43 3 62 2 and 41 4 54 9 respectively soil mulching treatments especially the psm treatment utilized in the sub humid drought prone regions that use a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system may increase the wue through the highly efficient use of precipitation and improve crop yields to levels observed in semi arid regions the psm treatment plastic film combined with straw mulch lead to favorable soil water and thermal conditions that effectively improved the grain yields and wue of winter wheat and summer maize therefore we conclude that the use of a ridge furrow planting practice with film mulch over ridge and wheat straw mulch over furrow is an effective crop management system to increase yields and wue for a winter wheat summer maize rotation within this sub humid drought prone area of china acknowledgements we would like to thank national key r d program of china 2017yfc0403600 and

11034,the application of soil mulching is widely used to improve crop productivity within semi arid regions of china but little is known when using a crop rotation system in the sub humid drought prone regions as to whether the mulching practice may perform as well as in semi arid regions a field study was conducted during two consecutive cycles of a wheat triticum aestivum l maize zea mays l cropping system within the yangling district of northwest china to evaluate the effects of different mulch cultivation practices on soil water contents and soil temperatures em50 probes crop yields and water use efficiency wue four treatments were evaluated 1 a flat plot without mulch control treatment ck 2 a flat plot with straw mulch sm 3 a flat plot with plastic film mulch pm and 4 a ridge furrow planting with film mulch over the ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow psm all mulch treatments significantly improved grain yields and wue of the winter wheat and summer maize in comparison with ck the highest grain yields and wue occurred in the psm treatment over the two wheat maize cycles the average soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil layer was 3 82 2 25 and 1 31 higher under the psm pm and sm treatments respectively in comparison to the ck treatment although the soil mulching practices insignificantly changed the total crop evapotranspiration et with a small quantity compared with non mulched treatment they tended to reduce non productive soil evaporation e and increase productive plant transpiration t all mulching treatments increased the soil temperature of the winter wheat from the seedling to the regreening stages and helped prevent freeze damage the psm and sm treatments effectively inhibited the excessive soil temperature rise during the growth stage for summer maize the psm treatment resulted in favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions that increased the grain yields and water use efficiency of winter wheat and summer maize therefore we concluded that ridge furrow planting with film mulch over ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow is an effective management practice to increase yields and wue in a winter wheat summer maize crop rotation within this sub humid drought prone region keywords ridge furrow with mulch wheat maize cycles soil water and temperature yield water use efficiency sub humid drought prone areas of china 1 introduction water stress directly limits crop growth and grain yieldsin a manner that significantly affects economic development and food security turner 2004 mupangwa et al 2008 in the last 50 years rainfall has decreased in some parts of china due to a warming climate zhang et al 2014 that has caused a severe shortage in the available water resources for agricultural production the sub humid drought prone areas are main dry land agricultural production areas in china annual rainfall in this area ranges from 400 to 600 mm which indicates that the area has more water for agriculture compared to the arid areas within china xiaoli et al 2012 however due to the continental monsoon climate 70 of the rainfall within the sub humid drought prone areas is concentrated in june and september annual precipitation in the region is higher than in arid and semi arid areas but the uneven distribution of rainfall has become the main limitation to the sustainable development of agriculture in the sub humid drought prone areas xie et al 2005 bu et al 2013 liu et al 2014a b thus the improved utilization of limited seasonal rainfall resources through reductions in inefficient water consumption and increased water utilization efficiency is urgently needed there are many proven mulching techniques to entrap and conserve rainwater such as plastic film mulch straw mulch and ridge furrow mulch plastic film mulch has proven to be a useful method for increasing grain yields in agricultural areas where irrigation is not available and has been widely utilized for crop growth in dryland areas yan et al 2006 liu et al 2009 mulch provides favorable soil conditions for crop growth that reduces the effects of drought stress and improves water collecting capacity mulch has been shown to reduce the relative rate of evaporation in evapotranspiration in a manner that enhances crop yields and water use efficiency dong et al 2009 bu et al 2013 however a large portion of this plastic is left on the field which have obvious negative effects on the environment and soil structure in terms of water nutrient transport and crop growth that resulted in decreased crop yields briassoulis 2006 liu et al 2014a b straw mulch has also been shown to reduce the needed quantities of chemical fertilizers wang et al 2013 as it helps increase soil organic matter and improves soil structure gami et al 2009 straw mulching is one effective practice that may comprehensively utilize the agricultural wastes and improve soil water conditions zhao et al 2009 zhang et al 2009a b c in addition the application of straw in agriculture will improve the agricultural ecological environment because the need of open field straw burning has been reduced or eliminated the incorporation of straw was beneficial for the improvement of soil nutrients wagner et al 2007 straw mulch was shown to raise the soil temperature in the cold season and reduce soil temperature in the hot season and help keep soil temperature stable chen et al 2007 other researchers have found that straw mulching resulted in frozen wheat seeding conditions that negatively influenced germination especially for relatively cold climate conditions gao et al 2009 ridge and furrow plantings were an efficient way to collect rainfall and promote root growth within northwest china han et al 2004 zhang et al 2007a b ridge furrow planting with film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow can help regulate water availability during critical growth stages improve soil temperatures save water resources and bring increases in crop yields and farmer s income li et al 2013a b therefore ridge and furrow planting with mulches has become a somewhat commonly used practice for farmers within semi arid regions of the loess plateau qin et al 2015 assessed the effects of soil mulch on maize and wheat using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries they demonstrated that soil mulching significantly increased yields wue yield per unit water and nitrogen use efficiency nue yield per unit n of maize and wheat but that the effects of mulching tended to decrease with increased water inputs these types of mulching practices are being rapidly developed and adopted in arid and semi arid areas where rainfall is low unpredictable and infrequent and in areas that typically utilize a crop fallow system of wheat or maize within the sub humid drought prone areas of china these sub humid areas have similar meteorological characteristics to semi arid areas and typically undergo drought stress during the cropping season that results in reduced crop productivity information is limited when using a crop rotation system in the sub humid drought prone regions whether the mulching practice would perform as well as in semi arid regions hence it is our hypothesis that soil mulching in the sub humid drought prone regions that use a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system may increase wue through the highly efficient use of precipitation and improve crop yields in a similar manner that occurs in semi arid regions therefore the present study was conducted for a rainfed wheat maize rotation system within a sub humid drought prone region of china that has similar meteorological characteristics to semi arid areas and typically undergo drought stress during the cropping season we tested four planting patterns 1 flat plot without mulch control treatment ck 2 flat plot with straw mulch sm 3 flat plot

water and soil temperature during the growing season of wheat and maize the volumetric soil moisture contents smc were measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico iph tdr germany li et al 2015 2004 with soil water measurements at 0 1 m intervals within the 0 1 m soil layer and at 0 2 m intervals within the 1 2 m soil layer the soil moisture content profiles were measured once in a week and the probes were placed in the middle of the planting rows an em50 american gene company data logger and soil moisture capacitance probes environmental logging system usa were used to dynamically monitor the soil water and soil temperatures during the growing season of winter wheat and summer maize soil water contents and temperatures were measured hourly at soil depths of 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm with the em50 soil sensors and then averaged as daily values the sensors were installed in the middle of the plant rows in the horizontal position one measurement site was located at the center of each plot to minimize variations caused by the soil profile and soil structure the soil was vertically excavated layer by layer at 10 cm intervals the excavated soil from each layer was separately placed and then backfilled in turn after all sensors were installed the soil water storage was calculated with the following equation 1 w i 1 n w i h i 10 where w mm soil

any of the plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the soil surface so the upward flow into the root zone was considered to be negligible li et al 2013a excess soil moisture conditions were not observed at the experimental field level during the study so the deep percolation was assumed to be insignificant the water use efficiency wue was calculated with the

calculated by a 1 m2 area located within the middle of the plots and the maize yield and biomass were calculated by randomly selecting ten plants in the central portion of each plot 2 3 3 interactions

results of soil water storage shown in fig 2 indicate the mulch treatments generally increased soil water storage particularly within the 0 200 cm soil layer compared with the ck treatment over the two wheat and maize growing seasons the average soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil depth over the two wheat maize cycles in comparison to the ck treatment was 3 82 2 25 and 1 31 higher under the psm pm and sm treatments respectively the psm treatment had the highest values of soil water storage over the two rotation cycles the soil water storage under sm treatment was relatively higher than under the ck treatment over the two rotation cycles but the differences were not significant during the early wheat growth stage seeding jointing stage the average soil water storage within the 0 2 0 m depth over the two rotation cycles was significantly p 0 05 increased in comparison to the ck treatment by 6 70 4 96 and 3 37 under the psm pm and sm treatments respectively during the wheat jointing maturity stage there were no significant differences in the soil water storage among the planting patterns at the time of harvest there were slightly reduced values of soil water storage for all the treatments with the exception of the 2014 summer maize the lack of treatment effects in soil water storage during the 2014 summer maize harvest season was possibly due to the relatively higher precipitation 38 mm in 2013 2014 wheat 24 mm in 2014 2015 maize 211 40 mm in 2014 maize 80 mm in 2015 maize during the grain filling stage after rainfall events the soil water storage under the mulch treatments were generally higher especially for the psm treatment when compared with the no mulch treatment the data showed that precipitation had large impacts on the soil water storage and the highest soil water contents were recorded for the psm treatment in comparison to the pm sm and ck treatments results of the soil water contents swc fig 3 showed that the mulching treatments increased the swc within the 0 80 cm soil profile compared with the ck treatment during the early growing seasons of both wheat and maize during the jointing grain filling stages the swc within 120 160 cm soil profile under the mulching treatments was generally lower in comparison to the ck treatment the swc reductions indicated that under the mulching treatments more water was utilized from the deeper soil layer than under the ck treatment at the maturity stage in maize there were no significant differences in swc between treatments but differences occurred in winter wheat such that the psm treatment having had the highest swc within the 20 60 cm soil depths 3 2 evapotranspiration the trends of evapotranspiration et soil evaporation e and transpiration t among the different planting patterns are illustrated for the two winter wheat and summer maize rotation cycles in fig 4 the soil evaporation e was large during the seeding regreening stages for winter wheat and the seeding stage for summer maize such that there was decreased e with increasing crop canopy the mulch treatments tended to have greater transpiration than the ck treatment during the two wheat maize seasons the mean seasonal transpiration within the psm pm sm and ck treatments accounted for 73 2 69 6 61 9 and 49 1 of the evapotranspiration for winter wheat respectively and 78 3 74 6 70 0 and 57 8 of the evapotranspiration for summer maize respectively the mean evapotranspiration within the psm pm and sm treatments was increased in comparison to the no mulch treatment by 19 92 14 34 and 11 39 mm respectively there were no differences in evapotranspiration between the pm and sm treatments over the two cropping cycles the et of the ck treatment was significantly higher compared with the mulching practices during the early growth periods i e wheat and maize seeding stages fig 4 and was attributed to the soil almost remaining bare for the ck treatment and soil evaporation from a bare soil surface would be expected to dominate the et the psm treatment had the most significant effects on reducing the e in comparison to the ck treatment with reductions of 20 23 mm and 37 15 mm in the mean soil evaporation during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter wheat seeding stages respectively and by 19 36 mm and 28 19 mm during the 2014 and 2015 summer maize seeding stages respectively with the growth of crops higher et values were observed for the mulch treatments due to the greater transpiration the evapotranspiration at the jointing stage for wheat and maize were significantly greater for the mulch treatments in comparison to the ck treatment the mulch and control treatments displayed reduced values of et during the maturity stage for both wheat and maize since there were reductions in crop transpiration use during the maturity stage 3 3 soil temperatures the dynamic changes of the soil temperatures within the upper 15 cm soil depth during the growth periods present similar patterns for the different mulch treatments in the winter wheat and summer maize of both crop growth years fig 5 the soil temperatures were significantly influenced by daily air temperatures and varied in similar patterns among the different mulch treatments figs 1 and 5 when compared with the ck treatment the soil temperatures were increased by an average of 1 23 c under the pm treatment and was reduced by a mean of 0 43 c and 1 02 c under the psm and sm treatments respectively during the two wheat maize growth seasons the mulch treatments displayed higher soil temperatures than the ck treatment during the 0 100 days after sowing for winter wheat during the mid to late growth periods of winter wheat relatively higher soil temperatures were displayed under the ck treatment compared with the mulch planting treatments during the entire summer maize growth season the soil temperatures for each of the treatments presented the following trend pm ck psm sm it was generally concluded that the effects of the mulch treatments on the soil temperatures decreased with increased summer maize growing diurnal changes of soil temperature at the stages of seeding and grain filling in the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons are shown in fig 6 the patterns of diurnal soil temperature change were similar for both the seeding and grain filling stages of wheat and maize however the amplitude of the variations in soil temperatures were greater during the seeding stage compared with the variations that occurred during the grain filling stage irrespective of whether the seeding stage or grain filling stage except for the wheat grain filling stage the pm treatment exhibited the greatest amplitudes in diurnal variations of soil temperatures followed by ck psm and sm the diurnal changes of soil temperatures at the wheat grain filling stage for each of the procedures presented the following trend ck pm psm sm these differences may be attributed to the crop canopy being smaller under the ck treatment during the wheat grain filling stage compared with the mulched treatments which allowed more solar radiation to intercept the ground surface during the seeding stage the amplitude of the soil temperature variations under the psm pm sm and ck treatments were 2 9 6 7 1 5 and 5 6 c during the wheat growing season respectively and 1 3 4 1 1 1 and 3 7 c during the maize growing season respectively during the grain filling stage the amplitude of the soil temperature variations under the psm pm sm and ck treatments were 1 1 1 4 0 9 and 1 7 c during the wheat growing season respectively and 1 6 2 9 1 2 and 2 3 c during the maize growing season respectively 3 4 wheat and maize biomass the dynamic process of aboveground biomass accumulation for the wheat and maize crops are presented in fig 7 the biomass production kg ha 1 increased gradually for all mulching treatments during the two wheat maize growth seasons and reached maximum values at the crop maturity stages the biomass accumulation over the two growth seasons was higher under the psm treatment with a trend that was followed by the pm sm and ck treatments especially during the late growth stages during jointing i e 160 days after sowing to the maturity stage of the wheat growth season during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 seasons the biomass accumulation significantly increased in comparison to the control treatment by 34 3 53 1 and 51 1 78 1 for the psm treatment respectively by 32 1 45 3 and 41 6 84 5 for the pm treatment respectively and by 14 6 24 2 and 16 9 24 3 for the sm treatment respectively there were no significant differences in biomass accumulation between the psm and pm treatments during either wheat growth season during tasseling 50 days after sowing to the maturity stages of maize growth seasons in 2014 and 2015 the biomass accumulation significantly increased in comparison to the control treatment by 44 0 75 8 and 72 6 74 5 with the psm treatment respectively by 31 0 48 6 and 46 4 60 6 with the pm treatment respectively and by 21 8 47 2 and 35 7 68 0 with the sm treatment respectively 3 5 grain yields and wue the grain yields of winter wheat were significantly influenced by the different mulch treatments for the two growth seasons table 4 the two year mean wheat yields for each of the treatments followed the trend psm pm sm ck the wheat yields under the psm pm and sm treatments were significantly increased in comparison to the control treatment during 2013 2014 by 26 5 19 7 and 8 0 respectively and in 2014 2015 by 51 8 42 4 and 42 3 respectively there were no significant differences in wheat crop yields between the psm and pm treatments the sm treatment yield value was not significantly different from the ck treatment value during the 2013 2014 winter wheat growing season similarly the two year mean wheat aboveground biomass yield was highest under the psm treatment and the lowest under the ck treatment the psm and pm treatments displayed statistically increased biomass in comparison to the biomass production for the ck treatment there were no significant differences in mean biomass production between the sm and ck practices p 0 05 the value of et under the mulching treatments were higher than under the ck treatment during the two year winter wheat growth seasons table 4 and seemed to be in agreement with the higher biomass production and yields for the mulching treatments however there were no significant differences in et between the mulching treatments and the ck treatment for the 2014 2015 growth season during the winter wheat growth seasons the values of wue were significantly increased under the mulching treatments when compared to the wue values for the ck treatment the values of wue under the psm pm and sm treatments compared to the wue values under the ck treatment were increased in the 2013 2014 wheat growth season by 19 6 11 7 and 1 4 respectively and in the 2014 2015 wheat growth season by 49 9 36 0 and 40 0 respectively table 4 the wue value under the sm treatment was not significantly different from the wue value under the ck treatment during the 2013 2014 wheat growth season in addition the wue values for any of the mulching treatments were not significantly different from each other within the 2013 2014 wheat growth season table 4 the psm pm and sm treatments significantly increased the 2014 and 2015 maize grain yields in comparison to the ck treatment by 75 2 65 1 and 59 6 respectively and 49 1 40 2 and 28 9 respectively table 5 the grain yields under the mulching treatments were not significantly different from each other during the two seasons the total annual dry biomass of the maize crop increased in comparison to values for the ck treatment dramatically by 44 0 31 0 and 37 1 during 2014 and by 72 6 60 6 and 37 1 during 2015 for the psm pm and sm treatments respectively however the biomass yields between the psm pm and sm treatments were not statistically different in 2014 p 0 05 the two year summer maize et was the highest under the psm treatment and was the lowest under the ck treatment table 5 the two year summer maize et value for each growth period was not significantly different the psm pm and sm treatments significantly increased the maize wue in comparison to the ck treatment with increased values of 67 6 61 6 and 55 8 in 2014 respectively and 42 1 37 5 and 27 0 in 2015 respectively table 5 the wue values under the mulching treatments were not significantly different from each other for the two maize growth seasons 3 6 interactions between soil water and temperature in yield and wue results of the statistical analysis of the effects of mulching on soil water and temperature and their interactions during the wheat maize growing season on yield are summarized in table 6 all the mulching treatments had significant and positive effects on wheat and maize yields wheat and maize yields were positively related to soil water content but not related to soil temperature the interactions between soil water and temperature were not significant in the analysis of the wheat and maize yields the wue of wheat and maize was not significantly related to the soil water content and temperature and the interactive effects were also not found to be significant table 7 the wue of wheat and maize was significantly and positively related to mulching treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulch on soil water most of the precipitation occurs in the form of low intensity precipitation events within the semi humid drought prone areas of china the precipitation quantities delivered in this manner cannot satisfy the normal growth of crops and a smaller quantity of rainfall occurs as intensive rainstorm events that usually cause surface runoff chen et al 2015 the soil surface mulch practices e g ridge furrow mulch plastic film mulch and straw mulch may reduce the evaporation losses from the soil surface it is very important to improve the conditions of soil moisture and the thermal regime in dry land agriculture kouwenhoven et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 in our study the mulch treatments significantly increased the 0 200 cm soil water storage during the early crop growing stages fig 2 the psm pm and sm treatments significantly increased the average 0 200 cm soil water storage in comparison to the ck treatment by 39 5 35 8 and 19 7 cm during the two year wheat early growth stage i e seeding regreening respectively and by 54 6 35 9 and 32 5 cm during the two year maize early growth stage i e seeding respectively it has been reported for a similar study in a dryland region with a semi arid climate that more soil water was lost from the ck practice because of intense soil surface evaporation by direct solar radiation in the early growth seasons bu et al 2013 mulch treatments have been shown to collect rainfall into the soil reduce soil surface evaporation and increase soil moisture within the soil profile li et al 2013a b during the jointing maturity stages there were no significant differences in the soil water storage between the mulching treatments and the non mulch treatments our study indicated that mulching treatments increased the swc within the 0 80 cm soil profile compared with the ck treatment in the early growing season of wheat and maize fig 3 in the jointing grain filling stages however the swc within the 120 160 cm soil profile under the mulching treatments were generally lower than under ck treatment the soil water storage for the ck treatment was even higher when compared with the mulching treatments at specific crop growth stages such as during the 2013 2014 wheat jointing stage the 2014 2015 wheat grain filling stage and the 2014 maize tasseling stage fig 2 these results were similar to the results reported by xiaoli et al 2012 and li et al 2016 within the same area the differences in their study were primarily attributable to the early establishment period of the winter wheat and summer maize that caused a stronger transpiration from the crop canopy and more water consumption from the soil layer for the mulching treatments in comparison to the ck treatment li et al 2004 all the mulching treatments would be expected to increase the value of soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil layer during the wheat and maize early growth stages however the mulching treatments caused differences in soil water storage the current study indicated that the psm treatment showed the most significant impacts on soil water storage followed by pm and sm treatments some explanations for that result are that i the sm treatment conserved soil water and reduced soil evaporation but the effects were less than the values for the psm and pm treatments ii the pm treatment may help conserve rainfall but some water might have evaporated directly from the flat surface of the plastic film so that only minimal amounts of water reached the crop roots when frequent but small rainfall events occurred during the crop growth stages zhao et al 2009 and iii the psm treatment increased soil moisture contents by the accumulation of water from light precipitation events and preserved excess water from intense rainfall events jia et al 2006 han et al 2004 demonstrated that the psm treatment was better in a semi arid climate for the utilization of water from minimal rainfall events and that utilization was the critical reason the psm treatment maximized the soil water resources in comparison to soil under conventional flat planting for all crop growing seasons thus the psm treatment may have helped decrease the consumption of groundwater by providing improved utilization of limited precipitation and may have helped resolve the water scarcity problem that limits sustainable agriculture production within the region 4 2 effects of mulch on soil water evapotranspiration within the rainfed agricultural regions it is essential to reduce the water loss caused by evaporation to improve the soil moisture conditions liu et al 2016 evapotranspiration and its components evaporation and transpiration are significant basic terms of the water balance in these ecosystems wang et al 2015 ding et al 2013 previous studies have shown that mulching treatments may effectively restrain soil evaporation promote less stressful plant transpiration and may help preserve water resources by improved water use the conservation of water is an important process to help facilitate crop vegetative and reproductive growth fang et al 2009 zhu et al 2000 in our study the mulching treatments displayed different impacts on water consumption during the wheat and maize growth seasons fig 4 when compared with the ck treatment the et of the mulching treatments were similar during the wheat and maize early growth stages and became more significant in wheat and maize during the mid to late growth stages during the seeding stages the ck treatment did not effectively harvest the rainfall but allowed rapid evaporation of the soil moisture from the bare soil surface while the mulching treatments reduced soil evaporation by providing increased soil surface cover over time in consideration of an increased crop growth canopy the soil evaporation might be continuously decreased and its contribution to et losses accordingly decreased the plant transpiration would be increased with the flourish of the plant canopy fig 4 the mulching treatments displayed a more significant crop canopy than the ck treatment as implicated by the more significant biomass fig 7 which would have resulted in increased et during the wheat and maize mid to late growth stages during the maturity stage the et of the mulching treatments was lower than the ck treatment because of the expedited crop development under the mulching treatments especially under the psm treatment these et values were also likely affected by the temporal distribution of rainfall huang et al 2003 showed that if there were a relative quantity of precipitation that occurred during the wheat and maize growth stages the soil evaporation would correspondingly be increased under the control treatment and decreased under the mulch treatments because of the soil surface cover provided by the mulch this phenomenon proved the implication that the et of the ck treatment was higher during periods with precipitation that occurred during the wheat heading stage in 2013 2014 the maize grain filling stage in 2014 and the maize grain tasseling stage in 2015 fig 4 4 3 effects of mulch on soil temperature the results of each mulching treatment on the soil temperature were different between the winter wheat and summer maize fig 5 at the early growth stage of wheat 0 100 days after seeding the influence on soil temperature followed the trend of pm psm sm ck treatments whereas at the later growth stage the effects on soil temperature followed the trend of ck pm psm sm treatments these patterns indicated that the mulching treatments increased the soil temperatures from the seeding to regreening stages for winter wheat these results agreed with the reports of zhang et al 2009a b c and li et al 2016 who also indicated that soil temperatures under mulching treatments were higher when the weather was colder and were lower when the weather was warmer compared with a conventional flat planting there are several explanations that help explain these results i during the early cooler periods the crop canopy was small under the mulching treatments which allowed the majority of the cover material to collect solar radiation and the surface soil temperature to rise more rapidly gao et al 2009 gan et al 2013 it has been suggested that the topsoil was insulated by straw mulching when the weather was colder wang et al 2015 the soil temperature under the psm treatment was lower in comparison with the pm treatment and higher in contrast with the sm treatment and was perhaps due to the interaction of the plastic film mulching and straw mulching chen et al 2015 ii during the warm period the mulching treatments and shading from the increased crop canopy effectively reduced large quantities of solar radiation that reached the ground surface therefore the lower soil temperatures under the mulching treatments were recorded which also agreed with the conclusions of gan et al 2013 nevertheless during the summer maize growth periods the mulching treatment effects on soil temperature followed the treatment trend of pm ck psm sm the plastic film mulching treatment raised the soil temperature by blocking the sensible heat exchange between the surface soil and air during the majority of the crop growth stage liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013 therefore the highest soil temperatures were observed under the pm treatment the lowest soil temperatures were observed under the sm treatments throughout the entire summer maize growth period it has been shown that straw mulch on the soil surface forms a physical barrier that could block the solar radiation and prevent water and heat exchange between the soil and atmosphere thereby decreasing soil temperature during summer maize growth seasons kar and kumar 2007 similarly there seemed to be interactions between the plastic film and straw mulch as the soil temperature under the psm treatment was lower when compared with the pm treatment and was higher when compared with the sm treatment the pattern of diurnal soil temperature changes was similar for both the seeding and grain filling stages of wheat and maize however the amplitude of the soil temperature variations was greater during the seeding stage compared with variations during the grain filling stage fig 6 it has been shown that the mulching treatments had greater effects on soil temperature when the crop canopy was small so the wheat maize yields and wue were not significantly related to the mean soil temperatures of the entire growth season moreover li et al 2013a b found that the soil temperature at depths of 5 25 cm under the dual mulching of ridges with plastic film and furrows with straw was always lower than that under single mulching with plastic film the pm treatment exhibited the greatest amplitude in diurnal soil temperature variations followed by the ck psm and sm treatments except during the wheat grain filling stage we came to a similar conclusion in this study that compared with plastic film mulching straw mulching on furrows could reduce the diurnal soil temperature variations the psm treatment could increase the soil temperature during the over wintering regreening stages for winter wheat and effectively inhibited the excessive temperature rise during the growth stage for summer maize thereby improving crop growth and yields 4 4 effects of mulch on crop growth and yield the aboveground biomass accumulation seemed to be the most closely associated with soil water and soil temperature conditions during the different crop growth stages liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2009a b c zhang et al 2017a b these stages have been shown to be correlated with evaporation interception moisture infiltration and sunlight capture and conversion payero et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2010 the mulching treatments likely enhanced the accumulation of biomass by improving the soil water and heat status to accelerate crop growth under the mulching treatments in such a manner that would result in more rapid crop development ma et al 2008 during our study the mulching treatments brought higher aboveground crop growth during the different crop growth stages in comparison to the ck treatment with the highest values under the psm treatment followed by the pm and sm treatments fig 7 these differences were thought to be primarily because the soil water and soil temperatures were lower under the sm treatment than under the psm and pm treatments during the early crop growth stages this delay was thought to have restricted the crop growth that occurred during the middle and late stages there were no significant differences between the psm and pm treatments during the entire wheat growing season which may be attributed to the similar soil water fig 2 and soil temperature status fig 5 the mulching treatments in our study insignificantly affected the total plant et in comparison to the no mulching treatments but the mulching treatments seemed to have effectively reduced soil surface evaporation and increased effective crop transpiration ding et al 2018 these differences significantly accelerated the growth of the crop canopy and resulted in the significantly increased aboveground biomass values that are displayed in tables 4 and 5 oweis and hachum 2006 reported similar research findings in studies with both maize and wheat the rainfall during the first wheat maize rotation cycle 683 5 mm was more than the rainfall which occurred during the second cycle 526 9 mm but the yields were less for the second cycle than the yields for the first cycle for almost all the treatments listed in tables 4 and 5 a probable reason for these yield differences may be that the rainfall distribution pattern was uneven during the first cycle and waterlogging stress may have occurred at various crop growth stages zang et al 2017a b please note that one third of the precipitation occurred during the 2013 2014 winter wheat heading stage and that more than a half of the precipitation happened in 2014 during the summer maize grain filling stage the crop was evidently not able to sufficiently use the rainfall during the grain filling stage it has been reported for a similar study in a semi arid region that more than normal amounts of precipitation were lost through evaporation and that the excessive rainfall may have caused waterlogging stress on crops tan et al 2010 in addition there were also periods of severe short term droughts and higher temperatures during the 2014 summer maize early growth stage all of these factors may have led to a decrease in crop yields additional mulch in crop furrows has been shown to increase the maize yields by approximately 20 within the semi arid area of the loess plateau li et al 2001 qin et al 2015 assessed the effects of soil mulch on maize and wheat using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries they demonstrated that straw mulching increased mean wheat and maize yields by 20 within arid and semi arid areas plastic mulching increased mean wheat yields by 15 and mean maize yields by 60 within arid and semi arid areas over the two years of our study the mean wheat yields and wue increased in comparison to the control by 39 15 and 34 7 under the psm treatment respectively by 31 0 and 23 9 under the pm treatment respectively and by 25 2 and 20 7 under the sm treatment respectively tables 4 and 5 over the two years of our study the mean maize yield and wue increased in comparison to the control by 62 2 and 54 9 under the psm treatment respecitively by 52 7 and 49 6 under the pm treatment respectively and by 44 3 and 41 4 under the sm treatment respectively therefore it is consistent with our hypothesis that soil mulching within the sub humid drought prone regions that use a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system increased the wue through the highly efficient utilization of precipitation that resulted in improved crop yields in the same manner as has been observed for semi arid regions the highest grain yields and wue occurred for the psm treatment over the two wheat maize rotation systems although soil water consumption characteristics under the psm treatment in our experiment were similar to the pm and sm treatments the crop yields under the psm treatment were increased in comparison to crop yields under the pm and sm treatments over the two wheat and maize crop growth seasons the psm treatment may result in increased soil water by reducing soil evaporation and accumulating light rain to infiltrate into the deep soil layers zhang et al 2007a b which may offer moisture necessary for key growth stages of the crop li et al 2004 the psm treatment in our study had more favorable soil temperature conditions which could help avoid freezing during the over wintering stage for the winter wheat and help abate the high temperatures that potentially cause crop damage during the summer maize growth season wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a b the psm treatment promoted crop growth and achieved better crop growth targets that affected both biomass and grain yields the water use efficiency wue helps explain factors which affect crop yield and evapotranspiration liu and siddique 2015 zhang et al 2008a b reported that the mulching treatments were a useful means of increasing the wue hu et al 2014 noted that the psm treatment significantly increased the utilization rate of rainfall improved soil moisture and increased the wue attributes corresponding to a reduced evapotranspiration rate this observation is consistent with the results of our study given the fact that although the et was similar for all the mulching treatments for the two years of both wheat and maize growth the wue under the psm treatment was higher as influenced by the higher crop yields than the yields observed for the other mulching treatments tables 4 and 5 5 conclusions all mulching treatments had significant and positive effects on wheat and maize yields wheat and maize yields were positively related to soil water content but not with soil temperature the wue of wheat and maize was not significantly related to either soil water content or temperature and the interactive effects were also not significant the beneficial effects of mulching on soil primarily occurred during the sowing to jointing stages of both wheat and maize this benefit was primarily reflected in the fact that mulching may reduce soil evaporation and help regulate soil temperature when the crop canopy is small thus promoting the growth of plants in later growth stages and increasing the crop yields the two years average wheat yields and wue under the mulching treatments increased in comparison to the control treatment by 25 2 39 1 and 20 7 34 1 respectively the two years average maize yields and wue under the mulching treatment increased in comparison to the control treatment by 43 3 62 2 and 41 4 54 9 respectively soil mulching treatments especially the psm treatment utilized in the sub humid drought prone regions that use a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system may increase the wue through the highly efficient use of precipitation and improve crop yields to levels observed in semi arid regions the psm treatment plastic film combined with straw mulch lead to favorable soil water and thermal conditions that effectively improved the grain yields and wue of winter wheat and summer maize therefore we conclude that the use of a ridge furrow planting practice with film mulch over ridge and wheat straw mulch over furrow is an effective crop management system to increase yields and wue for a winter wheat summer maize rotation within this sub humid drought prone area of china acknowledgements we would like to thank national key r d program of china 2017yfc0403600 and
