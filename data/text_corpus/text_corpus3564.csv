17820,time resolved monitoring of bromate and other by products formed into effluents treated with ozone or advanced oxidation processes in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is time consuming and expensive this study examined whether concentrations of bromate formed in wastewater after ozonation in the presence of widely varying bromide levels from ca 0 7 21 2 mg l can be quantified based on measurements of changes in optical properties differential uv absorbance δuva spectral slopes total or regional fluorescence of the ozonated samples batch ozonation was carried out using a secondary effluent produced at a major wastewater treatment plant located in the metropolitan seattle area the tests involved raw and bromide spiked samples treated with ozone doses from 0 1 to 1 mg o3 mg doc measurements of the absorbance at 254 nm uva254 fluorescence and bromate concentrations were performed on the treated samples in the ozonated wastewater the concentration of bromate increased approximately linearly from 10 ppb to ca 200 ppb without showing the lag phase characteristic for lower ozone doses 0 4 mg o3 mg doc that was observed in previous studies carried out with concentrations of bromide in the range of 0 05 0 5 mg l the highest bromide concentrations used in this study 10 mg l tended to inhibit the generation of bromate relative reduction of uva254 and total fluorescence tf were found to be good predictors of bromate generation specifically exponential curves could adequately fit the non linear relationships found to exist between the concentrations of bromate and the relative reductions of the uv254 and tf for any initial bromide concentrations used in this study little formation of bromate was found to occur for reduction ranges for uva254 and tf of 30 40 and 70 80 respectively conversely rapid increases in bromate generation were observed when the decrease of uva254 or tf exceeded these threshold values graphical abstract image 1 keywords

coliform and virus inactivation in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps rice et al 1981 in recent years ozonation of wastewater has gained increasing attention in the context of upgrading wwtps to include tertiary treatments this interest is in large extent due to the capacity of ozone to oxidize recalcitrant endocrine disruptors pharmaceuticals and personal care products edc ppcp as well as the predominant organic substrate operationally referred to as effluent organic matter efom zimmermann et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 efom properties tend to differ from those of dissolved organic matter dom found in natural aquatic systems maizel and remucal 2017 due to the notable presence in efom of soluble microbial products smps and related biologically produced compounds municipal wastewaters also contain multiple edc ppcps and disinfection by products shon et al 2006 chen et al 2017 the oxidation of edc ppcps by ozone tends to result in the formation of their transformation products that in many albeit not all cases have reduced biological response than the parent compounds wert et al 2007 dodd et al 2009 in addition to edc ppcp oxidation products ozonation can generate other undesired species wu et al 2019 notably bromate which is a known human carcinogen whose maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water has been set at 10 μg l in the united states and europe bromate is produced during ozonation through a multistep process involving the oxidation of bromide br ensuing generation of hypobromous acid and bromite and their reactions with ozone von gunten and oliveras 1998 von gunten 2003 fischbacher et al 2015 yao et al 2017 yang et al 2019 bromide is present in all water sources at concentrations from 10 to 1000 μg l in fresh waters and approximately 67 mg l in seawater fabbricino and korshin 2009 ikehata et al 2013 heeb et al 2014 wang et al 2017 in recent years the salinization of groundwater in several regions of the world has caused total dissolved solids tds or chloride concentrations to approach or exceed the u s epa s secondary maximum contaminant levels mcls of 500 mg l and 250 mg l with consequent increases of bromide concentrations up to 10 mg l szczuka et al 2017 in wastewater the bromide levels in the treated effluent may be much higher in areas where seawater rather than surface water is used for toilet flushing yang et al 2005 sun et al 2009 yang et al 2005 used a fresh water nitrified secondary effluent a saline nitrified secondary effluent and a saline chemically enhanced primary treatment cept effluent with bromide concentrations of 0 96 22 0 and 31 5 mg l respectively to study the formation of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas from the breakpoint chlorination to pursue the same aim sun et al 2009 doped two non disinfected wastewater samples with no or low natural bromide 0 14 mg l with five bromide concentrations from zero to 12 8 mg l wastewater effluents associated with produced water from both conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction activities can be a source of high bromide concentrations up to 1000 mg l because their origin is from highly evaporated paleoseawater wilson and vanbriesen 2012 ferrar et al 2013 warner et al 2013 these wastewaters are often referred to as brines hladik et al 2014 frequent monitoring of the degradation of individual edc ppcp and formation of bromate and other toxic by products is time consuming and expensive to address this difficulty prior research has examined the performance of surrogate parameters such as differential uv absorbance δuva and differential total fluorescence δtf in the monitoring of the quality of ozonated wastewaters gerrity et al 2012 these options have been implemented in practice for instance the california department of public health cdph published in 2014 a revised draft regulation on groundwater replenishment with recycled water this regulation requires that at least one surrogate indicator be continuously monitored to evaluate the efficiency of advanced oxidation processes cdph 2014 several studies have investigated relationships between the change in uv absorbance and or total fluorescence and the efficiency in removal of micropollutants during ozone based wastewater treatment li et al 2016a b liu et al 2012a b 2015 2016 song et al 2017 wert et al 2009 or other advanced oxidation processes dickenson et al 2009 li et al 2013 these studies have been performed for lab pilot and full scale conditions to the best of our knowledge only a limited number of prior studies have examined the correlations between changes of the optical properties of wastewater and formation of bromate dickenson et al 2009 had demonstrated that the formation of bromate during ozonation of wastewater effluents is proportional to the relative reduction of uva254 chon et al 2015 investigated the performance of surrogate indicators i e the relative residual uva254 or electron donating capacity edc in assessing the efficiency of ozonation of wastewater effluents related to changes in dom abatement of micropollutants and formation of bromate ross et al 2016 found an empirical correlation between the normalized differential spectra that is the differential spectra divided by the influent spectrum at the wavelengths of 250 and 270 nm and bromate formed during ozonation by using samples of wastewater effluent and surface water li et al 2017 and wu et al 2018 demonstrated that measurements of uva280 and humic like fluorescence could be used as alternatives or a complementary approach to conventional methods to monitor the formation of bromate as detailed in table s1 most of the above mentioned studies considered samples of wastewater effluent or freshwater containing bromide concentrations of less than 100 μg l the samples with the highest bromide concentrations were used for the study of li et al 2017 where the secondary municipal wastewater effluents had bromide concentrations from 200 to 300 μg l there is still information concerning the extent of bromate generation and the relative response of spectroscopic parameters notably uva254 spectral slopes and tf when higher bromide concentrations i e 1 mg l were present in the waters subjected to ozonation in this study batch ozonation tests of a secondary wastewater effluent were carried out to determine yields of bromate that is the relative bromate concentration normalized to initial bromide at varying ozone doses and bromide concentrations that were varied from 1 to 20 mg l correlations between the formation of bromate and simultaneous changes of spectroscopic surrogate parameters for instance the reduction in uva254 increase of spectral slopes and reduction in tf were used to assess their potential for efficient bromate control excitation emission matrixes eem of ozonated water were also examined with the aim to establish correlations between the generation of bromate and ozonation induced changes in the fluorescence of efom the outcomes of this study are expected to provide fundamental information needed for the practical application of spectroscopic indicators as feedback signals that can be employed for the a fast and inexpensive control of ozonation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and chemicals a sample of secondary municipal wastewater effluent before disinfection was collected from a local wwtp in seattle wa usa this plant uses high rate oxygen activated sludge technology without denitrification li et al 2017 the collected wastewater was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter immediately after it was transported to the research laboratory selected characteristics of the wastewater are presented in table 1 the filtered wastewater sample was kept refrigerated at 4 c and used within one week of sample collection sodium bromide nabr 99 used to spike the wastewater and sodium bromate nabro3 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich the ultrapure water 18 2 mω used in the experiment was produced by a milliq system millipore usa 2 2 ozonation experiments ozone was produced with a generator in usa ac 2025 norwood ma usa fed with pure oxygen gas ozone stock solution was prepared by sparging an ozone oxygen gas mixture through a diffuser placed at the bottom of a pre cleaned glass container filled with milliq water and cooled to 0 c oxygen flow and voltage settings of the ozone generator were optimized to obtain a 30 mg l steady state concentration of ozone in the stock solution the concentration of ozone in the stock solution and in ozonated samples was determined using the standard indigo colorimetric method 4500 o3 bader and hoigne 1982 potassium indigo trisulfonate and all other needed reagents were acs grade and purchased from sigma aldrich ozonation batch tests were carried out in 200 ml flasks requisite amounts of ozone stock solution were added to a 75 ml wastewater sample to achieve initial ozone concentrations of 0 1 2 3 5 7 5 and 10 mg o3 l the detailed procedure of sample preparation is described in the supplementary material the above mentioned ozone concentrations corresponded to specific ozone doses of 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 75 and 1 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc doc units were used henceforth as a measure of efom concentration and weight ratios of ozone dose vs efom concentration ozonation tests were carried out using samples of the wastewater without any additional bromide br concentration 0 69 mg l after dilution and those spiked with nabr to obtain final br concentrations of 1 72 2 85 5 29 10 8 and 21 2 mg l after a 20 min contact time residual ozone was below detection 1 μg l for all specific ozone doses and br concentrations for this reason no quenching with na2so3 to stop the reaction was done the samples were subsequently processed to determine their absorbance fluorescence ammonium and nitrate nitrogen and bromate 2 3 analytical methods absorbance spectra were measured with a perkinelmer lambda 18 spectrophotometer and 1 cm quartz cells fluorescence spectra were measured using an aqualog horiba fluorescence spectrophotometer the range of excitation wavelengths was 220 450 nm and that of emission was 245 827 nm fluorescence data were acquired with a 2 nm interval for both excitation and emission wavelengths similarly to prior studies e g anumol et al 2015 li et al 2017 the eems of the samples were automatically corrected for raman scattering by subtracting the eem of the water blank from the eem of any wastewater sample inner filter effects were corrected using the instrument s software that utilized applicable absorbance data integration of eems was carried out according to prior publications gerrity et al 2012 sgroi et al 2017a b to calculate the total fluorescence tf intensities in arbitrary fluorescence units for each sample analyses for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were carried out using an aa3 nitrogen analyzer bromide concentrations were determined by means of ic icpms using a perkinelmer series 200 hplc coupled with a perkinelmer sciex elan drc e icp ms spectrometer these analyses were done according to a prior method shi and adams 2009 bromate analysis was performed using an applied biosystems 4000 q trap liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system lc ms ms equipped with a guard column thermo scientific dionex ionpac tm a16 rfic 2 50 mm and a chromatographic column thermo scientific dionex ionpac tm as16 rfic 2 250 mm a binary eluent consisting of acetonitrile at a 0 2 ml min flow rate a and 1 n methylamine in water at 0 05 ml min flow rate b was used an injection volume of 25 μl was used the analyte only bromate was quantified using the multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ozonation on absorbance spectra of wastewater samples in accord with prior research rakness 2005 wert et al 2009 the instantaneous ozone demand iod was defined as the difference between the concentration of dissolved ozone at time zero and that found after 30 s of exposure relevant measurements showed that for the samples treated with specific ozone doses of 0 2 0 6 and 1 mg o3 mg doc the ozone that remained in the solution after a 30 s contact time was 0 0146 1 42 and 3 26 mg l respectively corresponding to iod values of 2 0 4 5 and 6 8 mg l these iod values were similar to those reported in prior literature wert et al 2009 ozonation did not have an appreciable effect on the oxidation of ammonia nh4 to nitrate no3 and the difference between the concentrations of nh4 and no3 before and after ozone exposure were below than the experimental error 2 measurements of the absorbance of ozonated wastewater and calculations of the corresponding differential absorbance spectra defined as the difference between the absorbance of a sample treated with ozone and that of the corresponding untreated sample showed that ozonation caused a monotonic decrease of efom absorbance at all wavelengths fig 1 as observed in previous research chon et al 2015 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 uva254 has been used as a surrogate of the aromaticity of nom and efom pi et al 2005 wert et al 2009 fig s1 reports the differential uva254 as a function of bromide concentration for the ozone doses 0 1 1 mg o3 mg doc used in this study in general the differential uva254 increased with increasing ozone doses however for ozone doses above 0 2 0 3 mg o3 mg doc concentrations of bromide of more than 5 mg l led to lower differential uva254 values this observation was in agreement with the findings of the prior study of xue et al 2008 where additions of bromide in the range of 0 16 7 μm 1 32 mg l were found to lead to lower differential uv absorbance values in the range 250 280 nm after chlorination xue et al 2008 explained the reduction of differential uva with increasing bromide levels by suggesting that the uv absorbing moieties in nom were attacked by both hocl and hobr but hocl was more active in oxidizing nom chromophores in the present study the reduced differential uva254 values could likely be due to reactions between ozone and bromide that result in the consumption of ozone in reactions other than those with efom and ensuing generation of hobr and other bromate precursors fig 2 a shows the relative changes of uva254 defined as δa a0 where a0 is the absorbance of the untreated sample for a given br concentration versus the doses of ozone for each of the bromide concentration used in this study the data demonstrate that the relative residual uva254 values changed quasi linearly for specific ozone doses between 0 1 and 0 5 mg o3 mg doc while for higher specific ozone doses 0 75 and 1 mg o3 mg doc the reduction in uva254 behaved asymptotically to reach the value of ca 50 of the initial value thus increasing bromide concentrations were associated with a reduced degradation of efom chromophores this trend was more evident for specific ozone doses larger than 0 5 mg o3 mg doc the change in the absorbance at the wavelength of 455 nm has been used to quantify the color removal wert et al 2009 fig 2b shows that the ozonation induced changes of color of ozonated wastewater were similar albeit more prominent than to those of uva254 a strong correlation between the removal of color and that of absorbance at 254 nm was observed fig 3 this correlation seemed not to depend on the bromide concentration and had a nearly linear trend following the expression given in 1 color depletion 1432 uva254 depletion 0 094 1 r2 0 97 information obtained from the single wavelength absorbance parameters i e 254 nm or 455 nm can be enhanced through the determination of multi wavelength spectroscopic indicators for instance via measurements of the spectral slopes helms et al 2008 roccaro et al 2015 of wastewater prior to and after its ozonation the slopes of the log transformed absorbance spectra are determined as shown in 2 2 s λ 1 λ 2 d l n a λ d λ λ 1 λ 2 where lna λ is the natural logarithm of efom or nom absorbance at any specific wavelength while λ1 and λ2 define the range of wavelength in which the spectral slope is calculated prior research has shown that the slope of the linear portion of the log transformed absorbance spectra e g that in the range 300 400 nm tended to be inversely proportional to the average molecular weight of the efom or nom found in the sample yan et al 2014 examination of the changes of the spectral slopes determined for a 300 400 nm wavelength range at varying ozone doses and bromide concentrations fig 4 showed two trends first similarly to the behavior of uv254 and color the spectral slope behaved asymptotically for ozone specific doses above 0 5 mg o3 mg doc changing from ca 0 013 nm 1 to above 0 016 nm 1 this is likely to be indicative of the breakdown of efom molecules on the other hand the inhibiting effect of br on the oxidation of organic compounds was associated with lower changes of the spectral slope at increasing bromide concentrations 3 2 bromate formation during ozonation of wastewater containing varying bromide concentrations fig 5 a shows the concentration of bromate in the ozonated samples at specific ozone doses and bromide concentrations the concentration of bromate increased approximately linearly with the specific ozone dose and ranged from 10 ppb to ca 200 ppb table 2 provides a compilation of parameters of linear fits between the concentrations of bromate and the specific ozone dose for each bromide concentration data presented in table 2 and fig 5a show that while the correlation between the specific ozone dose and bromate generation was nearly perfect for bromide concentration up to ca 5 mg l it deviated from linearity for higher br concentrations in fact it can be observed that for the specific ozone doses above 0 5 mg o3 mg doc the generation of bromate in the system with a br concentration of 21 2 mg l largely plateaued in that system the final concentration of bromate was only in the order of 120 ppb that is 25 less of the value found for the same ozone dose in the system with a br concentration of 2 85 mg l molar bromate yield can be defined as the dimensionless ratio of molar bromate concentrations normalized by the initial bromide concentration bro3 br mmol l 1 mmol l 1 the trend in molar bromate yields as a function of the specific ozone dose for each initial bromide concentration is shown in fig 5b in the case of un spiked wastewater with its low bromide concentration the bromate yield was as high as 10 for the highest dose of ozone in comparison bromate yields decreased to below 0 5 for the highest bromide concentrations previous studies chon et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 li et al 2017 wu et al 2018 have demonstrated that the bromate generation in systems containing efom could be described by two phases characterized by their ranges of specific ozone doses a first phase for specific ozone doses 0 25 0 3 mg o3 mg doc was characterized by a negligible bromate formation and a minor effect of the initial bromide concentration for specific ozone doses 0 3 mg o3 mg doc the concentrations of bromate increased almost linearly with increasing specific ozone doses chon et al 2015 however in the study of chon et al 2015 the concentration of bromide had a limited range of variation from 39 to 86 μg l which did not seem to affect the molar bromate yield in the present work the concentrations of bromide were considerably higher than those used in the aforementioned studies chon et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 li et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and ranged in a broader interval from 0 7 to ca 20 mg l fig 5b presents the experimental data demonstrating that the bromate yield could be linearly correlated with the specific ozone dose for each of the considered bromide concentrations consequently bromate yields were concluded to be affected both by the specific ozone dose and bromide concentration to describe the trend of bromate yield as a function of the two above mentioned variables two relations were proposed the first had an exponential form see eq 3 3 b r o 3 o 3 d o c b r a b o 3 d o c n c b r m and the second had a third order polynomial form see eq 4 4 b r o 3 o 3 d o c b r p 00 p 10 o 3 d o c p 01 b r p 11 o 3 d o c b r p 02 b r 2 p 12 o 3 d o c b r 2 p 03 b r 3 best fit coefficients with a 95 confidence bounds were obtained by using matlab software and are reported in the supplementary material section fits of the experimental data with the two analytical functions are shown in figs s2 and s3 respectively following the regression coefficient it was found that the equation in the polynomial form fitted r2 0 92 the experimental data better than the equation in the exponential form r2 0 67 the observed bromate concentrations and molar bromate yields were also correlated with two of the spectroscopic parameters introduced above for instance the decrease of uva254 fig 6 a b and the increase of spectral slopes fig 7 a b figs 6 and 7 show that the relationships between each of the spectroscopic parameters and the concentration of bromate in the ozonated wastewater was clearly non linear the observed non linearity could be attributed to the complex phenomena that involve both the organic substances found in the efom and bromide into the wastewater subjected to ozonation bromide and the fast reacting moieties of the efom such as hydroxyl substituted phenolic functionalities compete for ozone utilization and even if the highly reactive dom moieties are quickly oxidized they could retain some of their uv absorbing properties chon et al 2015 only when the highly reactive dom moieties are partially or completely depleted by the ozone attack the ozone can oxidize bromide to bromate at the same time nom moieties with relatively low reactivity such as unsubstituted aromatic functionalities that are much less affected by ozone continue to contribute to a persistently present residual amount of uva254 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 furthermore molecular ozone and the hydroxyl radicals that are formed as a result of ozone decomposition play different roles in the depletion of the efom and in the process of bromate generation mao et al 2018 for this reason we can argue that the regression between each of the spectroscopic parameters and the concentration of generated bromate was water specific with a strong dependence on the ozone reacting characteristics of the efom fig 6a demonstrates that for a given bromide concentration the formation of bromate during ozonation of the wastewater was proportional to the relative reduction of uva254 as previously observed by dickenson et al 2009 significant bromate concentrations were found starting from values of residual uva254 in the order of 70 however for the same value of uva254 reduction higher bromide concentrations led to higher bromate yields this result was in agreement with the findings of li et al 2017 who noticed that the plots of bro3 vs uva254 diverged into two distinct groups of data for effluents taken from a wwtp with a bromide concentration of 372 5 85 0 μg l and for the sample of freshwater with a bromide concentration of approximately one third 116 1 μg l in the present work bromide concentrations spanned over more than one order of magnitude and each bromide concentration generated a curve that could be adequately fitted with a 95 confidence bounds by an exponential curve described by equation 5 5 bro3 a eb uva254 reduction with 1 12 a 5 44 6 61 b 10 2 and 0 96 r2 0 99 the a parameter that is the bromate concentration for a null uva254 reduction did not show a definite relation with the concentration of bromide conversely the b parameter that describes the rate of bromate concentration increase was well correlated with the bromide concentration the dependence of the relative bromate yields defined as bromate concentration normalized by the initial bromide concentration bro3 br versus the relative residual uva254 fig 6b showed two regions in the relative residual uva254 range of 100 70 molar bromate yield bro3 br mmol l 1 mmol l 1 0 01 was very small for all bromide concentrations even though the variation in bromide concentrations spanned over more than one order of magnitude as discussed above in this region the limited reduction of uva254 was due to the small specific ozone dose applied o3 doc ratio 0 2 0 3 under these conditions the ozone was very quickly consumed with almost no ozone residual concentration available for bromate formation conversely in the relative residual uva254 range of 70 40 the bromate yield appears to be related to the abatement of the relative residual uva254 especially for bromide concentrations below 5 mg l residual uva254 values in the order of 70 40 were observed for specific ozone doses from 0 2 to 0 3 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc in this range of o3 doc ratios the observed trend of bromate formation was in good agreement with the findings of chon et al 2015 that attributed the formation of bromate by the combined action of ozone and hydroxyl radicals to the higher ozone lifetime due to the partially destroyed electron donating dom moieties fig 7a shows that increases of the spectral slope caused by the ozonation of efom were always correlated with the concurrently increasing bromate concentrations but these correlations depended on the initial concentration of bromide fig 7b relates the relative bromate normalized to bromide bro3 br to the spectral slopes determined for the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm it could be observed a trend similar to that found for uva254 reduction with two distinct behaviors for spectral slopes from 0 013 nm 1 to 0 017 nm 1 molar bromate yield showed approximately constant values in the order of 0 01 or less conversely for spectral slopes of more than 0 017 nm 1 this spectroscopic parameter seemed to be moderately well correlated with the molar bromate yield 3 3 relation between fluorescence parameters and bromate generation representative fluorescence eems of the untreated raw sample br 0 693 mg l and of the raw samples treated with 0 1 and 0 5 mg o3 mg doc are shown in figure s4a s4b and s4c respectively the data shown in fig s4a demonstrate the presence of four major characteristic structures the nature of which was attributed in accord with the findings of prior studies li et al 2013 2016a barsotti et al 2016 chen et al 2017 and maxima are listed in table 3 properties of the four structures listed in table 3 differed significantly from each other the first revealed a zone at high intensity that extended between the ex range of 220 230 nm and the em range of 330 360 nm due to its location this structure indicated the presence of protein like species however by analyzing this eem structure with the peak picking method sgroi et al 2017a b it was not possible to locate a definite peak of intensity in emission but only an area of maximum intensity with an amplitude of approximately 30 nm a similar consideration can be done for structure ii that was indicative of the presence of fulvic like species the maximum intensity covered an area of 100 nm around the ex wavelength of 240 nm structures iii and iv were instead more defined for these structures it was possible to identify an almost unique peak in both excitation and emission modes the location of structure iii like structure i was indicative of the presence of protein like species conversely structure iv was indicative of the presence of humic like species ozonation caused a pronounced decrease of the fluorescence intensity of the treated wastewater figs s4b and s4c show this effect on the raw wastewater exposed to 0 1 and 0 5 mg o3 mg doc respectively fig s4c shows that following an ozonation with a 0 5 mg o3 mg doc specific dose it was no longer possible to identify the structures related to the presence of protein like species in contrast the structures associated with fulvic like and humic like fluorophores were still discernible ozonation caused their intensity to decrease and position of the maximum intensity to shift towards higher wavelengths the peak of structure iv table 3 before ozonation was located at ex 330 nm em 430 nm see fig s4a and after ozonation its position was at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 345 nm and 445 nm respectively see fig s4c these observations that are consistent with those reported in prior research li et al 2013 indicated that fulvic like and humic like compounds in efom are comparatively more resistant to oxidation by ozone and ho radicals than protein like smps species tf integration was performed by summing all the intensity values on the rows and the columns of the eem that is by integrating the volume under the whole eem surface as in sgroi et al 2017a b for discrete eem data the parameter tf can be determined as in equation 6 6 t f e x e m i λ e x λ e m δ λ e x δ λ em where δλex is the excitation wavelength interval taken as 2 nm δλem is the emission wavelength interval taken as 2 nm and i λexλem is the fluorescence intensity of each excitation emission wavelength pair fig 8 shows the reduction of tf as a function of the specific dose of ozone as in the case of uva254 and color the reduction of tf plateaus for specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc the maximum reduction of tf was observed for the sample not spiked with br while higher concentrations of bromide decreased the extent of ozone effects on efom fluorophores the fluorescence data were processed to determine their correlations with the generation of bromate fig s5 shows the relationships of the generation of bromate with the reduction in tf while fig 9 presents the normalized molar bromate yields as a function of the relative residual tf fig s5 shows a trend for bromate generation similar to that observed for the correlation with uva254 reduction see fig 6a even in this case the relation between bromate concentration and total fluorescence reduction could be described with a 95 confidence bounds by an exponential curve as in equation 7 7 bro3 a eb ftot reduction with 0 47 a 3 74 4 41 b 6 16 and 0 92 r2 0 99 depending on the initial bromide concentration similarly to the relation found to exist between the uva254 parameters and bromate generation also in this case the a parameter that is the bromate concentration for a null tf reduction did not show a definite relation with the concentration of bromide conversely the b parameter that describes the rate of bromate concentration increase was quite well correlated with the bromide concentration in this case significant bromate concentrations were observed for residual tf in the order of 40 similarly to the trends shown in figs 6b 7b and 9 shows the presence of two distinct regions low molar bromate yields 0 01 could be observed for residual tf up to ca 30 followed by a sharp increase of bromate yield for more pronounced changes of tf in the region with the highest residual tf 80 30 ozone was rapidly consumed by substances responsible of for fluorescence and little residual ozone is left for reaction with br conversely in the second phase most of the substances responsible of fluorescence had been consumed and a higher ozone dose was available for oxidation of bromide to bromate this trend was in agreement with the observations of li et al 2017 4 conclusions this study examined the correlations between changes of optical properties of wastewater treated with ozone and bromate generation in the presence of widely varying initial bromide concentrations that is in the range from ca 0 7 21 2 mg l the major conclusions made based on the reported resulted can be presented as follows the intensity of differential uva254 increased with increasing ozone doses however the compresence of ozone doses above 0 2 0 3 mg o3 mg doc and bromide concentrations above 5 mg l were associated with somewhat lower differential uva254 values this is likely to be caused by the occurrence of reactions between ozone and bromide that decreased the extent of reactions between ozone and efom and at the same time resulted in the generation of hobr and other bromate precursors for specific doses of ozone from 0 1 to 1 mg o3 mg doc the concentration of bromate increased approximately linearly from below 10 ppb to ca 200 ppb without a lag phase in the correspondence of lower ozone doses 0 4 mg o3 mg doc higher bromide concentrations 10 mg l seemed to inhibit the generation of bromate relative reduction in uva254 and tf demonstrated to be good predictors of bromate generation for the entire range of examined bromide concentrations specifically an exponential fitting bro3 a eb uva254 or tf reduction proved to adequately fit 0 92 r2 0 99 the non linear relationships between the concentration of bromate and the relative reduction of the two spectroscopic parameters the b parameter in the model that describes the rate of bromate concentration increase was strongly dependent and positively correlated with the initial bromide concentration it was consistently observed for the same value of uva254 or tf reduction higher initial bromide concentration led to higher bromate generation when the generation of bromate was described based on the relative bromate yields bro3 br molar ratios two distinct regions were observed molar bromate yields of less than 0 01 were found for residual uva254 and tf above 70 and 30 respectively a subsequent sharp increase in the molar bromate yield from 0 01 to 0 1 depending on the bromide concentration was observed for more pronounced changes of uva 254 or tf the generation of bromate was positively correlated with the increase of spectral slopes 300 400 nm but more observations are necessary to identify a robust correlation between the two parameters when the normalized bromate yields were plotted vs the spectral slopes in the range 0 013 0 017 nm 1 they showed approximately constant values in the order of 0 01 conversely for spectral slopes of more than 0 017 nm 1 this spectroscopic parameter seemed to be moderately well correlated with the molar bromate yield the results of this study demonstrate that several spectroscopic parameters notably changes of uv254 spectral slope and tf can provide a feedback signal for a real time estimation of

17820,time resolved monitoring of bromate and other by products formed into effluents treated with ozone or advanced oxidation processes in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is time consuming and expensive this study examined whether concentrations of bromate formed in wastewater after ozonation in the presence of widely varying bromide levels from ca 0 7 21 2 mg l can be quantified based on measurements of changes in optical properties differential uv absorbance δuva spectral slopes total or regional fluorescence of the ozonated samples batch ozonation was carried out using a secondary effluent produced at a major wastewater treatment plant located in the metropolitan seattle area the tests involved raw and bromide spiked samples treated with ozone doses from 0 1 to 1 mg o3 mg doc measurements of the absorbance at 254 nm uva254 fluorescence and bromate concentrations were performed on the treated samples in the ozonated wastewater the concentration of bromate increased approximately linearly from 10 ppb to ca 200 ppb without showing the lag phase characteristic for lower ozone doses 0 4 mg o3 mg doc that was observed in previous studies carried out with concentrations of bromide in the range of 0 05 0 5 mg l the highest bromide concentrations used in this study 10 mg l tended to inhibit the generation of bromate relative reduction of uva254 and total fluorescence tf were found to be good predictors of bromate generation specifically exponential curves could adequately fit the non linear relationships found to exist between the concentrations of bromate and the relative reductions of the uv254 and tf for any initial bromide concentrations used in this study little formation of bromate was found to occur for reduction ranges for uva254 and tf of 30 40 and 70 80 respectively conversely rapid increases in bromate generation were observed when the decrease of uva254 or tf exceeded these threshold values graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromate bromide excitation emission matrix fluorescence ozonation spectral slope uv absorbance wastewater 1 introduction ozonation has been used since the 1970s to meet discharge requirements for coliform and virus inactivation in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps rice et al 1981 in recent years ozonation of wastewater has gained increasing attention in the context of upgrading wwtps to include tertiary treatments this interest is in large extent due to the capacity of ozone to oxidize recalcitrant endocrine disruptors pharmaceuticals and personal care products edc ppcp as well as the predominant organic substrate operationally referred to as effluent organic matter efom zimmermann et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 efom properties tend to differ from those of dissolved organic matter dom found in natural aquatic systems maizel and remucal 2017 due to the notable presence in efom of soluble microbial products smps and related biologically produced compounds municipal wastewaters also contain multiple edc ppcps and disinfection by products shon et al 2006 chen et al 2017 the oxidation of edc ppcps by ozone tends to result in the formation of their transformation products that in many albeit not all cases have reduced biological response than the parent compounds wert et al 2007 dodd et al 2009 in addition to edc ppcp oxidation products ozonation can generate other undesired species wu et al 2019 notably bromate which is a known human carcinogen whose maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water has been set at 10 μg l in the united states and europe bromate is produced during ozonation through a multistep process involving the oxidation of bromide br ensuing generation of hypobromous acid and bromite and their reactions with ozone von gunten and oliveras 1998 von gunten 2003 fischbacher et al 2015 yao et al 2017 yang et al 2019 bromide is present in all water sources at concentrations from 10 to 1000 μg l in fresh waters and approximately 67 mg l in seawater fabbricino and korshin 2009 ikehata et al 2013 heeb et al 2014 wang et al 2017 in recent years the salinization of groundwater in several regions of the world has caused total dissolved solids tds or chloride concentrations to approach or exceed the u s epa s secondary maximum contaminant levels mcls of 500 mg l and 250 mg l with consequent increases of bromide concentrations up to 10 mg l szczuka et al 2017 in wastewater the bromide levels in the treated effluent may be much higher in areas where seawater rather than surface water is used for toilet flushing yang et al 2005 sun et al 2009 yang et al 2005 used a fresh water nitrified secondary effluent a saline nitrified secondary effluent and a saline chemically enhanced primary treatment cept effluent with bromide concentrations of 0 96 22 0 and 31 5 mg l respectively to study the formation of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas from the breakpoint chlorination to pursue the same aim sun et al 2009 doped two non disinfected wastewater samples with no or low natural bromide 0 14 mg l with five bromide concentrations from zero to 12 8 mg l wastewater effluents associated with produced water from both conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction activities can be a source of high bromide concentrations up to 1000 mg l because their origin is from highly evaporated paleoseawater wilson and vanbriesen 2012 ferrar et al 2013 warner et al 2013 these wastewaters are often referred to as brines hladik et al 2014 frequent monitoring of the degradation of individual edc ppcp and formation of bromate and other toxic by products is time consuming and expensive to address this difficulty prior research has examined the performance of surrogate parameters such as differential uv absorbance δuva and differential total fluorescence δtf in the monitoring of the quality of ozonated wastewaters gerrity et al 2012 these options have been implemented in practice for instance the california department of public health cdph published in 2014 a revised draft regulation on groundwater replenishment with recycled water this regulation requires that at least one surrogate indicator be continuously monitored to evaluate the efficiency of advanced oxidation processes cdph 2014 several studies have investigated relationships between the change in uv absorbance and or total fluorescence and the efficiency in removal of micropollutants during ozone based wastewater treatment li et al 2016a b liu et al 2012a b 2015 2016 song et al 2017 wert et al 2009 or other advanced oxidation processes dickenson et al 2009 li et al 2013 these studies have been performed for lab pilot and full scale conditions to the best of our knowledge only a limited number of prior studies have examined the correlations between changes of the optical properties of wastewater and formation of bromate dickenson et al 2009 had demonstrated that the formation of bromate during ozonation of wastewater effluents is proportional to the relative reduction of uva254 chon et al 2015 investigated the performance of surrogate indicators i e the relative residual uva254 or electron donating capacity edc in assessing the efficiency of ozonation of wastewater effluents related to changes in dom abatement of micropollutants and formation of bromate ross et al 2016 found an empirical correlation between the normalized differential spectra that is the differential spectra divided by the influent spectrum at the wavelengths of 250 and 270 nm and bromate formed during ozonation by using samples of wastewater effluent and surface water li et al 2017 and wu et al 2018 demonstrated that measurements of uva280 and humic like fluorescence could be used as alternatives or a complementary approach to conventional methods to monitor the formation of bromate as detailed in table s1 most of the above mentioned studies considered samples of wastewater effluent or freshwater containing bromide concentrations of less than 100 μg l the samples with the highest bromide concentrations were used for the study of li et al 2017 where the secondary municipal wastewater effluents had bromide concentrations from 200 to 300 μg l there is still information concerning the extent of bromate generation and the relative response of spectroscopic parameters notably uva254 spectral slopes and tf when higher bromide concentrations i e 1 mg l were present in the waters subjected to ozonation in this study batch ozonation tests of a secondary wastewater effluent were carried out to determine yields of bromate that is the relative bromate concentration normalized to initial bromide at varying ozone doses and bromide concentrations that were varied from 1 to 20 mg l correlations between the formation of bromate and simultaneous changes of spectroscopic surrogate parameters for instance the reduction in uva254 increase of spectral slopes and reduction in tf were used to assess their potential for efficient bromate control excitation emission matrixes eem of ozonated water were also examined with the aim to establish correlations between the generation of bromate and ozonation induced changes in the fluorescence of efom the outcomes of this study are expected to provide fundamental information needed for the practical application of spectroscopic indicators as feedback signals that can be employed for the a fast and inexpensive control of ozonation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and chemicals a sample of secondary municipal wastewater effluent before disinfection was collected from a local wwtp in seattle wa usa this plant uses high rate oxygen activated sludge technology without denitrification li et al 2017 the collected wastewater was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter immediately after it was transported to the research laboratory selected characteristics of the wastewater are presented in table 1 the filtered wastewater sample was kept refrigerated at 4 c and used within one week of sample collection sodium bromide nabr 99 used to spike the wastewater and sodium bromate nabro3 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich the ultrapure water 18 2 mω used in the experiment was produced by a milliq system millipore usa 2 2 ozonation experiments ozone was produced with a generator in usa ac 2025 norwood ma usa fed with pure oxygen gas ozone stock solution was prepared by sparging an ozone oxygen gas mixture through a diffuser placed at the bottom of a pre cleaned glass container filled with milliq water and cooled to 0 c oxygen flow and voltage settings of the ozone generator were optimized to obtain a 30 mg l steady state concentration of ozone in the stock solution the concentration of ozone in the stock solution and in ozonated samples was determined using the standard indigo colorimetric method 4500 o3 bader and hoigne 1982 potassium indigo trisulfonate and all other needed reagents were acs grade and purchased from sigma aldrich ozonation batch tests were carried out in 200 ml flasks requisite amounts of ozone stock solution were added to a 75 ml wastewater sample to achieve initial ozone concentrations of 0 1 2 3 5 7 5 and 10 mg o3 l the detailed procedure of sample preparation is described in the supplementary material the above mentioned ozone concentrations corresponded to specific ozone doses of 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 75 and 1 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc doc units were used henceforth as a measure of efom concentration and weight ratios of ozone dose vs efom concentration ozonation tests were carried out using samples of the wastewater without any additional bromide br concentration 0 69 mg l after dilution and those spiked with nabr to obtain final br concentrations of 1 72 2 85 5 29 10 8 and 21 2 mg l after a 20 min contact time residual ozone was below detection 1 μg l for all specific ozone doses and br concentrations for this reason no quenching with na2so3 to stop the reaction was done the samples were subsequently processed to determine their absorbance fluorescence ammonium and nitrate nitrogen and bromate 2 3 analytical methods absorbance spectra were measured with a perkinelmer lambda 18 spectrophotometer and 1 cm quartz cells fluorescence spectra were measured using an aqualog horiba fluorescence spectrophotometer the range of excitation wavelengths was 220 450 nm and that of emission was 245 827 nm fluorescence data were acquired with a 2 nm interval for both excitation and emission wavelengths similarly to prior studies e g anumol et al 2015 li et al 2017 the eems of the samples were automatically corrected for raman scattering by subtracting the eem of the water blank from the eem of any wastewater sample inner filter effects were corrected using the instrument s software that utilized applicable absorbance data integration of eems was carried out according to prior publications gerrity et al 2012 sgroi et al 2017a b to calculate the total fluorescence tf intensities in arbitrary fluorescence units for each sample analyses for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were carried out using an aa3 nitrogen analyzer bromide concentrations were determined by means of ic icpms using a perkinelmer series 200 hplc coupled with a perkinelmer sciex elan drc e icp ms spectrometer these analyses were done according to a prior method shi and adams 2009 bromate analysis was performed using an applied biosystems 4000 q trap liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system lc ms ms equipped with a guard column thermo scientific dionex ionpac tm a16 rfic 2 50 mm and a chromatographic column thermo scientific dionex ionpac tm as16 rfic 2 250 mm a binary eluent consisting of acetonitrile at a 0 2 ml min flow rate a and 1 n methylamine in water at 0 05 ml min flow rate b was used an injection volume of 25 μl was used the analyte only bromate was quantified using the multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ozonation on absorbance spectra of wastewater samples in accord with prior research rakness 2005 wert et al 2009 the instantaneous ozone demand iod was defined as the difference between the concentration of dissolved ozone at time zero and that found after 30 s of exposure relevant measurements showed that for the samples treated with specific ozone doses of 0 2 0 6 and 1 mg o3 mg doc the ozone that remained in the solution after a 30 s contact time was 0 0146 1 42 and 3 26 mg l respectively corresponding to iod values of 2 0 4 5 and 6 8 mg l these iod values were similar to those reported in prior literature wert et al 2009 ozonation did not have an appreciable effect on the oxidation of ammonia nh4 to nitrate no3 and the difference between the concentrations of nh4 and no3 before and after ozone exposure were below than the experimental error 2 measurements of the absorbance of ozonated wastewater and calculations of the corresponding differential absorbance spectra defined as the difference between the absorbance of a sample treated with ozone and that of the corresponding untreated sample showed that ozonation caused a monotonic decrease of efom absorbance at all wavelengths fig 1 as observed in previous research chon et al 2015 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 uva254 has been used as a surrogate of the aromaticity of nom and efom pi et al 2005 wert et al 2009 fig s1 reports the differential uva254 as a function of bromide concentration for the ozone doses 0 1 1 mg o3 mg doc used in this study in general the differential uva254 increased with increasing ozone doses however for ozone doses above 0 2 0 3 mg o3 mg doc concentrations of bromide of more than 5 mg l led to lower differential uva254 values this observation was in agreement with the findings of the prior study of xue et al 2008 where additions of bromide in the range of 0 16 7 μm 1 32 mg l were found to lead to lower differential uv absorbance values in the range 250 280 nm after chlorination xue et al 2008 explained the reduction of differential uva with increasing bromide levels by suggesting that the uv absorbing moieties in nom were attacked by both hocl and hobr but hocl was more active in oxidizing nom chromophores in the present study the reduced differential uva254 values could likely be due to reactions between ozone and bromide that result in the consumption of ozone in reactions other than those with efom and ensuing generation of hobr and other bromate precursors fig 2 a shows the relative changes of uva254 defined as δa a0 where a0 is the absorbance of the untreated sample for a given br concentration versus the doses of ozone for each of the bromide concentration used in this study the data demonstrate that the relative residual uva254 values changed quasi linearly for specific ozone doses between 0 1 and 0 5 mg o3 mg doc while for higher specific ozone doses 0 75 and 1 mg o3 mg doc the reduction in uva254 behaved asymptotically to reach the value of ca 50 of the initial value thus increasing bromide concentrations were associated with a reduced degradation of efom chromophores this trend was more evident for specific ozone doses larger than 0 5 mg o3 mg doc the change in the absorbance at the wavelength of 455 nm has been used to quantify the color removal wert et al 2009 fig 2b shows that the ozonation induced changes of color of ozonated wastewater were similar albeit more prominent than to those of uva254 a strong correlation between the removal of color and that of absorbance at 254 nm was observed fig 3 this correlation seemed not to depend on the bromide concentration and had a nearly linear trend following the expression given in 1 color depletion 1432 uva254 depletion 0 094 1 r2 0 97 information obtained from the single wavelength absorbance parameters i e 254 nm or 455 nm can be enhanced through the determination of multi wavelength spectroscopic indicators for instance via measurements of the spectral slopes helms et al 2008 roccaro et al 2015 of wastewater prior to and after its ozonation the slopes of the log transformed absorbance spectra are determined as shown in 2 2 s λ 1 λ 2 d l n a λ d λ λ 1 λ 2 where lna λ is the natural logarithm of efom or nom absorbance at any specific wavelength while λ1 and λ2 define the range of wavelength in which the spectral slope is calculated prior research has shown that the slope of the linear portion of the log transformed absorbance spectra e g that in the range 300 400 nm tended to be inversely proportional to the average molecular weight of the efom or nom found in the sample yan et al 2014 examination of the changes of the spectral slopes determined for a 300 400 nm wavelength range at varying ozone doses and bromide concentrations fig 4 showed two trends first similarly to the behavior of uv254 and color the spectral slope behaved asymptotically for ozone specific doses above 0 5 mg o3 mg doc changing from ca 0 013 nm 1 to above 0 016 nm 1 this is likely to be indicative of the breakdown of efom molecules on the other hand the inhibiting effect of br on the oxidation of organic compounds was associated with lower changes of the spectral slope at increasing bromide concentrations 3 2 bromate formation during ozonation of wastewater containing varying bromide concentrations fig 5 a shows the concentration of bromate in the ozonated samples at specific ozone doses and bromide concentrations the concentration of bromate increased approximately linearly with the specific ozone dose and ranged from 10 ppb to ca 200 ppb table 2 provides a compilation of parameters of linear fits between the concentrations of bromate and the specific ozone dose for each bromide concentration data presented in table 2 and fig 5a show that while the correlation between the specific ozone dose and bromate generation was nearly perfect for bromide concentration up to ca 5 mg l it deviated from linearity for higher br concentrations in fact it can be observed that for the specific ozone doses above 0 5 mg o3 mg doc the generation of bromate in the system with a br concentration of 21 2 mg l largely plateaued in that system the final concentration of bromate was only in the order of 120 ppb that is 25 less of the value found for the same ozone dose in the system with a br concentration of 2 85 mg l molar bromate yield can be defined as the dimensionless ratio of molar bromate concentrations normalized by the initial bromide concentration bro3 br mmol l 1 mmol l 1 the trend in molar bromate yields as a function of the specific ozone dose for each initial bromide concentration is shown in fig 5b in the case of un spiked wastewater with its low bromide concentration the bromate yield was as high as 10 for the highest dose of ozone in comparison bromate yields decreased to below 0 5 for the highest bromide concentrations previous studies chon et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 li et al 2017 wu et al 2018 have demonstrated that the bromate generation in systems containing efom could be described by two phases characterized by their ranges of specific ozone doses a first phase for specific ozone doses 0 25 0 3 mg o3 mg doc was characterized by a negligible bromate formation and a minor effect of the initial bromide concentration for specific ozone doses 0 3 mg o3 mg doc the concentrations of bromate increased almost linearly with increasing specific ozone doses chon et al 2015 however in the study of chon et al 2015 the concentration of bromide had a limited range of variation from 39 to 86 μg l which did not seem to affect the molar bromate yield in the present work the concentrations of bromide were considerably higher than those used in the aforementioned studies chon et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 li et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and ranged in a broader interval from 0 7 to ca 20 mg l fig 5b presents the experimental data demonstrating that the bromate yield could be linearly correlated with the specific ozone dose for each of the considered bromide concentrations consequently bromate yields were concluded to be affected both by the specific ozone dose and bromide concentration to describe the trend of bromate yield as a function of the two above mentioned variables two relations were proposed the first had an exponential form see eq 3 3 b r o 3 o 3 d o c b r a b o 3 d o c n c b r m and the second had a third order polynomial form see eq 4 4 b r o 3 o 3 d o c b r p 00 p 10 o 3 d o c p 01 b r p 11 o 3 d o c b r p 02 b r 2 p 12 o 3 d o c b r 2 p 03 b r 3 best fit coefficients with a 95 confidence bounds were obtained by using matlab software and are reported in the supplementary material section fits of the experimental data with the two analytical functions are shown in figs s2 and s3 respectively following the regression coefficient it was found that the equation in the polynomial form fitted r2 0 92 the experimental data better than the equation in the exponential form r2 0 67 the observed bromate concentrations and molar bromate yields were also correlated with two of the spectroscopic parameters introduced above for instance the decrease of uva254 fig 6 a b and the increase of spectral slopes fig 7 a b figs 6 and 7 show that the relationships between each of the spectroscopic parameters and the concentration of bromate in the ozonated wastewater was clearly non linear the observed non linearity could be attributed to the complex phenomena that involve both the organic substances found in the efom and bromide into the wastewater subjected to ozonation bromide and the fast reacting moieties of the efom such as hydroxyl substituted phenolic functionalities compete for ozone utilization and even if the highly reactive dom moieties are quickly oxidized they could retain some of their uv absorbing properties chon et al 2015 only when the highly reactive dom moieties are partially or completely depleted by the ozone attack the ozone can oxidize bromide to bromate at the same time nom moieties with relatively low reactivity such as unsubstituted aromatic functionalities that are much less affected by ozone continue to contribute to a persistently present residual amount of uva254 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 furthermore molecular ozone and the hydroxyl radicals that are formed as a result of ozone decomposition play different roles in the depletion of the efom and in the process of bromate generation mao et al 2018 for this reason we can argue that the regression between each of the spectroscopic parameters and the concentration of generated bromate was water specific with a strong dependence on the ozone reacting characteristics of the efom fig 6a demonstrates that for a given bromide concentration the formation of bromate during ozonation of the wastewater was proportional to the relative reduction of uva254 as previously observed by dickenson et al 2009 significant bromate concentrations were found starting from values of residual uva254 in the order of 70 however for the same value of uva254 reduction higher bromide concentrations led to higher bromate yields this result was in agreement with the findings of li et al 2017 who noticed that the plots of bro3 vs uva254 diverged into two distinct groups of data for effluents taken from a wwtp with a bromide concentration of 372 5 85 0 μg l and for the sample of freshwater with a bromide concentration of approximately one third 116 1 μg l in the present work bromide concentrations spanned over more than one order of magnitude and each bromide concentration generated a curve that could be adequately fitted with a 95 confidence bounds by an exponential curve described by equation 5 5 bro3 a eb uva254 reduction with 1 12 a 5 44 6 61 b 10 2 and 0 96 r2 0 99 the a parameter that is the bromate concentration for a null uva254 reduction did not show a definite relation with the concentration of bromide conversely the b parameter that describes the rate of bromate concentration increase was well correlated with the bromide concentration the dependence of the relative bromate yields defined as bromate concentration normalized by the initial bromide concentration bro3 br versus the relative residual uva254 fig 6b showed two regions in the relative residual uva254 range of 100 70 molar bromate yield bro3 br mmol l 1 mmol l 1 0 01 was very small for all bromide concentrations even though the variation in bromide concentrations spanned over more than one order of magnitude as discussed above in this region the limited reduction of uva254 was due to the small specific ozone dose applied o3 doc ratio 0 2 0 3 under these conditions the ozone was very quickly consumed with almost no ozone residual concentration available for bromate formation conversely in the relative residual uva254 range of 70 40 the bromate yield appears to be related to the abatement of the relative residual uva254 especially for bromide concentrations below 5 mg l residual uva254 values in the order of 70 40 were observed for specific ozone doses from 0 2 to 0 3 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc in this range of o3 doc ratios the observed trend of bromate formation was in good agreement with the findings of chon et al 2015 that attributed the formation of bromate by the combined action of ozone and hydroxyl radicals to the higher ozone lifetime due to the partially destroyed electron donating dom moieties fig 7a shows that increases of the spectral slope caused by the ozonation of efom were always correlated with the concurrently increasing bromate concentrations but these correlations depended on the initial concentration of bromide fig 7b relates the relative bromate normalized to bromide bro3 br to the spectral slopes determined for the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm it could be observed a trend similar to that found for uva254 reduction with two distinct behaviors for spectral slopes from 0 013 nm 1 to 0 017 nm 1 molar bromate yield showed approximately constant values in the order of 0 01 or less conversely for spectral slopes of more than 0 017 nm 1 this spectroscopic parameter seemed to be moderately well correlated with the molar bromate yield 3 3 relation between fluorescence parameters and bromate generation representative fluorescence eems of the untreated raw sample br 0 693 mg l and of the raw samples treated with 0 1 and 0 5 mg o3 mg doc are shown in figure s4a s4b and s4c respectively the data shown in fig s4a demonstrate the presence of four major characteristic structures the nature of which was attributed in accord with the findings of prior studies li et al 2013 2016a barsotti et al 2016 chen et al 2017 and maxima are listed in table 3 properties of the four structures listed in table 3 differed significantly from each other the first revealed a zone at high intensity that extended between the ex range of 220 230 nm and the em range of 330 360 nm due to its location this structure indicated the presence of protein like species however by analyzing this eem structure with the peak picking method sgroi et al 2017a b it was not possible to locate a definite peak of intensity in emission but only an area of maximum intensity with an amplitude of approximately 30 nm a similar consideration can be done for structure ii that was indicative of the presence of fulvic like species the maximum intensity covered an area of 100 nm around the ex wavelength of 240 nm structures iii and iv were instead more defined for these structures it was possible to identify an almost unique peak in both excitation and emission modes the location of structure iii like structure i was indicative of the presence of protein like species conversely structure iv was indicative of the presence of humic like species ozonation caused a pronounced decrease of the fluorescence intensity of the treated wastewater figs s4b and s4c show this effect on the raw wastewater exposed to 0 1 and 0 5 mg o3 mg doc respectively fig s4c shows that following an ozonation with a 0 5 mg o3 mg doc specific dose it was no longer possible to identify the structures related to the presence of protein like species in contrast the structures associated with fulvic like and humic like fluorophores were still discernible ozonation caused their intensity to decrease and position of the maximum intensity to shift towards higher wavelengths the peak of structure iv table 3 before ozonation was located at ex 330 nm em 430 nm see fig s4a and after ozonation its position was at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 345 nm and 445 nm respectively see fig s4c these observations that are consistent with those reported in prior research li et al 2013 indicated that fulvic like and humic like compounds in efom are comparatively more resistant to oxidation by ozone and ho radicals than protein like smps species tf integration was performed by summing all the intensity values on the rows and the columns of the eem that is by integrating the volume under the whole eem surface as in sgroi et al 2017a b for discrete eem data the parameter tf can be determined as in equation 6 6 t f e x e m i λ e x λ e m δ λ e x δ λ em where δλex is the excitation wavelength interval taken as 2 nm δλem is the emission wavelength interval taken as 2 nm and i λexλem is the fluorescence intensity of each excitation emission wavelength pair fig 8 shows the reduction of tf as a function of the specific dose of ozone as in the case of uva254 and color the reduction of tf plateaus for specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc the maximum reduction of tf was observed for the sample not spiked with br while higher concentrations of bromide decreased the extent of ozone effects on efom fluorophores the fluorescence data were processed to determine their correlations with the generation of bromate fig s5 shows the relationships of the generation of bromate with the reduction in tf while fig 9 presents the normalized molar bromate yields as a function of the relative residual tf fig s5 shows a trend for bromate generation similar to that observed for the correlation with uva254 reduction see fig 6a even in this case the relation between bromate concentration and total fluorescence reduction could be described with a 95 confidence bounds by an exponential curve as in equation 7 7 bro3 a eb ftot reduction with 0 47 a 3 74 4 41 b 6 16 and 0 92 r2 0 99 depending on the initial bromide concentration similarly to the relation found to exist between the uva254 parameters and bromate generation also in this case the a parameter that is the bromate concentration for a null tf reduction did not show a definite relation with the concentration of bromide conversely the b parameter that describes the rate of bromate concentration increase was quite well correlated with the bromide concentration in this case significant bromate concentrations were observed for residual tf in the order of 40 similarly to the trends shown in figs 6b 7b and 9 shows the presence of two distinct regions low molar bromate yields 0 01 could be observed for residual tf up to ca 30 followed by a sharp increase of bromate yield for more pronounced changes of tf in the region with the highest residual tf 80 30 ozone was rapidly consumed by substances responsible of for fluorescence and little residual ozone is left for reaction with br conversely in the second phase most of the substances responsible of fluorescence had been consumed and a higher ozone dose was available for oxidation of bromide to bromate this trend was in agreement with the observations of li et al 2017 4 conclusions this study examined the correlations between changes of optical properties of wastewater treated with ozone and bromate generation in the presence of widely varying initial bromide concentrations that is in the range from ca 0 7 21 2 mg l the major conclusions made based on the reported resulted can be presented as follows the intensity of differential uva254 increased with increasing ozone doses however the compresence of ozone doses above 0 2 0 3 mg o3 mg doc and bromide concentrations above 5 mg l were associated with somewhat lower differential uva254 values this is likely to be caused by the occurrence of reactions between ozone and bromide that decreased the extent of reactions between ozone and efom and at the same time resulted in the generation of hobr and other bromate precursors for specific doses of ozone from 0 1 to 1 mg o3 mg doc the concentration of bromate increased approximately linearly from below 10 ppb to ca 200 ppb without a lag phase in the correspondence of lower ozone doses 0 4 mg o3 mg doc higher bromide concentrations 10 mg l seemed to inhibit the generation of bromate relative reduction in uva254 and tf

the rate of bromate concentration increase was strongly dependent and positively correlated with the initial bromide concentration it was consistently observed for the same value of uva254 or tf

regions were observed molar bromate yields of less than 0 01 were found for residual uva254 and tf above 70 and 30 respectively a subsequent sharp increase in the molar bromate yield from 0 01 to 0 1 depending on the bromide concentration was observed for more pronounced changes of uva 254 or tf the generation of bromate was positively correlated with the increase of spectral slopes 300 400 nm but more observations are necessary to identify a robust correlation between the two parameters when the normalized bromate yields were plotted vs the spectral slopes in the range 0 013 0 017 nm 1 they showed approximately constant values in the order of 0 01 conversely for spectral slopes of more than 0 017 nm 1 this spectroscopic parameter seemed to be moderately well correlated with the molar bromate yield the results of this study demonstrate that several spectroscopic parameters notably changes of uv254 spectral slope and tf can provide a feedback signal for a real time estimation of

17821,the western basin of lake erie experiences annual harmful algal blooms habs which degrade water quality threaten drinking water supplies and deter recreation the size of habs in lake erie is highly correlated with the external loading of phosphorus p from a major tributary the maumee river during spring and summer months because hab size is largely explained by external loading the contribution of p from lake sediments internal loading is considered to be minimal however if lake sediments become warmer and more hypoxic or anoxic in response to climate change the relative contribution of internal p loading from sediments may become greater in this study we examined the potential effect of elevated lake temperatures on internal loading of p under anoxic conditions sediment cores were collected during summer 2014 from 4 locations in the western basin of lake erie ranging from highly productive areas near maumee bay to less productive offshore areas cores were incubated for 4 days under anoxic conditions under different temperatures 10 c 20 c and 30 c p flux varied greatly between temperature treatments and sites average p flux at 20 c and 30 c were 2 and 14 times higher respectively than for cores incubated at 10 c the site closest to the mouth of the maumee river had the highest p flux 10 times higher than the furthest site and highest total p concentration in the surface sediment 2 times higher than the furthest site suggesting a gradient of sediment p characteristics associated with the maumee river plume extrapolating these fluxes across the western basin suggests that with four days of anoxia at 30 c lake sediments could contribute 415 metric tons of dissolved p which is equivalent to the springtime dissolved p loading from the maumee river for 2011 the second largest hab on record keywords limnology phosphorus internal loading 1 introduction lake erie is currently in a state of re eutrophication as evidenced by the increase in frequency and size of habs bridgeman et al 2013 kane et al 2014 phosphorus p is thought to be a major driver of habs and spring p loads to the western basin of the lake from external sources were highly correlated to the subsequent summer bloom size for the period 2002 2011 stumpf et al 2012 obenour et al 2014 to date most of the research on p loading has focused on external sources such as tributaries agricultural run off and point sources kane et al 2014 baker et al 2014 conroy et al 2014 resulting in a recommendation to reduce external p loading by 40 in order to reduce habs in lake erie to acceptable levels international joint commission 2015 there are concerns however that so much p has already entered lake erie and presently resides in the lake sediments that the internal recycling internal loading of p from lake sediments will continue to fuel large habs for many years after external sources have been reduced national science and technology council 2017 in order to address these concerns a study was undertaken in 2014 to measure internal p loading in western lake erie using a variety of methods matisoff et al 2016 the results of the study characterized internal p loading under oxic conditions at ambient temperatures and indicated that under typical summer conditions in western lake erie most p bound to sediments is unavailable for use by phytoplankton the study found the overall flux of p from western lake erie sediments during typical summer conditions to be small compared to external p loading in spring and summer matisoff et al 2016 limnotech 2014 typical conditions however do not always prevail and western lake erie sediments may at times become anoxic during intermittent summer stratification events carr et al 1965 bartish 1984 bridgeman et al 2006 these events which may occur only every few years last several days and are associated with periods of high temperatures and low winds bridgeman et al 2006 in contrast the central basin of lake erie experiences consistent summer stratification and hypoxia every year with the extent of hypoxia linked to springtime temperatures and long term nutrient loading trends del gidudce et al 2018 typically water overlying sediments contains dissolved oxygen and the sediment water interface swi is oxidized creating a layer where p is bound to ions such as iron the oxidized boundary at the swi only extends a few millimeters below the sediment surface below the oxidized swi oxygen is depleted causing iron bound p to be released into the pore water katsev et al 2006 however the p contained in the pore water cannot diffuse past the oxidized boundary when oxygen at the swi is depleted due to anoxia of the overlying water iron bound p is released and pore water containing high concentrations of p can diffuse into the overlying water mortimer 1971 boström et al 1988 phosphorus release from iron can also be facilitated by microbial decomposition of organic matter frevert 1980 jensen and andersen 1992 results from previous studies suggest that decomposition of organic matter can be a substantial source of p and the amount of organic matter can affect the long term phosphorus flux katsev et al 2006 therefore differences in organic content could impact rates of p flux katsev and dittrich 2013 in addition the microbial reduction of iron oxyhydroxides to fe2 during anaerobic metabolism of organic matter can cause p to be released into the porewater and diffused into the overlying water column which would be influenced by temperature katsev 2016 temperature affects on the release of p from anoxic lake sediments may be particularly important in the western basin of lake erie the western basin of lake erie is the southernmost and shallowest area in the laurentian great lakes with the average depth being 7 3 m bolsenga and herdendorf 1993 which results in warm summer water temperatures most climate change scenarios indicate that western lake erie will become even warmer with average annual temperature for the great lakes region increasing by as much as 5 c by the end of the century hayhoe et al 2010 lake water temperatures are thought to be increasing more rapidly than air temperatures due to decreased duration of ice cover austin and colman 2007 o reilly et al 2015 elevated temperature increase p flux by stimulating mineralization and thereby liberating organic bound p into the pore water jensen and andersen 1992 katsev et al 2006 in addition increased temperature causes increased microbial activity that lowers the redox potential at the surface sediment which may induce the release of iron bound p lovley and phillips 1986 hunting and kampfraath 2013 small et al 2014 elevated temperature can also cause an increase in diffusion rates which increases the flux of p from the sediments to the water column jiang et al 2008 anthony and lewis 2012 because temperature affects a multitude of factors that influence anaerobic p flux the effect of temperature is not consistent between lakes jensen and andersen 1992 lovley and phillips 1986 hunting and kampfraath 2013 small et al 2014 jiang et al 2008 anthony and lewis 2012 wu et al 2014 and therefore must be determined case by case about 80 of total p entering lake erie is retained in lake sediments international lake erie water pollution board 1969 therefore sediments constitute a substantial pool of p that could potentially be released into the water column under low dissolved oxygen concentrations mortimer 1942 and increased temperature james and barko 2004 søndergaard et al 2003 here we present additional results from the 2014 study matisoff et al 2016 in which we simulated unusual lake conditions namely anoxia at the lake bottom coupled with high temperatures conditions in which p flux from lake erie sediments could become temporarily elevated our objective was to determine an upper limit on the amount of p that could be expected to be released from the sediments into the overlying water during a multi day anoxic event in order to explore how the importance of summer internal p loading relative to external loading may increase in a future where summer lake temperatures are higher and anoxic events may be more frequent we determined anoxic sediment p flux from sediment cores collected at several locations representing various depths and sediment types and incubated under a range of temperatures we estimated the resulting internal p load in the western basin of lake erie and compared these loads to typical external loads from a major tributary to western lake erie the maumee river 2 methods 2 1 study site and collection sediment cores were collected from four sites 7m 4p 91m and c5 in the western basin of lake erie during the summer of 2014 fig 1 the four sites spanned the western basin from north to south and represented varying depths and sediment types sediment cores from 91m 41 50 27 6 n 82 54 58 w water depth 11 m and c5 41 58 1 2 n 82 46 1 w water depth 11 5 m were collected on july 22 2014 aboard the r v lake guardian by pressing acrylic core tubes dimensions 30 5 cm length and 7 cm diameter 10 cm into sediment collected by a ekman 30 30 cm box corer sediment cores from 7m 41 44 05 n 83 17 43 w water depth 5 m and 4p 41 45 00 n 83 06 14 w water depth 9 m were collected on august 21 and september 6 2014 respectively aboard the university of toledo s vessel using a gravity corer aquatic research instruments equipped with a 71 cm acrylic core diameter 7 cm upon return to the laboratory the top 10 cm of sediment from the 71 cm cores were extruded into a 30 5 cm tube diameter 7 cm cores were stored in the dark at 4 c for a maximum of 4 days prior to incubation the overlying water was siphoned off the sediment and replaced with 500 ml of filtered lake erie water 0 45 μm millipore gwsc 045 collected from the same location as the sediment core 2 2 core incubations incubation temperatures representing bottom water temperatures in lake erie were chosen based on vertical profile data collected from 2002 to 2012 by the university of toledo at locations 7m and 4p n 139 fig 2 bottom water temperatures at location 7m from may october ranged from 9 to 27 c with a mean temperature of 21 c an incubation temperature of 10 c was chosen to represent spring temperatures 20 c to represent average summer temperature and 30 c to represent the future scenario of a warmer lake erie in 2014 nine cores from each location were incubated for four days at 10 c 20 c or 30 c with 3 cores incubated at each temperature anoxic periods of 1 4 days are not uncommon in western lake erie bottom waters bridgeman et al 2006 temperature was maintained by incubation chambers percival e36ho for the 10 c and 20 c cores and warm water bath for the 30 c treatment nitrogen gas was gently bubbled into the overlying water of each core throughout the duration of the incubation period to achieve and maintain anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen 0 mg l water samples 15 ml were collected at 24 hour intervals from each sediment core and frozen for later analysis after completion of incubations water was drawn off of the sediments and the organic content of the top 1 cm of sediment was determined using loss on ignition schumacher 2002 water samples were analyzed for total reactive p using the ascorbic acid method american water works association 2005 total reactive p trp was measured since it provides an accurate measurement of reactive p without the complex analysis required to conduct soluble reactive phosphorus on anoxic samples nürnberg 1984 total p of the top 1 cm of all cores was determined by a persulfate digestion and analyzed by molybdate blue colorimetry using a seal autoanalyzer 3 a random effect model run using the lme4 package in r bates et al 2014 was used to quantify differences in temperature treatment sample location and day of incubation a random effect model is advantageous because it can account for correlation between samples and the output allows for generalization outside our specific samples qian and shen 2007 equation 1 denotes the random effect model set up where i represents individual sample points j represents number of locations k represents number of samples and l represents number of days 1 log p c o n c e n t r a t i o n

overlying incubated sediments multiplied by water volume 0 5 l and divided by sediment core area and incubation duration the increase in phosphorus concentrations measured daily was not linear over the entire incubation period therefore for the purpose of comparing between sites temperatures and with other studies limnotech 2014 we calculated flux based on linear regressions of p concentration increase over the entire 4 day incubation however for the purpose of calculating internal total reactive p load from the western basin we used daily changes in p concentration in the incubations to more accurately estimate the effect of 1 2 3 and 4 day anoxic events one potential cause of the nonlinearity may be due to a delay in the cores reaching the incubation temperature cores were moved from storage at 4 c into incubation chambers although the overlying water quickly reached the incubation temperature it is possible that the sediments warmed more slowly resulting in a delayed p release core incubation data from all four sites were used to estimate the potential load of total reactive p from sediments of the entire western basin during anoxic events lasting from 1 to 4 days internal load was calculated as the product of flux sediment surface area and duration to calculate a basin wide mean load results from each site were weighted proportional to the percentage of western basin bottom area falling within the depth contour of a given site for example 55 5 of the bottom area of the western basin deeper than 4 m falls within the 7 10 m depth contour fig 1 therefore p release rates from site 4p 9 m depth within that contour were weighted accordingly bottom area in depths less than 4 m were not included in the flux calculation because these shallow areas are not likely to experience anoxia bridgeman et al 2006 bottom area of the western basin of lake erie was calculated by importing a bathymetric map from the noaa national center for environmental information ncei into arc gis arcgis desktop release 10 2 redlands ca environmental systems research institute bottom area of the lake was divided into three depth categories 4 7 m 7 10 m and 10 m corresponding to depths of locations where sediment cores were collected fig 1 locations 91m and c5 were combined for the weighted average because the difference in depth at these two locations was 0 5 m 3 results 3 1 sediment core incubations at all four sites the flux of p from anoxic sediments into the overlying water increased with temperature fig 3 on average p flux in the overlying water for cores incubated for four days at 20 c and 30 c were 2 and 14 times higher respectively than cores incubated at 10 c table 1 although the effect of temperature was the same for all sites the magnitude of change was different across the sites differences in p flux between sites may be related to the total phosphorus tp concentration of the top 1 cm of sediment p flux after 4 days of incubation at 30 c increased linearly with sediment tp concentration r2 0 86 fig 4 this relationship was most evident under the 30 c temperature treatment but was also apparent in the 20 c and 10 c incubations tp content of sediments in turn corresponded to the distance of site from the mouth of the maumee river a major source of particulate phosphorus to western lake erie fig 5 organic content between sites was compared using a classical anova site 7m 3 85 0 23 had significantly less p 0 01 organic content than 4p 4 92 1 64 91m 5 51 0 28 and c5 4 88 0 06 sites 4p 91m and c5 did not have statistically significant differences in organic content the lower organics in 7m may be due to a higher sand content data from sediment core incubations were analyzed in r using a random effect model bates et al 2014 which determined the influence of location and temperature on p concentration a summary of the model indicates that the standard deviation for location 0 9543 and temperature 0 9659 are similar therefore both variables have a similar effect on p concentration from sediment cores coefficients produced by the random effect model table 2 indicate that site 7m has a similar influence on p concentration as the 30 c treatment the temperature with the highest p flux 3 2 estimation of western basin dissolved p internal loading during an anoxic event using arc gis the area of the western basin of lake erie deeper than 4 m was calculated to be 2667 km2 the areas of the depth contours were calculated to be 742 km2 4 7 m 1482 km2 7 10 m and 443 km2 10 m fig 1 therefore we weighted the p flux for location 7m at 27 9 4p at 55 5 and the average of 91m and c5 at 16 6 the weights were applied to the p flux calculated for each day of incubation and the weighted p flux was multiplied by the area of western lake erie deeper than 4 m to estimate p loads during basin wide anoxic events lasting from 1 to 4 days on average the internal p load from a 2 day anoxic event was 4 times higher than from a 1 day anoxic event although there was little difference between projected internal p load at 10 c and 20 c p load at 30 c was much higher the projected basin wide p load from a 2 day anoxic event at 30 c was 180 mt p see table 3 comparing the anaerobic fluxes calculated in this study to aerobic fluxes from previous studies in western lake erie matisoff et al 2016 we found that a 1 day anoxic event at springtime 10 c or summer 20 c temperatures would result in 7 times greater p load than oxic sediments at 20 c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of temperature temperature had a significant effect on the p flux of anoxic sediments phosphorus flux from 10 c to 20 c sediments was low while the 30 c temperature treatment resulted in much higher p flux for all locations lower p flux at 10 c and 20 c and increased flux at 30 c suggest that anoxic events during the warmer parts of the summer could result in substantially greater p release from sediments than similar events occurring in the early summer and fall when the water is cooler previous studies suggest that the relationship between temperature and p flux from anoxic sediments is not linear jiang et al 2008 james and barko 2004 james 2017 due to factors such as biological activity and diffusion rates effects of temperature on p flux may be lake specific due to differences in sediment characteristics jensen and andersen 1992 making it difficult to generalize results across all lakes our results suggest that for western lake erie water temperature does not have a large effect on p flux until water temperature increases to greater than about 20 c to compare changes in anoxic p flux due to temperature between lakes a q10 value can be used q10 is the amount of change per a 10 c increase for example a q10 of 3 would mean that for each 10 c increase in temperature the rate would triple in this study our average q10 was 5 1 72 between 10 and 20 c 8 21 between 20 and 30 c these results fit within the range of values observed or modeled in other studies including liikanen et al 2002 q10 of 2 9 james 2017 q10 of 3 15 and jensen and andersen 1992 q10 range observed of 3 5 and 7 4 2 differences in phosphorus flux between locations phosphorus flux varied by location as well as by temperature the sediment core with the highest p flux was from our southern most site 7m and the lowest rate was from our northern most site c5 and in general p flux increased from southwest to the northeast furthermore we found that sediment tp concentrations at these locations and p flux were positively correlated these observations are likely explained by the influence of the two major tributaries into western lake erie the maumee river and detroit river the maumee river drains a large agricultural watershed and discharges high concentrations of p and high quantities of sediment into the southwest corner of the western basin of lake erie baker et al 2014 carreon martinez 2015 while the detroit river conveys water from the three upper great lakes huron superior and michigan and their surrounding watersheds the detroit river inputs approximately an equal amount of total p as the maumee river into western lake erie however the discharge of the detroit river is approximately 25 times greater than the maumee river making total p concentrations in the water from the detroit river about 30 times less than the maumee river schwab 2009 the potentially high amounts of nutrient rich sediment being deposited at the southern portion of the lake may be the reason that p fluxes were higher for the southern sites positive correlations between sediment tp concentration and p flux under anoxic conditions have been documented for several lakes in north america nürnberg 1988 suggesting that sediment tp measurements could serve as a useful predictor of potential p flux under anoxic conditions however no such relationships may exist for aerobic conditions using aerobic core incubations from several of the same sampling sites matisoff found no relationships between location or sediment p concentration with p flux matisoff et al 2016 although comparable previous sediment incubation studies in lake erie are few a study conducted in 2013 produced similar results for the ambient temperature 20 c incubations limnotech 2014 the 2013 sediment core incubations were conducted in the same manner as in our study with the major difference being the length of incubation 14 days versus the 4 day incubation in our study the results of the 2013 sediment core incubations yielded an average p flux of 9 5 mg p m2 d for cores collected from the reference site and incubated at 20 c limnotech 2014 comparing our closest sampling site 7m which is 7 km from the 2013 sampling location we obtained an average p flux of 11 5 mg p m2 d for cores incubated at 20 c 4 3 comparison of internal to external p loads during an anoxic event most of the models of annual harmful algal blooms in western lake erie stumpf et al 2012 obenour et al 2014 bertani et al 2016 have focused on the influence of springtime p loading from the maumee river as the single most predictive factor of hab size therefore in order to gauge the potential effect of anaerobic sediments on hab development it is useful to compare potential sediment p loads to measured external loads from the maumee river external loads have been quantified using two metrics tp which is considered to be partially available for use by algae and dissolved reactive phosphorus drp which is considered to be 100 available for the growth of algae p flux from an anoxic event will be mostly drp therefore in terms of effect on hab growth it is appropriate to compare the internal p load generated by p flux with maumee river drp load from the results of this study a 2 day anoxic event at 20 c would release 30 mt drp which would be equal to 17 of the average springtime maumee river drp loading defined as cumulative loading from march through july a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would release 324 mt drp for reference in 2013 lake erie experienced the third largest hab on record 2002 2019 noaa nccos and the drp springtime loading for 2013 was 240 mt p fig 6 it is also possible to estimate the increased p concentration that would occur during a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c given that the surface area of the western basin is approximately 3284 km2 with an average water depth of 7 3 m the volume of water equals 2 39 1013 l matisoff et al 2016 a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would result in a 13 5 μg p l increase which is 90 of the ijc target concentration of 15 μg p l for the western basin of lake erie although there are no previous studies that directly link sediment release of p with enhanced habs in lake erie ho and michalek 2017 using remote sensing of bloom size and external loading records to model historic blooms 1984 2015 concluded that blooms in 1985 1988 1994 and 2012 may be been exacerbated by internal loading because the observed blooms in those years were larger than would have been accounted for due to external loading alone climate change models predict warmer summer temperatures for the western basin of lake erie and the average annual temperatures for the great lakes area to resemble the current climate of northern texas by the end of the century hayhoe et al 2010 warmer summer temperatures may result in an increased frequency of stratification events resulting in anoxia not only does climate change have the potential to increase the frequency of anoxic events in western lake erie but also increased bottom water temperatures would result in higher rates of p release from anoxic lake sediments lake texoma a reservoir in northern texas regularly experiences water temperatures of 30 c at a depth of 8 m churchill 2013 if bottom water temperatures in lake erie resembled lake texoma by the end of the century then rates for internal loading of p during an anoxic event could increase 7 fold the results of oxic core incubations and other lake erie sediment p flux measurements in 2014 matisoff et al 2016 indicate that currently under the oxic conditions that generally prevail in western lake erie the influence of sediment p in producing habs may be relatively small however the research presented here indicates that during the brief periods of benthic anoxia that occasionally occur in the western basin p flux from the sediments can be significant when anoxic conditions are accompanied by elevated water temperature p loads into the western basin from lake sediments are comparable to external loads from the maumee river the tributary that is believed to be the major influence on hab size in lake erie in the future it would be useful for western lake erie monitoring programs to routinely track western basin anoxic events because as external p loads are gradually brought under control anoxic sediment p flux may help to explain the occurrence of otherwise anomalous habs in western lake erie 5 conclusions results from this study supports a positive correlation between temperature and anoxic p flux from western lake erie sediments in this study anoxic p flux was measured at 10 c 20 c and 30 c phosphorous flux increased at each temperature treatment with the greatest increase occurring between 20 c and 30 c 7 time increase in p flux between 10 c and 20 c p flux increased 2 time shallow locations near the maumee river had the greatest p flux while the deeper sites near the north shore of lake erie had the lowest p flux extrapolating calculated p fluxes to the entire western lake erie basin deeper than 4 m areas less than 4 m are unlikely to go anoxic a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would release 324 mt drp estimating the volume of the western basin of lake erie a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would result in a 13 5 μg p l increase which is 90 of the ijc target concentration of 15 μg p l for the western basin of lake erie declaration of competing interest

14 times higher respectively than for cores incubated at 10 c the site closest to the mouth of the maumee river had the highest p flux 10 times higher than the furthest site and highest total p concentration in the surface sediment 2 times higher than the furthest site suggesting a gradient of sediment p characteristics associated with the maumee river plume extrapolating these fluxes across

typical conditions however do not always prevail and western lake erie sediments may at times become anoxic during intermittent summer stratification events carr et al 1965 bartish 1984 bridgeman et al 2006 these events which may occur only every few years last several days and are associated with periods of high temperatures and low winds bridgeman et al 2006 in contrast the central basin of lake erie experiences consistent summer stratification and hypoxia every year with the extent of hypoxia linked to springtime temperatures and long term nutrient loading trends del gidudce et al 2018 typically water overlying sediments contains dissolved oxygen and the sediment water interface swi is oxidized creating a layer where p is bound to ions such as iron the oxidized boundary at the swi only extends a few millimeters below the sediment surface below the oxidized swi oxygen is depleted causing iron bound p to be released into the pore water katsev et al 2006 however the p contained in the pore water cannot diffuse past the oxidized boundary when oxygen at the swi is depleted due to anoxia of the overlying water iron bound p is released and pore water containing high concentrations of p can diffuse into the overlying water mortimer 1971 boström et al 1988 phosphorus release from iron can also be facilitated by microbial decomposition of organic matter frevert 1980 jensen and andersen 1992 results from previous studies suggest that decomposition of organic matter can be a substantial source of p and the amount of organic matter can affect the long term phosphorus flux katsev et al 2006 therefore differences in organic content could impact rates of p flux katsev and dittrich 2013 in addition the microbial reduction of iron oxyhydroxides to fe2 during anaerobic metabolism of organic matter can cause p to be released into the porewater and diffused into the overlying water column which would be influenced by temperature katsev 2016 temperature affects on the release of p from anoxic lake sediments may be particularly important in the western basin of lake erie the western basin of lake erie is the southernmost and shallowest area in the laurentian great lakes with the average depth being 7 3 m bolsenga and herdendorf 1993 which results in warm summer water temperatures most climate change scenarios indicate that western lake erie will become even warmer with average annual temperature for the great lakes region increasing by as much as 5 c by the end of the century hayhoe et al 2010 lake water temperatures are thought to be increasing more rapidly than air temperatures due to decreased duration of ice cover austin and colman 2007 o reilly et al 2015 elevated temperature increase p flux by stimulating mineralization and thereby liberating organic bound p into the pore water jensen and andersen 1992 katsev et al 2006 in addition increased temperature causes increased microbial activity that lowers the redox potential at the surface sediment which may induce the release of iron bound p lovley and phillips 1986 hunting and kampfraath 2013 small et al 2014 elevated temperature can also cause an increase in diffusion rates which increases the flux of p from the sediments to the water column jiang et al 2008 anthony and lewis 2012 because temperature affects a multitude of factors that influence anaerobic p flux the effect of temperature is not consistent between lakes jensen and andersen 1992 lovley and phillips 1986 hunting and kampfraath 2013 small et al 2014 jiang et al 2008 anthony and lewis 2012 wu et al 2014 and therefore must be determined case by case about 80 of total p entering lake erie is retained in lake sediments international lake erie water pollution board 1969 therefore sediments constitute a substantial pool of p that could potentially be released into the water column under low dissolved oxygen concentrations mortimer 1942 and increased temperature james and barko 2004 søndergaard et al 2003 here we present additional results from the 2014 study matisoff et al 2016 in which we simulated unusual lake conditions namely anoxia at the lake bottom coupled with high temperatures conditions in which p flux from lake erie sediments could become temporarily elevated our objective was to determine an upper limit on the amount of p that could be expected to be released from the sediments into the overlying water during a multi day anoxic event in order to explore how the importance of summer internal p loading relative to external loading may increase in a future where summer lake temperatures are higher and anoxic events may be more frequent we determined anoxic sediment p flux from sediment cores collected at several locations representing various depths and sediment types and incubated under a range of temperatures we estimated the resulting internal p load in the western basin of lake erie and compared these loads to typical external loads from a major tributary to western lake erie the maumee river 2 methods 2 1 study site and collection sediment cores were collected from four sites 7m 4p 91m and c5 in the western basin of lake erie during the summer of 2014 fig 1 the four sites spanned the western basin from north to south and represented varying depths and sediment types sediment cores from 91m 41 50 27 6 n 82 54 58 w water depth 11 m and c5 41 58 1 2 n 82 46 1 w water depth 11 5 m were collected on july 22 2014 aboard the r v lake guardian by pressing acrylic core tubes dimensions 30 5 cm length and 7 cm diameter 10 cm into sediment collected by a ekman 30 30 cm box corer sediment cores from 7m 41 44 05 n 83 17 43 w water depth 5 m and 4p 41 45 00 n 83 06 14 w water depth 9 m were collected on august 21 and september 6 2014 respectively aboard the university of toledo s vessel using a gravity corer aquatic research instruments equipped with a 71 cm acrylic core diameter 7 cm upon return to the laboratory the top 10 cm of sediment from the 71 cm cores were extruded into a 30 5 cm tube diameter 7 cm cores were stored in the dark at 4 c for a maximum of 4 days prior to incubation the overlying water was siphoned off the sediment and replaced with 500 ml of filtered lake erie water 0 45 μm millipore gwsc 045 collected from the same location as the sediment core 2 2 core incubations incubation temperatures representing bottom water temperatures in lake erie were chosen based on vertical profile data collected from 2002 to 2012 by the university of toledo at locations 7m and 4p n 139 fig 2 bottom water temperatures at location 7m from may october ranged from 9 to 27 c with a mean temperature of 21 c an incubation temperature of 10 c was chosen to represent spring temperatures 20 c to represent average summer temperature and 30 c to represent the future scenario of a warmer lake erie in 2014 nine cores from each location were incubated for four days at 10 c 20 c or 30 c with 3 cores incubated at each temperature anoxic periods of 1 4 days are not uncommon in western lake erie bottom waters bridgeman et al 2006 temperature was maintained by incubation chambers percival e36ho for the 10 c and 20 c cores and warm water bath for the 30 c treatment nitrogen gas was gently bubbled into the overlying water of each core throughout the duration of the incubation period to achieve and maintain anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen 0 mg l water samples 15 ml were collected at 24 hour intervals from each sediment core and frozen for later analysis after completion of incubations water was drawn off of the sediments and the organic content of the top 1 cm of sediment was determined using loss on ignition schumacher 2002 water samples were analyzed for total reactive p using the ascorbic acid method american water works association 2005 total reactive p trp was measured since it provides an accurate measurement of reactive p without the complex analysis required to conduct soluble reactive phosphorus on anoxic samples nürnberg 1984 total p of the top 1 cm of all cores was determined by a persulfate digestion and analyzed by molybdate blue colorimetry using a seal autoanalyzer 3 a random effect model run using the lme4 package in r bates et al 2014 was used to quantify differences in temperature treatment sample location and day of incubation a random effect model is advantageous because it can account for correlation between samples and the output allows for generalization outside our specific samples qian and shen 2007 equation 1 denotes the random effect model set up where i represents individual sample points j represents number of locations k represents number of samples and l represents number of days 1 log p c o n c e n t r a t i o n i j k l β 0 β 1 j β 2 k β 3 l ε i j k l 2 3 estimation of p flux and western basin internal p load during an anoxic event we calculated p flux mg p m2 d based on changes in p concentration in water overlying incubated sediments multiplied by water volume 0 5 l and divided by sediment core area and incubation duration the increase in phosphorus concentrations measured daily was not linear over the entire incubation period therefore for the purpose of comparing between sites temperatures and with other studies limnotech 2014 we calculated flux based on linear regressions of p concentration increase over the entire 4 day incubation however for the purpose of calculating internal total reactive p load from the western basin we used daily changes in p concentration in the incubations to more accurately estimate the effect of 1 2 3 and 4 day anoxic events one potential cause of the nonlinearity may be due to a delay in the cores reaching the incubation temperature cores were moved from storage at 4 c into incubation chambers although the overlying water quickly reached the incubation temperature it is possible that the sediments warmed more slowly resulting in a delayed p release core incubation data from all four sites were used to estimate the potential load of total reactive p from sediments of the entire western basin during anoxic events lasting from 1 to 4 days internal load was calculated as the product of flux sediment surface area and duration to calculate a basin wide mean load results from each site were weighted proportional to the percentage of western basin bottom area falling within the depth contour of a given site for example 55 5 of the bottom area of the western basin deeper than 4 m falls within the 7 10 m depth contour fig 1 therefore p release rates from site 4p 9 m depth within that contour were weighted accordingly bottom area in depths less than 4 m were not included in the flux calculation because these shallow areas are not likely to experience anoxia bridgeman et al 2006 bottom area of the western basin of lake erie was calculated by importing a bathymetric map from the noaa national center for environmental information ncei into arc gis arcgis desktop release 10 2 redlands ca environmental systems research institute bottom area of the lake was divided into three depth categories 4 7 m 7 10 m and 10 m corresponding to depths of locations where sediment cores were collected fig 1 locations 91m and c5 were combined for the weighted average because the difference in depth at these two locations was 0 5 m 3 results 3 1 sediment core incubations at all four sites the flux of p from anoxic sediments into the overlying water increased with temperature fig 3 on average p flux in the overlying water for cores incubated for four days at 20 c and 30 c were 2 and 14 times higher respectively than cores incubated at 10 c table 1 although the effect of temperature was the same for all sites the magnitude of change was different across the sites differences in p flux between sites may be related to the total phosphorus tp concentration of the top 1 cm of sediment p flux after 4 days of incubation at 30 c increased linearly with sediment tp concentration r2 0 86 fig 4 this relationship was most evident under the 30 c temperature treatment but was also apparent in the 20 c and 10 c incubations tp content of sediments in turn corresponded to the distance of site from the mouth of the maumee river a major source of particulate phosphorus to western lake erie fig 5 organic content between sites was compared using a classical anova site 7m 3 85 0 23 had significantly less p 0 01 organic content than 4p 4 92 1 64 91m 5 51 0 28 and c5 4 88 0 06 sites 4p 91m and c5 did not have statistically significant differences in organic content the lower organics in 7m may be due to a higher sand content data from sediment core incubations were analyzed in r using a random effect model bates et al 2014 which determined the influence of location and temperature on p concentration a summary of the model indicates that the standard deviation for location 0 9543 and temperature 0 9659 are similar therefore both variables have a similar effect on p concentration from sediment cores coefficients produced by the random effect model table 2 indicate that site 7m has a similar influence on p concentration as the 30 c treatment the temperature with the highest p flux 3 2 estimation of western basin dissolved p internal loading during an anoxic event using arc gis the area of the western basin of lake erie deeper than 4 m was calculated to be 2667 km2 the areas of the depth contours were calculated to be 742 km2 4 7 m 1482 km2 7 10 m and 443 km2 10 m fig 1 therefore we weighted the p flux for location 7m at 27 9 4p at 55 5 and the average of 91m and c5 at 16 6 the weights were applied to the p flux calculated for each day of incubation and the weighted p flux was multiplied by the area of western lake erie deeper than 4 m to estimate p loads during basin wide anoxic events lasting from 1 to 4 days on average the internal p load from a 2 day anoxic event was 4 times higher than from a 1 day anoxic event although there was little difference between projected internal p load at 10 c and 20 c p load at 30 c was much higher the projected basin wide p load from a 2 day anoxic event at 30 c was 180 mt p see table 3 comparing the anaerobic fluxes calculated in this study to aerobic fluxes from previous studies in western lake erie matisoff et al 2016 we found that a 1 day anoxic event at springtime 10 c or summer 20 c temperatures would result in 7 times greater p load than oxic sediments at 20 c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of temperature temperature had a significant effect on the p flux of anoxic sediments phosphorus flux from 10 c to 20 c sediments was low while the 30 c temperature treatment resulted in much higher p flux for all locations lower p flux at 10 c and 20 c and increased flux at 30 c suggest that anoxic events during the warmer parts of the summer could result in substantially greater p release from sediments than similar events occurring in the early summer and fall when the water is cooler previous studies suggest that the relationship between temperature and p flux from anoxic sediments is not linear jiang et al 2008 james and barko 2004 james 2017 due to factors such as biological activity and diffusion rates effects of temperature on p flux may be lake specific due to differences in sediment characteristics jensen and andersen 1992 making it difficult to generalize results across all lakes our results suggest that for western lake erie water temperature does not have a large effect on p flux until water temperature increases to greater than about 20 c to compare changes in anoxic p flux due to temperature between lakes a q10 value can be used q10 is the amount of change per a 10 c increase for example a q10 of 3 would mean that for each 10 c increase in temperature the rate would triple in this study our average q10 was 5 1 72 between 10 and 20 c 8 21 between 20 and 30 c these results fit within the range of values observed or modeled in other studies including liikanen et al 2002 q10 of 2 9 james 2017 q10 of 3 15 and jensen and andersen 1992 q10 range observed of 3 5 and 7 4 2 differences in phosphorus flux between locations phosphorus flux varied by location as well as by temperature the sediment core with the highest p flux was from our southern most site 7m and the lowest rate was from our northern most site c5 and in general p flux increased from southwest to the northeast furthermore we found that sediment tp concentrations at these locations and p flux were positively correlated these observations are likely explained by the influence of the two major tributaries into western lake erie the maumee river and detroit river the maumee river drains a large agricultural watershed and discharges high concentrations of p and high quantities of sediment into the southwest corner of the western basin of lake erie baker et al 2014 carreon martinez 2015 while the detroit river conveys water from the three upper great lakes huron superior and michigan and their surrounding watersheds the detroit river inputs approximately an equal amount of total p as the maumee river into western lake erie however the discharge of the detroit river is approximately 25 times greater than the maumee river making total p concentrations in the water from the detroit river about 30 times less than the maumee river schwab 2009 the potentially high amounts of nutrient rich sediment being deposited at the southern portion of the lake may be the reason that p fluxes were higher for the southern sites positive correlations between sediment tp concentration and p flux under anoxic conditions have been documented for several lakes in north america nürnberg 1988 suggesting that sediment tp measurements could serve as a useful predictor of potential p flux under anoxic conditions however no such relationships may exist for aerobic conditions using aerobic core incubations from several of the same sampling sites matisoff found no relationships between location or sediment p concentration with p flux matisoff et al 2016 although comparable previous sediment incubation studies in lake erie are few a study conducted in 2013 produced similar results for the ambient temperature 20 c incubations limnotech 2014 the 2013 sediment core incubations were conducted in the same manner as in our study with the major difference being the length of incubation 14 days versus the 4 day incubation in our study the results of the 2013 sediment core incubations yielded an average p flux of 9 5 mg p m2 d for cores collected from the reference site and incubated at 20 c limnotech 2014 comparing our closest sampling site 7m which is 7 km from the 2013 sampling location we obtained an average p flux of 11 5 mg p m2 d for cores incubated at 20 c 4 3 comparison of internal to external p loads during an anoxic event most of the models of annual harmful algal blooms in western lake erie stumpf et al 2012 obenour et al 2014 bertani et al 2016 have focused on the influence of springtime p loading from the maumee river as the single most predictive factor of hab size therefore in order to gauge the potential effect of anaerobic sediments on hab development it is useful to compare potential sediment p loads to measured external loads from the maumee river external loads have been quantified using two metrics tp which is considered to be partially available for use by algae and dissolved reactive phosphorus drp which is considered to be 100 available for the growth of algae p flux from an anoxic event will be mostly drp therefore in terms of effect on hab growth it is appropriate to compare the internal p load generated by p flux with maumee river drp load from the results of this study a 2 day anoxic event at 20 c would release 30 mt drp which would be equal to 17 of the average springtime maumee river drp loading defined as cumulative loading from march through july a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would release 324 mt drp for reference in 2013 lake erie experienced the third largest hab on record 2002 2019 noaa nccos and the drp springtime loading for 2013 was 240 mt p fig 6 it is also possible to estimate the increased p concentration that would occur during a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c given that the surface area of the western basin is approximately 3284 km2 with an average water depth of 7 3 m the volume of water equals 2 39 1013 l matisoff et al 2016 a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would result in a 13 5 μg p l increase which is 90 of the ijc target concentration of 15 μg p l for the western basin of lake erie although there are no previous studies that directly link sediment release of p with enhanced habs in lake erie ho and michalek 2017 using remote sensing of bloom size and external loading records to model historic blooms 1984 2015 concluded that blooms in 1985 1988 1994 and 2012 may be been exacerbated by internal loading because the observed blooms in those years were larger than would have been accounted for due to external loading alone climate change models predict warmer summer temperatures for the western basin of lake erie and the average annual temperatures for the great lakes area to resemble the current climate of northern texas by the end of the century hayhoe et al 2010 warmer summer temperatures may result in an increased frequency of stratification events resulting in anoxia not only does climate change have the potential to increase the frequency of anoxic events in western lake erie but also increased bottom water temperatures would result in higher rates of p release from anoxic lake sediments lake texoma a reservoir in northern texas regularly experiences water temperatures of 30 c at a depth of 8 m churchill 2013 if bottom water temperatures in lake erie resembled lake texoma by the end of the century then rates for internal loading of p during an anoxic event could increase 7 fold the results of oxic core incubations and other lake erie sediment p flux measurements in 2014 matisoff et al 2016 indicate that currently under the oxic conditions that generally prevail in western lake erie the influence of sediment p in producing habs may be relatively small however the research presented here indicates that during the brief periods of benthic anoxia that occasionally occur in the western basin p flux from the sediments can be significant when anoxic conditions are accompanied by elevated water temperature p loads into the western basin from lake sediments are comparable to external loads from the maumee river the tributary that is believed to be the major influence on hab size in lake erie in the future it would be useful for western lake erie monitoring programs to routinely track western basin anoxic events because as external p loads are gradually brought under control anoxic sediment p flux may help to explain the occurrence of otherwise anomalous habs in western lake erie 5 conclusions results from this study supports a positive correlation between temperature and anoxic p flux from western lake erie sediments in this study anoxic p flux was measured at 10 c 20 c and 30 c phosphorous flux increased at each temperature treatment with the greatest increase occurring between 20 c and 30 c 7 time increase in p flux between 10 c and 20 c p flux increased 2 time shallow locations near the maumee river had the greatest p flux while the deeper sites near the north shore of lake erie had the lowest p flux extrapolating calculated p fluxes to the entire western lake erie basin deeper than 4 m areas less than 4 m are unlikely to go anoxic a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would release 324 mt drp estimating the volume of the western basin of lake erie a 3 day anoxic event at 30 c would result in a 13 5 μg p l increase which is 90 of the ijc target concentration of 15 μg p l for the western basin of lake erie declaration of competing interest

17822,wastewater has been identified as an important carrier for nanoplastics which could elicit unintended impacts on critical microbial processes however the long term impacts of nanoplastics on anaerobic granular sludge ags for methane recovery from wastewater and the mechanisms involved remains unclear in this study we investigated the long term exposure response relationship between polystyrene nanoplastics nano ps and ags in continuous test over 120 days with 86 days nano ps exposure feeding wastewater with 10 μg l of nano ps had no significant impacts on the ags performance in comparison higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps decreased methane production and chemical oxygen demand cod removal by 19 0 28 6 and 19 3 30 0 respectively along with volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation more extracellular polymeric substance eps was induced by 10 μg l of nano ps as a response to protect microbes but higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps decreased eps generation causing a decline in granule size and cell viability fluorescence tagging found that a large number of nano ps agglomerated accumulated on the outer layer of ags and even transferred into deeper layers of ags over exposure time producing toxic effects to adherent microorganisms e g longilinea sp paludibacter sp and methanosaeta sp the oxidative stress induced by nano ps was revealed to be a key factor for reshaping the ags reflected by the increased reactive oxygen species ros generation and lactate dehydrogenase ldh release the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds leached from nano ps was also demonstrated to restrain the activities of antioxidant enzymes thereby further lessening resistance to oxidative stress induced by nano ps this work improves our ability to predict the risks

far mainly focused on the anaerobic bacteria and microalgae for example fu et al 2018 demonstrated that nano ps partly inhibited the growth and metabolism of acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes via membrane dysfunction exposure to nanoplastics also has been evidenced to reduce co2 uptake by microalgae which was associated with nanoplastics induced oxidative stress bhattacharya et al 2010 liu et

2016 lee et al 2013 several studies chen et al 2019 suhrhoff et al 2016 have identified the presence of plastic leachate i e chemical additives after exposure of plastics pieces in water given the nano scale size of nanoplastics the leaching potential of nanoplastic additives seems high specifically studies on barnacle li et al 2015a b mussels e silva et al 2016 and nitocra spinipes bejgarn et al 2015 have indicated that leachate from plastic materials cause acute toxicity it seems likely that nanoplastic additives would also be released to the environment causing toxic effects wastewater has been identified as an important carrier for plastic particles down to the nano scale from urban system to the environment keller et al 2020 mahon et al 2016 intentionally manufacture for industrial purposes and daily life products contribute to the presence of nano microplastics in wastewater nano microplastics can easily travel along wastewater treatment processes and suffer fragmentation under shear stress forces leading to the generation of nano microplastics with smaller size and increasing number of nano microplastics in wastewater by one order of magnitude enfrin et al 2020a in turn the small size and high surface hydrophobicity of nano microplastics facilitate their agglomeration producing the potential influences on wastewater treatment processes enfrin et al 2019 for example the performances of activated sludge processes and sludge treatment can be compromised in the presence of nano microplastics which can directly attach on the sludge cell surface and poison the relevant microorganisms the strong adsorption affinities of nano microplastics also make them serve as carriers for environmental contaminants facilitating the spreading and bioaccumulation of contaminants thereby producing indirectly toxicity anaerobic granular sludge ags technology is widely utilized in high strength wastewater treatment for recovering methane from wastewater latif et al 2011 jensen et al 2014 wei et al 2019 anaerobic granular sludge generally exhibits a particular three layered microbial structure the outer layer is covered by acidogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens the middle layer consists of syntrophic microcolonies and the internal core is predominated by aceticlastic methanogens he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 apart from the microbial distribution structure extracellular polymeric substance eps is another important component of ags to bind cells together and protect the microorganisms as such ags is a complex microbial aggregate with self assembled community of environmental microbes for methane recovery from wastewater a large number of laboratory studies have examined the effects of engineered nanoparticles e g metals and metal

zero valent iron nzvi and single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts at the concentration up to 30 mmol l and 1000 mg l on the activity of ags was observed he et al 2017 li et al 2015a b however mu et al 2012 found that the methane production from ags was decreased in the presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps greater than 100 mg g tss in contrast the iron oxide nanoparticles ionps at 750 mg l induced more biogas and methane release from ags ambuchi et al 2017 the nanoplastics are also nano scale in size therefore potentially posing greater influence on ags performance most of previous work focused on the short term a few weeks impacts on anaerobic sludge systems through spiking batch tests and very limited information has so far been reported on the long term months exposure response relationship between nanoplastics and ags via continuous feeding tests that are representative of real wastewater treatment processes also the results of short term exposure studies may fail to capture the effects of the expected agglomeration accumulation of nanoplastics and transport of nanoplastics into deeper layers of ags over extended time thus underestimating the potential toxicity of nanoplastics over long term exposure scenarios more importantly the toxic mechanism of ps nanoplastics to ags is still largely unknown which is the key knowledge gap that needs to be addressed herein we utilized one of the most widely presented nano ps liu et al 2020 as the model nanoplastics to gain a comprehensive insight into the long term influence of nanoplastics on the ags for recovering methane from wastewater from macroscopic to microcosmic aspect the impact of nano ps on the ags was examined in terms of performance granule size distribution and morphology eps architecture live dead cells distribution of ags and microbial community besides the possible agglomeration accumulation and transport of nanoplastics in ags were characterized over long term exposure scenario the toxic mechanisms of nano ps were also specifically explored in terms of the oxidative stress the activities of antioxidant enzymes cell integrity and leachate toxicity on ags induced by nano ps 2 materials

reactor systems were continuously operated for 121 days with two phases i e baseline phase and exposure phase one uasb was served as control system while the other three reactors as experimental systems were conducted for nano ps exposure in baseline phase day 0 35 all systems were operated identically to acclimate ags and establish convergence that is they reached stable and similar cod removal efficiency the exposure phase day 36 121 was started when four systems reached convergence according to literature al sid cheikh et al 2018 the currently predicted environmental concentration of nano ps was 15 μg l for sizes of 50 nm the increased nano ps will be released to the environment due to their wider large scale production thus three test concentrations 10 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps were chosen for exposure assays in exposure phase the control system continued to be fed with synthetic wastewater this control would account for the potential presence of other pollutants in raw ags representing the performance of the raw sludge with other pollutants the other three experimental systems were fed with synthetic wastewater containing nano ps of 10 20 and 50 μg l nano ps stocks were sonicated at 50 khz for 60 s before being diluted to the exposure level size measurement enfrin et al 2020b by dynamic light scattering dls with a malvern autosizer 4700 indicated that the average particle size 50 6 nm of nano ps had not changed before and after sonication during the whole operation period the methane production of each reactor was determined every day the cod and volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations were measured 2 3 times per week in addition triplicate samples were collected from each reactor for microbial community analysis 2 3 ags characterization and eps analysis at the end of the long term nano ps exposure experiments the ags samples were withdrawn from each reactor the surface and interior morphology of ags were visualized using the scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f jeol co japan the granule size of ags was determined using a laser particle size analyzer malvern panalytical uk after pretreatment to eliminate the possible interference of nano ps aggregates in brief the collected ags samples were washed three times using deionized water and added in a serum bottle with 500 ml deionized water and 1 2 g ml sodium chloride after stirring for 15 min the mixture was settled for 2 h to make sure the separation of nano ps aggregates float on the top water layer due to low density and remove them from ags by skimming this extraction operation was carried out in triplicate finally the ags sample was washed with deionized water to remove any salt residues the live dead microorganisms in ags were counted using live deadr baclighttm bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 as detailed in the si fluorescence tagging method erni cassola et al 2017 was used to observe the nano ps in ags briefly nile red technical grade n3013 sigma aldrich was dissolved in methanol achieving a concentration of 1 μg ml ags samples were covered by 2 3 drops of a nile red solution and placed on standard microscope slides after incubation in dark for 10 min at 60 c the stained sample was observed using a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 at excitation and emission of 460 and 525 nm and photographed using an annex digital camera to further observe the nano ps in the intra of granule ags was firstly freezed at 20 c and sectioned into 30 μm sections and then the sections were mounted onto microscope slides for staining the overall porosity of ags samples was measured using hg porosimeter autopore iv9500 usa with the detailed procedure summarized in si the eps production of ags was extracted with the modified oscillation ultrasound combined cationic resin method the detailed procedure was also provided in the si afterwards the concentrations of polysaccharides proteins humic acids lipids and dna in eps extractions were analyzed the eps structures were visualized by multiple fluorescence labeling and confocal laser scanning microscope clsm as detailed in the si the functional groups components of eps were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir nexus 870 with kbr disc technique 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial community in sample was analyzed using illumina miseq sequencing first the sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 rpm then the genomic dna was extracted with the fast dna kit mobio laboratories the quantity and purity of collected dna was determined using nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific the primers 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnv gggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16s dna genes were chosen for real time pcr amplifications the sequence analysis was performed on illumina miseq pf300 platform as detailed in our previous study wei et al 2019 operational units otus were clustered with a 97 similarity for the taxonomic classification analysis 2 5 batch experiments of nano ps impacts on acidification and methanation synthetic wastewater with glucose as cod substances in uasb generally undergoes acidification and methanation processes which collectively affect ags performance for cod removal thus a series of batch tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of nano ps exposure 50 μg l on these two steps in short 100 ml of synthetic wastewater containing corresponding nano ps concentration with 2 g l tss of ags was added in a serum bottle 160 ml moreover 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa 50 mmol l was dosed to eliminate methanogens interference after flushing with nitrogen gas for around 2 min to ensure anaerobic condition each bottle was sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm 35 1 c the productions of vfas after 2 days were analyzed to indicate the impacts of nano ps on the acidification step also the similar operations were carried out to assess the impacts of nano ps on the methanation step except that the glucose in synthetic wastewater was replaced by 2000 mg cod l of sodium acetate and no besa was added after 8 days the methane production was measured all tests were conducted in triplicate 2 6 determination of ros generation and ldh release the extent of oxidative stress induced by nano ps exposure was examined by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros the integrity of the cell membranes was indicated using the amount of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase ldh released hence ros generation and ldh release after nano ps exposure were determined to explore toxic mechanisms of nano ps nano ps exposure assay were carried out with the similar operations described in the batch experiments above without besa addition the methane production during treatment period in each bottle was measured after 8 d the mixture in each test was withdrawn the ros and ldh levels were measured according to methods detailed in the si the superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat are the ros scavengers as the main antioxidant defenses in organisms messina et al 2014 to determine the impacts of oxidative stress induced by nano ps on ags performance 1 g l sod and 1 g l cat were dosed with nano ps in the nano ps exposure assay and then the changes of methane production as well as ros and ldh levels were examined 2 7 chemicals leaching from ps nanoplastics and antioxidant enzymes activities measurements according to the manufacturers sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is the only chemical additive used for nano ps processing not only additives but also the potential biodegradation products of nano ps such as mono and oligomers may also leach out therefore various oligomers of the nano ps in the experiment process were also measured including polystyrene dimers 2 4 diphenyl butene 1 2 diphenylcyclobutane trimers 2 4 6 triphenyl 1 hexene 1 phenyl 4 1 phenylethyl tetralin isomers polystyrene trimer isomer group tetramers polystyrene tetramer isomers and pentamers polystyrene pentamer isomers at different exposure time i e 0 1 3 5 and 7 d the concentrations of chemicals leached were measured through nano ps exposure assay above the experiments of leachates affecting methane production of ags were conducted by nano ps exposure assay above except that nano ps was replaced by the leachates with the corresponding concentration also the activities of sod and cat in the presence of sds were measured more detailed information about the measurements of leachates concentrations as well as sod and cat activities can be found in si 2 8 other analytical methods the measurements of tss vss and cod were performed following standard methods apha 1998 the vfa was determined by a gas chromatograph agilent fid with polar capillary column biogas volume in the continuous uasb reactor was recorded using a gas meter in batch assay the biogas volume in serum bottle was measured by a manometer based on the increased pressure in the headspace volume 60 ml in this study at the standard condition 25 c 1 atm the biogas composition i e h2 ch4 and co2 was analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd lunan 6890 as described in our previous work wei et al 2018 methane production was calculated based on the biogas volume and methane content protein content was analyzed using the bca method with bovine serum albumin as standard smith et al 1985 polysaccharide concentration was measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as standard raunkjaer et al 1994 the commercial olive oil was used as the standard to determine the lipids according to the literature frings et al 1970 the humic acids were analyzed according to the modified lowry method with humic acids fluka as standard frolund et al 1995 dna was analyzed using diphenylamine colorimetry method with calf thymus as a standard solution labarca et al 1980 independent samples t test was applied to evaluate the significant differences of the results and a value of p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant in this work zheng et al 2017 3 results 3 1 nano ps suppressed methane recovery from wastewater by ags the control ags reactor and three experimental ags systems exposed to 10 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps were continuously operated for 121 days with baseline phase and exposure phase fig 1 presented the methane production cod removal rate and vfa concentration in the control and experimental ags reactors during baseline phase following convergence and the entire exposure phase in baseline phase the four ags systems with no nano ps exposure reached convergence on day 30 with stable and similar p 0 05 performances under the steady state condition the average methane production cod removal rate and vfa concentration from day 30 35 in each system reached up to 67 1 ml d mean standard deviations 90 4 0 4 and 115 3 mg cod l respectively in the 86 d exposure phase a lower exposure level i e 10 μg l of nano ps did not cause significant effects p 0 46 and 0 95 on the methane production and cod removal rate of the ags where the average methane production and cod removal rate 64 3 ml d 90 6 2 were comparable to the control 66 3 ml d 90 7 2 however the methane productions in the experimental systems exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps dropped to 51 1 ml d and 45 1 ml d at the end of the exposure representing the relative decreases of 19 0 0 1 p 0 0007 and 28 6 0 1 p 0 0002 respectively fig 2 a aligning with the methane production data with the increase of nano ps exposure level from 20 to 50 μg l the cod removal rate on day 121 decreased from 71 7 0 6 to 62 2 0 8 which were 80 7 0 5 p 1 03e 05 and 70 0 0 1 p 2 75e 06 of the control vfa was an important intermediate product for methane production in the ags reactor and their concentrations also changed over the nano ps exposure period fig 1 the vfa concentrations in the ags reactors exposure to 10 μg l of nano ps were comparable to the control throughout the whole operation period remaining at about 115 mg cod l till the end of the exposure at the higher exposure levels of nano ps i e 20 and 50 μg l the vfa concentrations performed a tendency of increasing and reached up to 340 16 and 453 11 mg cod l at the end of the exposure a possible reason of this vfa accumulation might be that the higher levels of nano ps impeded the consumption of vfa for methane production overall the ags maintained good endurance with long term exposure to a lower level i e 10 μg l of nano ps but higher nano ps concentrations i e 20 and 50 μg l caused the deteriorative performances a cod mass balance was conducted based on the data at the end of the exposure i e on day 121 fig 2b summarized the products distribution converted from cod i e glucose in the control and experimental ags reactors glucose as the only cod component in the feed was 2000 mg cod day over one hrt i e 1 d the cod in four ags reactors included the remaining glucose vfa methane and other products which respectively occupied 4 4 6 7 82 9 and 6 0 in the control reactor hydrogen was detected but the amount was negligible in the experimental systems exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps the remaining glucose was measured and its proportion increased to 11 3 and 15 2 respectively similarly vfa content rose to 17 0 and 22 6 on the contrary the percentage of methane dropped to 67 1 and 59 2 other cod products were possibly mainly from the biomass growth in ags such as microbial cells and eps their proportions decreased to 4 6 and 3 0 with increasing the exposure levels of nano ps from 20 to 50 μg l however others in the experimental systems exposure to lower level i e 10 μg l of nano ps accounted for 7 2 slightly higher than that in the control 6 0 the cod for biomass growth was exactly equivalent to the difference between the utilized cod and the produced methane cod the data indicated that a complete cod balance closure was achieved within measurement error in each ags reactor confirming the higher nano ps concentrations inhibited the conversion of cod for methane and ags populations along with vfa accumulation 3 2 nano ps changed granule size distribution and morphology of ags the size distribution of the ags in the control and experimental reactors exposure to different levels of nano ps 0 10 20 and 50 μg l over the whole exposure phase was expressed as a volume fraction and shown in fig 2c as seen in fig 2c particle size of ags in each reactor exhibited a binomial distribution in the range from 0 1 to 3100 μm the medium particle diameter dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter were listed in table 1 interestingly after 86 d exposure operation the particle size of ags from the reactor exposure to 10 μg l of nano ps presented an increase with the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1290 31 p 0 004 and 1287 16 μm p 0 001 compared to the ags from the control reactor having the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1160 23 and 1167 19 μm nevertheless the ags from the reactors exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps was smaller than that from the control reactor as nano ps exposure concentrations increasing from 20 to 50 μg l the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of ags at the end of exposure operation decreased from 1076 15 and 1105 19 μm to 817 22 and 847 28 μm this revealed that higher nano ps concentrations i e 20 and 50 μg l caused granules breakage during wastewater treatment morphology of ags from control and experimental reactors exposure to 50 μg l of nano ps at the end of exposure operation was observed by sem in fig 2d the surface topography of ags from control reactor was more rigid and stable while the granule from experimental reactor exhibited a fissured even broken surface which was consistent with the smaller granule size measured above a further close up of the structure at higher magnification showed that the interior of control granule was colonized by a large amount of rods with flat ends which was thought to be methanogens macleod et al 1990 while the interior of experimental granule principally contained cocci with very small numbers of rods it was observed from fluorescence images fig 2e that nano ps agglomerated and a large number of nano ps clusters accumulated on the outer layer of ags inducing direct toxic effects to adherent sludge cells the analysis for pore structure of ags showed that the exposure of nano ps decreased the overall porosity of ags from 69 2 to 61 1 suggesting that ags cavities might be clogged by nano ps aggregates making granule denser the cavities were responsible for the transports of biogas and nutrient substances thus their decreases might prevent the biogas emission and nutrition supply which was were correlated to some ags floatation observed in the experimental test to further trace the transport and diffusion of nano ps the internal morphology of ags was observed fluorescence images of the cross section of ags in fig 2f clearly showed that nano ps have transferred into deeper layers of ags over exposure time suggesting an extensive spatial distribution of nano ps in the ags cells which can lead to an enhanced toxicity for sludge cells especially inner methanogens accordingly a slightly fissured surface was observed in the ags interior indicating that significant surface accumulation and associated transport of nano ps into deeper layers of ags likely interfered the formation of granular sludge 3 3 nano ps inhibited physiological activity and eps production of ags live dead microbial cells over the exposure phase were counted the results in fig 3 a showed that the fractions of the dead cells in ags was only 6 3 0 4 in the control whereas the dead cells fraction reached up to 16 7 0 9 when ags was long term exposed to 50 μg l of nano ps as an indispensable component of ags eps contents in the control and experimental reactors were also analyzed in fig 3b throughout the exposure phase eps in ags from each reactor was mainly composed of proteins polysaccharides humic acids lipids and dna compared to the control at the end of the exposure phase the presence of 10 μg l of nano ps substantially increased the proteins polysaccharides and lipids contents of eps by 21 2 0 1 15 5 0 1 and 12 4 0 1 but did not significantly affect the dna concentrations in eps such increases indicated that more eps was secreted as a defense of ags against nanoparticles thereby protecting the inner microbial cells to maintain a comparable performance with control more eps covered on the surface of ags might induce more cells to be adsorbed and accumulate on the surface of the ags which provided a reasonable explanation for the increased particle size of ags after exposed to 10 μg l of nano ps however higher nano ps exposure levels of 20 and 50 μg l reduced the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides humic acids and lipids in eps with the lowest concentrations being approximately 53 1 1 8 mg l 66 4 5 8 mg l 62 5 6 4 mg l and 28 3 1 9 mg l respectively achieved at 50 μg nano ps l a spatial distribution of eps demonstrated that eps were distributed over the granules fig 3c supporting the granule structure and providing defense against the toxic substances aligning with quantification data the presence of higher level nano ps at 50 μg l did cause the significant decreases of eps production with the less proteins α d glucopyranose polysaccharides β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids in contrast the increased level of dna was measured in eps dna is located in the cytoplasm of bacteria and archaea in ags cell death is accompanied by the release of dna from cell inside to outside their releases can therefore indicate the degree of cell deaths wang et al 2018 eps results revealed that high concentrations of nano ps restrained eps generation resulting in a large number of cell deaths which was consistent with the increased dead cells observed in fig 3a ftir analysis in fig 3d disclosed the influence of nano ps on the functional groups of eps it can be seen that all characteristic bands of eps appeared in the ft ir spectra the two discrete peaks at 1649 cm 1 and 1548 cm 1 represented the amido i and amido ii of proteins mu et al 2012 respectively the band at 1025 cm 1 was assigned to c o c of polysaccharides chakravarty et al 2010 the band of 3284 cm 1 are closely related to the stretching vibration of o h and the peak at 1402 cm 1 stem from the deformation or vibration of co yang et al 2015 obviously the peak intensity of these characteristic functional groups in eps from experimental reactor decreased suggesting that the exposure of 50 μg nano ps l reduced the protein and polysaccharides of eps this result was agreement with the above quantification data in particular there was certain shift from 1548 cm 1 1562 cm 1 in amido ii band after the addition of nano ps which might be attributed to the adsorption of nano ps on eps through to the interaction with amido ii group of eps the bands in the range of 1000 500 cm 1 belonged to the fingerprint region 3 4 nano ps reshaped the microbial community of ags the performances of ags during wastewater treatment are closely linked to the microbial community composition illumina sequencing was conducted for control and experimental ags reactors to evaluate the change of the microbial community when exposure to nano ps the similar p 0 5 shannon chao and pd indices in all reactors obtained by alpha diversity analysis fig 4 a revealed that the exposure of nano ps had insignificant impacts on the microbial diversity taxonomic abundance scenarios from the four ags reactors demonstrated general differences in the abundances of anaerobes at the phylum level fig 4b expectedly the euryarchaeota known as methanogens vanwonterghem et al 2014 was dominant with a high abundance of 31 9 40 6 in various ags reactors the abundance of euryarchaeota at nano ps concentrations of 10 μg l was comparable to that in the control conversely as nano ps concentrations increased 20 and 50 μg l their abundances reduced to 35 2 0 4 and 31 9 0 6 respectively when the control was 40 6 0 3 this reduction could be linked to the less methane production observed in this study additionally highly enriched bacteria comprised firmicutes chloroflexi bacteroidetes and actinobacteria which together exceeded about 55 9 of the total bacterial community many microbes in these phyla were regarded as organic compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides degraders ariesyady et al 2007 ags reactors exposure to 20 and 50 μg l comprised lower abundances of these phyla 42 6 0 7 and 38 1 0 5 than the control and experimental reactors exposure to 10 μg l 50 7 1 1 and 51 5 1 6 this suggested that the higher levels of nano ps would decrease the capacity of organic compounds biodegradation the bacterial and archaeal orders related with hydrolysis acidification and methanation in these four ags reactors were compared in fig 4c populations belonging to the orders of clostridiales bacteroidales and syntrophobacterales were known as saccharolytic chemoorganotrophic heterotrophs magnuson et al 2009 the abundance profiles of these populations in the reactor with 10 μg l of nano ps were similar in the control but the higher levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l decreased the abundances of these orders by 30 1 48 7 36 0 48 8 and 48 5 59 7 respectively although these members were not capable of producing methane directly they did have diverse metabolic capabilities that generate substrates for methanation e g polysaccharide fermentation to vfa homoacetogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation sundberg et al 2013 the archaeal populations belonged to the orders methanobacteriales methanosarcinales and methanomicrobiales were known as methanogens which often found together or separately as the dominant methanogens in anaerobic colonizers ariesyady et al 2007 these orders were also less abundant in the experimental reactor exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps than the control further exploration at the genus level fig 4d also confirmed that the higher levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l caused obvious decreases in the abundances of most key anaerobes associated with methane production the genera of longilinea sp and paludibacter sp which have been documented to have ability of degrading organic substances with vfa and hydrogen as their major products yamada et al 2006 luo et al 2016 were less abundant at the higher levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l but no obvious variation was observed at the lower level of 10 μg l compared to the control besides acetoclastic methanosaeta sp and hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium sp sundberg et al 2013 were dominant methanogens in all reactors and their relative abundances were reduced p 0 001 by 33 4 42 9 and 17 6 36 3 after the exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps compared to the control all of these variations suggested that the higher exposure levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l changed microbial communities along the direction against hydrolysis acidification and methanation which was consistent with the deteriorative performances of ags observed in the long term exposure operation 3 5 nano ps redirected the acidification and methanation processes of ags the cod removal from wastewater by ags is generally achieved by the release of methane which undergoes acidification and methanation processes mu and chen 2011 fig 5 a b illustrated the influences of nano ps at 50 μg l on the acidification and methanation by ags during wastewater treatment via a series of batch tests in the acidification stage cod was consumed by ags with the productions of acetic propionic and butyric acids compared to the control the presence of nano ps with 50 μg l remarkably p 3 19e 06 decreased the total vfa concentrations from 925 5 mg cod l to 810 2 mg cod l it also can be seen that the percentage of acetic when exposure to 50 μg nano ps l decreased from 28 6 0 9 to 22 3 0 3 with the increase of propionate from 3 1 0 8 to 8 0 0 8 which might provide an unfavorable substrate form for methanation the data in fig 5b showed that the cumulative methane production converted from acetic acid at 50 μg l of nano ps was 79 4 0 4 of the control obviously the presence of nano ps at 50 μg l induced the adverse impacts on the acidification and methanation processes and methanation step was more sensitive to the toxicity of nano ps 3 6 nano ps induced intracellular oxidative stress on microbes of ags short term exposure assay in fig 5c demonstrates that the presence of nano ps at 50 μg l declined methane production of ags to 85 1 2 4 of the control it was reported that jeong et al 2018 nano ps caused membrane dysfunction of rotifer b koreanus by inducing oxidative stress the extent of oxidative stress is generally examined by ros generation during the exposure period there was a 34 3 0 1 increase in ros level indicating that nano ps caused intracellular oxidative stress at the low level of oxidative stress antioxidant enzymes e g sod and cat as free radical scavengers are induced to mediate this stress forming the defense line against ros induced damages das and roychoudhury 2014 but this protective response transits to pro inflammatory responses when the oxidative stress level is high xia et al 2008 ldh as an indicator of cell membrane integrity showed a corresponding increase to determine the role of intracellular ros induced by nano ps in decreasing methane production from wastewater by ags the extra sod and cat as ros scavengers were dosed with nano ps in the exposure assay results showed that intracellular ros generation after short term exposure to 50 μg l of nano ps decreased to the same level with the control and the inhibition degree of nano ps on methane production was clearly alleviated achieving up to 93 3 of the control a reduced release of ldh was also observed this finding confirmed that ros induced by nano ps played an important role in decreasing the methane production which might be one of key toxicity mechanisms resulted in the deteriorative performances of ags during wastewater treatment 3 7 nano ps leached toxic chemical on microbes of ags according to the manufacturers sds is the only chemical additive used for nano ps processing during the short term exposure the concentrations of sds leaching from nano ps were detected fig s2 while the possible degradation products i e oligomers of nano ps were not detected this indicated that nano ps was scarcely biodegraded in this anaerobic process and sds was the dominant leachate playing the potential role in the system the effects of nano ps at 50 μg l and the corresponding sds on the methane production of ags during wastewater treatment were compared in fig 5d the methane production of ags with nano ps of 50 μg l was 85 1 2 4 of the control whereas methane production in the presence of the corresponding sds leached was 93 9 0 9 of the control thus the sds leached from nano ps would be one factor for nano ps causing toxicity towards ags additionally the activities of sod and cat at the presence of the corresponding sds were 89 4 2 3 and 85 6 1 4 of the control revealing that the sds leached from nano ps also restrained the activities of sod and cat thereby lessening resistance to oxidative stress induced by nano ps 4 discussion to date the actual number of nanoplastics in waste systems was reported to be higher than expected as such the contamination of highly polluted wastewater could be even worse than reported the small size and high specific surface area of nanoplastics facilitate their ingestion by microorganisms and enlarge the impacts on microbial processes for wastewater treatment this study provided a first insight into the influence of nanoplastics on ags for methane recovery from wastewater this work demonstrated that the low exposure level of 10 μg nano ps l had limited impact on ags performance for methane production possibly due to greatly increased secretion of eps fig 3b as a defense of ags protecting the interior microorganisms against nano ps nevertheless our data suggests that ags long term exposed to higher level of 20 50 μg nano ps l experienced a toxic response with an unfavorable consequence for ags performance particle size physiological activity and eps production nano ps agglomerated and a large number of nano ps clusters accumulated on the outer layer of ags and even transferred into deeper layers of ags over exposure time producing toxic effects to adherent sludge cells laboratory based previous toxicity tests have identified the adverse impacts of nanoplastics on microorganisms bhattacharya et al 2010 nolte et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 according to the distribution of microorganism in ags the outer layered microorganisms i e acidogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens may suffer from direct contact with nano ps amplicon sequencing in this work revealed that many key acidogens e g paludibacter sp and petrimonas sp luo et al 2016 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacterium sp and methanolinea sp sundberg et al 2013 were less abundant when long term exposure to higher level of 20 50 μg nano ps l the syntrophic microcolonies in middle layer such as clostridiales bacteroidales and syntrophobacterales magnuson et al 2009 associated with hydrolysis acidification were then attacked by higher level of nano with the decreased abundances it is reported that he et al 2017 the mature ags has a well micro pore structure with an average pore width of 291 5 446 5 nm thus this might make the access of nano ps 50 nm into the internal core and further produce toxic effects on aceticlastic methanogens such as methanosaeta sp detected supporting the variations of microbial community batch exposure assay identified that higher level 50 μg l of nano ps did inhibit acidification and methanation processes during wastewater treatment by ags nanoplastics have been found to cause cytotoxicity towards microalgae and aquatic via induced ros jeong et al 2018 nolte et al 2017 including superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh it is reported that the excessive nanoparticles in aerobic condition could induce extracellular and intracellular ros productions jeong et al 2016 xia et al 2008 some researchers speculated that even in anaerobic condition submicromolar oxygen still existed after succinate respiration the electrons on the active sites of nanoparticles might be trapped by molecular dioxygen o2 with the production of o2 and h2o2 which would further generate ros through fenton chemistry dismutation degli esposti et al 1998 nel et al 2006 however there is still a great argument if extracellular ros would be produced in anaerobic environment on the other hand nanoplastics can attach on the cell surface penetrate cell membrane enter inside cells and produce intracellular ros wang and chen 2016 in this study the microbes in ags were evidenced to produce intracellular ros when exposed to nano ps during anaerobic wastewater treatment in general most cells have the ability of mediating oxidative stress via enzymatic reactions however such capability is limited owing to the restricted number of antioxidant enzymes the excessive ros level can destroy redox balance and cause peroxidation of cells which eventually might result in cellular metabolic disturbance or even death the intracellular ros induced by nano ps was shown to be one of the key toxicity mechanisms revealed by the measured intracellular ros generation and ros scavenger experiment previous research reported that the toxicity of microplastics was strongly associated with the chemical additives leached li et al 2015a b e silva et al 2016 bejgarn et al 2015 as the only additive of nano ps used in this experiment the sds during nano ps exposure period was leaching although their release concentration from nano ps was low agglomeration of nano ps and sludge cells fig 2 resulted in the sds leaching from ps nanoplastics to directly attach the microbial cells especially methanogens thereby causing a certain 6 negative impact on methane production by ags besides in accord with literatures feng et al 2008 the sds were found to be able to restrain the activities of antioxidant enzymes fig 5 thereby lessening resistance of microbial cells against oxidative stress induced by nano ps and aggravating nano ps toxicity towards ags as such the key insights into the influence of nanoplastics on ags unveiled in this study include nano ps at the currently predicted environmental concentration had no significant impacts on the ags performance however if their concentration further increased a significant adverse effect on ags system would be posed nano ps decreased eps generation in ags causing a decline in granule size and cell viability nano ps shifted the microbial communities in ags along the direction against hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis the nano ps suppressed the microbial activity of ags through generating intracellular ros and releasing toxic chemical the sds leached from nano ps restrained the activities of antioxidant enzymes thereby further lessening resistance to oxidative stress induced by nano ps as such nano ps reshaped the ags for recovering methane from wastewater therefore given the increased demand for plastic products and their adverse environmental impact a more holistic approach may require vigilantly managing plastics to reduce littering and developing bio based biodegradable alternative materials to minimize the potential environmental impact of nanoplastics on biotechnological systems such as ags at current stage a longer sludge retention time srt or a larger anaerobic fermenter might be required for achieving the same performance of methane recovery as the ags without significant nanoplastics accumulation if a relatively high amount of nanoplastics entering the ags system the findings of this study are expected to provide a new perspective for the toxicology of nanoplastics and contribute to comprehensively understanding their potential risks on environmental microbes 5 conclusions in the lab scale continuously operated ags system of this work a lower exposure level i e 10 μg l of nano ps did not cause significant effects on the performance of ags while higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps substantially inhibited methane production and cod removal along with vfa accumulation over the 86 d exposure phase the particle size and cell viability of ags became worse after exposure phase when nano ps concentration exceeded 20 μg l more eps was induced by 10 μg l of nano ps to provide protection to the microorganisms from nano ps attack but higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps decreased eps production the microbial community analysis demonstrated that nano ps with 20 50 μg l decreased the abundances of hydrolyzers acidogens e g longilinea sp and paludibacter sp and methanogens i e methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp mechanism studies indicated that the toxicity of nano ps was strongly associated with the oxidative stress induced and sds leached moreover sds leached was found to be able to restrain the activities of antioxidant enzymes thereby further lessening

17822,wastewater has been identified as an important carrier for nanoplastics which could elicit unintended impacts on critical microbial processes however the long term impacts of nanoplastics on anaerobic granular sludge ags for methane recovery from wastewater and the mechanisms involved remains unclear in this study we investigated the long term exposure response relationship between polystyrene nanoplastics nano ps and ags in continuous test over 120 days with 86 days nano ps exposure feeding wastewater with 10 μg l of nano ps had no significant impacts on the ags performance in comparison higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps decreased methane production and chemical oxygen demand cod removal by 19 0 28 6 and 19 3 30 0 respectively along with volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation more extracellular polymeric substance eps was induced by 10 μg l of nano ps as a response to protect microbes but higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps decreased eps generation causing a decline in granule size and cell viability fluorescence tagging found that a large number of nano ps agglomerated accumulated on the outer layer of ags and even transferred into deeper layers of ags over exposure time producing toxic effects to adherent microorganisms e g longilinea sp paludibacter sp and methanosaeta sp the oxidative stress induced by nano ps was revealed to be a key factor for reshaping the ags reflected by the increased reactive oxygen species ros generation and lactate dehydrogenase ldh release the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds leached from nano ps was also demonstrated to restrain the activities of antioxidant enzymes thereby further lessening resistance to oxidative stress induced by nano ps this work improves our ability to predict the risks associated with this ubiquitous contaminant in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanoplastics anaerobic granular sludge polystyrene extracellular polymeric substances eps toxicity 1

of by 2025 cole and galloway 2015 in the environment large plastic litter pieces would suffer multiple natural actions e g weathering uv radiation and microbial degradation leading to the release of microplastics with an uncontrolled range of sizes and shapes cole and galloway 2015 enfrin et al 2020a this prolonged fragmentation progress in water streams will eventually contributes to the

electronics personal care products etc exacerbated the environment release of high amount of nanoplastics hernandez et al 2017 lehner et al 2019 nanoplastics are extremely small in size giving them high stability mobility and bioavailability liu et al 2019 rist et al 2019 posing a toxic threat to the exposed ecosystem recent laboratory studies using model polystyrene nanoplastics nano ps have emphasized that nanoplastics are able to easily pass through biological barriers and accumulate in tissues and organs of organisms e g invertebrates cole and galloway 2015 jeong et al 2018 trevisan et al 2019 aquatic plants nolte et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 and even human lehner et al 2019 triggering a series of adverse responses for microorganism the toxicological research of nanoplastics has so far mainly focused on the anaerobic bacteria and microalgae for example fu et al 2018 demonstrated that nano ps partly inhibited the growth and metabolism of acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes via membrane dysfunction exposure to nanoplastics also has been evidenced to reduce co2 uptake by microalgae which was associated with nanoplastics induced oxidative stress bhattacharya et al 2010 liu et al 2020 nanoplastic toxicity may be related to particle itself and plastic associated chemicals which would depend on the nanoplastic characteristics e g particle size and polymer type jeong et al 2016 lee et al 2013 several studies chen et al 2019 suhrhoff et al 2016 have identified the presence of plastic leachate i e chemical additives after exposure of plastics pieces in water given the nano scale size of nanoplastics the leaching potential of nanoplastic additives seems high specifically studies on barnacle li et al 2015a b mussels e silva et al 2016 and nitocra spinipes bejgarn et al 2015 have indicated that leachate from plastic materials cause acute toxicity it seems likely that nanoplastic additives would also be released to the environment causing toxic effects wastewater has been identified as an important carrier for plastic particles down to the nano scale from urban system to the environment keller et al 2020 mahon et al 2016 intentionally manufacture for industrial purposes and daily life products contribute to the presence of nano microplastics in wastewater nano microplastics can easily travel along wastewater treatment processes and suffer fragmentation under shear stress forces leading to the generation of nano microplastics with smaller size and increasing number of nano microplastics in wastewater by one order of magnitude enfrin et al 2020a in turn the small size and high surface hydrophobicity of nano microplastics facilitate their agglomeration producing the potential influences on wastewater treatment processes enfrin et al 2019 for example the performances of activated sludge processes and sludge treatment can be compromised in the presence of nano microplastics which can directly attach on the sludge cell surface and poison the relevant microorganisms the strong adsorption affinities of nano microplastics also make them serve as carriers for environmental contaminants facilitating the spreading and bioaccumulation of contaminants thereby producing indirectly toxicity anaerobic granular sludge ags technology is widely utilized in high strength wastewater treatment for recovering methane from wastewater latif et al 2011 jensen et al 2014 wei et al 2019 anaerobic granular sludge generally exhibits a particular three layered microbial structure the outer layer is covered by acidogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens the middle layer consists of syntrophic microcolonies and the internal core is predominated by aceticlastic methanogens he et al 2017 mu et al 2012 apart from the microbial distribution structure extracellular polymeric substance eps is another important component of ags to bind cells together and protect the microorganisms as such ags is a complex microbial aggregate with self assembled community of environmental microbes for methane recovery from wastewater a large number of laboratory studies have examined the effects of engineered nanoparticles e g metals and metal oxides nanoparticles carbon nanotubes which depend on their concentration physicochemical properties and contact time chen et al 2012 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2011 insignificant inhibitions of nano zero valent iron nzvi and single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts at the concentration up to 30 mmol l and 1000 mg l on the activity of ags was observed he et al 2017 li et al 2015a b however mu et al 2012 found that the methane production from ags was decreased in the presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps greater than 100 mg g tss in contrast the iron oxide nanoparticles ionps at 750 mg l induced more biogas and methane release from ags ambuchi et al 2017 the nanoplastics are also nano scale in size therefore potentially posing greater influence on ags performance most of previous work focused on the short term a few weeks impacts on anaerobic sludge systems through spiking batch tests and very limited information has so far been reported on the long term months exposure response relationship between nanoplastics and ags via continuous feeding tests that are representative of real wastewater treatment processes also the results of short term exposure studies may fail to capture the effects of the expected agglomeration accumulation of nanoplastics and transport of nanoplastics into deeper layers of ags over extended time thus underestimating the potential toxicity of nanoplastics over long term exposure scenarios more importantly the toxic mechanism of ps nanoplastics to ags is still largely unknown which is the key knowledge gap that needs to be addressed herein we utilized one of the most widely presented nano ps liu et al 2020 as the model nanoplastics to gain a comprehensive insight into the long term influence of nanoplastics on the ags for recovering methane from wastewater from macroscopic to microcosmic aspect the impact of nano ps on the ags was examined in terms of performance granule size distribution and morphology eps architecture live dead cells distribution of ags and microbial community besides the possible agglomeration accumulation and transport of nanoplastics in ags were characterized over long term exposure scenario the toxic mechanisms of nano ps were also specifically explored in terms of the oxidative stress the activities of antioxidant enzymes cell integrity and leachate toxicity on ags induced by nano ps 2 materials and methods 2 1 ags and nanoparticles sources in this study the inoculated ags was obtained from a laboratory mesophilic 35 1 c upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating starch wastewater the average particle diameter of the seed ags was 1 18 mm and the ratio of volatile suspended solid vss to total suspended solid tss was 88 6 polystyrene nanoparticles 5 solids suspension with sizes of 50 nm used in this study were purchased from huizhi biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the morphology of obtained polystyrene nanoparticles was photographed using a motic microscope ba410e china and shown in fig s1 in the supporting information si 2 2 long term ags reactor operation and monitoring protocol the long term experiments were carried out in four uasb reactors with a working volume of 7 l at 35 1 c the inoculation quantity of ags was 2 g tss l the uasb was fed with synthetic wastewater whose composition was listed in the si uasb reactor was continuously operated at an organic loading rate olr of 2 0 kg chemical oxygen demand cod m3 d with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h biogas production rate was recorded using a gas meter and the ph was monitored by a ph meter the four reactor systems were continuously operated for 121 days with two phases i e baseline phase and exposure phase one uasb was served as control system while the other three reactors as experimental systems were conducted for nano ps exposure in baseline phase day 0 35 all systems were operated identically to acclimate ags and establish convergence that is they reached stable and similar cod removal efficiency the exposure phase day 36 121 was started when four systems reached convergence according to literature al sid cheikh et al 2018 the currently predicted environmental concentration of nano ps was 15 μg l for sizes of 50 nm the increased nano ps will be released to the environment due to their wider large scale production thus three test concentrations 10 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps were chosen for exposure assays in exposure phase the control system continued to be fed with synthetic wastewater this control would account for the potential presence of other pollutants in raw ags representing the performance of the raw sludge with other pollutants the other three experimental systems were fed with synthetic wastewater containing nano ps of 10 20 and 50 μg l nano ps stocks were sonicated at 50 khz for 60 s before being diluted to the exposure level size measurement enfrin et al 2020b by dynamic light scattering dls with a malvern autosizer 4700 indicated that the average particle size 50 6 nm of nano ps had not changed before and after sonication during the whole operation period the methane production of each reactor was determined every day the cod and volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations were measured 2 3 times per week in addition triplicate samples were collected from each reactor for microbial community analysis 2 3 ags characterization and eps analysis at the end of the long term nano ps exposure experiments the ags samples were withdrawn from each reactor the surface and interior morphology of ags were visualized using the scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f jeol co japan the granule size of ags was determined using a laser particle size analyzer malvern panalytical uk after pretreatment to eliminate the possible interference of nano ps aggregates in brief the collected ags samples were washed three times using deionized water and added in a serum bottle with 500 ml deionized water and 1 2 g ml sodium chloride after stirring for 15 min the mixture was settled for 2 h to make sure the separation of nano ps aggregates float on the top water layer due to low density and remove them from ags by skimming this extraction operation was carried out in triplicate finally the ags sample was washed with deionized water to remove any salt residues the live dead microorganisms in ags were counted using live deadr baclighttm bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 as detailed in the si fluorescence tagging method erni cassola et al 2017 was used to observe the nano ps in ags briefly nile red technical grade n3013 sigma aldrich was dissolved in methanol achieving a concentration of 1 μg ml ags samples were covered by 2 3 drops of a nile red solution and placed on standard microscope slides after incubation in dark for 10 min at 60 c the stained sample was observed using a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 at excitation and emission of 460 and 525 nm and photographed using an annex digital camera to further observe the nano ps in the intra of granule ags was firstly freezed at 20 c and sectioned into 30 μm sections and then the sections were mounted onto microscope slides for staining the overall porosity of ags samples was measured using hg porosimeter autopore iv9500 usa with the detailed procedure summarized in si the eps production of ags was extracted with the modified oscillation ultrasound combined cationic resin method the detailed procedure was also provided in the si afterwards the concentrations of polysaccharides proteins humic acids lipids and dna in eps extractions were analyzed the eps structures were visualized by multiple fluorescence labeling and confocal laser scanning microscope clsm as detailed in the si the functional groups components of eps were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir nexus 870 with kbr disc technique 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial community in sample was analyzed using illumina miseq sequencing first the sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 rpm then the genomic dna was extracted with the fast dna kit mobio laboratories the quantity and purity of collected dna was determined using nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific the primers 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnv gggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16s dna genes were chosen for real time pcr amplifications the sequence analysis was performed on illumina miseq pf300 platform as detailed in our previous study wei et al 2019 operational units otus were clustered with a 97 similarity for the taxonomic classification analysis 2 5 batch experiments of nano ps impacts on acidification and methanation synthetic wastewater with glucose as cod substances in uasb generally undergoes acidification and methanation processes which collectively affect ags performance for cod removal thus a series of batch tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of nano ps exposure 50 μg l on these two steps in short 100 ml of synthetic wastewater containing corresponding nano ps concentration with 2 g l tss of ags was added in a serum bottle 160 ml moreover 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa 50 mmol l was dosed to eliminate methanogens interference after flushing with nitrogen gas for around 2 min to ensure anaerobic condition each bottle was sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm 35 1 c the productions of vfas after 2 days were analyzed to indicate the impacts of nano ps on the acidification step also the similar operations were carried out to assess the impacts of nano ps on the methanation step except that the glucose in synthetic wastewater was replaced by 2000 mg cod l of sodium acetate and no besa was added after 8 days the methane production was measured all tests were conducted in triplicate 2 6 determination of ros generation and ldh release the extent of oxidative stress induced by nano ps exposure was examined by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros the integrity of the cell membranes was indicated using the amount of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase ldh released hence ros generation and ldh release after nano ps exposure were determined to explore toxic mechanisms of nano ps nano ps exposure assay were carried out with the similar operations described in the batch experiments above without besa addition the methane production during treatment period in each bottle was measured after 8 d the mixture in each test was withdrawn the ros and ldh levels were measured according to methods detailed in the si the superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat are the ros scavengers as the main antioxidant defenses in organisms messina et al 2014 to determine the impacts of oxidative stress induced by nano ps on ags performance 1 g l sod and 1 g l cat were dosed with nano ps in the nano ps exposure assay and then the changes of methane production as well as ros and ldh levels were examined 2 7 chemicals leaching from ps nanoplastics and antioxidant enzymes activities measurements according to the manufacturers sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is the only chemical additive used for nano ps processing not only additives but also the potential biodegradation products of nano ps such as mono and oligomers may also leach out therefore various oligomers of the nano ps in the experiment process were also measured including polystyrene dimers 2 4 diphenyl butene 1 2 diphenylcyclobutane trimers 2 4 6 triphenyl 1 hexene 1 phenyl 4 1 phenylethyl tetralin isomers polystyrene trimer isomer group tetramers polystyrene tetramer isomers and pentamers polystyrene pentamer isomers at different exposure time i e 0 1 3 5 and 7 d the concentrations of chemicals leached were measured through nano ps exposure assay above the experiments of leachates affecting methane production of ags were conducted by nano ps exposure assay above except that nano ps was replaced by the leachates with the corresponding concentration also the activities of sod and cat in the presence of sds were measured more detailed information about the measurements of leachates concentrations as well as sod and cat activities can be found in si 2 8 other analytical methods the measurements of tss vss and cod were performed following standard methods apha 1998 the vfa was determined by a gas chromatograph agilent fid with polar capillary column biogas volume in the continuous uasb reactor was recorded using a gas meter in batch assay the biogas volume in serum bottle was measured by a manometer based on the increased pressure in the headspace volume 60 ml in this study at the standard condition 25 c 1 atm the biogas composition i e h2 ch4 and co2 was analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd lunan 6890 as described in our previous work wei et al 2018 methane production was calculated based on the biogas volume and methane content protein content was analyzed using the bca method with bovine serum albumin as standard smith et al 1985 polysaccharide concentration was measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as standard raunkjaer et al 1994 the commercial olive oil was used as the standard to determine the lipids according to the literature frings et al 1970 the humic acids were analyzed according to the modified lowry method with humic acids fluka as standard frolund et al 1995 dna was analyzed using diphenylamine colorimetry method with calf thymus as a standard solution labarca et al 1980 independent samples t test was applied to evaluate the significant differences of the results and a value of p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant in this work zheng et al 2017 3 results 3 1 nano ps suppressed methane recovery from wastewater by ags the control ags reactor and three experimental ags systems exposed to 10 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps were continuously operated for 121 days with baseline phase and exposure phase fig 1 presented the methane production cod removal rate and vfa concentration in the control and experimental ags reactors during baseline phase following convergence and the entire exposure phase in baseline phase the four ags systems with no nano ps exposure reached convergence on day 30 with stable and similar p 0 05 performances under the steady state condition the average methane production cod removal rate and vfa concentration from day 30 35 in each system reached up to 67 1 ml d mean standard deviations 90 4 0 4 and 115 3 mg cod l respectively in the 86 d exposure phase a lower exposure level i e 10 μg l of nano ps did not cause significant effects p 0 46 and 0 95 on the methane production and cod removal rate of the ags where the average methane production and cod removal rate 64 3 ml d 90 6 2 were comparable to the control 66 3 ml d 90 7 2 however the methane productions in the experimental systems exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps dropped to 51 1 ml d and 45 1 ml d at the end of the exposure representing the relative decreases of 19 0 0 1 p 0 0007 and 28 6 0 1 p 0 0002 respectively fig 2 a aligning with the methane production data with the increase of nano ps exposure level from 20 to 50 μg l the cod removal rate on day 121 decreased from 71 7 0 6 to 62 2 0 8 which were 80 7 0 5 p 1 03e 05 and 70 0 0 1 p 2 75e 06 of the control vfa was an important intermediate product for methane production in the ags reactor and their concentrations also changed over the nano ps exposure period fig 1 the vfa concentrations in the ags reactors exposure to 10 μg l of nano ps were comparable to the control throughout the whole operation period remaining at about 115 mg cod l till the end of the exposure at the higher exposure levels of nano ps i e 20 and 50 μg l the vfa concentrations performed a tendency of increasing and reached up to 340 16 and 453 11 mg cod l at the end of the exposure a possible reason of this vfa accumulation might be that the higher levels of nano ps impeded the consumption of vfa for methane production overall the ags maintained good endurance with long term exposure to a lower level i e 10 μg l of nano ps but higher nano ps concentrations i e 20 and 50 μg l caused the deteriorative performances a cod mass balance was conducted based on the data at the end of the exposure i e on day 121 fig 2b summarized the products distribution converted from cod i e glucose in the control and experimental ags reactors glucose as the only cod component in the feed was 2000 mg cod day over one hrt i e 1 d the cod in four ags reactors included the remaining glucose vfa methane and other products which respectively occupied 4 4 6 7 82 9 and 6 0 in the control reactor hydrogen was detected but the amount was negligible in the experimental systems exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps the remaining glucose was measured and its proportion increased to 11 3 and 15 2 respectively similarly vfa content rose to 17 0 and 22 6 on the contrary the percentage of methane dropped to 67 1 and 59 2 other cod products were possibly mainly from the biomass growth in ags such as microbial cells and eps their proportions decreased to 4 6 and 3 0 with increasing the exposure levels of nano ps from 20 to 50 μg l however others in the experimental systems exposure to lower level i e 10 μg l of nano ps accounted for 7 2 slightly higher than that in the control 6 0 the cod for biomass growth was exactly equivalent to the difference between the utilized cod and the produced methane cod the data indicated that a complete cod balance closure was achieved within measurement error in each ags reactor confirming the higher nano ps concentrations inhibited the conversion of cod for methane and ags populations along with vfa accumulation 3 2 nano ps changed granule size distribution and morphology of ags the size distribution of the ags in the control and experimental reactors exposure to different levels of nano ps 0 10 20 and 50 μg l over the whole exposure phase was expressed as a volume fraction and shown in fig 2c as seen in fig 2c particle size of ags in each reactor exhibited a binomial distribution in the range from 0 1 to 3100 μm the medium particle diameter dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter were listed in table 1 interestingly after 86 d exposure operation the particle size of ags from the reactor exposure to 10 μg l of nano ps presented an increase with the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1290 31 p 0 004 and 1287 16 μm p 0 001 compared to the ags from the control reactor having the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1160 23 and 1167 19 μm nevertheless the ags from the reactors exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps was smaller than that from the control reactor as nano ps exposure concentrations increasing from 20 to 50 μg l the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of ags at the end of exposure operation decreased from 1076 15 and 1105 19 μm to 817 22 and 847 28 μm this revealed that higher nano ps concentrations i e 20 and 50 μg l caused granules breakage during wastewater treatment morphology of ags from control and experimental reactors exposure to 50 μg l of nano ps at the end of exposure operation was observed by sem in fig 2d the surface topography of ags from control reactor was more rigid and stable while the granule from experimental reactor exhibited a fissured even broken surface which was consistent with the smaller granule size measured above a further close up of the structure at higher magnification showed that the interior of control granule was colonized by a large amount of rods with flat ends which was thought to be methanogens macleod et al 1990 while the interior of experimental granule principally contained cocci with very small numbers of rods it was observed from fluorescence images fig 2e that nano ps agglomerated and a large number of nano ps clusters accumulated on the outer layer of ags inducing direct toxic effects to adherent sludge cells the analysis for pore structure of ags showed that the exposure of nano ps decreased the overall porosity of ags from 69 2 to 61 1 suggesting that ags cavities might be clogged by nano ps aggregates making granule denser the cavities were responsible for the transports of biogas and nutrient substances thus their decreases might prevent the biogas emission and nutrition supply which was were correlated to some ags floatation observed in the experimental test to further trace the transport and diffusion of nano ps the internal morphology of ags was observed fluorescence images of the cross section of ags in fig 2f clearly showed that nano ps have transferred into deeper layers of ags over exposure time suggesting an extensive spatial distribution of nano ps in the ags cells which can lead to an enhanced toxicity for sludge cells especially inner methanogens accordingly a slightly fissured surface was observed in the ags interior indicating that significant surface accumulation and associated transport of nano ps into deeper layers of ags likely interfered the formation of granular sludge 3 3 nano ps inhibited physiological activity and eps production of ags live dead microbial cells over the exposure phase were counted the results in fig 3 a showed that the fractions of the dead cells in ags was only 6 3 0 4 in the control whereas the dead cells fraction reached up to 16 7 0 9 when ags was long term exposed to 50 μg l of nano ps as an indispensable component of ags eps contents in the control and experimental reactors were also analyzed in fig 3b throughout the exposure phase eps in ags from each reactor was mainly composed of proteins polysaccharides humic acids lipids and dna compared to the control at the end of the exposure phase the presence of 10 μg l of nano ps substantially increased the proteins polysaccharides and lipids contents of eps by 21 2 0 1 15 5 0 1 and 12 4 0 1 but did not significantly affect the dna concentrations in eps such increases indicated that more eps was secreted as a defense of ags against nanoparticles thereby protecting the inner microbial cells to maintain a comparable performance with control more eps covered on the surface of ags might induce more cells to be adsorbed and accumulate on the surface of the ags which provided a reasonable explanation for the increased particle size of ags after exposed to 10 μg l of nano ps however higher nano ps exposure levels of 20 and 50 μg l reduced the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides humic acids and lipids in eps with the lowest concentrations being approximately 53 1 1 8 mg l 66 4 5 8 mg l 62 5 6 4 mg l and 28 3 1 9 mg l respectively achieved at 50 μg nano ps l a spatial distribution of eps demonstrated that eps were distributed over the granules fig 3c supporting the granule structure and providing defense against the toxic substances aligning with quantification data the presence of higher level nano ps at 50 μg l did cause the significant decreases of eps production with the less proteins α d glucopyranose polysaccharides β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids in contrast the increased level of dna was measured in eps dna is located in the cytoplasm of bacteria and archaea in ags cell death is accompanied by the release of dna from cell inside to outside their releases can therefore indicate the degree of cell deaths wang et al 2018 eps results revealed that high concentrations of nano ps restrained eps generation resulting in a large number of cell deaths which was consistent with the increased dead cells observed in fig 3a ftir analysis in fig 3d disclosed the influence of nano ps on the functional groups of eps it can be seen that all characteristic bands of eps appeared in the ft ir spectra the two discrete peaks at 1649 cm 1 and 1548 cm 1 represented the amido i and amido ii of proteins mu et al 2012 respectively the band at 1025 cm 1 was assigned to c o c of polysaccharides chakravarty et al 2010 the band of 3284 cm 1 are closely related to the stretching vibration of o h and the peak at 1402 cm 1 stem from the deformation or vibration of co yang et al 2015 obviously the peak intensity of these characteristic functional groups in eps from experimental reactor decreased suggesting that the exposure of 50 μg nano ps l reduced the protein and polysaccharides of eps this result was agreement with the above quantification data in particular there was certain shift from 1548 cm 1 1562 cm 1 in amido ii band after the addition of nano ps which might be attributed to the adsorption of nano ps on eps through to the interaction with amido ii group of eps the bands in the range of 1000 500 cm 1 belonged to the fingerprint region 3 4 nano ps reshaped the microbial community of ags the performances of ags during wastewater treatment are closely linked to the microbial community composition illumina sequencing was conducted for control and experimental ags reactors to evaluate the change of the microbial community when exposure to nano ps the similar p 0 5 shannon chao and pd indices in all reactors obtained by alpha diversity analysis fig 4 a revealed that the exposure of nano ps had insignificant impacts on the microbial diversity taxonomic abundance scenarios from the four ags reactors demonstrated general differences in the abundances of anaerobes at the phylum level fig 4b expectedly the euryarchaeota known as methanogens vanwonterghem et al 2014 was dominant with a high abundance of 31 9 40 6 in various ags reactors the abundance of euryarchaeota at nano ps concentrations of 10 μg l was comparable to that in the control conversely as nano ps concentrations increased 20 and 50 μg l their abundances reduced to 35 2 0 4 and 31 9 0 6 respectively when the control was 40 6 0 3 this reduction could be linked to the less methane production observed in this study additionally highly enriched bacteria comprised firmicutes chloroflexi bacteroidetes and actinobacteria which together exceeded about 55 9 of the total bacterial community many microbes in these phyla were regarded as organic compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides degraders ariesyady et al 2007 ags reactors exposure to 20 and 50 μg l comprised lower abundances of these phyla 42 6 0 7 and 38 1 0 5 than the control and experimental reactors exposure to 10 μg l 50 7 1 1 and 51 5 1 6 this suggested that the higher levels of nano ps would decrease the capacity of organic compounds biodegradation the bacterial and archaeal orders related with hydrolysis acidification and methanation in these four ags reactors were compared in fig 4c populations belonging to the orders of clostridiales bacteroidales and syntrophobacterales were known as saccharolytic chemoorganotrophic heterotrophs magnuson et al 2009 the abundance profiles of these populations in the reactor with 10 μg l of nano ps were similar in the control but the higher levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l decreased the abundances of these orders by 30 1 48 7 36 0 48 8 and 48 5 59 7 respectively although these members were not capable of producing methane directly they did have diverse metabolic capabilities that generate substrates for methanation e g polysaccharide fermentation to vfa homoacetogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation sundberg et al 2013 the archaeal populations belonged to the orders methanobacteriales methanosarcinales and methanomicrobiales were known as methanogens which often found together or separately as the dominant methanogens in anaerobic colonizers ariesyady et al 2007 these orders were also less abundant in the experimental reactor exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps than the control further exploration at the genus level fig 4d also confirmed that the higher levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l caused obvious decreases in the abundances of most key anaerobes associated with methane production the genera of longilinea sp and paludibacter sp which have been documented to have ability of degrading organic substances with vfa and hydrogen as their major products yamada et al 2006 luo et al 2016 were less abundant at the higher levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l but no obvious variation was observed at the lower level of 10 μg l compared to the control besides acetoclastic methanosaeta sp and hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium sp sundberg et al 2013 were dominant methanogens in all reactors and their relative abundances were reduced p 0 001 by 33 4 42 9 and 17 6 36 3 after the exposure to 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps compared to the control all of these variations suggested that the higher exposure levels of nano ps at 20 and 50 μg l changed microbial communities along the direction against hydrolysis acidification and methanation which was consistent with the deteriorative performances of ags observed in the long term exposure operation 3 5 nano ps redirected the acidification and methanation processes of ags the cod removal from wastewater by ags is generally achieved by the release of methane which undergoes acidification and methanation processes mu and chen 2011 fig 5 a b illustrated the influences of nano ps at 50 μg l on the acidification and methanation by ags during wastewater treatment via a series of batch tests in the acidification stage cod was consumed by ags with the productions of acetic propionic and butyric acids compared to the control the presence of nano ps with 50 μg l remarkably p 3 19e 06 decreased the total vfa concentrations from 925 5 mg cod l to 810 2 mg cod l it also can be seen that the percentage of acetic when exposure to 50 μg nano ps l decreased from 28 6 0 9 to 22 3 0 3 with the increase of propionate from 3 1 0 8 to 8 0 0 8 which might provide an unfavorable substrate form for methanation the data in fig 5b showed that the cumulative methane production converted from acetic acid at 50 μg l of nano ps was 79 4 0 4 of the control obviously the presence of nano ps at 50 μg l induced the adverse impacts on the acidification and methanation processes and methanation step was more sensitive to the toxicity of nano ps 3 6 nano ps induced intracellular oxidative stress on microbes of ags short term exposure assay in fig 5c demonstrates that the presence of nano ps at 50 μg l declined methane production of ags to 85 1 2 4 of the control it was reported that jeong et al 2018 nano ps caused membrane dysfunction of rotifer b koreanus by inducing oxidative stress the extent of oxidative stress is generally examined by ros generation during the exposure period there was a 34 3 0 1 increase in ros level indicating that nano ps caused intracellular oxidative stress at the low level of oxidative stress antioxidant enzymes e g sod and cat as free radical scavengers are induced to mediate this stress forming the defense line against ros induced damages das and roychoudhury 2014 but this protective response transits to pro inflammatory responses when the oxidative stress level is high xia et al 2008 ldh as an indicator of cell membrane integrity showed a corresponding increase to determine the role of intracellular ros induced by nano ps in decreasing methane production from wastewater by ags the extra sod and cat as ros scavengers were dosed with nano ps in the exposure assay results showed that intracellular ros generation after short term exposure to 50 μg l of nano ps decreased to the same level with the control and the inhibition degree of nano ps on methane production was clearly alleviated achieving up to 93 3 of the control a reduced release of ldh was also observed this finding confirmed that ros induced by nano ps played an important role in decreasing the methane production which might be one of key toxicity mechanisms resulted in the deteriorative performances of ags during wastewater treatment 3 7 nano ps leached toxic chemical on microbes of ags according to the manufacturers sds is the only chemical additive used for nano ps processing during the short term exposure the concentrations of sds leaching from nano ps were detected fig s2 while the possible degradation products i e oligomers of nano ps were not detected this indicated that nano ps was scarcely biodegraded in this anaerobic process and sds was the dominant leachate playing the potential role in the system the effects of nano ps at 50 μg l and the corresponding sds on the methane production of ags during wastewater treatment were compared in fig 5d the methane production of ags with nano ps of 50 μg l was 85 1 2 4 of the control whereas methane production in the presence of the corresponding sds leached was 93 9 0 9 of the control thus the sds leached from nano ps would be one factor for nano ps causing toxicity towards ags additionally the activities of sod and cat at the presence of the corresponding sds were 89 4 2 3 and 85 6 1 4 of the control revealing that the sds leached from nano ps also restrained the activities of sod and cat thereby lessening resistance to oxidative stress induced by nano ps 4 discussion to date the actual number of nanoplastics in waste systems was reported to be higher than expected as such the contamination of highly polluted wastewater could be even worse than reported the small size and high specific surface area of nanoplastics facilitate their ingestion by microorganisms and enlarge the impacts on microbial processes for wastewater treatment this study provided a first insight into the influence of nanoplastics on ags for methane recovery from wastewater this work demonstrated that the low exposure level of 10 μg nano ps l had limited impact on ags performance for methane production possibly due to greatly increased secretion of eps fig 3b as a defense of ags protecting the interior microorganisms against nano ps nevertheless our data suggests that ags long term exposed to higher level of 20 50 μg nano ps l experienced a toxic response with an unfavorable consequence for ags performance particle size physiological activity and eps production nano ps agglomerated and a large number of nano ps clusters accumulated on the outer layer of ags and even transferred into deeper layers of ags over exposure time producing toxic effects to adherent sludge cells laboratory based previous toxicity tests have identified the adverse impacts of nanoplastics on microorganisms bhattacharya et al 2010 nolte et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 according to the distribution of microorganism in ags the outer layered microorganisms i e acidogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens may suffer from direct contact with nano ps amplicon sequencing in this work revealed that many key acidogens e g paludibacter sp and petrimonas sp luo et al 2016 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacterium sp and methanolinea sp sundberg et al 2013 were less abundant when long term exposure to higher level of 20 50 μg nano ps l the syntrophic microcolonies in middle layer such as clostridiales bacteroidales and syntrophobacterales magnuson et al 2009 associated with hydrolysis acidification were then attacked by higher level of nano with the decreased abundances it is reported that he et al 2017 the mature ags has a well micro pore structure with an average pore width of 291 5 446 5 nm thus this might make the access of nano ps 50 nm into the internal core and further produce toxic effects on aceticlastic methanogens such as methanosaeta sp detected supporting the variations of microbial community batch exposure assay identified that higher level 50 μg l of nano ps did inhibit acidification and methanation processes during wastewater treatment by ags nanoplastics have been found to cause cytotoxicity towards microalgae and aquatic via induced ros jeong et al 2018 nolte et al 2017 including superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh it is reported that the excessive nanoparticles in aerobic condition could induce extracellular and intracellular ros productions jeong et al 2016 xia et al 2008 some researchers speculated that even in anaerobic condition submicromolar oxygen still existed after succinate respiration the electrons on the active sites of nanoparticles might be trapped by molecular dioxygen o2 with the production of o2 and h2o2 which would further generate ros through fenton chemistry dismutation degli esposti et al 1998 nel et al 2006 however there is still a great argument if extracellular ros would be produced in anaerobic environment on the other hand nanoplastics can attach on the cell surface penetrate cell membrane enter inside cells and produce intracellular ros wang and chen 2016 in this study the microbes in ags were evidenced to produce intracellular ros when exposed to nano ps during anaerobic wastewater treatment in general most cells have the ability of mediating oxidative stress via enzymatic reactions however such capability is limited owing to the restricted number of antioxidant enzymes the excessive ros level can destroy redox balance and cause peroxidation of cells which eventually might result in cellular metabolic disturbance or even death the intracellular ros induced by nano ps was shown to be one of the key toxicity mechanisms revealed by the measured intracellular ros generation and ros scavenger experiment previous research reported that the toxicity of microplastics was strongly associated with the chemical additives leached li et al 2015a b e silva et al 2016 bejgarn et al 2015 as the only additive of nano ps used in this experiment the sds during nano ps exposure period was leaching although their release concentration from nano ps was low agglomeration of nano ps and sludge cells fig 2 resulted in the sds leaching from ps nanoplastics to directly attach the microbial cells especially methanogens thereby causing a certain 6 negative impact on methane production by ags besides in accord with literatures feng et al 2008 the sds were found to be able to restrain the activities of antioxidant enzymes fig 5 thereby lessening resistance of microbial cells against oxidative stress induced by nano ps and aggravating nano ps toxicity towards ags as such the key insights into the influence of nanoplastics on ags unveiled in this study include nano ps at the currently predicted environmental concentration had no significant impacts on the ags performance however if their concentration further increased a significant adverse effect on ags system would be posed nano ps decreased eps generation in ags causing a decline in granule size and cell viability nano ps shifted the microbial communities in ags along the direction against hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis the nano ps suppressed the microbial activity of ags through generating intracellular ros and releasing toxic chemical the sds leached from nano ps restrained the activities of antioxidant enzymes thereby further lessening resistance to oxidative stress induced by nano ps as such nano ps reshaped the ags for recovering methane from wastewater therefore given the increased demand for plastic products and their adverse environmental impact a more holistic approach may require vigilantly managing plastics to reduce littering and developing bio based biodegradable alternative materials to minimize the potential environmental impact of nanoplastics on biotechnological systems such as ags at current stage a longer sludge retention time srt or a larger anaerobic fermenter might be required for achieving the same performance of methane recovery as the ags without significant nanoplastics accumulation if a relatively high amount of nanoplastics entering the ags system the findings of this study are expected to provide a new perspective for the toxicology of nanoplastics and contribute to comprehensively understanding their potential risks on environmental microbes 5 conclusions in the lab scale continuously operated ags system of this work a lower exposure level i e 10 μg l of nano ps did not cause significant effects on the performance of ags while higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps substantially inhibited methane production and cod removal along with vfa accumulation over the 86 d exposure phase the particle size and cell viability of ags became worse after exposure phase when nano ps concentration exceeded 20 μg l more eps was induced by 10 μg l of nano ps to provide protection to the microorganisms from nano ps attack but higher levels i e 20 and 50 μg l of nano ps decreased eps production the microbial community analysis demonstrated that nano ps with 20 50 μg l decreased the abundances of hydrolyzers acidogens e g longilinea sp and paludibacter sp and methanogens i e methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp mechanism studies indicated that the toxicity of nano ps was strongly associated with the oxidative stress induced and sds leached moreover sds leached was found to be able to restrain the activities of antioxidant enzymes thereby further lessening

17823,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are major reservoirs and sources for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance into the environment in this study the population dynamics of two full scale wwtps was characterized along different sampling points including the reused effluents in both cellular and extracellular dna samples the analysis was performed by high throughput sequencing targeting the 16s rrna v4 gene region and by three in house taqman multiplex qpcr assays that detect and quantify the most clinically relevant and globally distributed carbapenem bla and fluoro quinolone qnr resistance genes the obtained results identify the biological treatment as the crucial step on tailoring the wastewater bacterial community which is thereafter maintained in both discharged and reused effluents the influent bacterial community does not alter the wwtp core community although it clearly contributes for the introduction and spread of antibiotic resistance to the in house bacteria the presence of high concentrations of bla and qnr genes was not only detected in the wastewater influents and discharged effluents but also in the reused effluents which therefore represent another gateway for antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes into the environment and directly to the human populations moreover and together with the study of the cellular dna it was described for the first time the role of the extracellular dna in the dissemination of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance as well as the impact of the wastewater treatment process on this dna fraction altogether the results prove that the current wastewater treatments are inefficient in the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes and reinforce that targeted treatments must be developed and implemented at full scale in the wwtps for wastewater reuse to become a safe and sustainable practice able to be implemented in areas such as agricultural irrigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance carbapenems fluoro quinolones wastewater treatment plants reused wastewater extracellular dna 1 introduction in the last decades antibiotics abs have been increasingly used in human and veterinary medicine as well as in other areas such as agriculture livestock and aquaculture considerable fractions of these pharmaceuticals are excreted into sewage in their unmetabolized original forms or as active and inactive metabolites ending up in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps jelic et al 2011 therefore the bacterial communities present in the wwtps are continuously exposed to sub inhibitory concentrations of different abs which promotes the selection and spread of resistances davies et al 2006 moreover and since the conventional wastewater treatments are not designed for the removal of ab resistant bacteria and genes wwtps are considered major anthropogenic reservoirs and sources for the dissemination of these pollutants into the environment guo et al 2017 michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 the presence of ab resistant bacteria and genes towards the most commonly used classes of abs have been extensively reported in the influents and effluents of several wwtps worldwide cacace et al 2019 mao et al 2015 munir et al 2011 rafraf et al 2016 however the resistance towards last line abs such as carbapenems has only started to be assessed in the wastewaters more recently and further studies are still required to fully understand not only the occurrence of these resistant bacteria and genes in the distinct geographic locations but also their fate along the most critical steps of different wastewater treatment processes carbapenems are currently one of the most important classes of abs used to treat severe and persistent multiresistant infections caused by both gram positive and gram negative bacteria kattan et al 2008 papp wallace et al 2011 nevertheless their efficiency is threatened by the global emergence and spread of carbapenem resistant bacteria which harbour carbapenem resistance genes that express carbapenemases carbapenemases are a particular group of β lactamases that inactivate carbapenems and other β lactam abs papp wallace et al 2011 poirel et al 2007 walsh 2010 regarding their clinical relevance and global distribution the most important carbapenemases are 1 the class a serine β lactamases of the kpc type 2 the class b metallo β lactamases of the ndm imp and vim types 3 the class d serine β lactamases of the oxa 48 type nordmann et al 2012 pfeifer et al 2010 as with other β lactamases the majority of the carbapenemase encoding genes are located in conjugative plasmids which makes them easily transferable between bacteria and favours their fast and wide distribution nordmann et al 2012 pfeifer et al 2010 schultsz and geerlings 2012 the co occurrence of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the same plasmids is common schultsz and geerlings 2012 strahilevitz et al 2009 in fact the most relevant fluoro quinolone resistance genes which correspond to the qnra qnrb and qnrs type genes have multiple variants identified and numerous reports of co localization with carbapenemase encoding genes in conjugative plasmids leading to their simultaneous transfer even when bacteria are only pressured by one ab schultsz and geerlings 2012 strahilevitz et al 2009 these fluoro quinolone resistance genes have already been identified and are often present along the different steps of several wastewater treatment processes worldwide auguet et al 2017 mao et al 2015 neudorf et al 2017 rafraf et al 2016 however little is still known about their likely co occurrence with carbapenem resistance genes in such environments recent studies have reported the detection of both carbapenem resistant bacteria and genes in the wastewater influents and discharged effluents of different wwtps of europe auguet et al 2017 cacace et al 2019 pärnänen et al 2019 asia lamba and ahammad 2017 yang et al 2016 and northern america mathys et al 2019 naquin et al 2017 nevertheless there are still major gaps in the current knowledge that have to be overcome to better demonstrate the importance of the environmental sector in the global resistance to both carbapenems and fluoro quinolones 1 the search for all main carbapenem resistance genes to provide a more accurate picture regarding the carbapenem resistome present in the wwtps 2 the look for the possible co occurrence of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes since the resistance to these two classes of abs is often simultaneously transferred between bacteria 3 the analysis of reused wastewater samples which can represent an additional gateway for ab resistant bacteria and genes into the environment and directly to the human populations 4 the focus not only on the cellular dna but also on the free extracellular dna edna which can harbour an important fraction of ab resistance genes that are able to be assimilated by non resistant bacteria via natural transformation this study addresses these questions and provides a deep insight on the occurrence and characterization of the carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistome from the anthropogenic produced wastewater influents to the reused streams in two portuguese full scale wwtps to achieve such goal the main objectives are 1 characterize the bacterial community composition along different sampling points of the two wwtps by high throughput sequencing targeting the 16s rrna v4 gene region 2 investigate the prevalence and fate of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in dna and edna samples using three in house taqman multiplex qpcr assays 3 assess whether the different designs and operational conditions of the two wwtps impact differently the removal of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistant bacteria and genes preventing them from reaching the environment and or directly the human populations by wastewater reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtps design description and sample collection two portuguese full scale wwtps from the metropolitan lisbon area were selected for this study 1 the wwtp a was designed to treat the domestic wastewater of approximately 756 000 population equivalents p e and employs a biological treatment step with biological aerated filters baf most of the produced effluent is discharged into the tagus river and a smaller fraction is filtered through a cartridge filter disinfected with the addition of sodium hypochlorite and then reused for green park irrigation and street washing purposes 2 the wwtp b was designed to treat the domestic wastewater of approximately 211 000 p e and employs the conventional biological nutrient removal by activated sludge bnr as after the biological treatment step the wastewater is filtered through a sand filter being most of the produced effluent discharged into the tagus river the remaining effluent is disinfected with the addition of sodium hypochlorite and then reused for green park irrigation and street washing purposes for each wwtp four sampling points were defined and a total sample of 30 l consisting in three biological replicates of 10 l was collected from each one in sterile containers in april 9 2019 the samples were transported to the laboratory under refrigerated conditions and immediately processed upon arrival

primarily filtered in triplicate through 0 45 μm pore size polyethersulfone filters pall corporation new york usa and the resulting filtrates were again filtered through 0 22 μm pore size polyethersulfone filters pall corporation new york usa filtration volumes were defined by clogging of the filters as a measure of the same amount of filtered biomass therefore volumes of 30 ml for wwtp a and 35 ml for wwtp b from sampling point 1 90 ml for wwtp a and 350 ml for wwtp b from sampling point 2 200 ml for wwtp a and 550 ml for wwtp b from sampling point 3 and 250 ml for wwtp a and

these taqman qpcr reactions were retrieved from the literature or designed in the course of this study for that multiple alignments of reference sequences retrieved from genbank and resfinder zankari et al 2012 for each target gene were executed on mafft 7 katoh and standley 2013 and the design of the primers and probes was performed using a combination of tools including multiple primer analyzer

then purified using the nzygelpure kit nzytech lisbon portugal inserted into pgem t easy vector systems promega madison usa and transformed into jm109 competent cells promega madison usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the selection was based on the inactivation of β galactosidase and the recombinant clones were distinguished by blue white colonies all white positive clones for each target gene were selected and plasmids were extracted using the standard protocol from the nzyminiprep kit nzytech lisbon portugal sanger sequencing was performed to ensure the specificity and correct insertion of the purified pcr products in the corresponding plasmids plasmid dna concentrations and purity were measured using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham usa gene copy numbers were calculated as previously described by ritalahti et al 2006 and standard curves for each target gene were generated from tenfold dilutions of the extracted plasmids ranging from 107 to 100 gene copy numbers μl 1 which allowed the assessment of the efficiency and sensitivity of each taqman qpcr 2 3 4 detection and quantification of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes by taqman multiplex qpcr the quantification of the target carbapenem bla and fluoro quinolone qnr resistance genes as well as of the 16s rrna gene was conducted in triplicate on a lightcycler 96 real time pcr system roche basel switzerland using the following program dna denaturation polymerase activation at 95 c for 5 min 40 cycles of amplification at 95 c for 10 s and 60 c for 30 s information about the mix reactions of each taqman qpcr is provided in table 3 2 4 statistical analysis a principal component analysis pca was performed to identify the samples with similar bacterial community compositions additionally several one way analysis of variance tests anova were conducted to compare the mean values of both the bacterial community composition and the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes along the different sampling points of each wwtp and or between the corresponding sampling points of both wwtps different methodologies were adopted depending on whether the variances were homogeneous or not the homogeneity of the variances was previously evaluated with different levene s tests table s4 s5 and s6 1 if the resulting differences were significant the variances were not considered homogeneous and an anova with the dunnett t3 post hoc test was performed 2 if the resulting differences were not significant the variances were considered homogeneous and an anova with the tukey post hoc test was performed these statistical analyses were performed using the spss 26 software ibm armonk usa and the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 bacterial community composition of the wastewater samples according to the pca performed the bacterial community composition of both wastewater influents was similar fig 2 however the impact of the two distinct biological treatments resulted in the formation of two bacterial communities that were simultaneously different from the respective influent samples and from each other fig 2 regarding a higher taxonomic level the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria were predominant in all sampling points of the two wwtps fig 3 a table s7 nevertheless significant differences p 0 05 in their relative abundances were observed not only between the corresponding sampling points of both wwtps but also after the biological treatment of each wwtp fig 3a tables s7 s8 and s9 in wwtp a the decrease in the relative abundance of the firmicutes from 45 26 to 9 73 was simultaneous to the increase in the relative abundances of the phyla bacteroidetes from 2 42 to 30 51 and proteobacteria from 36 62 to 55 07 fig 3a table s7 in wwtp b the decrease in the relative abundances of the firmicutes from 33 76 to 12 33 and proteobacteria from 51 37 to 39 16 was simultaneous to the increase in the relative abundance of the phylum actinobacteria from 5 19 to 19 75 fig 3a table s7 at a lower taxonomic level bacteria belonging to several genera associated with the human intestinal microbiota such as bifidobacterium blautia comamonas faecalibacterium and jeotgalibaca were well represented in the wastewater influents of the two wwtps despite being efficiently outcompeted or retained at the biological treatment step fig 3b table s10 bacteria belonging to genera associated with potential opportunistic pathogens were also detected with high relative abundances in the influents of both wwtps fig 3b table s10 in fact the genus acinetobacter was the most represented of all genera in the influents of the two wwtps with a relative abundance of 13 42 in wwtp a and 26 75 in wwtp b being also detected in the discharged effluent of wwtp a with a relative abundance of 5 52 and along the remaining sampling points of wwtp b with relative abundances of 3 23 in sampling point 2 2 85 in sampling point 3 and 2 54 in sampling point 4 fig 3b table s10 moreover the genera moraxella and streptococcus were found in both wastewater influents with relative abundances of 6 14 and 3 32 respectively in wwtp a and 7 57 and 3 36 respectively in wwtp b also the genus arcobacter was found along all sampling points of wwtp b with relative abundances ranging from 4 25 to 5 98 fig 3b table s10 after the biological treatment step bacteria from the genus pseudomonas were found in the reused effluent of wwtp a with a relative abundance of 3 40 and besides the previously mentioned genera acinetobacter and arcobacter bacteria belonging to the genera bacteroides clostridium corynebacterium and mycobacterium were found in the discharged and reused effluents of wwtp b with relative abundances of 1 58 2 49 1 03 and 1 61 respectively in the discharged effluent and 2 97 3 78 1 67 and 1 78 respectively in the reused effluent fig 3b table s10 3 2 carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes present in the wastewater samples for each taqman qpcr standard curves were generated by tenfold dilutions of the templates which allowed the estimation of the efficiency coefficient of correlation r2 and sensitivity of the reactions table 4 all taqman qpcr reactions had amplification efficiencies between 86 80 and 102 49 coefficients of correlation r2 between 0 9867 and 0 9999 and sensitivities of 10 gene copy numbers μl 1 table 4 the specificity of each qpcr reaction was also assessed with no detection of any nonspecific amplification products within the set of templates used table s11 regarding the study of the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells the quantification of the 16s rrna gene was performed to assess the bacterial abundance in the different sampling points of the two wwtps the obtained concentrations ranged from 9 3 109 to 1 8 108 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp a and from 6 6 109 to 2 9 107 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp b fig 4 table s12 in both wwtps a significant decrease p 0 05 of the bacterial abundance was observed after the biological treatment step fig 4 tables s12 and s13 nevertheless the 16s rrna gene remained present at high concentrations in the discharged and reused effluents of the two wwtps fig 4 table s12 as for the ab resistance genes seven out of the eight target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 bla ndm bla vim qnra qnrb and qnrs were detected at high concentrations in both wastewater influents fig 4 table s12 the most abundant resistance genes in the influent of wwtp a were the qnrs and bla vim with concentrations of 2 7 107 and 7 2 106 gene copy numbers ml 1 respectively fig 4a table s12 in the influent of wwtp b the most abundant resistance genes were the bla vim and bla oxa 48 with concentrations of 9 4 105 and 4 0 105 gene copy numbers ml 1 respectively fig 4b table s12 despite the reduction in the average abundance of the target resistance genes observed in the two wwtps after the biological treatment step the bla kpc bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes were detected along all sampling points of both wwtps fig 4 table s12 in fact the discharged and reused effluents presented considerable concentrations of these genes ranging from 5 2 105 to 4 6 104 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent of wwtp a from 2 4 104 to 3 9 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent of wwtp b from 6 9 104 to 6 9 103 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent of wwtp a and from 2 8 104 to 7 2 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent of wwtp b fig 4 table s12 the unexpected single detection of the bla oxa 48 gene in the reused effluent of wwtp a was understood by us as a sporadic event that is not representative of this sampling point and that was probably due to a punctual development of a bacterial biofilm harbouring this resistance gene in the pipeline transporting the reused effluent fig 4a table s12 in the study of the edna the 16s rrna gene was also detected along all sampling points of both wwtps at concentrations that ranged from 2 9 106 to 1 1 105 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp a and from 1 7 106 to 2 7 104 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp b fig 5 table s14 contrary to the analysis of this gene in the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells in the edna samples these values do not represent bacterial abundance but free naked bacterial edna in the influent of wwtp a four out of the eight target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes bla oxa 48 bla vim qnrb and qnrs were detected at concentrations ranging from 1 2 105 to 2 6 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 fig 5a table s14 three of these genes bla vim qnrb and qnrs were detected along all sampling points including the discharged and reused effluents at concentrations that ranged from 3 9 103 to 3 9 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent and from 2 1 104 to 2 5 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent fig 5a table s14 in the influent of wwtp b five out of the eight target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 bla vim qnrb and qnrs were detected at concentrations ranging from 1 0 104 to 5 7 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 fig 5b table s14 one of these genes bla vim was detected along all sampling points including the discharged and reused effluents at a concentration of 5 3 103 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent and 3 2 103 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent fig 5b table s14 4 discussion the most abundant phyla and genera found in the two wastewater influents under study are in agreement with previous studies pointing out that the phylogenetic groups present in the influent samples are generally the same worldwide despite the differences in their relative abundances that are observed between wwtps mclellan et al 2010 narciso da rocha et al 2018 numberger et al 2019 also the presence of bacteria belonging to several genera associated with potential opportunistic pathogens namely the genera acinetobacter moraxella and streptococcus in wwtp a and the genera acinetobacter arcobacter moraxella and streptococcus in wwtp b suggests that these can be the main hosts of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in both wastewater influents and the main responsible for the entrance of these ab resistance genes in the two wwtps both bacterial communities underwent important changes in their compositions during the wastewater treatment process being most of them tailored by the biological treatment step in fact previous studies have already shown that the majority of the bacteria present in the wastewater influents are not able to persist under the operational and environmental conditions of the biological treatment units highlighting that their impact on the wwtp core community is almost negligible hashimoto et al 2014 lee et al 2015 saunders et al 2016 the biological reactors are usually designed to simultaneously promote and control the microbial populations that are relevant for the removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus offering special growth conditions that are not often found in other environments therefore the dilution of the influent load of anthropogenic bacteria combined with their lesser ability to adapt to such specific environments explains the low impact of the wastewater influents on the wwtp core community and the consequent high removal rate of these bacteria during the biological treatment step however the results from both the relative abundance of the 16s rrna gene and the quantification of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes suggest that a fraction of this influent community which includes several potential opportunistic pathogens can either pass successfully throughout the two wastewater treatment processes and or horizontally transfer genetic traits such as ab resistance genes to the well adapted in house community furthermore the results confirm that neither biological treatments studied have the ability to completely prevent some of the in house biomass to continue downstream on the wastewater treatment process which is in agreement with the literature hashimoto et al 2014 liu et al 2007 tong et al 2019 since most of the bacteria present in the wastewater influents are eliminated during the biological treatment step these in house bacteria seem to be indeed the main hosts of the target ab resistance genes in the treated effluents lastly it is important to mention that the bacterial community composition of each wwtp evolved differently after the biological treatment step which can be explained by the distinct design and operational conditions of each wwtp wwtp a applies a baf technology where a biofilm support medium commonly known as carriers is submerged in the wastewater creating a large contact area that firstly selects for bacteria that are able to grow attached to a solid surface by the production of specific molecules of the extracellular polymeric matrix afterwards further bacteria are recruited to form a mature attached biofilm this system is designed to perform a simultaneous biological treatment of the organic matter followed by a physical filtration targeting the size of the carriers wwtp b applies a bnr as technology in which the activated sludge is formed by microorganisms agglomerating together in suspended biofilms known as suspended flocs also due to the production of an extracellular polymeric substance that in this case is not relevant for the adherence to a surface when the activated sludge is transferred into the settling tanks the flocs sediment and the treated wastewater is removed from the top therefore and as previously described each wwtp exerts a distinct selective pressure that shapes differently the corresponding bacterial community tong et al 2019 altogether these results reinforce that regardless of the differences in the design and operational conditions of each wwtp the conventionally applied wastewater treatments are inefficient in the complete removal of bacteria that can be potentially pathogenic and or harbour ab resistance genes from both discharged and reused effluents contributing to their dissemination into the environment and or to the human populations the high concentrations of carbapenem resistance genes present in the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells of both wastewater influents reflect the increasing resistance in the community towards this group of last line abs moreover their presence is coincident with high relative abundances of several bacteria belonging to genera associated with known carbapenem resistant bacteria such as the acinetobacter genus which further reinforces that they can be the main hosts of these genes in the influent samples regardless of the treatments applied the bla kpc bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes were detected along all sampling points of the two wwtps both biological treatments led to decreases of only 1 2 logs in the concentrations of these ab resistance genes with no considerable differences in terms of efficiency between them since wwtp b has a lower initial load of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes and also applies a sand filtration step immediately after the biological treatment step the discharged effluent of this wwtp present lower concentrations of the target ab resistance genes than the discharged effluent of wwtp a however these differences are less visible when comparing the reused effluents of both wwtps which shows that both cartridge and sand filtrations have similar performances also the addition of sodium hypochlorite to the reused effluents had almost no impact on the concentrations of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the two wwtps stressing that this disinfection method must be replaced it is interesting to note that although the bla kpc bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes still maintain high concentrations in the discharged and reused effluents of both wwtps the composition of the bacterial communities is considerably different after the two biological treatment steps these results are in agreement with the previously described co localization of both carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the same conjugative plasmids schultsz and geerlings 2012 strahilevitz et al 2009 and suggest that the conjugation of such plasmids occurs between the incoming and the in house bacteria that find suitable conditions on the biological tanks to efficiently interact and share their mobile genetic elements recent studies have already reported the presence of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the wastewater treatment processes of several european wwtps auguet et al 2017 cacace et al 2019 pärnänen et al 2019 indicating that the majority of these genes is present at higher concentrations in the southern european wwtps rather than in those of northern europe pärnänen et al 2019 this is in line with the high concentrations of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes found in this study these observations can be explained not only by the differences at the level of the ab consumption pattern between northern and southern european countries but also possibly by the warmer waters of southern europe which may be another favourable factor for the bacterial growth and a major driver of ab resistance in the environment pärnänen et al 2019 altogether the results obtained with the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells point out for the inefficiency of the conventionally applied wastewater treatments in the removal of different carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes from both discharged and reused effluents this raises the awareness that the legislation on the recycled wastewater quality must be revised taking into consideration the current scientific studies and that the microbial indicators referred are outdated leaving behind human health menaces such as ab resistant bacteria and genes either transported by their initial bacterial hosts able to survive to the wastewater treatment process or horizontally transferred to the well adapted environmental bacteria the presence of these genes in the discharged and reused effluents make them a source of ab resistance dissemination into the environment and back to the human populations although a few recent studies have started to search for ab resistance genes in the edna fraction of different environmental samples dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 this is the first study to the best of our knowledge to undertake a comprehensive analysis on the concentrations of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the edna fraction of wastewaters in fact considerable concentrations of these resistance genes were detected in the edna samples of both wastewater influents and for certain genes along all sampling points of the two wwtps the results support recent research highlighting that the study of the ab resistance in the edna should not be neglected as it can harbour an important fraction of the environmental resistome dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 the bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes were detected along all sampling points of wwtp a with no important changes in their concentrations detected between the wastewater influent and the treated effluents in fact the presence of these three resistance genes in the edna fraction which only represent a minimum percentage of their total concentrations in the influent samples correspond to respectively 23 33 3 50 and 1 84 of their total concentrations in the reused effluent in wwtp b only the bla vim gene was detected along all sampling points being the other four resistance genes found in the corresponding wastewater influent efficiently eliminated during the biological treatment or the sand filtration steps the edna present in these wastewater samples can derive from both cellular extrusion mechanisms or cell lysis resulting in the release of chromosomal dna mobile genetic elements and phages that can be protected against nucleases and able to be assimilated via natural transformation by staying integrated in the extracellular polymeric matrix surrounding the bacteria or adsorbed to colloids sand particles clay minerals and humic substances dong et al 2019 ibáñez de aldecoa et al 2017 pietramellara et al 2009 vlassov et al 2007 comparing both wastewater treatments the results clearly show that the bnr as technology possibly by retention of the edna and the sand filtration possibly by edna sorption have a higher efficiency in the removal of the edna than the baf technology and the cartridge filtration also and similar to what was observed in the study of the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells the addition of sodium hypochlorite to the reused effluents had no visible impact on the concentrations of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes present in the edna samples of the two wwtps once again reinforcing the need for alternative disinfection methods altogether these results demonstrate that the elimination of the edna is another important issue that wwtps will have to overcome when the industry will start to actively tackle the ab related pollution since it constitutes an additional source for the dissemination of the ab resistance 5 conclusions in this study it was clearly demonstrated that the wwtps represent a major vehicle for the dissemination of the ab resistance and was further detailed the great importance of the environmental sector on the ab resistance spreading cycle underlying the one health approach it was possible to conclude that 1 the biological treatment is the most important step on shaping the bacterial community composition as well as on affecting the concentrations of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes along the wastewater treatment process 2 regardless of the different designs and treatments applied in the two wwtps carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes persisted at high concentrations in both dna and edna fractions of the discharged and reused effluents 3 the conventionally applied treatments for wastewater reuse are clearly inefficient being this stream a direct gateway for the dissemination of ab resistant bacteria and genes back to the human populations 4 the edna fraction of the wastewater is a relevant source of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes representing an additional path for the dissemination of the ab resistance for wastewater reuse to become a safe and reliable practice in the near future able to be implemented as a sustainable alternative in areas such as agricultural irrigation targeted treatments towards ab resistant bacteria and genes must

17823,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are major reservoirs and sources for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance into the environment in this study the population dynamics of two full scale wwtps was characterized along different sampling points including the reused effluents in both cellular and extracellular dna samples the analysis was performed by high throughput sequencing targeting the 16s rrna v4 gene region and by three in house taqman multiplex qpcr assays that detect and quantify the most clinically relevant and globally distributed carbapenem bla and fluoro quinolone qnr resistance genes the obtained results identify the biological treatment as the crucial step on tailoring the wastewater bacterial community which is thereafter maintained in both discharged and reused effluents the influent bacterial community does not alter the wwtp core community although it clearly contributes for the introduction and spread of antibiotic resistance to the in house bacteria the presence of high concentrations of bla and qnr genes was not only detected in the wastewater influents and discharged effluents but also in the reused effluents which therefore represent another gateway for antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes into the environment and directly to the human populations moreover and together with the study of the cellular dna it was described for the first time the role of the extracellular dna in the dissemination of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance as well as the impact of the wastewater treatment process on this dna fraction altogether the results prove that the current wastewater treatments are inefficient in the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes and reinforce that targeted treatments must be developed and implemented at full scale in the wwtps for wastewater reuse to become a safe and sustainable practice able to be implemented in areas such as agricultural irrigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance carbapenems fluoro quinolones wastewater treatment plants reused wastewater extracellular dna 1 introduction in the last decades antibiotics abs have been increasingly used in human and veterinary medicine as well as in other areas such as agriculture livestock and aquaculture considerable fractions of these pharmaceuticals are excreted into sewage in their unmetabolized original forms or as active and inactive metabolites ending up in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps jelic et al 2011 therefore the bacterial communities present in the wwtps are continuously exposed to sub inhibitory concentrations of different abs which promotes the selection and spread of resistances davies et al 2006 moreover and since the conventional wastewater treatments are not designed for the removal of ab resistant bacteria and genes wwtps are considered major anthropogenic reservoirs and sources for the dissemination of these pollutants into the environment guo et al 2017 michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 the presence of ab resistant bacteria and genes towards the most commonly used classes of abs have been extensively reported in the influents and effluents of several wwtps worldwide cacace et al 2019 mao et al 2015 munir et al 2011 rafraf et al 2016 however the resistance towards last line abs such as carbapenems has only started to be assessed in the wastewaters more recently and further studies are still required to fully understand not only the occurrence of these resistant bacteria and genes in the distinct geographic locations but also their fate along the most critical steps of different wastewater treatment processes carbapenems are currently one of the most important classes of abs used to treat severe and persistent multiresistant infections caused by both gram positive and gram negative bacteria kattan et al 2008 papp wallace et al 2011 nevertheless their efficiency is threatened by the global emergence and spread of carbapenem resistant bacteria which harbour carbapenem resistance genes that express carbapenemases carbapenemases are a particular group of β lactamases that inactivate carbapenems and other β lactam abs papp wallace et al 2011 poirel et al 2007 walsh 2010 regarding their clinical relevance and global distribution the most important carbapenemases are 1 the class a serine β lactamases of the kpc type 2 the class b metallo β lactamases of the ndm imp and vim types 3 the class d serine β lactamases of the oxa 48 type nordmann et al 2012 pfeifer et al 2010 as with other β lactamases the majority of the carbapenemase encoding genes are located in conjugative plasmids which makes them easily transferable between bacteria and favours their fast and wide distribution nordmann et al 2012 pfeifer et al 2010 schultsz and geerlings 2012 the co occurrence of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the same plasmids is common schultsz and geerlings 2012 strahilevitz et al 2009 in fact the most relevant fluoro quinolone resistance genes which correspond to the qnra qnrb and qnrs type genes have multiple variants identified and numerous reports of co localization with carbapenemase encoding genes in conjugative plasmids leading to their simultaneous transfer even when bacteria are only pressured by one ab schultsz and geerlings 2012 strahilevitz et al 2009 these fluoro quinolone resistance genes have already been identified and are often present along the different steps of several wastewater treatment processes worldwide auguet et al 2017 mao et al 2015 neudorf et al 2017 rafraf et al 2016 however little is still known about their likely co occurrence with carbapenem resistance genes in such environments recent studies have reported the detection of both carbapenem resistant bacteria and genes in the wastewater influents and discharged effluents of different wwtps of europe auguet et al 2017 cacace et al 2019 pärnänen et al 2019 asia lamba and ahammad 2017 yang et al 2016 and northern america mathys et al 2019 naquin et al 2017 nevertheless there are still major gaps in the current knowledge that have to be overcome to better demonstrate the importance of the environmental sector in the global resistance to both carbapenems and fluoro quinolones 1 the search for all main carbapenem resistance genes to provide a more accurate picture regarding the carbapenem resistome present in the wwtps 2 the look for the possible co occurrence of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes since the resistance to these two classes of abs is often simultaneously transferred between bacteria 3 the analysis of reused wastewater samples which can represent an additional gateway for ab resistant bacteria and genes into the environment and directly to the human populations 4 the focus not only on the cellular dna but also on the free extracellular dna edna which can harbour an important fraction of ab resistance genes that are able to be assimilated by non resistant bacteria via natural transformation this study addresses these questions and provides a deep insight on the occurrence and characterization of the carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistome from the anthropogenic produced wastewater influents to the reused streams in two portuguese full scale wwtps to achieve such goal the main objectives are 1 characterize the bacterial community composition along different sampling points of the two wwtps by high throughput sequencing targeting the 16s rrna v4 gene region 2 investigate the prevalence and fate of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in dna and edna samples using three in house taqman multiplex qpcr assays 3 assess whether the different designs and operational conditions of the two wwtps impact differently the removal of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistant bacteria and genes preventing them from reaching the environment and or directly the human populations by wastewater reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtps design description and sample collection two portuguese full scale wwtps from the metropolitan lisbon area were selected for this study 1 the wwtp a was designed to treat the domestic wastewater of approximately 756 000 population equivalents p e and employs a biological treatment step with biological aerated filters baf most of the produced effluent is discharged into the tagus river and a smaller fraction is filtered through a cartridge filter disinfected with the addition of sodium hypochlorite and then reused for green park irrigation and street washing purposes 2 the wwtp b was designed to treat the domestic wastewater of approximately 211 000 p e and employs the conventional biological nutrient removal by activated sludge bnr as after the biological treatment step the wastewater is filtered through a sand filter being most of the produced effluent discharged into the tagus river the remaining effluent is disinfected with the addition of sodium hypochlorite and then reused for green park irrigation and street washing purposes for each wwtp four sampling points were defined and a total sample of 30 l consisting in three biological replicates of 10 l was collected from each one in sterile containers in april 9 2019 the samples were transported to the laboratory under refrigerated conditions and immediately processed upon arrival

bacterial community compositions additionally several one way analysis of variance tests anova were conducted to compare the mean values of both the bacterial community composition and the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes along the different sampling points of each wwtp and or between the corresponding sampling points of both wwtps different methodologies were adopted depending on whether the variances were homogeneous or not the homogeneity of the variances was previously evaluated with different levene s tests table s4 s5 and s6 1 if the resulting differences were significant the variances were not considered homogeneous and an anova with the dunnett t3 post hoc test was performed 2 if the resulting differences were not significant the variances were considered homogeneous and an anova with the tukey post hoc test was performed these statistical analyses were performed using the spss 26 software ibm armonk usa and the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 bacterial community composition of the wastewater samples according to the pca performed the bacterial community composition of both wastewater influents was similar fig 2 however the impact of the two distinct biological treatments resulted in the formation of two bacterial communities that were simultaneously different from the respective influent samples and from each other fig 2 regarding a higher taxonomic level the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria were predominant in all sampling points of the two wwtps fig 3 a table s7 nevertheless significant differences p 0 05 in their relative abundances were observed not only between the corresponding sampling points of both wwtps but also after the biological treatment of each wwtp fig 3a tables s7 s8 and s9 in wwtp a the decrease in the relative abundance of the firmicutes from 45 26 to 9 73 was simultaneous to the increase in the relative abundances of the phyla bacteroidetes from 2 42 to 30 51 and proteobacteria from 36 62 to 55 07 fig 3a table s7 in wwtp b the decrease in the relative abundances of the firmicutes from 33 76 to 12 33 and proteobacteria from 51 37 to 39 16 was simultaneous to the increase in the relative abundance of the phylum actinobacteria from 5 19 to 19 75 fig 3a table s7 at a lower taxonomic level bacteria belonging to several genera associated with the human intestinal microbiota such as bifidobacterium blautia comamonas faecalibacterium and jeotgalibaca were well represented in the wastewater influents of the two wwtps despite being efficiently outcompeted or retained at the biological treatment step fig 3b table s10 bacteria belonging to genera associated with potential opportunistic pathogens were also detected with high relative abundances in the influents of both wwtps fig 3b table s10 in fact the genus acinetobacter was the most represented of all genera in the influents of the two wwtps with a relative abundance of 13 42 in wwtp a and 26 75 in wwtp b being also detected in the discharged effluent of wwtp a with a relative abundance of 5 52 and along the remaining sampling points of wwtp b with relative abundances of 3 23 in sampling point 2 2 85 in sampling point 3 and 2 54 in sampling point 4 fig 3b table s10 moreover the genera moraxella and streptococcus were found in both wastewater influents with relative abundances of 6 14 and 3 32 respectively in wwtp a and 7 57 and 3 36 respectively in wwtp b also the genus arcobacter was found along all sampling points of wwtp b with relative abundances ranging from 4 25 to 5 98 fig 3b table s10 after the biological treatment step bacteria from the genus pseudomonas were found in the reused effluent of wwtp a with a relative abundance of 3 40 and besides the previously mentioned genera acinetobacter and arcobacter bacteria belonging to the genera bacteroides clostridium corynebacterium and mycobacterium were found in the discharged and reused effluents of wwtp b with relative abundances of 1 58 2 49 1 03 and 1 61 respectively in the discharged effluent and 2 97 3 78 1 67 and 1 78 respectively in the reused effluent fig 3b table s10 3 2 carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes present in the wastewater samples for each taqman qpcr standard curves were generated by tenfold dilutions of the templates which allowed the estimation of the efficiency coefficient of correlation r2 and sensitivity of the reactions table 4 all taqman qpcr reactions had amplification efficiencies between 86 80 and 102 49 coefficients of correlation r2 between 0 9867 and 0 9999 and sensitivities of 10 gene copy numbers μl 1 table 4 the specificity of each qpcr reaction was also assessed with no detection of any nonspecific amplification products within the set of templates used table s11 regarding the study of the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells the quantification of the 16s rrna gene was performed to assess the bacterial abundance in the different sampling points of the two wwtps the obtained concentrations ranged from 9 3 109 to 1 8 108 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp a and from 6 6 109 to 2 9 107 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp b fig 4 table s12 in both wwtps a significant decrease p 0 05 of the bacterial abundance was observed after the biological treatment step fig 4 tables s12 and s13 nevertheless the 16s rrna gene remained present at high concentrations in the discharged and reused effluents of the two wwtps fig 4 table s12 as for the ab resistance genes seven out of the eight target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 bla ndm bla vim qnra qnrb and qnrs were detected at high concentrations in both wastewater influents fig 4 table s12 the most abundant resistance genes in the influent of wwtp a were the qnrs and bla vim with concentrations of 2 7 107 and 7 2 106 gene copy numbers ml 1 respectively fig 4a table s12 in the influent of wwtp b the most abundant resistance genes were the bla vim and bla oxa 48 with concentrations of 9 4 105 and 4 0 105 gene copy numbers ml 1 respectively fig 4b table s12 despite the reduction in the average abundance of the target resistance genes observed in the two wwtps after the biological treatment step the bla kpc bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes were detected along all sampling points of both wwtps fig 4 table s12 in fact the discharged and reused effluents presented considerable concentrations of these genes ranging from 5 2 105 to 4 6 104 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent of wwtp a from 2 4 104 to 3 9 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent of wwtp b from 6 9 104 to 6 9 103 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent of wwtp a and from 2 8 104 to 7 2 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent of wwtp b fig 4 table s12 the unexpected single detection of the bla oxa 48 gene in the reused effluent of wwtp a was understood by us as a sporadic event that is not representative of this sampling point and that was probably due to a punctual development of a bacterial biofilm harbouring this resistance gene in the pipeline transporting the reused effluent fig 4a table s12 in the study of the edna the 16s rrna gene was also detected along all sampling points of both wwtps at concentrations that ranged from 2 9 106 to 1 1 105 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp a and from 1 7 106 to 2 7 104 gene copy numbers ml 1 in wwtp b fig 5 table s14 contrary to the analysis of this gene in the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells in the edna samples these values do not represent bacterial abundance but free naked bacterial edna in the influent of wwtp a four out of the eight target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes bla oxa 48 bla vim qnrb and qnrs were detected at concentrations ranging from 1 2 105 to 2 6 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 fig 5a table s14 three of these genes bla vim qnrb and qnrs were detected along all sampling points including the discharged and reused effluents at concentrations that ranged from 3 9 103 to 3 9 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent and from 2 1 104 to 2 5 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent fig 5a table s14 in the influent of wwtp b five out of the eight target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 bla vim qnrb and qnrs were detected at concentrations ranging from 1 0 104 to 5 7 102 gene copy numbers ml 1 fig 5b table s14 one of these genes bla vim was detected along all sampling points including the discharged and reused effluents at a concentration of 5 3 103 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the discharged effluent and 3 2 103 gene copy numbers ml 1 in the reused effluent fig 5b table s14 4 discussion the most abundant phyla and genera found in the two wastewater influents under study are in agreement with previous studies pointing out that the phylogenetic groups present in the influent samples are generally the same worldwide despite the differences in their relative abundances that are observed between wwtps mclellan et al 2010 narciso da rocha et al 2018 numberger et al 2019 also the presence of bacteria belonging to several genera associated with potential opportunistic pathogens namely the genera acinetobacter moraxella and streptococcus in wwtp a and the genera acinetobacter arcobacter moraxella and streptococcus in wwtp b suggests that these can be the main hosts of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in both wastewater influents and the main responsible for the entrance of these ab resistance genes in the two wwtps both bacterial communities underwent important changes in their compositions during the wastewater treatment process being most of them tailored by the biological treatment step in fact previous studies have already shown that the majority of the bacteria present in the wastewater influents are not able to persist under the operational and environmental conditions of the biological treatment units highlighting that their impact on the wwtp core community is almost negligible hashimoto et al 2014 lee et al 2015 saunders et al 2016 the biological reactors are usually designed to simultaneously promote and control the microbial populations that are relevant for the removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus offering special growth conditions that are not often found in other environments therefore the dilution of the influent load of anthropogenic bacteria combined with their lesser ability to adapt to such specific environments explains the low impact of the wastewater influents on the wwtp core community and the consequent high removal rate of these bacteria during the biological treatment step however the results from both the relative abundance of the 16s rrna gene and the quantification of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes suggest that a fraction of this influent community which includes several potential opportunistic pathogens can either pass successfully throughout the two wastewater treatment processes and or horizontally transfer genetic traits such as ab resistance genes to the well adapted in house community furthermore the results confirm that neither biological treatments studied have the ability to completely prevent some of the in house biomass to continue downstream on the wastewater treatment process which is in agreement with the literature hashimoto et al 2014 liu et al 2007 tong et al 2019 since most of the bacteria present in the wastewater influents are eliminated during the biological treatment step these in house bacteria seem to be indeed the main hosts of the target ab resistance genes in the treated effluents lastly it is important to mention that the bacterial community composition of each wwtp evolved differently after the biological treatment step which can be explained by the distinct design and operational conditions of each wwtp wwtp a applies a baf technology where a biofilm support medium commonly known as carriers is submerged in the wastewater creating a large contact area that firstly selects for bacteria that are able to grow attached to a solid surface by the production of specific molecules of the extracellular polymeric matrix afterwards further bacteria are recruited to form a mature attached biofilm this system is designed to perform a simultaneous biological treatment of the organic matter followed by a physical filtration targeting the size of the carriers wwtp b applies a bnr as technology in which the activated sludge is formed by microorganisms agglomerating together in suspended biofilms known as suspended flocs also due to the production of an extracellular polymeric substance that in this case is not relevant for the adherence to a surface when the activated sludge is transferred into the settling tanks the flocs sediment and the treated wastewater is removed from the top therefore and as previously described each wwtp exerts a distinct selective pressure that shapes differently the corresponding bacterial community tong et al 2019 altogether these results reinforce that regardless of the differences in the design and operational conditions of each wwtp the conventionally applied wastewater treatments are inefficient in the complete removal of bacteria that can be potentially pathogenic and or harbour ab resistance genes from both discharged and reused effluents contributing to their dissemination into the environment and or to the human populations the high concentrations of carbapenem resistance genes present in the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells of both wastewater influents reflect the increasing resistance in the community towards this group of last line abs moreover their presence is coincident with high relative abundances of several bacteria belonging to genera associated with known carbapenem resistant bacteria such as the acinetobacter genus which further reinforces that they can be the main hosts of these genes in the influent samples regardless of the treatments applied the bla kpc bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes were detected along all sampling points of the two wwtps both biological treatments led to decreases of only 1 2 logs in the concentrations of these ab resistance genes with no considerable differences in terms of efficiency between them since wwtp b has a lower initial load of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes and also applies a sand filtration step immediately after the biological treatment step the discharged effluent of this wwtp present lower concentrations of the target ab resistance genes than the discharged effluent of wwtp a however these differences are less visible when comparing the reused effluents of both wwtps which shows that both cartridge and sand filtrations have similar performances also the addition of sodium hypochlorite to the reused effluents had almost no impact on the concentrations of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the two wwtps stressing that this disinfection method must be replaced it is interesting to note that although the bla kpc bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes still maintain high concentrations in the discharged and reused effluents of both wwtps the composition of the bacterial communities is considerably different after the two biological treatment steps these results are in agreement with the previously described co localization of both carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the same conjugative plasmids schultsz and geerlings 2012 strahilevitz et al 2009 and suggest that the conjugation of such plasmids occurs between the incoming and the in house bacteria that find suitable conditions on the biological tanks to efficiently interact and share their mobile genetic elements recent studies have already reported the presence of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the wastewater treatment processes of several european wwtps auguet et al 2017 cacace et al 2019 pärnänen et al 2019 indicating that the majority of these genes is present at higher concentrations in the southern european wwtps rather than in those of northern europe pärnänen et al 2019 this is in line with the high concentrations of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes found in this study these observations can be explained not only by the differences at the level of the ab consumption pattern between northern and southern european countries but also possibly by the warmer waters of southern europe which may be another favourable factor for the bacterial growth and a major driver of ab resistance in the environment pärnänen et al 2019 altogether the results obtained with the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells point out for the inefficiency of the conventionally applied wastewater treatments in the removal of different carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes from both discharged and reused effluents this raises the awareness that the legislation on the recycled wastewater quality must be revised taking into consideration the current scientific studies and that the microbial indicators referred are outdated leaving behind human health menaces such as ab resistant bacteria and genes either transported by their initial bacterial hosts able to survive to the wastewater treatment process or horizontally transferred to the well adapted environmental bacteria the presence of these genes in the discharged and reused effluents make them a source of ab resistance dissemination into the environment and back to the human populations although a few recent studies have started to search for ab resistance genes in the edna fraction of different environmental samples dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 this is the first study to the best of our knowledge to undertake a comprehensive analysis on the concentrations of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes in the edna fraction of wastewaters in fact considerable concentrations of these resistance genes were detected in the edna samples of both wastewater influents and for certain genes along all sampling points of the two wwtps the results support recent research highlighting that the study of the ab resistance in the edna should not be neglected as it can harbour an important fraction of the environmental resistome dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 the bla vim qnrb and qnrs genes were detected along all sampling points of wwtp a with no important changes in their concentrations detected between the wastewater influent and the treated effluents in fact the presence of these three resistance genes in the edna fraction which only represent a minimum percentage of their total concentrations in the influent samples correspond to respectively 23 33 3 50 and 1 84 of their total concentrations in the reused effluent in wwtp b only the bla vim gene was detected along all sampling points being the other four resistance genes found in the corresponding wastewater influent efficiently eliminated during the biological treatment or the sand filtration steps the edna present in these wastewater samples can derive from both cellular extrusion mechanisms or cell lysis resulting in the release of chromosomal dna mobile genetic elements and phages that can be protected against nucleases and able to be assimilated via natural transformation by staying integrated in the extracellular polymeric matrix surrounding the bacteria or adsorbed to colloids sand particles clay minerals and humic substances dong et al 2019 ibáñez de aldecoa et al 2017 pietramellara et al 2009 vlassov et al 2007 comparing both wastewater treatments the results clearly show that the bnr as technology possibly by retention of the edna and the sand filtration possibly by edna sorption have a higher efficiency in the removal of the edna than the baf technology and the cartridge filtration also and similar to what was observed in the study of the dna extracted from the bacterial community cells the addition of sodium hypochlorite to the reused effluents had no visible impact on the concentrations of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes present in the edna samples of the two wwtps once again reinforcing the need for alternative disinfection methods altogether these results demonstrate that the elimination of the edna is another important issue that wwtps will have to overcome when the industry will start to actively tackle the ab related pollution since it constitutes an additional source for the dissemination of the ab resistance 5 conclusions in this study it was clearly demonstrated that the wwtps represent a major vehicle for the dissemination of the ab resistance and was further detailed the great importance of the environmental sector on the ab resistance spreading cycle underlying the one health approach it was possible to conclude that 1 the biological treatment is the most important step on shaping the bacterial community composition as well as on affecting the concentrations of the target carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes along the wastewater treatment process 2 regardless of the different designs and treatments applied in the two wwtps carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes persisted at high concentrations in both dna and edna fractions of the discharged and reused effluents 3 the conventionally applied treatments for wastewater reuse are clearly inefficient being this stream a direct gateway for the dissemination of ab resistant bacteria and genes back to the human populations 4 the edna fraction of the wastewater is a relevant source of carbapenem and fluoro quinolone resistance genes representing an additional path for the dissemination of the ab resistance for wastewater reuse to become a safe and reliable practice in the near future able to be implemented as a sustainable alternative in areas such as agricultural irrigation targeted treatments towards ab resistant bacteria and genes must

17824,volatile fatty acids vfas the intermediate of the anaerobic process are considered to be the critical high sensitive and reliable indicators of the process stability close monitoring and control of vfas are paramount for the efficient operation of the anaerobic reactors in this study a buffer intensity based mathematical model was developed and the least square method was integrated into the model to solve the issue of non linear fitting of the titration curve an automatic analyzer embedded with the developed model was designed and implemented for measuring vfas and alkalinity through model optimization the ph range of 3 5 5 6 was found to be suitable for vfas analysis the developed approach was validated by different vfas up to 500 mg l as acetic acid and carbonate alkalinity concentrations up to 1500 mg l as caco3 with high recovery rates 0 9 optimal ratios of carbonate alkalinity to vfas are identified in the range of 2 4 7 5 for accuracy owing to the non linear fitting

titration method the 2 step back titration method or the 4 ph point titration method due to errors induced by the interference of titration endpoints buchauer 1998 lahav and morgan 2004 lützhøft et al 2014 the 5 ph point titration and 8 ph point titration methods have high tolerance with the influence of other weak acid subsystems by selecting symmetrical ph pairs however the high initial ph 6 7 requirement and exact knowledge of the other weak acids concentrations still hamper its wide application in the full scale digesters hey et al 2013 moosbrugger et al 1993b 1993a vannecke et al 2015 moreover for real time monitoring of vfas and alkalinity response time and reliability are crucial for effective operation of the anaerobic process titration is faster than other methods but more than 15 mins are required for the analysis of a single sample using the 5 ph point titration method to achieve real time titration based vfas and alkalinity monitoring the following challenges need to be addressed 1 how to optimize the titration procedure to minimize the response time 2 is it possible to incorporate the titration theory in the mathematical methods for a greater analysis of accuracy and 3 how to further implement the measurement of vfas and alkalinity for real time automatic monitoring of the anaerobic process by addressing these concerns the efficiency and stability of the ad system can be significantly improved the aim of this study is to achieve the real time monitoring of vfas and alkalinity during the anaerobic process with greater accuracy thereby making real time monitoring reliable a buffer intensity based mathematical model was first developed as the core algorithm and an automatic analyzer embedded with the model i e the vfas alkalinity analyzer was designed for the measurement subsequent to that the selection of the optimal ph range during the titration was conducted to collect data segments for model optimization standard solutions and the impact of weak acid systems e g phosphorus ammonium and sulfide on the analytical accuracy were examined by the analyzer the accuracy reliability and robustness of this newly developed approach was validated through one year real time monitoring of environmental samples the potential applications of this approach were evaluated and discussed as well as its drawbacks for further upgrading and improvements 2 model development 2 1 the principle model derivation and optimization 2 1 1 buffer intensity the buffer intensity of a solution β is defined as a measure of the ability of the solution to withstand the addition of acid or base without significant ph change snoeyink and jenkins 1980 1 β d c b d p h d c a d p h where c a and c b are concentrations of acid and base respectively added to the solution mol l for a weak monoprotic acid ha and a weak diprotic acid h2b the buffer intensity can be expressed as snoeyink and jenkins 1980 2 β h 2 o 2 303 h k w h 3 β h a 2 303 c t h a k a h

ionization constant of the weak monoprotic acid i e ha in the solution k b1 k b2 are the first and second apparent ionization constants respectively of the weak diprotic acid i e h2b in the solution in this study acetic acid was used to represent vfas owing to its dominant proportion and similar ionization constant with propionic acid and butyric acid for aqueous solution containing acetate and carbonate weak acid bases the buffer intensity β t o t a l can be written as the sum of the buffer intensity of each species and water 5 β t o t a l β h 2 o β h a c β h 2 c o 3 6 β t o t a l 2 303 h k

buffer intensity during the titration the titration curve of a given solution can be described by its total buffer intensity making it possible to determine vfas concentration by fitting the experimental titration curve the theoretical relationship between the volume of the titrant added v a and ph change of the solution is given by 7 v a c t i t r a n t v s o l u t i o n v a p h 0 p h x β t o t a l d p h where v a is the added volume of titrant to the endpoint of ph 3 5 ml v s o l u t i o n is the volume of the solution before titration ml c t i t r a n t is the concentration of titrant mol l from the above eq 7 the following can be derived 8 f β t o t a l p h x v a v s o l u t i o n p h 0 p h x β t o t a l d p h c t i t r a n t p h 0 p h x β t o t a l d p h the inverse function of f β t o t a l p h x is a theoretical titration curve the relatively low pka of acetic acid pka 4 75 at 25 c similar as other vfas has little influence on β t o t a l at high ph 4 75 it is therefore possible to simplify the mathematical algorithm in eq 8 by selecting a small fraction of collected data during the titration and fitting with least squares method for the measurement of vfas meanwhile the influence of other weak acids bases such as carbonic acid pka 6 35 hydrogen sulfide pka 7 1 phosphoric acid pka 2 1 and ammonium ion pka 9 3 can also be neglected due to the different values of pka based on eqs 6 and 8 for any given values of a t and c t the residues y between predicted data v a and observed data v a d a t a i can be expressed as 9 y f a t c t p h x d a t a i v a d a t a i where p h x d a t a i is the vector of observed ph during the titration v a d a t a i is the volume vector of the added titrant ml this non linear curve fitting is solved by the least squares method by finding the optimum parameters a t and c t at which the minimizing sum of the squared residuals y min is obtained 10 y m i n min i f a t c t p h x d a t a i v a d a t a i 2 the calculation of eq 10 was solved by the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is implemented into matlab madsen et al 2004 the algorithms of all the data analyses were first written in c and then integrated in the graphical user interface gui that is a key part of the analyzer alkalinity is defined as the proton accepting capacity of the solution relative to a reference state ph 4 5 apha 2005 quantitatively the alkalinity can be obtained through the titrant volume added to the reference state ph thus alkalinity can be derived from the titration curve as described in the following equation 11 a l k a l i n i t y m g c a c o 3 l v b c t i t r a n t v s a m p l e where v b is the added volume of titrant to the endpoint of ph 4 5 ml v s a m p l e is the added volume of sample ml and c t i t r a n t is the concentration of titrant mol l the optimization of this model is to determine the optimal ph range for data collection in the model the ph value of 3 5 is set as the lower boundary value which is lower than the titration endpoint of both vfas ph 4 3 for 5 ph point titration and alkalinity ph 4 5 to eliminate the impact of weak acids except vfas and carbonate acid on the total buffer intensity the upper boundary of ph was validated to be in the range of 4 0 7 5 by using the data collected from section 2 3 3 2 2 the vfas alkalinity analyzer the present approach was implemented by using a newly designed device viz the vfas alkalinity v a analyzer the analyzer consists of three major modules a ph recording system an automatic titration system and a control operation system fig 1 the sample is pumped to a specially designed cylindrical cell with an equal diameter and height of 0 05 m with two apertures for ph sensor and a tube for pumping titrant the ph recording unit is then used for real time data collection from the ph sensor during the titration the ph based titration data are recorded by a microcontroller unit mcu for two additional purposes namely 1 sending data to the gui computer for user instruction distribution model calculation and data representation and 2 controlling the titration system i e automatic off titration once the ph reaches the set value of ph in gui the mcu automatically stops the titration process 3 materials and methods 3 1 verification test verification tests were performed to validate the accuracy repetition and reliability of the developed approach in this study the 5 ph point titration method was used as a comparison method in terms of vfas and alkalinity measurements verification tests were conducted using laboratory prepared solutions the concentrated vfas stock solution 1000 10 mg l as hac and alkalinity stock solution 5000 50 mg l as caco3 were prepared by dilution of acetic acid ch3cooh 99 7 acros and sodium carbonate na2co3 99 8 sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid 0 1n from a 37 solution in water acros was the titrant and its concentration was standardized against 0 05n standard na2co3 solution according to apha 2005 concentrated solutions of phosphate 1 0 01 g p l ammonium 1 0 01 g n l and sulfide 1 0 01 g s l were prepared accordingly respectively from potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 99 5 sigma aldrich ammonium chloride nh4cl 99 vwr and sodium sulfide hydrate na2s xh2o 60 sigma aldrich both the analyzer ph recording system and the ph meter model 420aplus thermo scientific orion star used in the 5 ph point titration were calibrated by three buffer solutions merck at the ph 4 00 ph 7 01 and ph 10 01 with the observed calibration slopes higher than 0 98 3 1 1 5 ph point titration method the 5 ph point titration method is considered an accurate and reliable method for vfas and alkalinity measurements lahav and loewenthal 2000 lahav and morgan 2004 lützhøft et al 2014 purser et al 2014 the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach are therefore evaluated with various concentrations of vfas and carbonate alkalinity against the results obtained from the 5 ph point titration method the detailed procedure of the 5 ph point titration method is well documented by moosbrugger et al 1993a in general the 5 ph point titration method requires titration with a standard acid solution hcl solution over the middle range of ph of a filtered sample in four steps i e from the initial ph the sample down to ph 6 7 ph 5 9 ph 5 2 and ph 4 3 if the initial ph the sample is below 6 7 the ph must to be raised to 6 7 by adding a known volume of a strong base solution e g naoh solution the calculation of vfas alkalinity with the 5 ph point method can be done using a ms excel version of the titra5 program developed by chris brouckaert vannecke et al 2015 if naoh is added to the sample to raise the ph above 6 7 before the 5 point titration it is not correct to subtract the concentration of the naoh dose from the determined h2co3 alkalinity because the naoh dose changes the alkalinities of all the weak acid bases present loewenthal et al 1991 3 2 accuracy and reproducibility test standard solutions of vfas and alkalinity were tested to evaluate the accuracy of the developed approach the verification of alkalinity by the developed method is simplified by using vfas and carbonate weak acid subsystems the total alkalinity of a solution is the sum of all the weak acid subsystems present in the solution hence in this study the total alkalinity is the sum of acetate alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity various combinations of acetate and carbonate were prepared table 1 the solutions were titrated with both the developed approach and 5 ph point titration method each combination was replicated 5 times moreover the developed approach and 5 ph point titration method were applied to measure vfas and alkalinity of food waste samples for one year zan et al 2018 the one year test is to verify the accuracy reliability and robustness of this developed approach 3 3 effect of phosphate ammonium and sulfide weak acid subsystems bioprocesses in which vfas and carbonate weak acid systems are present also contain phosphate pt ammonium nt and sometimes sulfide st weak acid subsystems to investigate the influence of these different concentrations of phosphate ammonium and sulfide were added to vfas with concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l as hac as summarized in table 2 3 4 analytical methods and data analysis all the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm microfiltration membrane before vfas and alkalinity measurements the vfas were measured by the 5 ph point titration method phosphate was determined by an ion chromatograph hic 20a super shimadzu japan equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic sa2 analytical column ammonium was determined using a flow injection analyzer quikchem fia 8000 lachat usa whereas sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 recovery by different methods refers to the analytic measured value and it is calculated as a percentage of the theoretical value in this study a 95 confidence level p 0 05 was selected to determine the significance of the calculation of the vfas recovery by the 5 ph point titration and the developed approach the mean value x and standard deviation sd were calculated using ms excel moreover the one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the significance of the statistical differences in vfas and alkalinity measurements the analysis was conducted using the software spss version 21 ibm usa with a 95 confidence level p 0 05 statistical significance 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimization of data collection for model implementation the developed model uses the titration data as inputs for model fitting and problem solving optimization of the model mainly focuses on the determination of the ph range during the titration which helps select the segment of data with vfas recovery rate of 100 fig 2 in general the vfas recovery rate first shows a converging trend and subsequently a diverging trend as the ph increases from 4 0 to 7 5 a relatively stable vfas recovery rate with ph ranging from 5 1 to 5 6 is obtained as the average value decreases from 1 01 0 05 at ph 5 1 to 0 98 0 03 at ph 5 6 the chosen segment of data has a large influence on the fitting results for instance the vfas recovery rate can decrease to 0 95 0 04 at ph 6 and 0 82 0 15 at ph 7 thereby increasing the measured errors of up to 3 and 17 respectively given the minor difference between ph 5 1 and ph 5 6 ph 5 6 is selected as the upper boundary ph to ensure enough sample size for fitting moreover to avoid the impact of h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 pka 2 1 snoeyink and jenkins 1980 ph 3 5 is manually set as the titration endpoint as well as the lower boundary ph in this study the poor recovery rate e g ph 5 1 or ph 5 6 obtained in this study is mainly ascribed to the following 1 when ph 5 6 the continuous stir in the sample during the titration which can accelerate the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere thus causing a deviation in the titration curve anderson and yang 1992 mu et al 2018 2 the influence from phosphate ammonium and sulfide ions which can be involved in fitting due to their ionization or pka at ph 5 6 to reduce such interference relative low ph values must be selected in the algorithm when ph 5 1 the fitting accuracy can be greatly influenced by the segment size e g the vfas recovery rate is up to 8 6 when using the segment size from ph 3 5 to ph 4 therefore the optimal ph range used in this model is set from 3 5 to 5 6 for data collection 4 2 accuracy and reproducibility the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach are evaluated with various concentrations of vfas from 100 to 500 mg l as hac and carbonate alkalinity from 300 to 2400 mg l as caco3 against the results obtained from the 5 ph point titration method figs 3 and 4 table s1 s2 and s1 of the si the vfas and carbonate alkalinity estimated by the developed approach are in good agreement with the corresponding values measured by the 5 ph point titration method also yielding a high recovery rate 90 and good linearity 0 99 fig 3 when vfas are lower than 400 mg l as hac the estimated values by the developed approach show slightly higher recovery rates 3 than the 5 ph point titration method whereas the difference is negligible for carbonate alkalinity this indicates that the developed approach is accurate and reproducible for vfas and carbonate alkalinity measurements particularly compared with the 5 ph point titration method fig 4 shows the correlation between the recovery rate of vfas and carbonate alkalinity and ratio of carbonate alkalinity to vfas from ratios of 0 6 15 little influence on vfas recovery rate but considerable influence on carbonate alkalinity are recorded at low ratios whereas the reverse trend is observed at high ratios in this study high recovery rates 0 90 of vfas are obtained at ratios of up to 7 5 by both methods at a ratio of 15 the relative error to the 5 ph point titration method is around 28 much larger than the developed approach with 13 thus suggesting that the developed approach has greater resistance to high alkalinity and good consistency and robustness this can be attributed to 1 the upper ph boundary of the developed approach of 5 6 which reduces the influence from carbonate alkalinity and 2 the fact that more data are applied for fitting and calculation in comparison with conventional titration methods as for carbonate alkalinity a relatively high recovery rate 1 is observed when using the 5 ph point titration method and a low recovery rate 0 9 at ratios lower than 2 4 is observed when using the developed approach ratios of carbonate alkalinity to vfas ranging from 2 4 to 7 5 are observed for greater recovery rates of vfas and carbonate alkalinity when using the developed approach the impact of the different ratios of carbonate alkalinity to vfas on the measurement of vfas can be explained by the overlap of the individual buffer intensity curves fig s1 of the si as elucidated in previous studies lahav and loewenthal 2000 lahav and morgan 2004 moosbrugger et al 1993b 1993a the points at which carbonate and acetate subsystems cross can induce changes in ph depending on the concentration of each purser et al 2014 overlapping is noticeable at ratios of 0 6 15 with cross points from ph 4 6 to 5 7 this causes the higher concentration subsystem described in a larger buffer intensity curve area this buffer intensity curve significantly affects the total area and subsystem at lower concentration sharp changes in buffer intensity can also occur at ph adjacent to the cross points thereby yielding titration gaps the 5 ph point titration method is more sensitive to the interference from other weak acids given that it relies on symmetrical ph pairs for calculation therefore using a segment of titration data with ph values of 3 5 5 6 can be more reliable and robust than using the developed approach for vfas and alkalinity measurements under different conditions 4 3 impact of phosphate ammonium and sulfide weak acid subsystems in the anaerobic process weak acid subsystems such as phosphate ammonium and sulfide coexist with vfas and carbonate subsystems these weak acid subsystems can cause interference to the measurement of vfas by affecting the titration curve different concentrations of phosphate ammonium and sulfide are added to standard vfas solutions with 50 and 100 mg l as hac for impact analyses fig 5 to simulate real cases no correction of these weak acid subsystems is made during the analyzer calculation negligible impact of phosphate from 20 to 100 mg p l on the measurement of vfas are recorded when using the developed approach with the relative errors ranging from 1 to 6 at 50 and 100 mg l as hac fig 5a this is consistent with other titration methods such as the 2 ph point titration 4 ph point titration and 5 ph point titration lützhøft et al 2014 for instance a phosphate concentration of up to 100 mg p l has very little effect on the measurement of vfas with errors of up to 6 mg l as hac when using the 5 ph point titration method moosbrugger et al 1993b dissolved phosphoric acid is normally present in the liquid phase as it does not decompose or escape to the atmosphere and its concentration ranges from 14 to 150 mg p l in the full scale anaerobic digesters for sludge treatment and can increase to 450 mg p l in dairy manure treatment battistoni et al 1997 huchzermeier and tao 2012 munch and barr 2001 tao et al 2016 yoshino et al 2003 hence the measurement of vfas in sludge treated ad process using the developed approach is insensitive to the phosphate concentrations however research must be done to confirm this observation for relatively high p concentrations above 200 mg p l it is expected that the effects of ammonium and sulfide on the measurement of vfas will be of insignificance given the high pk values of ammonium and sulfide pk n 9 25 and pk s 7 04 at 25 c and low pk value of acetate pk hac 4 75 at 25 c represent for vfas fig s1 lahav et al 2002 lahav and loewenthal 2000 lützhøft et al 2014 moosbrugger et al 1993a in this study the relative errors with ammonium or sulfide addition are within 8 at vfas concentrations of 50 mg l and 100 mg l as hac fig 5b and c one possible reason for the high relative error can be the volatility of hydrogen sulfide causing the inaccuracy in ph measurement and subsequently yielding errors in the collected data lahav et al 2002 this implies that the developed approach has high tolerance in the measurement of vfas with the presence of ammonium and sulfide with a concentration of up to 100 mg l as n or s while high levels of sulfide and ammonia can be present in the anaerobic system e g 10 372 mg s l and 100 1900 mg n l their presence mainly affect the ph instead of the titration curve during the vfas measurement due to the high pk values fung and yeung 2012 procházka et al 2012 yenigün and demirel 2013 zan et al 2019 4 4 long term stability evaluation of the developed approach the stability of the long term performance is the major concern regarding this automatic analyzer a one year vfas and alkalinity analysis was conducted with the characterization of food waste samples to reevaluate the accuracy and reliability of the developed approach samples were tested for vfas and alkalinity using the 5 ph point titration method and the developed approach respectively as shown in fig s2 of the si similar trends can be observed in the measurement of vfas and alkalinity showing the consistency and stability of the methods being used table 3 shows the results of a one way anova analyses of vfas and alkalinity it can be seen that the statistical significance is found at the 95 level of confidence suggesting the consistency of the results obtained with the two methods moreover the relative difference of vfas measured by the 5 ph point titration method and the developed approach is calculated and compared in fig 6 it is clear that most calculated results lie in the range of 10 with few results lying in the range of 20 the difference can be ascribed to the presence of other weak acid subsystems in the aqueous system it has been reported that inorganic carbon total ammonia nitrogen and phosphate can interfere with the measurement of vfas using the titration methods charnier et al 2016 mu et al 2018 ripley et al 1997 for instance organic acids such as citric or lactic acids can seriously hinder the measurement of vfas in food waste samples the pka values of citric acid pka1 3 09 and pka2 4 76 and lactic acid pka 3 86 are very close to that of vfas moreover the values lie in the ph range 5 6 3 5 required by the developed approach and theses acids are likely to be considered as vfas during the model calculations 4 5 potential application and drawbacks of the approach the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach in the measurement of vfas and alkalinity are well demonstrated in this study providing a new technique for real time automatic anaerobic system monitoring with greater accuracy and reliability the measurement of vfas is achieved by the mathematical model derived from the buffer intensity also the least squares method imbedded in the model is further used to solve the non linear fitting problem of the titration curve by using the titration data with ph ranging 5 6 3 5 this technique is capable of precisely measuring vfas and alkalinity concentrations up to 500 mg l as hac and 2400 mg l as caco3 respectively even with the influences of different vfas over carbonate alkalinity ratios and other weak acid subsystems e g phosphate ammonium and sulfide with good reliability and robustness compared with methods relying on gc angelidaki et al 1990 hplc albert and martens 1997 or headspace gc boe et al 2007 the developed approach is more viable particularly regarding cost and maintenance since the apparatus modules are cheap and easily available the initial ph greater than 6 7 is essential for the conventional 5 or 8 ph point titration method due to the symmetrical ph pairs for calculation manual addition of an alkaline solution is generally required in real application to increase the ph value above 6 7 by comparison for the developed approach the initial ph is 5 6 which nearly covers all conditions in the ad process given that the pka of vfas is around 4 75 this suggests a broad applicability of the developed approach and further guarantees the rapid analysis of vfas under different conditions while the developed approach has a more complex structure compared with the conventional titration methods three major units can be modularly designed and manufactured in addition the modularized analyzer can achieve real time automatic monitoring of vfas and alkalinity 3 min sample and also an accurate diagnosis hence allowing a timely adjustment of the anaerobic system for instance the abnormal level of vfas and alkalinity can be detected in time and a real time feedback control can be applied by changing the loading rate adjusting the ph and hrt to avoid the negative impact on the system operation and sustain the efficacy of the anaerobic system beside the aforementioned the following potential drawbacks can be expected and hence must be clarified while using the developed approach 1 the algorithm optimization 2 the modular integration and 3 the resistance against the complex conditions in the anaerobic processes to further upgrade the developed approach more detailed expression of the algorithm is necessary for model fitting and calculations greater design and integration of the analyzer can improve its application in addition regular calibration of the ph meter and titrant are essential to obtain accurate titration data for some systems under complex conditions the pretreatment of the samples or the adjustment of the algorithms can be required to sustain the accuracy and reduce the duration of titration therefore to further validate the possibility of applying the developed approach to other real cases including application to full scale anaerobic systems more studies must be done in the future meanwhile the v a analyzer is a potential market product for the measurement of vfas which can be used in several industrial processes such as the anaerobic sludge digestion biological nutrients removal wine making and food processing given its advantages namely reliable monitoring automation and speed 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the use of an innovative automatic analyzer embedded with a model combining the titration theory and a mathematical model fitting to precisely determine the concentration of vfas and alkalinity under different conditions the main findings are summarized as follow 1 a buffer intensity based mathematical model can be developed integrated with the least squares method which requires the ph to range between 3 5 and 5 6 for the measurement of vfas 2 the accuracy and reproducibility of the analyzer for vfas and alkalinity measurements can be validated and ratios of carbonate alkalinity over vfas must be in the range 2 4 7 5 for greater accuracy 3 the impact of other weak acid subsystems e g phosphate ammonium and sulfide are negligible when using the analyzer and 4 the rapid response 3 min sample accuracy and reliability make the developed analyzer a promising technique for on site real time automatic monitoring of the anaerobic process

17824,volatile fatty acids vfas the intermediate of the anaerobic process are considered to be the critical high sensitive and reliable indicators of the process stability close monitoring and control of vfas are paramount for the efficient operation of the anaerobic reactors in this study a buffer intensity based mathematical model was developed and the least square method was integrated into the model to solve the issue of non linear fitting of the titration curve an automatic analyzer embedded with the developed model was designed and implemented for measuring vfas and alkalinity through model optimization the ph range of 3 5 5 6 was found to be suitable for vfas analysis the developed approach was validated by different vfas up to 500 mg l as acetic acid and carbonate alkalinity concentrations up to 1500 mg l as caco3 with high recovery rates 0 9 optimal ratios of carbonate alkalinity to vfas are identified in the range of 2 4 7 5 for accuracy owing to the non linear fitting of the titration curve the impact of other weak acid subsystems e g phosphate ammonium and sulfide can be negligible the one year real time monitoring of environmental samples by using the automatic analyzer indicates a high consistency and stability compared with the 5 ph point titration this approach proves to be rapid 3 min sample accurate reliable and can be applied for real time automatic

reliable indicators of process stability ahring et al 1995 boe et al 2010 2007 hawkes et al 1993 lahav et al 2002 this is because the accumulation of vfas reflects the metabolic imbalance resulting

2014 the 5 ph point titration and 8 ph point titration methods have high tolerance with the influence of other weak acid subsystems by selecting symmetrical ph pairs however the high initial ph 6 7 requirement and exact knowledge of the other weak acids concentrations still hamper its wide application in the full scale digesters hey et al 2013 moosbrugger et al 1993b 1993a vannecke et al 2015 moreover for real time monitoring of vfas and alkalinity response time and reliability are crucial for effective operation of the anaerobic process titration is faster than other methods but more than 15 mins are required for the analysis of a single sample using the 5 ph point titration method to achieve real time titration based vfas and alkalinity monitoring the following challenges need to be addressed 1 how to optimize the titration procedure to minimize the response time 2 is it possible to incorporate the titration theory in the mathematical methods for a greater analysis of accuracy and 3 how to further implement the measurement of vfas and alkalinity for real time automatic monitoring of the anaerobic process by addressing these concerns the efficiency and stability of the ad system can be significantly improved the aim of this study is to achieve the real time monitoring of vfas and alkalinity during the anaerobic process with greater accuracy thereby making real time monitoring reliable a buffer intensity based mathematical model was first developed as the core algorithm and an automatic analyzer embedded with the model i e the vfas alkalinity analyzer was designed for the measurement subsequent to that the selection of the optimal ph range during the titration was conducted to collect data segments for model optimization standard solutions and the impact of weak acid systems e g phosphorus ammonium and sulfide on the analytical accuracy were examined by the analyzer the accuracy reliability and robustness of this newly developed approach was validated through one year real time monitoring of environmental samples the potential applications of this approach were evaluated and discussed as well as its drawbacks for further upgrading and improvements 2 model development 2 1 the principle model derivation and optimization 2 1 1 buffer intensity the buffer intensity of a solution β is defined as a measure of the ability of the solution to withstand the addition of acid or base without significant ph change snoeyink and jenkins 1980 1 β d c b d p h d c a d p h where c a and c b are concentrations of acid and base respectively added to the solution mol l for a weak monoprotic acid ha and a weak diprotic acid h2b the buffer intensity can be expressed as snoeyink and jenkins 1980 2 β h 2 o 2 303 h k w h 3 β h a 2 303 c t h a k a h

acetic acid hac and b containing species e g carbonic acid h2co3 respectively mol l k w is the self ionization constant of water h is the hydrogen ion concentration mol l k a is the apparent ionization constant of the weak monoprotic acid i e ha in the solution k b1 k b2 are the first and second apparent ionization constants respectively of the weak diprotic acid i e h2b in the solution in this study acetic acid was used to represent vfas owing to its dominant proportion and similar ionization constant with propionic acid and butyric acid for aqueous solution containing acetate and carbonate weak acid bases the buffer intensity β t o t a l can be written as the sum of the buffer intensity of each species and water 5 β t o t a l β h 2 o β h a c β h 2 c o 3 6 β t o t a l 2 303 h k

buffer intensity during the titration the titration curve of a given solution can be described by its total buffer intensity making it possible to determine vfas concentration by fitting the experimental titration curve the theoretical relationship between the volume of the titrant added v a and ph change of the solution is given by 7 v a c t i t r a n t v s o l u t i o n v a p h 0 p h x β t o t a l d p h where v a is the added volume of titrant to the endpoint of ph 3 5 ml v s o l u t i o n is the volume of the solution before titration ml c t i t r a n t is the concentration of titrant mol l from the above eq 7 the following can be derived 8 f β t o t a l p h x v a v s o l u t i o n p h 0 p h x β t o t a l d p h c t i t r a n t p h 0 p h x β t o t a l d p h the inverse function of f β t o t a l p h x is a theoretical titration curve the relatively low pka of acetic acid pka 4 75 at 25 c similar as other vfas has little influence on β t o t a l at high ph 4 75 it is therefore possible to simplify the mathematical algorithm in eq 8 by selecting a small fraction of collected data during the titration and fitting with least squares method for the measurement of vfas meanwhile the influence of other weak acids bases such as carbonic acid pka 6 35 hydrogen sulfide pka 7 1 phosphoric acid pka 2 1 and ammonium ion pka 9 3 can also be neglected due to the different values of pka based on eqs 6 and 8 for any given values of a t and c t the residues y between predicted data v a and observed data v a d a t a i can be expressed as 9 y f a t c t p h x d a t a i v a d a t a i where p h x d a t a i is the vector of observed ph during the titration v a d a t a i is the volume vector of the added titrant ml this non linear curve fitting is solved by the least squares method by finding the optimum parameters a t and c t at which the minimizing sum of the squared residuals y min is obtained 10 y m i n min i f a t c t p h x d a t a i v a d a t a i 2 the calculation of eq 10 was solved by the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is implemented into matlab madsen et al 2004 the algorithms of all the data analyses were first written in c and then integrated in the graphical user interface gui that is a key part of the analyzer alkalinity is defined as the proton accepting capacity of the solution relative to a reference state ph 4 5 apha 2005 quantitatively the alkalinity can be obtained through the titrant volume added to the reference state ph thus alkalinity can be derived from the titration curve as described in the following equation 11 a l k a l i n i t y m g c a c o 3 l v b c t i t r a n t v s a m p l e where v b is the added volume of titrant to the endpoint of ph 4 5 ml v s a m p l e is the added volume of sample ml and c t i t r a n t is the concentration of titrant mol l the optimization of this model is to determine the optimal ph range for data collection in the model the ph value of 3 5 is set as the lower boundary value which is lower than the titration endpoint of both vfas ph 4 3 for 5 ph point titration and alkalinity ph 4 5 to eliminate the impact of weak acids except vfas and carbonate acid on the total buffer intensity the upper boundary of ph was validated to be in the range of 4 0 7 5 by using the data collected from section 2 3 3 2 2 the vfas alkalinity analyzer the present approach was implemented by using a newly designed device viz the vfas alkalinity v a analyzer the analyzer consists of three major modules a ph recording system an automatic titration system and a control operation system fig 1 the sample is pumped to a specially designed cylindrical cell with an equal diameter and height of 0 05 m with two apertures for ph sensor and a tube for pumping titrant the ph recording unit is then used for real time data collection from the ph sensor during the titration the ph based titration data are recorded by a microcontroller unit mcu for two additional purposes namely 1 sending data to the gui computer for user instruction distribution model calculation and data representation and 2 controlling the titration system i e automatic off titration once the ph reaches the set value of ph in gui the mcu automatically stops the titration process 3 materials and methods 3 1 verification test verification tests were performed to validate the accuracy repetition and reliability of the developed approach in this study the 5 ph point titration method was used as a comparison method in terms of vfas and alkalinity measurements verification tests were conducted using laboratory prepared solutions the concentrated vfas stock solution 1000 10 mg l as hac and alkalinity stock solution 5000 50 mg l as caco3 were prepared by dilution of acetic acid ch3cooh 99 7 acros and sodium carbonate na2co3 99 8 sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid 0 1n from a 37 solution in water acros was the titrant and its concentration was standardized against 0 05n standard na2co3 solution according to apha 2005 concentrated solutions of phosphate 1 0 01 g p l ammonium 1 0 01 g n l and sulfide 1 0 01 g s l were prepared accordingly respectively from potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 99 5 sigma aldrich ammonium chloride nh4cl 99 vwr and sodium sulfide hydrate na2s xh2o 60 sigma aldrich both the analyzer ph recording system and the ph meter model 420aplus thermo scientific orion star used in the 5 ph point titration were calibrated by three buffer solutions merck at the ph 4 00 ph 7 01 and ph 10 01 with the observed calibration slopes higher than 0 98 3 1 1 5 ph point titration method the 5 ph point titration method is considered an accurate and reliable method for vfas and alkalinity measurements lahav and loewenthal 2000 lahav and morgan 2004 lützhøft et al 2014 purser et al 2014 the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach are therefore evaluated with various concentrations of vfas and carbonate alkalinity against the results obtained from the 5 ph point titration method the detailed procedure of the 5 ph point titration method is well documented by moosbrugger et al 1993a in general the 5 ph point titration method requires titration with a standard acid solution hcl solution over the middle range of ph of a filtered sample in four steps i e from the initial ph the sample down to ph 6 7 ph 5 9 ph 5 2 and ph 4 3 if the initial ph the sample is below 6 7 the ph must to be raised to 6 7 by adding a known volume of a strong base solution e g naoh solution the calculation of vfas alkalinity with the 5 ph point method can be done using a ms excel version of the titra5 program developed by chris brouckaert vannecke et al 2015 if naoh is added to the sample to raise the ph above 6 7 before the 5 point titration it is not correct to subtract the concentration of the naoh dose from the determined h2co3 alkalinity because the naoh dose changes the alkalinities of all the weak acid bases present loewenthal et al 1991 3 2 accuracy and reproducibility test standard solutions of vfas and alkalinity were tested to evaluate the accuracy of the developed approach the verification of alkalinity by the developed method is simplified by using vfas and carbonate weak acid subsystems the total alkalinity of a solution is the sum of all the weak acid subsystems present in the solution hence in this study the total alkalinity is the sum of acetate alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity various combinations of acetate and carbonate were prepared table 1 the solutions were titrated with both the developed approach and 5 ph point titration method each combination was replicated 5 times moreover the developed approach and 5 ph point titration method were applied to measure vfas and alkalinity of food waste samples for one year zan et al 2018 the one year test is to verify the accuracy reliability and robustness of this developed approach 3 3 effect of phosphate ammonium and sulfide weak acid subsystems bioprocesses in which vfas and carbonate weak acid systems are present also contain phosphate pt ammonium nt and sometimes sulfide st weak acid subsystems to investigate the influence of these different concentrations of phosphate ammonium and sulfide were added to vfas with concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l as hac as summarized in table 2 3 4 analytical methods and data analysis all the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm microfiltration membrane before vfas and alkalinity measurements the vfas were measured by the 5 ph point titration method phosphate was determined by an ion chromatograph hic 20a super shimadzu japan equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic sa2 analytical column ammonium was determined using a flow injection analyzer quikchem fia 8000 lachat usa whereas sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 recovery by different methods refers to the analytic measured value and it is calculated as a percentage of the theoretical value in this study a 95 confidence level p 0 05 was selected to determine the significance of the calculation of the vfas recovery by the 5 ph point titration and the developed approach the mean value x and standard deviation sd were calculated using ms excel moreover the one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the significance of the statistical differences in vfas and alkalinity measurements the analysis was conducted using the software spss version 21 ibm usa with a 95 confidence level p 0 05 statistical significance 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimization of data collection for model implementation the developed model uses the titration data as inputs for model fitting and problem solving optimization of the model mainly focuses on the determination of the ph range during the titration which helps select the segment of data with vfas recovery rate of 100 fig 2 in general the vfas recovery rate first shows a converging trend and subsequently a diverging trend as the ph increases from 4 0 to 7 5 a relatively stable vfas recovery rate with ph ranging from 5 1 to 5 6 is obtained as the average value decreases from 1 01 0 05 at ph 5 1 to 0 98 0 03 at ph 5 6 the chosen segment of data has a large influence on the fitting results for instance the vfas recovery rate can decrease to 0 95 0 04 at ph 6 and 0 82 0 15 at ph 7 thereby increasing the measured errors of up to 3 and 17 respectively given the minor difference between ph 5 1 and ph 5 6 ph 5 6 is selected as the upper boundary ph to ensure enough sample size for fitting moreover to avoid the impact of h 3 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 pka 2 1 snoeyink and jenkins 1980 ph 3 5 is manually set as the titration endpoint as well as the lower boundary ph in this study the poor recovery rate e g ph 5 1 or ph 5 6 obtained in this study is mainly ascribed to the following 1 when ph 5 6 the continuous stir in the sample during the titration which can accelerate the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere thus causing a deviation in the titration curve anderson and yang 1992 mu et al 2018 2 the influence from phosphate ammonium and sulfide ions which can be involved in fitting due to their ionization or pka at ph 5 6 to reduce such interference relative low ph values must be selected in the algorithm when ph 5 1 the fitting accuracy can be greatly influenced by the segment size e g the vfas recovery rate is up to 8 6 when using the segment size from ph 3 5 to ph 4 therefore the optimal ph range used in this model is set from 3 5 to 5 6 for data collection 4 2 accuracy and reproducibility the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach are evaluated with various concentrations of vfas from 100 to 500 mg l as hac and carbonate alkalinity from 300 to 2400 mg l as caco3 against the results obtained from the 5 ph point titration method figs 3 and 4 table s1 s2 and s1 of the si the vfas and carbonate alkalinity estimated by the developed approach are in good agreement with the corresponding values measured by the 5 ph point titration method also yielding a high recovery rate 90 and good linearity 0 99 fig 3 when vfas are lower than 400 mg l as hac the estimated values by the developed approach show slightly higher recovery rates 3 than the 5 ph point titration method whereas the difference is negligible for carbonate alkalinity this indicates that the developed approach is accurate and reproducible for vfas and carbonate alkalinity measurements particularly compared with the 5 ph point titration method fig 4 shows the correlation between the recovery rate of vfas and carbonate alkalinity and ratio of carbonate alkalinity to vfas from ratios of 0 6 15 little influence on vfas recovery rate but considerable influence on carbonate alkalinity are recorded at low ratios whereas the reverse trend is observed at high ratios in this study high recovery rates 0 90 of vfas are obtained at ratios of up to 7 5 by both methods at a ratio of 15 the relative error to the 5 ph point titration method is around 28 much larger than the developed approach with 13 thus suggesting that the developed approach has greater resistance to high alkalinity and good consistency and robustness this can be attributed to 1 the upper ph boundary of the developed approach of 5 6 which reduces the influence from carbonate alkalinity and 2 the fact that more data are applied for fitting and calculation in comparison with conventional titration methods as for carbonate alkalinity a relatively high recovery rate 1 is observed when using the 5 ph point titration method and a low recovery rate 0 9 at ratios lower than 2 4 is observed when using the developed approach ratios of carbonate alkalinity to vfas ranging from 2 4 to 7 5 are observed for greater recovery rates of vfas and carbonate alkalinity when using the developed approach the impact of the different ratios of carbonate alkalinity to vfas on the measurement of vfas can be explained by the overlap of the individual buffer intensity curves fig s1 of the si as elucidated in previous studies lahav and loewenthal 2000 lahav and morgan 2004 moosbrugger et al 1993b 1993a the points at which carbonate and acetate subsystems cross can induce changes in ph depending on the concentration of each purser et al 2014 overlapping is noticeable at ratios of 0 6 15 with cross points from ph 4 6 to 5 7 this causes the higher concentration subsystem described in a larger buffer intensity curve area this buffer intensity curve significantly affects the total area and subsystem at lower concentration sharp changes in buffer intensity can also occur at ph adjacent to the cross points thereby yielding titration gaps the 5 ph point titration method is more sensitive to the interference from other weak acids given that it relies on symmetrical ph pairs for calculation therefore using a segment of titration data with ph values of 3 5 5 6 can be more reliable and robust than using the developed approach for vfas and alkalinity measurements under different conditions 4 3 impact of phosphate ammonium and sulfide weak acid subsystems in the anaerobic process weak acid subsystems such as phosphate ammonium and sulfide coexist with vfas and carbonate subsystems these weak acid subsystems can cause interference to the measurement of vfas by affecting the titration curve different concentrations of phosphate ammonium and sulfide are added to standard vfas solutions with 50 and 100 mg l as hac for impact analyses fig 5 to simulate real cases no correction of these weak acid subsystems is made during the analyzer calculation negligible impact of phosphate from 20 to 100 mg p l on the measurement of vfas are recorded when using the developed approach with the relative errors ranging from 1 to 6 at 50 and 100 mg l as hac fig 5a this is consistent with other titration methods such as the 2 ph point titration 4 ph point titration and 5 ph point titration lützhøft et al 2014 for instance a phosphate concentration of up to 100 mg p l has very little effect on the measurement of vfas with errors of up to 6 mg l as hac when using the 5 ph point titration method moosbrugger et al 1993b dissolved phosphoric acid is normally present in the liquid phase as it does not decompose or escape to the atmosphere and its concentration ranges from 14 to 150 mg p l in the full scale anaerobic digesters for sludge treatment and can increase to 450 mg p l in dairy manure treatment battistoni et al 1997 huchzermeier and tao 2012 munch and barr 2001 tao et al 2016 yoshino et al 2003 hence the measurement of vfas in sludge treated ad process using the developed approach is insensitive to the phosphate concentrations however research must be done to confirm this observation for relatively high p concentrations above 200 mg p l it is expected that the effects of ammonium and sulfide on the measurement of vfas will be of insignificance given the high pk values of ammonium and sulfide pk n 9 25 and pk s 7 04 at 25 c and low pk value of acetate pk hac 4 75 at 25 c represent for vfas fig s1 lahav et al 2002 lahav and loewenthal 2000 lützhøft et al 2014 moosbrugger et al 1993a in this study the relative errors with ammonium or sulfide addition are within 8 at vfas concentrations of 50 mg l and 100 mg l as hac fig 5b and c one possible reason for the high relative error can be the volatility of hydrogen sulfide causing the inaccuracy in ph measurement and subsequently yielding errors in the collected data lahav et al 2002 this implies that the developed approach has high tolerance in the measurement of vfas with the presence of ammonium and sulfide with a concentration of up to 100 mg l as n or s while high levels of sulfide and ammonia can be present in the anaerobic system e g 10 372 mg s l and 100 1900 mg n l their presence mainly affect the ph instead of the titration curve during the vfas measurement due to the high pk values fung and yeung 2012 procházka et al 2012 yenigün and demirel 2013 zan et al 2019 4 4 long term stability evaluation of the developed approach the stability of the long term performance is the major concern regarding this automatic analyzer a one year vfas and alkalinity analysis was conducted with the characterization of food waste samples to reevaluate the accuracy and reliability of the developed approach samples were tested for vfas and alkalinity using the 5 ph point titration method and the developed approach respectively as shown in fig s2 of the si similar trends can be observed in the measurement of vfas and alkalinity showing the consistency and stability of the methods being used table 3 shows the results of a one way anova analyses of vfas and alkalinity it can be seen that the statistical significance is found at the 95 level of confidence suggesting the consistency of the results obtained with the two methods moreover the relative difference of vfas measured by the 5 ph point titration method and the developed approach is calculated and compared in fig 6 it is clear that most calculated results lie in the range of 10 with few results lying in the range of 20 the difference can be ascribed to the presence of other weak acid subsystems in the aqueous system it has been reported that inorganic carbon total ammonia nitrogen and phosphate can interfere with the measurement of vfas using the titration methods charnier et al 2016 mu et al 2018 ripley et al 1997 for instance organic acids such as citric or lactic acids can seriously hinder the measurement of vfas in food waste samples the pka values of citric acid pka1 3 09 and pka2 4 76 and lactic acid pka 3 86 are very close to that of vfas moreover the values lie in the ph range 5 6 3 5 required by the developed approach and theses acids are likely to be considered as vfas during the model calculations 4 5 potential application and drawbacks of the approach the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach in the measurement of vfas and alkalinity are well demonstrated in this study providing a new technique for real time automatic anaerobic system monitoring with greater accuracy and reliability the measurement of vfas is achieved by the mathematical model derived from the buffer intensity also the least squares method imbedded in the model is further used to solve the non linear fitting problem of the titration curve by using the titration data with ph ranging 5 6 3 5 this technique is capable of precisely measuring vfas and alkalinity concentrations up to 500 mg l as hac and 2400 mg l as caco3 respectively even with the influences of different vfas over carbonate alkalinity ratios and other weak acid subsystems e g phosphate ammonium and sulfide with good reliability and robustness compared with methods relying on gc angelidaki et al 1990 hplc albert and martens 1997 or headspace gc boe et al 2007 the developed approach is more viable particularly regarding cost and maintenance since the apparatus modules are cheap and easily available the initial ph greater than 6 7 is essential for the conventional 5 or 8 ph point titration method due to the symmetrical ph pairs for calculation manual addition of an alkaline solution is generally required in real application to increase the ph value above 6 7 by comparison for the developed approach the initial ph is 5 6 which nearly covers all conditions in the ad process given that the pka of vfas is around 4 75 this suggests a broad applicability of the developed approach and further guarantees the rapid analysis of vfas under different conditions while the developed approach has a more complex structure compared with the conventional titration methods three major units can be modularly designed and manufactured in addition the modularized analyzer can achieve real time automatic monitoring of vfas and alkalinity 3 min sample and also an accurate diagnosis hence allowing a timely adjustment of the anaerobic system for instance the abnormal level of vfas and alkalinity can be detected in time and a real time feedback control can be applied by changing the loading rate adjusting the ph and hrt to avoid the negative impact on the system operation and sustain the efficacy of the anaerobic system beside the aforementioned the following potential drawbacks can be expected and hence must be clarified while using the developed approach 1 the algorithm optimization 2 the modular integration and 3 the resistance against the complex conditions in the anaerobic processes to further upgrade the developed approach more detailed expression of the algorithm is necessary for model fitting and calculations greater design and integration of the analyzer can improve its application in addition regular calibration of the ph meter and titrant are essential to obtain accurate titration data for some systems under complex conditions the pretreatment of the samples or the adjustment of the algorithms can be required to sustain the accuracy and reduce the duration of titration therefore to further validate the possibility of applying the developed approach to other real cases including application to full scale anaerobic systems more studies must be done in the future meanwhile the v a analyzer is a potential market product for the measurement of vfas which can be used in several industrial processes such as the anaerobic sludge digestion biological nutrients removal wine making and food processing given its advantages namely reliable monitoring automation and speed 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the use of an innovative automatic analyzer embedded with a model combining the titration theory and a mathematical model fitting to precisely determine the concentration of vfas and alkalinity under different conditions the main findings are summarized as follow 1 a buffer intensity based mathematical model can be developed integrated with the least squares method which requires the ph to range between 3 5 and 5 6 for the measurement of vfas 2 the accuracy and reproducibility of the analyzer for vfas and alkalinity measurements can be validated and ratios of carbonate alkalinity over vfas must be in the range 2 4 7 5 for greater accuracy 3 the impact of other weak acid subsystems e g phosphate ammonium and sulfide are negligible when using the analyzer and 4 the rapid response 3 min sample accuracy and reliability make the developed analyzer a promising technique for on site real time automatic monitoring of the anaerobic process
