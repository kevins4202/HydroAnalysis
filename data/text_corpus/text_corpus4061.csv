turbine owt using gyrostabilizer ocean eng 209 2020 https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 107500 however contrary to the preceding paper the owt is modelled with rotor and is dynamic i e rotor rotating in different speeds thereby inducing gyroscopic motions on the floater this study is close to operational conditions of the wind turbine the expansion of wind energy has become a mainstream source of clean and cost effective energy in and around the world in the last 20 years according to the global wind energy report 2019 the global wind energy industry secured a breakthrough of 651 gw cumulative installed capacity around the world gwec 2019 wind energy can be harvested through wind turbines placed onshore and offshore as onshore wind technology has matured over the years its counterpart offshore wind energy stemmed using offshore industry concepts has more advantages higher productivity due to strong and uniform winds and installing these far off the coastal communities the issues of visual impact and noise are minimized as turbine erection is done at a deeper ocean practically there is no limit on the size of the turbines that can be installed as opposed to limits created by road restrictions in the case of onshore the installation of offshore wind farms is influenced by seabed fixed structures in the areas of shallow water water depth less than 60 m bottom fixed structures would not be economically feasible to support the wind turbine structures due to material and installation cost as water depth increases breton and moe 2009 floating platforms such as semisubmersibles tension leg platform tlp spar and barge can support owt in deep waters the barge that supports owt with catenary moorings attains stability via buoyancy and with a wide waterplane area as reported by jonkman 2007 and vijfhuizen 2006 of all the floating offshore wind turbine fowt models barge type fowt has a minimal complication of design fabrication transportation and installation but can be subjected to extreme wind wave induced loads in severe marine environments this results in a large oscillation effect on the wind turbine structures with huge displacements at the tower top and the blade tip these displacements will create large bending moments and shearing force at the root of the tower and the blades yang et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to minimize motions during parked and operational conditions by suitable stabilizers for the effective operation of the fowt motion control of any floating structure that supports owt using various technologies has been explored worldwide by the researchers a conventional blade pitch control with state space feedback controller ssfc yielded a reduction in platform angular motions up to 44 zuo et al 2013 collective blade pitch control using a linear quadratic regulator lqr reduced platform angular oscillations up to 27 namik et al 2008 the rolling motion of fowt was actively controlled by vertical vanes with a pi controller by kane s method and the roll motion damping was increased and damage equivalent loads of side side bending moment at the tower base was reduced from 19 to 42 under turbulent wind yang and li 2013 hu and he 2017 investigated the active based stroke limited hybrid mass damper hmd control strategy to lessen the dynamic response of the barge supported fowt this active hmd had a load reduction of about 60 for barge supported fowt ding et al 2019 investigated the stability of barge supported fowt with nacelle based passive tmd and showed the improvement in the stability of the roll motion and side to side displacement of the tower by 53 and 50 these damping devices were seated within or over the nacelle and use of rotor blades however these types of control tend to disturb the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine along with the challenges of structural stability of fowt due to the heavy tmd mass inside the nacelle over the tower top as reported by yang et al 2018 to overcome this drawback motion reduction devices within or over the substructures such as liquid column damper lcd active and passive tuned mass damper tmd and ball vibration absorber bva were used to reduce the motions among these devices stewart and lackner 2013 studied the load reduction of offshore wind turbine with a set of optimum passive tmd having a limited degree of freedom and reported reduction of the loads in the fore aft direction of the barge by 12 using fore aft tmd and side side loads by 30 using side side tmd motion reduction of 19 87 using active tmd with h structural control and 34 1 using tmd with g h structural control placed inside the barge was achieved as reported by li and gao 2016 he et al 2017 investigated the efficiency of lagrange s equations based fore aft tmd on barge supported fowt the maximum suppression rate varied from 20 to 50 when the mass ratio changed from 0 5 to 2 hu et al 2018 investigated the passive inerter based structural control of barge supported fowt motions and showed an improved performance using inerter with weak performance in tower top fore aft load yang et al 2018 investigated the improvement in the structural dynamic performance of barge supported fowt with tmd in a barge which showed the suppression rate of platform pitch motion by 47 95 and the tower top fore aft displacement by 38 64

motion reduction device to increase the survivability and fatigue life of fowt in an extreme marine environment this paper presents the dynamic response of a 1 50 scaled experimental model of iti barge supported 5 mw nrel owt jonkman 2007 with active gyrostabilizer to minimize the oscillatory motions of fowt structure exposed to the range of regular and irregular wave disturbances the efficiency of active gyrostabilizer on stabilizing the fowt model at parked and operational conditions have been investigated for regular and irregular waves 2 theoretical background to study the

rotation of the turbine rotor induces a gyroscopic effect on the floater due to wave disturbance on the fowt the gyroscopic moment has to be incorporated into the dynamic equation of motion of fowt the coordinate system to represent the rotational motion of the rotor is shown in fig 3 let us assume a right handed coordinate system where g is the center of the rotor x 1 y 1 z 1 be the initial

model of dimension 0 8 m 0 8 m 0 2 m sidewalls bottom and top of the barge model were made with the acrylic sheets of thickness 20 mm 30 mm and 10 mm a 50 mm diameter circular hole was provided in the middle on the top side of the barge to hold the turbine fixtures as a first approximation the 1 50 5 mw nrel owt tapered tower was modelled as a 5 mm thick rigid hollow cylinder with a circular acrylic tube of 50 mm inner diameter a stepped connecting rod was used to hold the tower in position on the barge the center of gravity targeted for the model scale is nearly matched by this arrangement for rotor nacelle assembly rna a rectangular nacelle was designed with an acrylic sheet of thickness 10 and 5 mm in such a way that it can hold a motor which in turn holds the rotor of the turbine and had a fixture to connect with the tower the top portion of the nacelle is kept open to match the scaled down inertia and to provide easy access to the sensors kept inside the nacelle the main parts of the turbine rotor are the shaft hub and blades two glass fiber sheets carbon fibre epoxy were used to fabricate the triangular shape hub sab scale blades sab0232 made up of glass fibre

swept back design at the root to accommodate the connections with the hub the blades were sandwiched in between the hub sheets at an angle of 120 apart and the hub holds the blades at 0 pitch angle to replicate the rotor arrangement the model rotor mass is 1 04 kg which is 13 5 more than the targeted mass of 0 9 kg where the inertia of the rotor was almost closely matched with distortion in length scale the rotor blade is only for the conceptual design for analyzing the rotor rotational effects on the floater response and not for power generation the rotor was connected to the shaft of the geared dc motor and the motor was rigidly fixed inside the nacelle with a help of a mounting bracket with shaft extension outside the nacelle to hold the rotor naqvi 2012 in the present study the nacelle is fixed yawing angle is zero four pvc coated 3 mm steel wire ropes of length 5 m each were used as a catenary mooring arrangement to prevent drifting of fowt through the wave basin one end of

the help of four catenary mooring lines by tieing it to the basin floor anchor to avoid drift along the wave basin the wave probe was fixed on the left side at a distance of 7 5 m away from the model to record the undisturbed incoming waves 4 1 instrumentation and control the data measuring system consists of a resistant type wave probe connected with a wavemeter that was opted to record the in line wave surface elevation a two axis inclinometer psital fraba was used to measure the platform pitch and roll motion due to waves the wave probe and inclinometer were calibrated manually and the calibration constants obtained were 10 4 cm per volt and 40 per volt with an accuracy of 0 1 pcb single axis accelerometer was used to measure the nacelle acceleration in fore after and side to side motions with a calibration constant of 9 55 m s2 per volt eight channel hbm spider8 was used for data recording and it has been connected to the personal computer pc the spider8 was interfaced with catman data acquisition daq software the wave and motion responses such as roll pitch side to side and fore after nacelle acceleration of the dynamic fowt model were recorded with a sampling rate of 150 hz the rpm of the bldc motor that rotates the gyrostabilizer flywheel was also calibrated and the calibration constant is 380 rpm v dc power supply was used to power up the gyrostabilizer via 4 mm thick silicon wire gyrostabilizer control includes an electronic speed controller esc used to power up the microcontroller board and to control the rpm of the flywheel motor pixhawk microcontroller

state derivative feedback gain adopted based on the trial and error method which was kept constant for all gyrostabilizer on test cases the maximum precession angle of the gimbal frame was limited to 57 3 by the servo motor i e 1 rad perez and steinmann 2009 as turbine rotor rotation is concerned a motor driven rotor system was opted to purely model the gyroscopic force due to rotor rotation wan et al 2014 goupee et al 2014 and murphy et al 2015 a 12 v geared dc motor with the specification of 200 rpm and 15 6 kg cm stall torque was used to drive the rotor précised motor shaft rotation was achieved through the l298n motor driver communicated via the arduino uno microcontroller board through arduino ide software to verify the accuracy of the rotation that represents the below rated 60

speeds that represent below rated rated and above rated cases and these rpms are given in table 3 5 1 regular waves the model was subjected to regular waves of 5 cm height with wave period ranging from 1 5 s to 2 3 s that includes above below and near the natural period of the model experiments were conducted for 0 and 90 wave heading angles waves were generated and the resulting platform pitch and roll rotational motions as well as its corresponding nacelle accelerations were recorded using inclinometers only dominant responses were considered for data analysis namely pitch motion for 0 heading angle and roll motion for 90 heading angle for regular wave the pitch and roll response can be represented in terms of a non dimensional transfer function called response amplitude operator rao which is defined as the ratio of response amplitude to wave steepness as recommended by the ittc and denoted by 20 θ ˆ θ a k ζ a 21 φ ˆ φ a k ζ a where θ ˆ is the nondimensional pitch response

in the nrao fa and nrao ss have been indicated as an error bar in the fore aft and side to side rao graph shown in figs 9 b and fig 14 b 7 experimental test results 7 1 free decay test free vibration tests were performed in the wave basin for roll and pitch dof by giving an initial angular displacement and recording the resultant decaying responses rigid fowt along with gyrostabilizer in off condition was deflected at one of the ends and then released the free decay time histories recorded are shown in fig 7 and from the time histories the damped natural frequency and damping ratio for roll and pitch were calculated the damping ratio was estimated by the logarithmic decrement method averaging over successive cycles from the time series the roll and pitch natural frequencies obtained are 0 478 hz and 0 484 hz respectively and the roll and pitch damping ratios obtained are 0 044 and 0 027 respectively and this is shown in table 4 7 2 regular wave tests 7 2 1 fowt at 0 wave heading angle to estimate the pitch response fowt was positioned in such a way that its rotor axis g x 1 is normal to the face of the wave paddle with rna having fore aft movement sample time series comparison of pitch response of fowt at parked and operational conditions for regular wave height of 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the wave periods of 2 0 s 2 1 s and 2 2 s are shown in fig 8 it can be observed from the time series comparisons significant pitch response reduction occurs for fowt with gyro on condition stabilized time series length was used from the time series of wave and responses of fowt to estimate the rao for gyro off and on conditions p r a o and n r a o f a comparison of fowt at parked and operational conditions for gyro off case is shown in fig 9 a b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from the figure it is observed that the pitch response is maximum for the rotor at the parked condition than the operational conditions this less pitch response during operational conditions is due to the additional gyroscopic damping created due to the spinning turbine rotor during the operational conditions the damping induced on the fowt motion in pitch dof due to gyroscopic forces is directly proportional to the angular rate and moment of inertia of the rotor results show that an increase in the speed of the rotor from 60 rpm to 80 rpm and 114 rpm to represent rated and above rated condition has increased the damping in pitch response of fowt the peak is observed close to the natural period of 2 1 s for parked and at all operational conditions prao comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition at rotor parked and at three different operating cases is shown in fig 10 the prao peak of 5 17 2 28 2 08 1 90 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively during gyro off condition has been reduced to 2 39 1 55 1 12 and 1 35 during gyro on condition this shows that there is a significant reduction in pitch response peak of fowt with gyro on at parked and operational conditions the gyrostabilizer had significantly effective in reducing the pitch response at all the periods for the different turbine rotor rpm cases and the maximum reduction is observed near the resonant period of t 2 1 s due to higher stabilizing moment caused by the gyro at higher responses for the operational cases in addition to the gyroscopic damping due to rotation of the turbine rotor gyro had also added a significant amount of damping moment on the pitch response of fowt fig 11 shows the sample time series comparisons of fowt nacelle fore aft accelerations at parked and operational conditions for regular wave height of 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the near natural periods 2 0 s 2 1 s and 2 2 s from the time series comparisons significant damping in fore aft nacelle acceleration due to pitch response is observed for rotor at the parked and rated case with gyro on condition less performance of gyro on motions of fowt at operational conditions is due to the small pitch angle i e θ 3 that leads to the reduced precision angle of the gyro thereby reduced effect of counteracting moment on the pitch motion during the operational conditions maximum allowable nacelle acceleration is limited to 1 0 m s 2 karimi et al 2017 and this is observed for the case of rated and above rated time series from the response of wave and nacelle displacement estimated from the acceleration time series of fowt n r a o f a was evaluated for gyro off and on condition with the stabilized time series length n r a o f a comparison of fowt at parked and operational cases for gyro off condition for the 5 cm wave height is shown in fig 9 b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from this figure it is observed that the peak nacelle displacement is at 2 1 s for all rotor cases with gyro off condition and this shows that the nacelle response is high near the natural period of the fowt as in the case of pitch response the nacelle fore aft response at the operational condition is less than the parked condition and this is due to the rotor gyroscopic moment that influences the floater motion that drives the nacelle pitch response n r a o f a comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for all the turbine rotor cases is shown in fig 12 the n r a o f a peak of 8 56 6 89 7 03 5 72 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively during gyro off condition has been reduced to 5 47 4 37 2 84 and 4 34 during gyro on condition the maximum reduction of nacelle fore aft displacement during operational conditions is observed for fowt at rated condition less performance in below and above rated operational cases is due to the less stabilizing moment created due to the small wave induced pitch responses 7 2 2 fowt at 90 wave heading angle to estimate the roll response fowt was positioned in such a way that its rotor axis g x 1 are parallel to the face of the wave paddle with nacelle having side to side movement sample time series comparison of roll response of fowt at parked and operational conditions for wave height of 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the wave periods of 2 0 s 2 1 s and 2 2 s are shown in fig 13 it is observed from the time series comparisons that the significant roll response damping occurs for fowt with gyro on condition stabilized time series length was used from the time series of wave and roll responses of fowt to estimate the rrao for gyro off and on conditions rrao comparison and n r a o s s comparison of fowt at parked and operational conditions for gyro off case is shown in fig 14 a b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from the figure by comparing roll response of fowt for rotor at different operational cases it is observed that the roll response is higher at rated speed and lower at the below rated speed for most of the time periods the higher roll response at rated speed is due to the moment created by the spinning rotor being in phase with the wave exciting moment a lower roll response at below rated speed indicates that the moment due to rotor rotation is out of phase with the wave exciting moment the peak is observed at 2 0 s for rated rpm and 2 1 s for below rated above rated and parked condition which are close to the natural period rrao comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for the parked and operational conditions of the wind turbine rotor is shown in fig 15 the rrao peak of 5 20 5 15 5 45 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated above rated and 5 99 at 2 0 s for rated rpm during gyro off condition has been reduced to 2 11 2 53 2 37 and 2 08 during gyro on condition this shows a significant reduction in roll response of fowt with gyro on condition for turbine rotor at parked and operational conditions the gyrostabilizer had significantly effective in reducing the roll response at all the periods for the different turbine rotor rpm cases and the maximum reduction is observed near the resonant period of t 2 1 s due to higher stabilizing moment caused by the gyro at higher responses for the operational cases gyro had added a significant amount of damping moment on the roll response of fowt fig 16 shows the sample time series comparisons of nacelle side to side acceleration of fowt at the parked and operational case for gyro off and on condition from the time series comparisons a significant reduction in nacelle side to side acceleration due to roll response is noticed for all the turbine rotor case with gyro on condition from the time histories of wave and nacelle displacement estimated from the acceleration time series of fowt n r a o s s was evaluated for gyro off and on condition with the stabilized time series length nrao ss comparison of fowt at the parked and operational case for gyro off condition is shown in fig 14 b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from this figure it is noticed that the peak nacelle displacement is at 2 0 s for rated condition and 2 1 s for other test cases with gyro off condition this shows that nacelle response is high near the natural period of the fowt as in the case of roll response n r a o s s comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for the turbine rotor at parked and operational conditions is shown in fig 17 from the figure a significant reduction in the nacelle side to side response around the natural period with gyro on condition is observed for all turbine rotor cases the n r a o s s peak of 16 0 14 53 19 37 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated above rated and 20 12 at 2 0 s for rated case during gyro off condition has been reduced to 7 75 7 56 9 14 and 8 04 during gyro on condition this indicates that the gyrostabilizer is more effective in reducing the nacelle motion and the maximum reduction of nacelle side to side displacement is observed for fowt at rated condition and this maximum reduction of side to side motion at rated condition is due to the better reduction of roll motion that drives the nacelle response 7 2 3 comparison of responses reduction for different wave periods to estimate the efficiency of gyrostabilizer the rotational motion reduction is evaluated by a common figure of performance called reduction of rotation rr widely used by the ship roll stabilizer manufacturers and is given by perez 2005 32 r r 100 1 i s i u t j where i φ ˆ θ ˆ δ ˆ s s δ ˆ f a and t j is the corresponding period denotes the rao value and the superscripts u and s stands for gyro off unstabilized and gyro on stabilized table 5 shows the rr values at different wave periods obtained for the roll pitch and corresponding nacelle motions for parked and operational conditions from the table it is observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer for roll motion reduction is high near the natural period and the reduction observed is almost 64 for parked 57 for below rated 67 for rated and 64 for above rated conditions by reducing the roll motion the nacelle side to side motion is reduced significantly around the natural period and the reduction rates are almost 58 for parked 40 for below rated 63 for rated and 53 for above rated conditions it also observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer for pitch motion reduction is high for parked condition and has slightly less impact during operational conditions the maximum reduction is around the natural period and the reduction observed is almost 54 for parked 39 for below rated 45 for rated and 39 for above rated conditions by reducing the pitch motion the nacelle fore aft acceleration is reduced near natural period and the reduction is almost 69 for parked 46 for below rated 60 for rated and 40 for above rated conditions 7 2 4 precession angle proportional and derivative control of the gimbal torque is responsible for generating the continuous precession motion that generates the gyro counteracting moment fig 18 shows the measured precession angle time series comparisons between roll and pitch for the regular wave height of 5 cm for the wave periods of t 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s from the figure it is observed that the maximum precission angle attained by the gyrostabilizer gimbal to generate stabilizing torque for the corresponding platform roll is more than 30 for all fowt conditions and pitch motion it is more than 30 for fowt at the parked condition and is less for operational conditions 7 3 motion response of fowt for irregular waves 7 3 1 fowt at 0 wave heading angle the sample time histories of pitch response of fowt at parked and operational case with gyro off and on condition for an irregular wave of hs 6 cm and tp 2 3 s is shown in fig 19 a pitch response is less for fowt with gyro off at operational conditions this is due to the additional damping created by the gyroscopic effect of the spinning rotor from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer is significant in reducing the pitch in the region of highest response for rotor at parked and below rated condition for rotor at rated and above rated condition the reduction observed is less and the reason behind the low performance of gyro is that pitch angle is very less for the gyro to respond fig 20 shows the pitch response spectrums comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for the turbine rotor at the parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s of significant wave height 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the peak of pitch response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases the maximum pitch response peak of 43 1 d e g 2 s for rotor at the parked case for tp 2 2 s with gyro off condition has been reduced to 10 95 d e g 2 s for the gyro on condition the highest response peak of 18 4 d e g 2 s 7 4 d e g 2 s 8 0 d e g 2 s for tp 2 1 s for below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 7 8 d e g 2 s 4 7 d e g 2 s and 4 68 d e g 2 s for the gyro on condition the area under the pitch response spectrums is also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer for the rotor parked case the area under the pitch spectrum is 3 3 d e g 2 3 7 d e g 2 3 8 d e g 2 4 5 d e g 2 5 3 d e g 2 and 5 7 d e g 2 for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 2 3 d e g 2 2 2 d e g 2 2 3 d e g 2 2 6 d e g 2 1 7 d e g 2 and 1 7 d e g 2 for gyro on condition overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 4 0 6 hz for all cases the sample time histories of nacelle fore aft acceleration during pitch dof with gyro off and on condition for turbine rotor at parked and operational case is shown in fig 19 b from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyro has significantly reduced the nacelle afore aft acceleration created by the pitch motion the maximum reduction is observed for the rotor at the parked condition fig 21 shows the nacelle fore aft displacement spectrum comparison with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the turbine rotor at parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s with a significant wave height of 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the peak of the nacelle fore aft response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases the maximum nacelle fore aft response peak of 0 14 m 2 s for rotor at the parked case at tp 2 2 s with gyro off condition has been reduced to 4 5 10 2 m 2 s for the gyro on condition the highest response peak of 4 3 10 2 m 2 s at tp 2 2 s 2 6 10 2 m 2 s and 2 4 10 2 m 2 s at 2 1 s for below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 1 6 10 2 m 2 s 1 4 10 2 m 2 s and 1 3 10 2 m 2 s for the gyro on condition the area under the nacelle fore aft response spectrums is also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer for the rotor parked case the area under the nacelle fore aft response spectrum of 7 6 10 3 m 2 1 0 10 2 m 2 1 1 10 2 m 2 1 4 10 2 m 2 1 7 10 2 m 2 and 1 5 10 2 m 2 for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 4 5 10 3 m 2 4 4 10 3 m 2 6 2 10 3 m 2 7 3 10 3 m 2 5 9 10 3 m 2 and 4 6 10 3 m 2 for gyro on condition overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 4 0 65 hz for all cases 7 3 2 fowt at 90 wave heading the sample time histories of roll response of fowt at the parked and operational case with gyro off and on condition for the irregular wave of hs 6 cm and tp 2 3 s is shown in fig 22 from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer is significant in reducing the roll in the region of highest response and the reduction is more for rotor at rated and above rated case in comparison with other cases this higher motion reduction is due to the higher precision motion of the gyro gimbal driven by the roll motion which are more at rated and above rated case fig 23 shows the roll response spectrums comparison of fowt with gyro off and on conditions for rotor at the parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s of significant wave height 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the roll response at the operational case is higher than the response at the parked case for gyro off condition this indicates that the disturbance in the rotation axis of the turbine rotor had increased the platform motion from the figure it is observed that the peak of roll response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases and the motion reductions are highest around the peak frequency and for most cases it is around the natural frequency of the fowt the maximum roll response peak of 64 6 d e g 2 s for above rated rpm at tp 2 3 s with gyro off condition has been reduced to 15 9 d e g 2 s the highest response peak of 42 7 d e g 2 s 52 71 d e g 2 s at 2 2 s and 51 7 d e g 2 s at 2 3 s for parked below rated and rated rpm has been reduced to 10 98 d e g 2 s 10 0 d e g 2 s and 14 7 d e g 2 s by gyro on condition the area under the roll response spectrums is also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer the area under the roll spectrum is 4 6 d e g 2 5 0 d e g 2 5 1 d e g 2 6 0 d e g 2 6 5 d e g 2 and 7 7 d e g 2 for gyro off condition at below rated rpm and above rated rpm has been reduced to 2 5 d e g 2 2 3 d e g 2 2 2 d e g 2 1 9 d e g 2 2 2 d e g 2 and 2 0 d e g 2 during gyro on condition this shows a significant reduction in roll response of fowt with gyro on condition for all the cases of the turbine rotor overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 36 hz 0 66 hz for all cases the sample time histories of nacelle side to side acceleration during roll dof with gyro off and on condition for turbine rotor at parked and operational case is shown in fig 22 b from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyro has significantly reduced the nacelle side to side acceleration created by the roll motion the maximum reduction is observed for the rotor at rated condition in comparison with other cases as the roll response reduction of fowt at the rated operational condition is high compared to the other cases the nacelle side to side motion reduction is also high fig 24 shows the nacelle side to side displacement spectrum comparison with gyro off and on conditions for the turbine rotor at the parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s with a significant wave height of 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the peak of the nacelle side to side response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases and the motion reductions are highest around the frequency where the peak of the spectrum lies the maximum nacelle response peak of 20 9 10 2 m 2 s is observed at tp 2 3 s for rotor at above rated rpm with gyro off condition has been reduced to 5 6 10 2 m 2 s the highest response peak of 14 6 10 2 m 2 s 13 9 10 2 m 2 s at 2 2 s and 20 8 10 2 m 2 s at 2 3 s for parked below rated and rated rpm during gyro off condition has been reduced to 3 4 10 2 m 2 s 4 2 10 2 m 2 s and 3 5 10 2 m 2 s for gyro on condition the area under the nacelle side to side response spectrums are also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer the maximum area under the nacelle side to side displacement spectrum for gyro off condition is 8 6 10 3 m 2 1 27 10 2 m 2 1 46 10 2 m 2 1 95 10 2 m 2 2 21 10 2 m 2 and 2 42 10 2 m 2 obtained at different operational condition has been reduced to 4 2 10 3 m 2 0 5 10 2 m 2 0 58 10 2 m 2 0 67 10 2 m 2 0 73 10 2 m 2 and 0 7 10 2 m 2 for gyro on condition overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 39 hz 0 66 hz for all cases 7 3 3 comparison of reduction of statistics of response rsr to estimate the efficiency of gyrostabilizer for irregular wave conditions the rotational motion in irregular waves for the selected sea state is more appropriately evaluated using statistics of fowt response the percentage of reduction of statistics of response rsr is defined as perez 2005 33 r s r 100 1 h i s 1 3 h i u 1 3 where i φ θ a s s a f a and h i 1 3 denotes the double significant amplitude valueof responses obtained by the eq 27 and the superscripts u and s stands for gyro off unstabilized and gyro on stabilized table 6 shows the estimated platform and nacelle response reduction rate for irregular wave conditions from the table it is observed that the maximum reductions are observed near the frequencies wherein the wave spectral peaks are near to the natural periods of the roll pitch motions for roll motion maximum rsr of 44 for parked 46 for below rated 53 for rated and 49 are obtained by reducing the roll motion the nacelle side to side displacements response is reduced remarkably and the rsr are almost 50 for parked 43 for below rated 55 for rated and 46 for above rated conditions for pitch motion maximum rsr of 43 for parked 35 for below rated 23 for rated and 32 for above rated rotor angular velocity conditions by reducing the pitch motions the nacelle fore aft displacement response is reduced and the rsr are almost 45 for parked 39 for below rated 33 for rated and 25 for above rated conditions 7 3 4 precession angle fig 25 shows the measured precession angle time series comparisons between roll and pitch for the irregular wave height of 6 cm for the peak period of 2 3 s from the figure it is observed that the maximum precission angle attained by the gyrostabilizer gimbal to generate stabilizing torque for the corresponding platform roll is almost 20 for all fowt conditions whereas for pitch motion the precession angle is significantly less for operational conditions 8 summary and conclusion detailed experiments were carried out to investigate and evaluate the performance of a gyrostabilizer on a fowt on a model scale experiments were performed in regular and irregular waves to evaluate the efficiency of gyrostabilizer in motion reduction of fowt at parked shut down case and operational conditions to represent the fowt at the operational scenario different wind turbine rotor rotating conditions such as below rated power 60 rpm rated power 85 rpm above rated power 114 rpm were selected the platform rotations and nacelle accelerations during roll and pitch dof for gyrostabilizer off and on condition with gyro flywheel spin velocity of 5700 were measured and compared to evaluate the motion reduction rates based on the detailed experimental investigations following conclusions are drawn 8 1 roll an increase in platform motion of the fowt was observed during the turbine operational condition than at the parked condition due to extra loads created by the rotating turbine rotor for both regular and irregular waves the increase in motion varied between 5 6 and 12 3 for the cases undertaken in this study under regular waves the roll reduction by almost 64 for parked 57 for below rated 67 for rated and 64 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer reduction of roll motions resulted in the reduction of nacelle side to side acceleration and the reduction rates obtained were almost 58 for parked 40 for below rated 63 for rated and 53 for above rated conditions for irregular waves roll reduction by 44 for parked 46 for below rated 53 for rated and 49 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer reduction of roll motions resulted in the reduction of nacelle side to side acceleration and the reduction rates obtained were almost 50 for parked 43 for below rated 55 for rated and 46 for above rated conditions 8 2 pitch a decrease in platform pitch motion of the fowt was observed during the turbine operational condition than at the parked condition due to the gyroscopic effect created by the rotating turbine rotor for both regular and irregular waves the decrease in motion varied between 55 8 and 63 3 for the cases undertaken in this study under regular waves the pitch reduction by almost 54 for parked 39 for below rated 45 for rated and 39 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer by reducing the pitch motions the nacelle fore aft acceleration is also reduced significantly and the reduction rates are almost 69 for parked 46 for below rated 60 for rated and 40 for above rated conditions for irregular waves pitch reduction by 43 for parked 35 for below rated 23 for rated and 32 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer reduction of pitch motions resulted in reduction of nacelle fore aft acceleration and the reduction rates obtained are almost 45 for parked 39 for below rated 33 for rated and 25 for above rated condition the reduction in motion showed by the experiments can be achieved in the prototype by the proper design of a gyroscopic stabilizer this work is limited in exploring the performance of the gyrostabilizer in mitigating the fowt motions at dynamic conditions including the gyroscopic effect at the prototype level it is very difficult and challenging to model a device with a large rotational mass and required levels of force to actuate the gimbal to generate a stabilizing moment by placing more than one gyrostabilizer inline or by having a gyrostabilizer with more than one flywheel stabilizing moment are the options that can be investigated for applications credit authorship

turbine owt using gyrostabilizer ocean eng 209 2020 https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 107500 however contrary to the preceding paper the owt is modelled with rotor and is dynamic i e rotor rotating in different speeds thereby inducing gyroscopic motions on the floater this study is close to operational conditions of the wind turbine the expansion of wind energy has become a mainstream source of clean and cost effective energy in and around the world in the last 20 years according to the global wind energy report 2019 the global wind energy industry secured a breakthrough of 651 gw cumulative installed capacity around the world gwec 2019 wind energy can be harvested through wind turbines placed onshore and offshore as onshore wind technology has matured over the years its counterpart offshore wind energy stemmed using offshore industry concepts has more advantages higher productivity due to strong and uniform winds and installing these far off the coastal communities the issues of visual impact and noise are minimized as turbine erection is done at a deeper ocean practically there is no limit on the size of the turbines that can be installed as opposed to limits created by road restrictions in the case of onshore the installation of offshore wind farms is influenced by seabed fixed structures in the areas of shallow water water depth less than 60 m bottom fixed structures would not be economically feasible to support the wind turbine structures due to material and installation cost as water depth increases breton and moe 2009 floating platforms such as semisubmersibles tension leg platform tlp spar and barge can support owt in deep waters the barge that supports owt with catenary moorings attains stability via buoyancy and with a wide waterplane area as reported by jonkman 2007 and vijfhuizen 2006 of all the floating offshore wind turbine fowt models barge type fowt has a minimal complication of design fabrication transportation and installation but can be subjected to extreme wind wave induced loads in severe marine environments this results in a large oscillation effect on the wind turbine structures with huge displacements at the tower top and the blade tip these displacements will create large bending moments and shearing force at the root of the tower and the blades yang et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to minimize motions during parked and operational conditions by suitable stabilizers for the effective operation of the fowt motion control of any floating structure that supports owt using various technologies

tests were performed in the wave basin for roll and pitch dof by giving an initial angular displacement and recording the resultant decaying responses rigid fowt along with gyrostabilizer in off condition was deflected at one of the ends and then released the free decay time histories recorded are shown in fig 7 and from the time histories the damped natural frequency and damping ratio for roll and pitch were calculated the damping ratio was estimated by the logarithmic decrement method averaging over successive cycles from the time series the roll and pitch natural frequencies obtained are 0 478 hz and 0 484 hz respectively and the roll and pitch damping ratios obtained are 0 044 and 0 027 respectively and this is shown in table 4 7 2 regular wave tests 7 2 1 fowt at 0 wave heading angle to estimate the pitch response fowt was positioned in such a way that its rotor axis g x 1 is normal to the face of the wave paddle with rna having fore aft movement sample time series comparison of pitch response of fowt at parked and operational conditions for regular wave height of 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the wave periods of 2 0 s 2 1 s and 2 2 s are shown in fig 8 it can be observed from the time series comparisons significant pitch response reduction occurs for fowt with gyro on condition stabilized time series length was used from the time series of wave and responses of fowt to estimate the rao for gyro off and on conditions p r a o and n r a o f a comparison of fowt at parked and operational conditions for gyro off case is shown in fig 9 a b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from the figure it is observed that the pitch response is maximum for the rotor at the parked condition than the operational conditions this less pitch response during operational conditions is due to the additional gyroscopic damping created due to the spinning turbine rotor during the operational conditions the damping induced on the fowt motion in pitch dof due to gyroscopic forces is directly proportional to the angular rate and moment of inertia of the rotor results show that an increase in the speed of the rotor from 60 rpm to 80 rpm and 114 rpm to represent rated and above rated condition has increased the damping in pitch response of fowt the peak is observed close to the natural period of 2 1 s for parked and at all operational conditions prao comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition at rotor parked and at three different operating cases is shown in fig 10 the prao peak of 5 17 2 28 2 08 1 90 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively during gyro off condition has been reduced to 2 39 1 55 1 12 and 1 35 during gyro on condition this shows that there is a significant reduction in pitch response peak of fowt with gyro on at parked and operational conditions the gyrostabilizer had significantly effective in reducing the pitch response at all the periods for the different turbine rotor rpm cases and the maximum reduction is observed near the resonant period of t 2 1 s due to higher stabilizing moment caused by the gyro at higher responses for the operational cases in addition to the gyroscopic damping due to rotation of the turbine rotor gyro had also added a significant amount of damping moment on the pitch response of fowt fig 11 shows the sample time series comparisons of fowt nacelle fore aft accelerations at parked and operational conditions for regular wave height of 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the near natural periods 2 0 s 2 1 s and 2 2 s from the time series comparisons significant damping in fore aft nacelle acceleration due to pitch response is observed for rotor at the parked and rated case with gyro on condition less performance of gyro on motions of fowt at operational conditions is due to the small pitch angle i e θ 3 that leads to the reduced precision angle of the gyro thereby reduced effect of counteracting moment on the pitch motion during the operational conditions maximum allowable nacelle acceleration is limited to 1 0 m s 2 karimi et al 2017 and this is observed for the case of rated and above rated time series from the response of wave and nacelle displacement estimated from the acceleration time series of fowt n r a o f a was evaluated for gyro off and on condition with the stabilized time series length n r a o f a comparison of fowt at parked and operational cases for gyro off condition for the 5 cm wave height is shown in fig 9 b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from this figure it is observed that the peak nacelle displacement is at 2 1 s for all rotor cases with gyro off condition and this shows that the nacelle response is high near the natural period of the fowt as in the case of pitch response the nacelle fore aft response at the operational condition is less than the parked condition and this is due to the rotor gyroscopic moment that influences the floater motion that drives the nacelle pitch response n r a o f a comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for all the turbine rotor cases is shown in fig 12 the n r a o f a peak of 8 56 6 89 7 03 5 72 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively during gyro off condition has been reduced to 5 47 4 37 2 84 and 4 34 during gyro on condition the maximum reduction of nacelle fore aft displacement during operational conditions is observed for fowt at rated condition less performance in below and above rated operational cases is due to the less stabilizing moment created due to the small wave induced pitch responses 7 2 2 fowt at 90 wave heading angle to estimate the roll response fowt was positioned in such a way that its rotor axis g x 1 are parallel to the face of the wave paddle with nacelle having side to side movement sample time series comparison of roll response of fowt at parked and operational conditions for wave height of 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the wave periods of 2 0 s 2 1 s and 2 2 s are shown in fig 13 it is observed from the time series comparisons that the significant roll response damping occurs for fowt with gyro on condition stabilized time series length was used from the time series of wave and roll responses of fowt to estimate the rrao for gyro off and on conditions rrao comparison and n r a o s s comparison of fowt at parked and operational conditions for gyro off case is shown in fig 14 a b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from the figure by comparing roll response of fowt for rotor at different operational cases it is observed that the roll response is higher at rated speed and lower at the below rated speed for most of the time periods the higher roll response at rated speed is due to the moment created by the spinning rotor being in phase with the wave exciting moment a lower roll response at below rated speed indicates that the moment due to rotor rotation is out of phase with the wave exciting moment the peak is observed at 2 0 s for rated rpm and 2 1 s for below rated above rated and parked condition which are close to the natural period rrao comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for the parked and operational conditions of the wind turbine rotor is shown in fig 15 the rrao peak of 5 20 5 15 5 45 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated above rated and 5 99 at 2 0 s for rated rpm during gyro off condition has been reduced to 2 11 2 53 2 37 and 2 08 during gyro on condition this shows a significant reduction in roll response of fowt with gyro on condition for turbine rotor at parked and operational conditions the gyrostabilizer had significantly effective in reducing the roll response at all the periods for the different turbine rotor rpm cases and the maximum reduction is observed near the resonant period of t 2 1 s due to higher stabilizing moment caused by the gyro at higher responses for the operational cases gyro had added a significant amount of damping moment on the roll response of fowt fig 16 shows the sample time series comparisons of nacelle side to side acceleration of fowt at the parked and operational case for gyro off and on condition from the time series comparisons a significant reduction in nacelle side to side acceleration due to roll response is noticed for all the turbine rotor case with gyro on condition from the time histories of wave and nacelle displacement estimated from the acceleration time series of fowt n r a o s s was evaluated for gyro off and on condition with the stabilized time series length nrao ss comparison of fowt at the parked and operational case for gyro off condition is shown in fig 14 b the associated error bars obtained using eq 29 are marked in the same figure to indicate the experimental uncertainty from this figure it is noticed that the peak nacelle displacement is at 2 0 s for rated condition and 2 1 s for other test cases with gyro off condition this shows that nacelle response is high near the natural period of the fowt as in the case of roll response n r a o s s comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for the turbine rotor at parked and operational conditions is shown in fig 17 from the figure a significant reduction in the nacelle side to side response around the natural period with gyro on condition is observed for all turbine rotor cases the n r a o s s peak of 16 0 14 53 19 37 at 2 1 s for rotor at parked below rated above rated and 20 12 at 2 0 s for rated case during gyro off condition has been reduced to 7 75 7 56 9 14 and 8 04 during gyro on condition this indicates that the gyrostabilizer is more effective in reducing the nacelle motion and the maximum reduction of nacelle side to side displacement is observed for fowt at rated condition and this maximum reduction of side to side motion at rated condition is due to the better reduction of roll motion that drives the nacelle response 7 2 3 comparison of responses reduction for different wave periods to estimate the efficiency of gyrostabilizer the rotational motion reduction is evaluated by a common figure of performance called reduction of rotation rr widely used by the ship roll stabilizer manufacturers and is given by perez 2005 32 r r 100 1 i s i u t j where i φ ˆ θ ˆ δ ˆ s s δ ˆ f a and t j is the corresponding period denotes the rao value and the superscripts u and s stands for gyro off unstabilized and gyro on stabilized table 5 shows the rr values at different wave periods obtained for the roll pitch and corresponding nacelle motions for parked and operational conditions from the table it is observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer for roll motion reduction is high near the natural period and the reduction observed is almost 64 for parked 57 for below rated 67 for rated and 64 for above rated conditions by reducing the roll motion the nacelle side to side motion is reduced significantly around the natural period and the reduction rates are almost 58 for parked 40 for below rated 63 for rated and 53 for above rated conditions it also observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer for pitch motion reduction is high for parked condition and has slightly less impact during operational conditions the maximum reduction is around the natural period and the reduction observed is almost 54 for parked 39 for below rated 45 for rated and 39 for above rated conditions by reducing the pitch motion the nacelle fore aft acceleration is reduced near natural period and the reduction is almost 69 for parked 46 for below rated 60 for rated and 40 for above rated conditions 7 2 4 precession angle proportional and derivative control of the gimbal torque is responsible for generating the continuous precession motion that generates the gyro counteracting moment fig 18 shows the measured precession angle time series comparisons between roll and pitch for the regular wave height of 5 cm for the wave periods of t 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s from the figure it is observed that the maximum precission angle attained by the gyrostabilizer gimbal to generate stabilizing torque for the corresponding platform roll is more than 30 for all fowt conditions and pitch motion it is more than 30 for fowt at the parked condition and is less for operational conditions 7 3 motion response of fowt for irregular waves 7 3 1 fowt at 0 wave heading angle the sample time histories of pitch response of fowt at parked and operational case with gyro off and on condition for an irregular wave of hs 6 cm and tp 2 3 s is shown in fig 19 a pitch response is less for fowt with gyro off at operational conditions this is due to the additional damping created by the gyroscopic effect of the spinning rotor from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer is significant in reducing the pitch in the region of highest response for rotor at parked and below rated condition for rotor at rated and above rated condition the reduction observed is less and the reason behind the low performance of gyro is that pitch angle is very less for the gyro to respond fig 20 shows the pitch response spectrums comparison of fowt with gyro off and on condition for the turbine rotor at the parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s of significant wave height 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the peak of pitch response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases the maximum pitch response peak of 43 1 d e g 2 s for rotor at the parked case for tp 2 2 s with gyro off condition has been reduced to 10 95 d e g 2 s for the gyro on condition the highest response peak of 18 4 d e g 2 s 7 4 d e g 2 s 8 0 d e g 2 s for tp 2 1 s for below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 7 8 d e g 2 s 4 7 d e g 2 s and 4 68 d e g 2 s for the gyro on condition the area under the pitch response spectrums is also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer for the rotor parked case the area under the pitch spectrum is 3 3 d e g 2 3 7 d e g 2 3 8 d e g 2 4 5 d e g 2 5 3 d e g 2 and 5 7 d e g 2 for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 2 3 d e g 2 2 2 d e g 2 2 3 d e g 2 2 6 d e g 2 1 7 d e g 2 and 1 7 d e g 2 for gyro on condition overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 4 0 6 hz for all cases the sample time histories of nacelle fore aft acceleration during pitch dof with gyro off and on condition for turbine rotor at parked and operational case is shown in fig 19 b from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyro has significantly reduced the nacelle afore aft acceleration created by the pitch motion the maximum reduction is observed for the rotor at the parked condition fig 21 shows the nacelle fore aft displacement spectrum comparison with gyrostabilizer off and on condition for the turbine rotor at parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s with a significant wave height of 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the peak of the nacelle fore aft response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases the maximum nacelle fore aft response peak of 0 14 m 2 s for rotor at the parked case at tp 2 2 s with gyro off condition has been reduced to 4 5 10 2 m 2 s for the gyro on condition the highest response peak of 4 3 10 2 m 2 s at tp 2 2 s 2 6 10 2 m 2 s and 2 4 10 2 m 2 s at 2 1 s for below rated rated and above rated rpm respectively for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 1 6 10 2 m 2 s 1 4 10 2 m 2 s and 1 3 10 2 m 2 s for the gyro on condition the area under the nacelle fore aft response spectrums is also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer for the rotor parked case the area under the nacelle fore aft response spectrum of 7 6 10 3 m 2 1 0 10 2 m 2 1 1 10 2 m 2 1 4 10 2 m 2 1 7 10 2 m 2 and 1 5 10 2 m 2 for the gyro off condition has been reduced to 4 5 10 3 m 2 4 4 10 3 m 2 6 2 10 3 m 2 7 3 10 3 m 2 5 9 10 3 m 2 and 4 6 10 3 m 2 for gyro on condition overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 4 0 65 hz for all cases 7 3 2 fowt at 90 wave heading the sample time histories of roll response of fowt at the parked and operational case with gyro off and on condition for the irregular wave of hs 6 cm and tp 2 3 s is shown in fig 22 from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyrostabilizer is significant in reducing the roll in the region of highest response and the reduction is more for rotor at rated and above rated case in comparison with other cases this higher motion reduction is due to the higher precision motion of the gyro gimbal driven by the roll motion which are more at rated and above rated case fig 23 shows the roll response spectrums comparison of fowt with gyro off and on conditions for rotor at the parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s of significant wave height 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the roll response at the operational case is higher than the response at the parked case for gyro off condition this indicates that the disturbance in the rotation axis of the turbine rotor had increased the platform motion from the figure it is observed that the peak of roll response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases and the motion reductions are highest around the peak frequency and for most cases it is around the natural frequency of the fowt the maximum roll response peak of 64 6 d e g 2 s for above rated rpm at tp 2 3 s with gyro off condition has been reduced to 15 9 d e g 2 s the highest response peak of 42 7 d e g 2 s 52 71 d e g 2 s at 2 2 s and 51 7 d e g 2 s at 2 3 s for parked below rated and rated rpm has been reduced to 10 98 d e g 2 s 10 0 d e g 2 s and 14 7 d e g 2 s by gyro on condition the area under the roll response spectrums is also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer the area under the roll spectrum is 4 6 d e g 2 5 0 d e g 2 5 1 d e g 2 6 0 d e g 2 6 5 d e g 2 and 7 7 d e g 2 for gyro off condition at below rated rpm

with gyro on condition for all the cases of the turbine rotor overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 36 hz 0 66 hz for all cases the sample time histories of nacelle side to side acceleration during roll dof with gyro off and on condition for turbine rotor at parked and operational case is shown in fig 22 b from the figure it is observed that the performance of gyro has significantly reduced the nacelle side to side acceleration created by the roll motion the maximum reduction is observed for the rotor at rated condition in comparison with other cases as the roll response reduction of fowt at the rated operational condition is high compared to the other cases the nacelle side to side motion reduction is also high fig 24 shows the nacelle side to side displacement spectrum comparison with gyro off and on conditions for the turbine rotor at the parked and operational case for the range of peak periods tp 1 8 s 1 9 s 2 0 s 2 1 s 2 2 s and 2 3 s with a significant wave height of 6 cm from the figure it is observed that the peak of the nacelle side to side response spectrum is significantly reduced by the gyrostabilizer for all cases and the motion reductions are highest around the frequency where the peak of the spectrum lies the maximum nacelle response peak of 20 9 10 2 m 2 s is observed at tp 2 3 s for rotor at above rated rpm with gyro off condition has been reduced to 5 6 10 2 m 2 s the highest response peak of 14 6 10 2 m 2 s 13 9 10 2 m 2 s at 2 2 s and 20 8 10 2 m 2 s at 2 3 s for parked below rated and rated rpm during gyro off condition has been reduced to 3 4 10 2 m 2 s 4 2 10 2 m 2 s and 3 5 10 2 m 2 s for gyro on condition the area under the nacelle side to side response spectrums are also significantly reduced due to gyrostabilizer the maximum area under the nacelle side to side displacement spectrum for gyro off condition is 8 6 10 3 m 2 1 27 10 2 m 2 1 46 10 2 m 2 1 95 10 2 m 2 2 21 10 2 m 2 and 2 42 10 2 m 2 obtained at different operational condition has been reduced to 4 2 10 3 m 2 0 5 10 2 m 2 0 58 10 2 m 2 0 67 10 2 m 2 0 73 10 2 m 2 and 0 7 10 2 m 2 for gyro on condition overall significant reduction of motion is effected by the gyrostabilizer within the band of 0 39 hz 0 66 hz for all cases 7 3 3 comparison of reduction of statistics of response rsr to estimate the efficiency of gyrostabilizer for irregular wave conditions the rotational motion in irregular waves for the selected sea state is more appropriately evaluated using statistics of fowt response the percentage of reduction of statistics of response rsr is defined as perez 2005 33 r s r 100 1 h i s 1 3 h i u 1 3 where i φ θ a s s a f a and h i 1 3 denotes the double significant amplitude valueof responses obtained by the eq 27 and the superscripts u and s stands for gyro off unstabilized and gyro on stabilized table 6 shows the estimated platform and nacelle response reduction rate for irregular wave conditions from the table it is observed that the maximum reductions are observed near the frequencies wherein the wave spectral peaks are near to the natural periods of the roll pitch motions for roll motion maximum rsr of 44 for parked 46 for below rated 53 for rated and 49 are obtained by reducing the roll motion the nacelle side to side displacements response is reduced remarkably and the rsr are almost 50 for parked 43 for below rated 55 for rated and 46 for above rated conditions for pitch motion maximum rsr of 43 for parked 35 for below rated 23 for rated and 32 for above rated rotor angular velocity conditions by reducing the pitch motions the nacelle fore aft displacement response is reduced and the rsr are almost 45 for parked 39 for below rated 33 for rated and 25 for above rated conditions 7 3 4 precession angle fig 25 shows the measured precession angle time series comparisons between roll and pitch for the irregular wave height of 6 cm for the peak period of 2 3 s from the figure it is observed that the maximum precission angle attained by the gyrostabilizer gimbal to generate stabilizing torque for the corresponding platform roll is almost 20 for all fowt conditions whereas for pitch motion the precession angle is significantly less for operational conditions 8 summary and conclusion detailed experiments were carried out to investigate and evaluate the performance of a gyrostabilizer on a fowt on a model scale experiments were performed in regular and irregular waves to evaluate the efficiency of gyrostabilizer in motion reduction of fowt at parked shut down case and operational conditions to represent the fowt at the operational scenario different wind turbine rotor rotating conditions such as below rated power 60 rpm rated power 85 rpm above rated power 114 rpm were selected the platform rotations and nacelle accelerations during roll and pitch dof for gyrostabilizer off and on condition with gyro flywheel spin velocity of 5700 were measured and compared to evaluate the motion reduction rates based on the detailed experimental investigations following conclusions are drawn 8 1 roll an increase in platform motion of the fowt was observed during the turbine operational condition than at the parked condition due to extra loads created by the rotating turbine rotor for both regular and irregular waves the increase in motion varied between 5 6 and 12 3 for the cases undertaken in this study under regular waves the roll reduction by almost 64 for parked 57 for below rated 67 for rated and 64 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer reduction of roll motions resulted in the reduction of nacelle side to side acceleration and the reduction rates obtained were almost 58 for parked 40 for below rated 63 for rated and 53 for above rated conditions for irregular waves roll reduction by 44 for parked 46 for below rated 53 for rated and 49 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer reduction of roll motions resulted in the reduction of nacelle side to side acceleration and the reduction rates obtained were almost 50 for parked 43 for below rated 55 for rated and 46 for above rated conditions 8 2 pitch a decrease in platform pitch motion of the fowt was observed during the turbine operational condition than at the parked condition due to the gyroscopic effect created by the rotating turbine rotor for both regular and irregular waves the decrease in motion varied between 55 8 and 63 3 for the cases undertaken in this study under regular waves the pitch reduction by almost 54 for parked 39 for below rated 45 for rated and 39 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer by reducing the pitch motions the nacelle fore aft acceleration is also reduced significantly and the reduction rates are almost 69 for parked 46 for below rated 60 for rated and 40 for above rated conditions for irregular waves pitch reduction by 43 for parked 35 for below rated 23 for rated and 32 for above rated conditions were obtained using gyrostabilizer reduction of pitch motions resulted in reduction of nacelle fore aft acceleration and the reduction rates obtained are almost 45 for parked 39 for below rated 33 for rated and 25 for above rated condition the reduction in motion showed by the experiments can be achieved in the prototype by the proper design of a gyroscopic stabilizer this work is limited in exploring the performance of the gyrostabilizer in mitigating the fowt motions at dynamic conditions including the gyroscopic effect at the prototype level it is very difficult and challenging to model a device with a large rotational mass and required levels of force to actuate the gimbal to generate a stabilizing moment by placing more than one gyrostabilizer inline or by having a gyrostabilizer with more than one flywheel stabilizing moment are the options that can be investigated for applications credit authorship

20306,the paper presents the rescue systems of submarines used worldwide the idea of rescue seats was explained and described the seat s load caused by the pressure of hydrostatic pressure the thrust of the rescue vehicle and the sea current was defined in accordance with the requirements of stanag 1297 according to the standard an analysis of the stress state of a kobben class submarine rescue seat loaded with the pressure of an emergency vehicle was carried out the sea current and hydrostatic pressure at a depth of 700 m were taken into account non linearities related to the description of the material and large deformations were used johnson cook characteristics for hy 80 steel are described the stress state results in a kobben class submarine rescue seat obtained based on fem simulations for a submersion depth of 700 m are presented the results are shown in two variants variant i following the standard variant ii author s proposal then differences were demonstrated and additional recommendations were proposed keywords submarine finite element analysis rescue operations military applications 1 introduction it is assumed that the development of submarines was initiated by david bushnell who in 1776 was the first man to use his own made submarine called turtle for military operations jackson and palasek 2001 the fact is that counter offensive measures must be developed in parallel with the development of offensive technologies initially the combat value of submarines was underestimated and neglected by the military as a result the successful detection of the submarine using technical equipment took place in 1916 140 years after its invention during wwi underwater microphones called hydrophones bai et al 2019 began to be used to detect german submarines the first submarine located by using a hydrophone was the german uc 3 which was sunk on april 23 1916 she also became the first victim of depth charges perepeczko 2000 a field of technology that was overlooked was also the rescue of sunken submarines apart from operational activities the leading causes of failure and sinking of submarines were collisions with other ships or wrecks fires explosions and crew errors a damaged submarine due to its construction often multi compartment remains wholly or partially sealed and settles to the bottom its crew can survive several days until the air supply is exhausted unfortunately for decades in emergencies the crews of damaged ships were on their own and their ship became an iron coffin for them between 1925 and 1927 the us navy lost two submarines uss s 51 and uss s 4 with 73 seamen drowned both ships were rammed the crew of the uss s 4 survived a collision after which the ship sank to the bottom at a depth of 33 m the diving team that went to the bottom managed to contact the crew of the torpedo compartment but at that time it was not possible to carry out a quick rescue operation that would allow the ship to be lifted from the bottom as a result of the cold and lack of oxygen 40 sailors died polmar 1981 this catastrophe was a turning point in the history of the sea rescue of sunken submarine s crews efforts have been made which have resulted in innovations in rescue systems and procedures for carrying out rescue operations and evacuating crew members nato submarine crew rescue procedures are described mainly in two publications atp 10 and atp 57 allied tactical publication atp 57 b 2015 nato 1995 these documents present among other security procedures such as next of kin list the crew list containing details of crew members and their families in the event of a tragedy updated before departure from port subnote plan of the submarine route moving haven the area in which the submarine should be located when sailing at sea diving signal radio signal containing the time and place of the dive and the time and place of ascent besides the operating submarine is subject to the communication and rescue procedures outlined below subcheck signal with a submarine with an interval of 36 h usually 24 h comcheck a signal from the command when there is a suspicion that the ship is in danger or that the report from the ship has not been received within the specified time the so called zero time sublook signal from the command about searching for a submarine zero 1 h submiss signal from the command about the disappearance of the submarine zero 3 h for a single compartment ship zero 6 h for a multi compartment ship subsunk signal from the command after making sure that the submarine has sunk the presented procedures show that in the worst case the start of a rescue operation may start 37 h after the crash which in the case of smaller submarines may constitute even 15 of the maximum waiting time for rescue jackson and palasek 2001 polmar 1981 kiciński and szturomski 2019 gołąbek and sobociński 2003 the most recent example of such a catastrophe is the submarine of the argentine navy san juan which sank on november 15 2017 the ship was found a year after the tragedy at a depth of about 800 m the official causes of the crash are unknown attention is also drawn to the fact that the search and rescue operation was carried out until november 30 2017 from that date only search activities were carried out not counting on finding alive crew members the determination of the argentinian authorities is also admirable they continued the search action until the end involving navy s strength and the external company ocean infinity which found the ship after 71 days of seeking argentina submarine 2018 tragic disasters and the sinking of submarines caused the development of techniques to leave the sunken ship began among the rescue techniques of submarine crews the so called wet and dry methods are known the world navies developed them independently and over time they turned into complex rescue systems generally speaking the wet method makes it possible to leave the submarine only through direct contact of the crew with a dangerous and hostile marine environment low temperature and pressure at a given depth it requires the ship to be equipped with evacuation locks and special breathing suits or escape suits the exit to the surface with techniques using breathing apparatus takes place along the so called life lines some suits use the phenomenon of air expansion as a result of reducing the pressure of the surrounding water and the buoyancy force the free flow method the modern seie submarine escape immersion equipment suits are inflatable suits that bring crew members to the surface kiciński and szturomski 2019 gołąbek and sobociński 2003 o donnell and horn 2014 seiemk11 1549 the tragedies of uss s 51 and uss s 4 table 1 ironically contributed to the idea of a system to rescue the crew of a sunken ship through a rescue hatch using modernized diving bells the first rescue chambers were developed by allan mccann in 1929 fig 1 sewell et al 2010 the mccann chamber is a cylindrical steel tank divided into two chambers one for the crew and the other for a lock the rescue chambers can only retrieve a few people from the damaged unit at a time when lowered from a rescue ship they have limited manoeuvrability and a limited depth of approx 100 m depending on sea and weather conditions the idea behind the system is that it is possible to guide mccann s chamber and place it where the hull is flat so that the emergency hatch can open inside the chamber the system was called src submarine rescue chamber the chamber ends with a flat surface with a seal after draining the space between the hatches the chamber is sucked into the ship s hull due to loading the wetted surface of the chamber with hydrostatic pressure at a given depth then after equalizing the pressure between the ship and the chamber the crew goes to the rescue chamber without contact with the hostile environment kiciński and szturomski 2019 the first such operation using the src was carried out in 1939 on the uss squalus ss 192 polmar 1981 although they changed the image of the evacuation of the crew of the sunken ship mccann s rescue chambers increasing their safety similarly to the classic diving bells have some disadvantages firstly the greatest of them is the need to precisely position the rescue ship with the rescue hatch of the sunken ship and the chamber guidance system on the hatch is needed secondly the rescue operation depends on the state of the sea and usually divers are required to be protected when using the mccann chamber the era of the src rescue bells is passing but it has changed the submarines design on decks of which there are rescue seats with emergency hatches capable of carrying the loads caused by the pressure of the bell during connection with the ship the ships were also equipped with systems for guiding the rescue chamber to the escape hatch consisting of a buoy and a rope hooked in its centre the tragedy of uss thresher in 1963 bentley 1975 became an inspiration to replace mccann s rescue bells with a mobile system in the form of an underwater rescue vehicle called dsrv deep submergence rescue vehicle these vehicles are capable of reaching a sunken ship on its own landing on its rescue seat and creating a tight connection in line with this idea in 1970 a new rescue unit dsrv 1 mystic was put into service in the usa a twin unit the dsrv 2 avalon was also built compared to src systems mobile dsrv has plenty of advantages equipped with its electric propulsion batteries sonar navigation systems and communication operated by two pilots it can independently reach the sunken ship and evacuate its crew at one time the dsrv could take 24 survivors these units can perform rescue tasks up to a depth of 650 m the mobility of this system is an undeniable advantage dsrv can be transported by sea air and land watts 1998 the dsrv 1 mystic and the dsrv 2 avalon have already ended their service but these systems concept is continued and developed the withdrawn mccann src and dsrv chambers imposed specific standards on their successors one of the standards is the docking ring seal dimension which must be between 1380 and 1500 mm this dimension was imposed by dsrv rescue vehicles and is currently 1432 mm in the united states the used dsrv 1 and dsrv 2 in 2006 were replaced by the prm pressurized rescue module falcon it is a part of the srdrs submarine rescue diving and recompression system system including a decompression chamber located on the rescue ship prm can operate at depths of up to 600 m and takes 16 survivors at a time the docking collar s innovative solutions allow the prm to land on ships tilted or trimmed to an angle of 45 srdrs a similar docking collar has the australian asrv system remora 1 1 the vehicle name is an acronym really excellent method of rescuing aussies can operate at depths of up to 500 m the construction of rescue vehicles included in the rescue systems was also undertaken in other countries such as great britain france norway sweden italy japan korea singapore and the russian federation davison and allibone 2005 the rescue systems include rescue vehicles of the srv type or mccann src chambers and various other underwater vehicles of the rov type remotely operated vehicle these are unmanned underwater units equipped with cameras sonars and other devices used for underwater reconnaissance and search for a damaged ship submarine crew rescue systems also include deep water diving teams according to atp atp 57 b 2015 all countries with submarines must have any rescue systems they have declared themselves to cooperate in assisting the crews of sunken ships and exchange experiences technologies and information in this regard after the tragedy of kursk k 141 in 2003 anette mikes and migdal 2014 the international submarine escape and rescue liaison office ismerlo http www ismerlo org was established the ismerlo office is located in norfolk virginia usa which employs a team of experts worldwide mainly dealing with the coordination of rescue operations on the bureau s website information about the rescue systems of different countries and the possibilities of using them can be found this page is also used to summon help for missing submarines until 2019 there were four kobben class project 207 submarines in operational use by the polish navy these were s 306 skolpen orp sep s 308 stord orp sokol s 309 swenner orp bielik and s 319 kunna orp kondor fig 2 the fifth submarine s 318 kobben orp jastrzab is used as a crew training simulator at the polish naval academy they are the last ships of this series worldwide the oldest in operational use 15 such units were built in 1964 67 at the german shipyard rheinstahl nordseewerke as a modification of the 205 project submarines for norway s navy five of them were transferred to the polish navy in 2002 2003 okrętypodwodnetypukobben 2020 these ships end their service in the polish navy orp kondor was decommissioned first in december 2017 due to the decommissioning their tactical data can be declassified and therefore their documentation can be used for scientific purposes this submarine is adapted to operate in all regions of the world after previous ballast with the possibility of using the weapon in any conditions the primary technical data of the kobben class submarines gołąbek and sobociński 2003 okrętypodwodnetypukobben 2020 szturomski and kiciński 2015 total length 47 24 m height 8 88 m bow draft 3 9 m stern

crew 26 people based on the technical data for kobben class submarines a rescue seat strength analysis was carried out for this type of ship in two variants following the standard variant 1 and a new proposal given by the authors variant 2 according to the standards atp 57 b 2015 dod international 2013 dod 2001 underwater technology 2018 underwater technology 2018 dnvgl 2018 ships 2019 a rescue submarine was adopted as the fundamental assistance to a damaged submarine crew in an emergency the vehicle docks into a sunken submarine on a rescue seat with an evacuation hatch taking the crew without contact with the deep sea environment the adopted evacuation model requires the use of rescue seat structures for each of the submarines being built dimensions of submarine rescue seats and docking devices of newly emerging rescue systems are modelled and adapted to the design of the first american dsrv deep submergence rescue vehicle submarines have been equipped with rescue seats with evacuation hatch for several dozen years fig 3 which when the submarine is sunk to the bottom and cannot be ascended allow the crew to leave the ship using the so called dry method in this case the rescue vehicle fig 4 connects to the seat s surface with a flange fitted with a rubber seal then the water from the inner space connecting the submarine with the rescue vehicle is drained which results in the pressure drop in relation to the surrounding environment and the mutual suction of both vehicles the surrounding water s pressure presses the hull of the rescue vehicle to the seat structure that is the load in which the seat s frame has to transfer to the ship s hull at a given depth of immersion deformation of the rescue seat must ensure the constant tightness of the connection during the operation of submarines due to forces acting on the ship corrosion sandblasting painting wear aging processes etc the geometry of the ship s hull and the rescue seat is changing the thicknesses of the connecting elements are decreasing for this reason every two years certification of emergency seals should be made atp 57 b 2015 dod international 2013 dod 2001 north atlantic treaty organisation 2012 the detailed requirements result from the content of stanag 1297 which very precisely defines the dimensions of the main components of the construction of the rescue seat according to stanag 1297 the seat s strength has to ensure safe docking of rescue vehicles structurally similar to dsrv at a depth of up to 700 m compliance with these requirements is affiliated with a certificate issued by navsea dod inspection of rescue seats is carried out on newly certified submarines and after the expiry of the previous certificate or after the occurrence of factors that may change the technical condition of the seat such as repair and maintenance work inspection of a submarine rescue seat includes visual inspection of the state of the structure of the seat pitting cavities deformation visual inspection of the continuity of welds visual inspection of the protective paint measurement of the thickness of the seat ring measurement of the roughness of the outer surface of the seat ring measurement of the thickness of the base of the seat measurement of the outer and inner diameter of the seat measurement of the free space around the seat measurement of the flatness of the seat ring the next inspection stage is to make strength calculations to check the maximum depth that allows safe docking of the rescue vehicle according to stanag 1297 strength analysis using the finite element method fem is preferred it will determine the state of stresses and deformations of the seat caused by loads due to the docking vehicle s pressure on the ring rescue seat s ring these calculations include docking depth sea currents ship s heel angle and other factors depending on the seat design the obtained extreme values results are compared with the permissible values for the seat elements material the results of strength calculations for a given rescue seat should be presented in a report showing the entire course of the task including the following elements input data seat documentation with dimensions technical drawings photographs auxiliary sketches measurements carried out on the ship names of cad computer aided design and cae computer aided engineering programs geometry of the rescue seat with a fragment of the ship s hull made in the cad program description of geometric simplifications discretization of the seating area containing the number and type of finite elements used verification of the correctness of geometry material data including the name of the steel young s modulus poisson s ratio yield strength strength limit boundary conditions variants of seat loads results presented in graphical and tabular form of the required parameters including extreme values conclusions according to these documents calculations are made only for the seat structure itself artificially cut off from the hull it is a simplification that generates significantly higher values of torsional stresses and deformations the seat is supported by the hull which deforms together with the seat and takes over part of the load modelling the seat and the entire ship s hull and bottom with the plastic material model seems more rational and is the primary assumption of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 rescue seat area loads following navsea ss700 aa ins 010 international 2013 the rescue vehicle applies a hydrostatic load onto the rescue seat when the transfer skirt seals with the rescue seat and dewaters this load s magnitude is equal to the hydrostatic pressure at rescue depth acting on the 2500 in2 16 129 cm2 area within the seal of the transfer skirt radius of 28 23 inches or 71 70 cm the magnitude of this load is dependent on the rescue depth which may be the full rescue depth of the rescue vehicle e g prm 2000 feet or 609 m or the collapse depth of the submarine this load is applied to the top surface of the rescue seat by the collar s connecting surface an inner radius of 26 50 inches or 67 31 cm and an outer radius of 30 50 inches or 77 47 cm the seat s surface is loaded with the pressure exerted by the surface and the place of contact with the rescue vehicle during connection at depths of 100 m 700 m concerning sea currents fig 5 connecting a rescue vehicle sealing and water draining results in hydrostatic pressure load on the seat construction this load acts on a surface limited by the rescue vehicle collar s outer diameter which is d z 1 545 m fig 6 therefore the surface area of connection is equal to a π d z 2 4 3 14159 1 545 2 4 1 87476 m 2 concentrated equivalent force at seat area construction is equal to 1 f γ h a where γ water specific gravity n m3 h depth of immersion m this force breaks down on the contact surface between the rescue vehicle collar and seat area which is a k π d z 2 d w 2 4 3 14159 1 545 2 1 346 2 4 0 4518566 m 2 so the load pressure on this surface is equal 2 p c f a k or p c a a k γ h 4 149107 γ h sea current was assumed as a linear variable pressure p l equal to 2 mpa effect of sea current is described by shape function 3 ϕ 1 x 1 x l ϕ 2 x x l then pressure p l is equal to 4 p l p 1 ϕ 1 x p 2 ϕ 2 x where p 1 2 mpa p 2 2 mpa if the zero of the coordinate system is in the middle of the seat area contact surface fig 7 a load of contact surface for mentioned dimensions and immersion depth including sea current flow along axis x is given by the equation 5 p p c p l 29 7 h 4 x 1 545 m p a where x local coordinate measured from the centre of the manhole x ε 1 545 2 1 545 2 2 2 material data the standard international 2013 does not specify how to model the material during calculations it only presents the requirements for submitting material data as an attachment to the seat certificate the material can be modelled using perfectly elastic variant 1 in this paper ideally plastic or models with plastic hardening variant 2 in this paper a material curve obtained from a testing machine can also be used however in cae programs such a curve may increase the computation time due to extrapolation between the curve points this problem can be avoided by using material models such material can be described by johnson cook polynomial in the form abaqus 6 14 2014 szturomski 2013 kohnke 1999 johnson and cook 2009 6 σ a b ε n 1 c l n ε ε 0 1 t t 0 t m t 0 m where σ stress a material constant b strengthening parameter ε plastic strain n exponent of strengthening c material constant referred to strain rate ε strain rate ε 0 is the effective plastic strain rate of the quasi static test t ambient temperature t 0 reference temperature t m melting temperature m softening exponent under the influence of temperature the seat structure should be made of high quality steel such as the structure of a strong hull stainless steels resistant to the marine environment with a yield point r e greater than 550 mpa is recommended due to the pressure occurring at great depths submarine structures must be durable therefore high strength heat treated steel with high coal equivalent is used for shipbuilding typical steel used in the construction of submarines is hy 80 hy 100 hrs 650m to the calculation the data for hy 80 steel which is suggested by navsea ss700 aa ins 010 instruction as a high quality steel used for special marine structures was used typical chemical composition of hy 80 steel is 0 18 c 0 3 mn 1 6 cr 3 ni 0 5 mo lincoln electric therefore the hy 80 johnson cook plastic steel model with the following properties was taken to the calculations holmquist 1987 density ρ 7746 kg m3 poisson s ratio ν 0 3 young s modulus e 2 07 105 mpa yield point r e 672 mpa ultimate strength r m 861 mpa material constant a 700 material constant b 425 material constant n 0 35 material constant c m 0 as can be seen from the presented material constants the temperature component m and strain rate dependency component c of the johnson cook model were not considered for further calculations due to its negligible influence during this analysis due to the high coal equivalent the welding process is also more complicated various methods can do welding of hy 80 hy 100 and hrs 650 m steels welding processes and welding materials are presented in table 2 2 3 the geometry of the rescue seat area discretization and boundary conditions stanag 1297 proposes examples of calculations made for the rescue seat s simplified geometry fig 8 due to the multitude of structural solutions of the hulls part of the surrounding hull should also be modelled in the case considered in this article the hull and part of the external environment sand is given when analyzing the seat certification reports szturomski et al 2013 patriciosepúlvedaaraos certificación it can be seen that they are made following the standard but the results and methodology are different this article presents the impact of hull geometry modelling on the stress results according to stanag 1297 this data are necessary for certification of submarines rescue seats for this purpose based on prepared drafts drawings and pictures of all seat area parts the rescue seat s geometry in the cad program was created fig 9 then two variants of the hull model were prepared variant 1 according to standards part of the strong hull variant 2 authors proposition whole hull with the bottom in the first variant part of the hull seat area s solid geometry was discretized into 223504 linear shell elements 224300 nodes fig 10 what constitutes a task with 1 345 800 degrees of freedom in the areas where the seat ring connects to the rescue vehicle the finite element mesh size was 5 mm while outside the ring of the seat the mesh was thinned to 100 mm analyzed sections of the strong hull with seat area construction were tied along the hull s cut edge taking away to all laying their nodes possibility of movement in the normal direction to the cut plane and rotation in other direction fig 11 in the second variant of calculations based on the technical documentation gołąbek and sobociński 2003 the entire ship s hull s geometry was created the hull was tied by boundary conditions on a springy sand bottom fig 12 in which the hull dipped into 10 cm the contact interaction with the coefficient of friction μ 0 2 between the hull and the sand was defined joseph 1996 the hull s solid geometry was discretized into 1224607 linear shell elements 1213302 nodes which constitutes a task with 7279812 degrees of freedom 3 calculations 3 1 strength analysis of rescue seat area strength calculations of rescue seat area were conducted by licensed cae software according to navsea ss700 aa ins 010 requirements seat area deformation caused by the pressure of connected rescue vehicle is determined by solving the finite element equation 7 k ε p l u f p c h p l v γ h where k ε p l stiffness matrix takes into account the structure of the plastic material model ε p l vector of plastic strain u displacement vector f load vector p c h emphasis of the docking vehicle ring depends on the depth of immersion p l v emphasis of the docking vehicle ring depends on the sea current speed γ water specific gravity n m3 h the depth of immersion m v the speed of the sea current in the second variant of calculations the equation in a given form was solved 8 k ε p l u f p c h p l v γ h c μ where c μ contact forces associated with the coefficient of friction given equations are strongly non linear due to the material s plastic characteristics the standard proposes linear elastic characteristics shape matrices and deformations of the whole structure besides the whole and part of the hull s elasticity significantly impact the calculation results the non linearity of the considered equations requires step by step integration dynamic explicit which substantially complicates fem calculations 4 results and conclusions the results of the stress state of the reduced hmh huber misses hencky occurring in the construction of the seat and hull from the pressure of the rescue vehicle at a depth of 700 m for both variants are presented if the results are compared differences between the load on the part and the whole hull can be seen for part of the hull the stress value reaches 5146 mpa fig 13 while for the whole the stress value reaches 821 mpa fig 14 such high stress values indicate that the structure is stiffened by certification based on the current standards the influence of the entire hull s elasticity and the bottom on which the ship rests is ignored using methodology from standard the hull and bottom elasticity impact on the seat is omitted however the analysis carried out in this way generates a higher stress value which is a safe parameter for the user but inconsistent with reality simulation of the entire hull requires a larger calculation task however it generates more plausible calculation results in this case errors resulting from the fem contact issue should be considered sładkowski 2005 in an emergency the submarine is usually located on the bottom which interacts with the ship s structure analyzing the literature teoriaokrętówpodwodnych 1965 kierowanie 1965 and using the author s experience it was found that to keep the boat at the bottom additional ballast about 1 2 displacement should be taken inside the ship which creates additional contact force between the bottom and the ship s hull which is not taken into account in standards for variant 1 which was developed to investigate a problem consisting of only parts of a strong hull according to the standard shell elements were used to simulate all features included in the model standards allow the use of shell elements but for those seat elements on which the load is applied solid elements must be applied to obtain the stress component perpendicular to the surface besides the seat is thick enough to consider the use of solid features instead of shell members the behaviour of the steel material is a certain inconsistency in the presented study in no case should the stresses exceed the strength limit of hy80 steel if this event occurred then the damage model should be applied to determine that the corresponding point in the model is broken so that point or feature should be deleted the fem model corresponding to a part of the hull can be improved using solid elements or submodels the steel material model does not function correctly without considering the damage criterion the comprehensive analysis also requires consideration of welds and haz to obtain stress concentration locations in the results for both variants there is a discrepancy of one order of magnitude for a part of the hull variant 1 the hmh stress reaches 5146 mpa and for the whole hull variant 2 821 mpa such high values in variant 1 result from simplification which ignores the impact of elasticity of the part of the hull that has been cut off and the elastic bottom on which the ship is sunk what is more the standards do not include strains analyzing fig 15 it can be seen that in the model from variant 1 the maximum deformations are smaller than in variant 2 that leads to the conclusion that such calculations should also consider failure criteria that can cause discontinuities in the structure it is also worth noting that the maximum depth for this type of ship is 225 m and the calculations according to the standard are performed for a depth of 700 m taking these considerations into account high stress values in the seating area should be expected to summarizing the guidelines for performing strength simulations of rescue seats may be incorrectly formulated and give excessive results funding this paper was supported by the polish naval academy in the year 2021 credit authorship contribution statement radosław

20306,the paper presents the rescue systems of submarines used worldwide the idea of rescue seats was explained and described the seat s load caused by the pressure of hydrostatic pressure the thrust of the rescue vehicle and the sea current was defined in accordance with the requirements of stanag 1297 according to the standard an analysis of the stress state of a kobben class submarine rescue seat loaded with the pressure of an emergency vehicle was carried out the sea current and hydrostatic pressure at a depth of 700 m were taken into account non linearities related to the description of the material and large deformations were used johnson cook characteristics for hy 80 steel are described the stress state results in a kobben class submarine rescue seat obtained based on fem simulations for a submersion depth of 700 m are presented the results are shown in two variants variant i following the standard variant ii author s proposal then differences were demonstrated and additional recommendations were proposed keywords submarine finite element analysis rescue operations military applications 1 introduction it is assumed that the development of submarines was initiated by david bushnell who in 1776 was the first man to use his own made submarine called turtle for military operations jackson and palasek 2001 the fact is that counter offensive measures must be developed in parallel with the development of offensive technologies initially the combat value of submarines was underestimated and neglected by the military as a result the successful detection of the submarine using technical equipment took place in 1916 140 years after its invention during wwi underwater microphones called hydrophones bai et al 2019 began to be used to detect german submarines the first submarine located by using a hydrophone was the german uc 3 which was sunk on april 23 1916 she also became the first victim of depth charges perepeczko 2000 a field of technology that was overlooked was also the rescue of sunken submarines apart from operational activities the leading causes of failure and sinking of submarines were collisions with other ships or wrecks fires explosions and crew errors a damaged submarine due to its construction often multi compartment remains wholly or partially sealed and settles to the bottom its crew can survive several days until the air supply is exhausted unfortunately for decades in emergencies the crews of damaged ships were on their own and their ship became an iron coffin for them between 1925 and 1927 the us navy lost two submarines uss s 51 and uss s 4 with 73 seamen drowned both ships were rammed the crew of the uss s 4 survived a collision after which the ship sank to the bottom at a depth of 33 m the diving team that went to the bottom managed to contact the crew of the torpedo compartment but at that time it was not possible to carry out a quick rescue operation that would allow the ship to be lifted from the bottom as a result of the cold and lack of oxygen 40 sailors died polmar 1981 this catastrophe was a turning point in the history of the sea rescue of sunken submarine s crews efforts have been made which have resulted in innovations in rescue systems and procedures for carrying out rescue operations and evacuating crew members nato submarine crew rescue procedures are described mainly in two publications atp 10 and atp 57 allied tactical publication atp 57 b 2015 nato 1995 these documents present among other security procedures such as next of kin list the crew list containing details of crew members and their families in the event of a tragedy updated before departure from port subnote plan of the submarine route moving haven the area in which the submarine should be located when sailing at sea diving signal radio signal containing the time and place of the dive and the time and place of ascent besides the operating submarine is subject to the communication and rescue procedures outlined below subcheck signal with a submarine with an interval of 36 h usually 24 h comcheck a signal from the command when there is a suspicion that the ship is in danger or that the report from the ship has not been received within the specified time the so called zero time sublook signal from the command about searching for a submarine zero 1 h submiss signal from the command about the disappearance of the submarine zero 3 h for a single compartment ship zero 6 h for a multi compartment ship subsunk signal from the command after making sure that the submarine has sunk the presented procedures show that in the worst case the start of a rescue operation may start 37 h after the crash which in the case of smaller submarines may constitute even 15 of the maximum waiting time for rescue jackson and palasek 2001 polmar 1981 kiciński and szturomski 2019 gołąbek and sobociński 2003 the most recent example of such a catastrophe is the submarine of the argentine navy san juan which sank on november 15 2017 the ship was found a year after the tragedy at a depth of about 800 m the official causes of the crash are unknown attention is also drawn to the fact that the search and rescue operation was carried out until november 30 2017 from that date only search activities were carried out not counting on finding alive crew members the determination of the argentinian authorities is also admirable they continued the search action until the end involving navy s strength and the external company ocean infinity which found the ship after 71 days of seeking argentina submarine 2018 tragic disasters and the sinking of submarines caused the development of techniques to leave the sunken ship began among the rescue techniques of submarine crews the so called wet and dry methods are known the world navies developed them independently and over time they turned into complex rescue systems generally speaking the wet method makes it possible to leave the submarine only through direct contact of the crew with a dangerous and hostile marine environment low temperature and pressure at a given depth it requires the ship to be equipped with evacuation locks and special breathing suits or escape suits the exit to the surface with techniques using breathing apparatus takes place along the so called life lines some suits use the phenomenon of air expansion as a result of reducing the pressure of the surrounding water and the buoyancy force the free flow method the modern seie submarine escape immersion equipment suits are inflatable suits that bring crew members to the surface kiciński and szturomski 2019 gołąbek and sobociński 2003 o donnell and horn 2014 seiemk11 1549 the tragedies of uss s 51 and uss s 4 table 1 ironically contributed to the idea of a system to rescue the crew of a sunken ship through a rescue hatch using modernized diving bells the first rescue chambers were developed by allan mccann in 1929 fig 1 sewell et al 2010 the mccann chamber is a cylindrical steel tank divided into two chambers one for the crew and the other for a lock the rescue chambers can only retrieve a few people from the damaged unit at a time when lowered from a rescue ship they have limited manoeuvrability and a limited depth of approx 100 m depending on sea and weather conditions the idea behind the system is that it is possible to guide mccann s chamber and place it where the hull is flat so that the emergency hatch can open inside the chamber the system was called src submarine rescue chamber the chamber ends with a flat surface with a seal after draining the space between the hatches the chamber is sucked into the ship s hull due to loading the wetted surface of the chamber with hydrostatic pressure at a given depth then after equalizing the pressure between the ship and the chamber the crew goes to the rescue chamber without contact with the hostile environment kiciński and szturomski 2019 the first such operation using the src was carried out in 1939 on the uss squalus ss 192 polmar 1981 although they changed the image of the evacuation of the crew of the sunken ship mccann s rescue chambers increasing their safety similarly to the classic diving bells have some disadvantages firstly the greatest of them is the need to precisely position the rescue ship with the rescue hatch of the sunken ship and the chamber guidance system on the hatch is needed secondly the rescue operation depends on the state of the sea and usually divers are required to be protected when using the mccann chamber the era of the src rescue bells is passing but it has changed the submarines design on decks of which there are rescue seats with emergency hatches capable of carrying the loads caused by the pressure of the bell during connection with the ship the ships were also equipped with systems for guiding the rescue chamber to the escape hatch consisting of a buoy and a rope hooked in its centre the tragedy of uss thresher in 1963 bentley 1975 became an inspiration to replace mccann s rescue bells with a mobile system in the form of an underwater rescue vehicle called dsrv deep submergence rescue vehicle these vehicles are capable of reaching a sunken ship on its own landing on its rescue seat and creating a tight connection in line with this idea in 1970 a new rescue unit dsrv 1 mystic was put into service in the usa a twin unit the dsrv 2 avalon was also built compared to src systems mobile dsrv has plenty of advantages equipped with its electric propulsion batteries sonar navigation systems and communication operated by two pilots it can independently reach the sunken ship and evacuate its crew at one time the dsrv could take 24 survivors these units can perform rescue tasks up to a depth of 650 m the mobility of this system is an undeniable advantage dsrv can be transported by sea air and land watts 1998 the dsrv 1 mystic and the dsrv 2 avalon have already ended their service but these systems concept is continued and developed the withdrawn mccann src and dsrv chambers imposed specific standards on their successors one of the standards is the docking ring seal dimension which must be between 1380 and 1500 mm this dimension was imposed by dsrv rescue vehicles and is currently 1432 mm in the united states the used dsrv 1 and dsrv 2 in 2006 were replaced by the prm pressurized rescue module falcon it is a part of the srdrs submarine rescue diving and recompression system system including a decompression chamber located on the rescue ship prm can operate at depths of up to 600 m and takes 16 survivors at a time the docking collar s innovative solutions allow the prm to land on ships tilted or trimmed to an angle of 45 srdrs a similar docking collar has the australian asrv system remora 1 1 the vehicle name is an acronym really excellent method of rescuing aussies can operate at depths of up to 500 m the construction of rescue vehicles included in the rescue systems was also undertaken in other countries such as great britain france norway sweden italy japan korea singapore and the russian federation davison and allibone 2005 the rescue systems include rescue vehicles of the srv type or mccann src chambers and various other underwater vehicles of the rov type remotely operated vehicle these are unmanned underwater units equipped with cameras sonars and other devices used for underwater reconnaissance and search for a damaged ship submarine crew rescue systems also include deep water diving teams according to atp atp 57 b 2015 all countries with submarines must have any rescue systems they have declared themselves to cooperate in assisting the crews of sunken ships and exchange experiences technologies and information in this regard after the tragedy of kursk k 141 in 2003 anette mikes and migdal 2014 the international submarine escape and rescue liaison office ismerlo http www ismerlo org was established the ismerlo office is located in norfolk virginia usa which employs a team of experts worldwide mainly dealing with the coordination of rescue operations on the bureau s website information about the rescue systems of different countries and the possibilities of using them can be found this page is also used to summon help for missing submarines until 2019 there were four kobben class project 207 submarines in operational use by the polish navy these were s 306 skolpen orp sep s 308 stord orp sokol s 309 swenner orp bielik and s 319 kunna orp kondor fig 2 the fifth submarine s 318 kobben orp jastrzab is used as a crew training simulator at the polish naval academy they are the last ships of this series worldwide the oldest in operational use 15 such units were built in 1964 67 at the german shipyard rheinstahl nordseewerke as a modification of the 205 project submarines for norway s navy five of them were transferred to the polish navy in 2002 2003 okrętypodwodnetypukobben 2020 these ships end their service in the polish navy orp kondor was decommissioned first in december 2017 due to the decommissioning their tactical data can be declassified and therefore their

crew 26 people based on the technical data for kobben class submarines a rescue seat strength analysis was carried out for this type of ship in two variants following the standard variant 1 and a new proposal given by the authors variant 2 according to the standards atp 57 b 2015 dod international 2013 dod 2001 underwater technology 2018 underwater technology 2018 dnvgl 2018 ships 2019 a rescue submarine was adopted as the fundamental assistance to a damaged submarine crew in an emergency the vehicle docks into a sunken submarine on a rescue seat with an evacuation hatch taking the crew without contact with the deep sea environment the adopted evacuation model requires the use of rescue seat structures for each of the submarines being built dimensions of submarine rescue seats and docking devices of newly emerging rescue systems are modelled and adapted to the design of the first american dsrv deep submergence rescue vehicle submarines have been equipped with rescue seats with evacuation hatch for several dozen years fig 3 which when the submarine is sunk to the bottom and cannot be ascended allow the crew to leave the ship using the so called dry method in this case the rescue vehicle fig 4 connects to the seat s surface with a flange fitted with a rubber seal then the water from the inner space connecting the submarine with the rescue vehicle is drained which results in the pressure drop in relation to the surrounding environment and the mutual suction of both vehicles the surrounding water s pressure presses the hull of the rescue vehicle to the seat structure that is the load in which the seat s frame has to transfer to the ship s hull at a given depth of immersion deformation of the rescue seat must ensure the constant tightness of the connection during the operation of submarines due to forces acting on the ship corrosion sandblasting painting wear aging processes etc the geometry of the ship s hull and the rescue seat is changing the thicknesses of the connecting elements are decreasing for this reason every two years certification of emergency seals should be made atp 57 b 2015 dod international 2013 dod 2001 north atlantic treaty organisation 2012 the detailed requirements result from the content of stanag 1297 which very precisely defines the dimensions of the main components of the construction of the rescue seat according to stanag 1297 the seat s strength has to ensure safe docking of rescue vehicles structurally similar to dsrv at a depth of up to 700 m compliance with these requirements is affiliated with a certificate issued by navsea dod inspection of rescue seats is carried out on newly certified submarines and after the expiry of the previous certificate or after the occurrence of factors that may change the technical condition of the seat such as repair and maintenance work inspection of a submarine rescue seat includes visual inspection of the state of the structure of the seat pitting cavities deformation visual inspection of the continuity of welds visual inspection of the protective paint measurement of the thickness of the seat ring measurement of the roughness of the outer surface of the seat ring measurement of the thickness of the base of the seat measurement of the outer and inner diameter of the seat measurement of the free space around the seat measurement of the flatness of the seat ring the next inspection stage is to make strength calculations to check the maximum depth that allows safe docking of the rescue vehicle according to stanag 1297 strength analysis using the finite element method fem is preferred it will determine the state of stresses and deformations of the seat caused by loads due to the docking vehicle s pressure on the ring rescue seat s ring these calculations include docking depth sea currents ship s heel angle and other factors depending on the seat design the obtained extreme values results are compared with the permissible values for the seat elements material the results of strength calculations for a given rescue seat should be presented in a report showing the entire course of the task including the following elements input data seat documentation with dimensions technical drawings photographs auxiliary sketches measurements carried out on the ship names of cad computer aided design and cae computer aided engineering programs geometry of the rescue seat with a fragment of the ship s hull made in the cad program description of geometric simplifications discretization of the seating area containing the number and type of finite elements used verification of the correctness of geometry material data including the name of the steel young s modulus poisson s ratio yield strength strength limit boundary conditions variants of seat loads results presented in graphical and tabular form of the required parameters including extreme values conclusions according to these documents calculations are made only for the seat structure itself artificially cut off from the hull it is a simplification that generates significantly higher values of torsional stresses and deformations the seat is supported by the hull which deforms together with the seat and takes over part of the load modelling the seat and the entire ship s hull and bottom with the plastic material model seems more rational and is the primary assumption of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 rescue seat area loads following navsea ss700 aa ins 010 international 2013 the rescue vehicle applies a hydrostatic load onto the rescue seat when the transfer skirt seals with the rescue seat and dewaters this load s magnitude is equal to the hydrostatic pressure at rescue depth acting on the 2500 in2 16 129 cm2 area within the seal of the transfer skirt radius of 28 23 inches or 71 70 cm the magnitude of this load is dependent on the rescue depth which may be the full rescue depth of the rescue vehicle e g prm 2000 feet or 609 m or the collapse depth of the submarine this load is applied to the top surface of the rescue seat by the collar s connecting surface an inner radius of 26 50 inches or 67 31 cm and an outer radius of 30 50 inches or 77 47 cm the seat s surface is loaded with the pressure exerted by the surface and the place of contact with the rescue vehicle during connection at depths of 100 m 700 m concerning sea currents fig 5 connecting a rescue vehicle sealing and water draining results in hydrostatic pressure load on the seat construction this load acts on a surface limited by the rescue vehicle collar s outer diameter which is d z 1 545 m fig 6 therefore the surface area of connection is equal to a π d z 2 4 3 14159 1 545 2 4 1 87476 m 2 concentrated equivalent force at seat area construction is equal to 1 f γ h a where γ water specific gravity n m3 h depth of immersion m this force breaks down on the contact surface between the rescue vehicle collar and seat area which is a k π d z 2 d w 2 4 3 14159 1 545 2 1 346 2 4 0 4518566 m 2 so the load pressure on this surface is equal 2 p c f a k or p c a a k γ h 4 149107 γ h sea current was assumed as a linear variable pressure p l equal to 2 mpa effect of sea current is described by shape function 3 ϕ 1 x 1 x l ϕ 2 x x l then pressure p l is equal to 4 p l p 1 ϕ 1 x p 2 ϕ 2 x where p 1 2 mpa p 2 2 mpa if the zero of the coordinate system is in the middle of the seat area contact surface fig 7 a load of contact surface for mentioned dimensions and immersion depth including sea current flow along axis x is given by the equation 5 p p c p l 29 7 h 4 x 1 545 m p a where x local coordinate measured from the centre of the manhole x ε 1 545 2 1 545 2 2 2 material data the standard international 2013 does not specify how to model the material during calculations it only presents the requirements for submitting material data as an attachment to the seat certificate the material can be modelled using perfectly elastic variant 1 in this paper ideally plastic or models with plastic hardening variant 2 in this paper a material curve obtained from a testing machine can also be used however in cae programs such a curve may increase the computation time due to extrapolation between the curve points this problem can be avoided by using material models such material can be described by johnson cook polynomial in the form abaqus 6 14 2014 szturomski 2013 kohnke 1999 johnson and cook 2009 6 σ a b ε n 1 c l n ε ε 0 1 t t 0 t m t 0 m where σ stress a material constant b strengthening parameter ε plastic strain n exponent of strengthening c material constant referred to strain rate ε strain rate ε 0 is the effective plastic strain rate of the quasi static test t ambient temperature t 0 reference temperature t m melting temperature m softening exponent under the influence of temperature the seat structure should be made of high quality steel such as the structure of a strong hull stainless steels resistant to the marine environment with a yield point r e greater than 550 mpa is recommended due to the pressure occurring at great depths submarine structures must be durable therefore high strength heat treated steel with high coal equivalent is used for shipbuilding typical steel used in the construction of submarines is hy 80 hy 100 hrs 650m to the calculation the data for hy 80 steel which is suggested by navsea ss700 aa ins 010 instruction as a high quality steel used for special marine structures was used typical chemical composition of hy 80 steel is 0 18 c 0 3 mn 1 6 cr 3 ni 0 5 mo lincoln electric therefore the hy 80 johnson cook plastic steel model with the following properties was taken to the calculations holmquist 1987 density ρ 7746 kg m3 poisson s ratio ν 0 3 young s modulus e 2 07 105 mpa yield point r e 672 mpa ultimate strength r m 861 mpa material constant a 700 material constant b 425 material constant n 0 35 material constant c m 0 as can be seen from the presented material constants the temperature component m and strain rate dependency component c of the johnson cook model were not considered for further calculations due to its negligible influence during this analysis due to the high coal equivalent the welding process is also more complicated various methods can do welding of hy 80 hy 100 and hrs 650 m steels welding processes and welding materials are presented in table 2 2 3 the geometry of the rescue seat area discretization and boundary conditions stanag 1297 proposes examples of calculations made for the rescue seat s simplified geometry fig 8 due to the multitude of structural solutions of the hulls part of the surrounding hull should also be modelled in the case considered in this article the hull and part of the external environment sand is given when analyzing the seat certification reports szturomski et al 2013 patriciosepúlvedaaraos certificación it can be seen that they are made following the standard but the results and methodology are different this article presents the impact of hull geometry modelling on the stress results according to stanag 1297 this data are necessary for certification of submarines rescue seats for this purpose based on prepared drafts drawings and pictures of all seat area parts the rescue seat s geometry in the cad program was created fig 9 then two variants of the hull model were prepared variant 1 according to standards part of the strong hull variant 2 authors proposition whole hull with the bottom in the first variant part of the hull seat area s solid geometry was discretized into 223504 linear shell elements 224300 nodes fig 10 what constitutes a task with 1 345 800 degrees of freedom in the areas where the seat ring connects to the rescue vehicle the finite element mesh size was 5 mm while outside the ring of the seat the mesh was thinned to 100 mm analyzed sections of the strong hull with seat area construction were tied along the hull s cut edge taking away to all laying their nodes possibility of movement in the normal direction to the cut plane and rotation in other direction fig 11 in the second variant of calculations based on the technical documentation gołąbek and sobociński 2003 the entire ship s hull s geometry was created the hull was tied by boundary conditions on a springy sand bottom fig 12 in which the hull dipped into 10 cm the contact interaction with the coefficient of friction μ 0 2 between the hull and the sand was defined joseph 1996 the hull s solid geometry was discretized into 1224607 linear shell elements 1213302 nodes which constitutes a task with 7279812 degrees of freedom 3 calculations 3 1 strength analysis of rescue seat area strength calculations of rescue seat area were conducted by licensed cae software according to navsea ss700 aa ins 010 requirements seat area deformation caused by the pressure of connected rescue vehicle is determined by solving the finite element equation 7 k ε p l u f p c h p l v γ h where k ε p l stiffness matrix takes into account the structure of the plastic material model ε p l vector of plastic strain u displacement vector f load vector p c h emphasis of the docking vehicle ring depends on the depth of immersion p l v emphasis of the docking vehicle ring depends on the sea current speed γ water specific gravity n m3 h the depth of immersion m v the speed of the sea current in the second variant of calculations the equation in a given form was solved 8 k ε p l u f p c h p l v γ h c μ where c μ contact forces associated with the coefficient of friction given equations are strongly non linear due to the material s plastic characteristics the standard proposes linear elastic characteristics shape matrices and deformations of the whole structure besides the whole and part of the hull s elasticity significantly impact the calculation results the non linearity of the considered equations requires step by step integration dynamic explicit which substantially complicates fem calculations 4 results and conclusions the results of the stress state of the reduced hmh huber misses hencky occurring in the construction of the seat and hull from the pressure of the rescue vehicle at a depth of 700 m for both variants are presented if the results are compared differences between the load on the part and the whole hull can be seen for part of the hull the stress value reaches 5146 mpa fig 13 while for the whole the stress value reaches 821 mpa fig 14 such high stress values indicate that the structure is stiffened by certification based on the current standards the influence of the entire hull s elasticity and the bottom on which the ship rests is ignored using methodology from standard the hull and bottom elasticity impact on the seat is omitted however the analysis carried out in this way generates a higher stress value which is a safe parameter for the user but inconsistent with reality simulation of the entire hull requires a larger calculation task however it generates more plausible calculation results in this case errors resulting from the fem contact issue should be considered sładkowski 2005 in an emergency the submarine is usually located on the bottom which interacts with the ship s structure analyzing the literature teoriaokrętówpodwodnych 1965 kierowanie 1965 and using the author s experience it was found that to keep the boat at the bottom additional ballast about 1 2 displacement should be taken inside the ship which creates additional contact force between the bottom and the ship s hull which is not taken into account in standards for variant 1 which was developed to investigate a problem consisting of only parts of a strong hull according to the standard shell elements were used to simulate all features included in the model standards allow the use of shell elements but for those seat elements on which the load is applied solid elements must be applied to obtain the stress component perpendicular to the surface besides the seat is thick enough to consider the use of solid features instead of shell members the behaviour of the steel material is a certain inconsistency in the presented study in no case should the stresses exceed the strength limit of hy80 steel if this event occurred then the damage model should be applied to determine that the corresponding point in the model is broken so that point or feature should be deleted the fem model corresponding to a part of the hull can be improved using solid elements or submodels the steel material model does not function correctly without considering the damage criterion the comprehensive analysis also requires consideration of welds and haz to obtain stress concentration locations in the results for both variants there is a discrepancy of one order of magnitude for a part of the hull variant 1 the hmh stress reaches 5146 mpa and for the whole hull variant 2 821 mpa such high values in variant 1 result from simplification which ignores the impact of elasticity of the part of the hull that has been cut off and the elastic bottom on which the ship is sunk what is more the standards do not include strains analyzing fig 15 it can be seen that in the model from variant 1 the maximum deformations are smaller than in variant 2 that leads to the conclusion that such calculations should also consider failure criteria that can cause discontinuities in the structure it is also worth noting that the maximum depth for this type of ship is 225 m and the calculations according to the standard are performed for a depth of 700 m taking these considerations into account high stress values in the seating area should be expected to summarizing the guidelines for performing strength simulations of rescue seats may be incorrectly formulated and give excessive results funding this paper was supported by the polish naval academy in the year 2021 credit authorship contribution statement radosław

20307,in the present work we have operationally implemented a data assimilation da scheme in the wave forecasting system at the indian operational agency indian national centre for ocean information services incois significant wave height swh measurements from the saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 altimeters were assimilated using the optimal interpolation technique the impact of altimeter da towards improving the reliability of wave predictions in the indian ocean is evaluated by validating the forecasted wave parameters with buoy observations the assimilation of altimeter data showed considerable improvement in the wave predictions swh forecast in the northern indian ocean region improved up to 15 in the first 24 h period the improvement in forecasted wave parameters were due to the correction in swell forecast which persists throughout the forecast period for wind sea forecast impact of da was less visible 4 6 improvement up to forecast lead time of 24 h as it is primarily driven by local wind fields the positive impact of da on the swell forecast is further established considering a swell surge event named kallakkadal keywords data assimilation altimeter wave forecast optimal interpolation indian ocean kallakkadal 1 introduction accurate prediction of ocean surface wave conditions is crucial for various human activities at the sea for example naval operations ship routing tourism fisheries port and harbour construction and offshore industries numerical wave modelling is one of the approaches to accomplish this goal and continual advances in this area have resulted in the community standard third generation spectral wave models komen et al 1994 such as wave model wam simulating waves nearshore swan and wavewatch iii ww3 different operational centres around the world for instance the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf national center for environmental prediction ncep usa the australian bureau of meteorology and the indian national centre for ocean information services incois india use these state of the art numerical models for operational wave forecast however the accuracy of wave forecasting depends mainly on the model forcing fields source term parameterizations and effect of numerics the input wind forcing is usually obtained from numerical weather prediction nwp models which have their own errors in the recent past several studies have made efforts to improve the parameterizations and numerics of the wave models cavaleri et al 2007 roland and ardhuin 2014 stopa et al 2016 in spite of all the advancement that has happened in the wave modelling models are still far from perfect particularly in the coastal regions cavaleri et al 2018 another approach to improve wave forecasting is by updating the model initial conditions through the assimilation of wave observations into the model data assimilation da in wave models has progressed with the availability of wave observations from radar altimeter on board different satellites studies by esteva 1988 janssen et al 1989 and lionello et al 1992 were among the first such attempts using seasat and geosat altimeter data since then a number of earth observing satellites carrying altimeters have been launched by different space agencies and near real time global wave observations available from these sensors are being used to improve the accuracy of operational wave forecast for example ers 1 altimeter observed wave heights were assimilated in the operational wave model at the norwegian meteorological institute breivik and reistad 1994 similarly greenslade 2001 assimilated ers 2 significant wave height swh data in the operational wave model at the australian bureau of meteorology the author has found an improvement in the model performance throughout the forecast period 96 h and the highest impact was observed at the locations where the sea state was dominated by swell operational wave da at ecmwf started with ingestion of ers 1 altimeter wave heights followed by ers 2 envisat and jason ifs documentation 2017 likewise altimeter data from multiple sources ers 2 and jason 1 were assimilated in a global wave model and its impact on wave analysis and forecast were evaluated by skandrani et al 2004 over the indian ocean region emmanouil et al 2007 studied the impact of altimeter da using envisat data they reported that the assimilation showed a considerable improvement in wave forecasting for the indian ocean region because of the longer memory of swell envisat wave height were also assimilated into a coastal wave model swan for the indian ocean region suchandra et al 2014 after the launch of first ka band altimeter saral altika suchandra et al 2015a used these wave height data for the assimilation all the above mentioned studies were based on the optimal interpolation oi assimilation method researchers have also attempted other methods such as ensemble based almeida et al 2016 peng and lei 2015 sannasiraj et al 2006 kalman filter based pinto et al 2005 voorrips et al 1999 and variational based orzech et al 2013 veeramony et al 2010 however these algorithms require much larger computational resources compared to the conventional oi which is otherwise computationally fast relatively simpler and operationally feasible at global scale moreover advantage of using advanced assimilation methods for wave da has not yet been established lefèvre and aouf 2012 in india incois is the operational agency which provides ocean forecast and advisory services to the society industry government agencies and scientific community it started the ocean state forecast osf service in the year 2005 by issuing forecast of ocean surface waves and winds balakrishnan nair et al 2013 high resolution wave forecast is a component of incois osf which is using state of the art wave models such as mike21 spectral wave model mike21 sw swan ww3 etc the regional wave forecast is given using ww3 model and its performance is found reliable in various high wave conditions remya et al 2016 2020 the system is also used for the special case of coastal flooding known as kallakkadal forecast remya et al 2016 however no da technique was operationally incorporated in the incois ww3 model in the present work we have implemented an assimilation algorithm based on oi to ingest the near real time observation of swh from saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 altimeters into the operational wave model ww3 at incois the impact of altimeter assimilation on the operational wave forecast in the indian ocean region is presented here 2 model description the ww3 is a third generation wind wave spectral model developed at noaa ncep with physics and numerics similar to those of the wam model wamdi group 1988 it solves the random phase spectral action density balance equation for wave number direction spectra which in spherical coordinates is 1 n t 1 cos φ φ φ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ 2 φ c g cos θ u φ r 3 λ c g sin θ u λ r cos 4 θ g θ c g tan φ cos θ r where t is time λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave direction n is the wave action density spectrum described in five dimensions λ φ k θ t k is the wave number the overdot symbol denotes the wave action propagation speed in λ φ k θ space c g is group velocity u φ and u λ are current components r is radius of earth σ is relative frequency and s is the total of source sink terms in deep water the net source term s is generally considered to consist of three parts 5 s s i n s n l s d s where s i n is wind wave interaction term s n l is non linear wave wave interactions term and s d s is dissipation term in shallow water additional processes are to be considered most notably wave bottom interactions s b o t and depth induced breaking s d b with model version 3 14 a mosaic approach is available where an arbitrary number of grids can be considered with variable spatial resolutions and with full two way interactions between all grids tolman 2008 to describe wave propagation both a first order accurate and third order accurate numerical scheme are available tolman 1995 for source term integration in time a dynamically adjusted time stepping algorithm is used for detailed description of the model see tolman and the wavewatch iii development group 2014 3 data and methodology 3 1 forcing data the forecasting system uses 10 m analysis and forecast wind components obtained from the ecmwf as the forcing field the ecmwf integrated forecast system ifs uses four dimensional 4d variational assimilation scheme that assimilates several meteorological observations rabier et al 2000 ifs documentation 2017 the spatial and temporal resolutions of the forecasted winds are 0 250 0 250 and 3 h respectively 3 2 assimilation data sets swh observations obtained from the operational geophysical data record ogdr products of saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 are used for assimilation after applying the quality flags these along track observations are generally available with 3 5 h latency only those observations where the difference between the observed and modeled swh is less than 5 times the standard deviation of the difference are considered for the assimilation this threshold is applied to prevent spurious altimeter data from being assimilated into the model it allows for more than 99 of observation getting assimilated with less than 1 rejection saral altika is a joint centre national d etudes spatiales cnes indian space research organization isro altimeter mission verron et al 2015 it is at an altitude of 800 km in a polar orbit with 35 days exact repeat cycle from july 2016 it is in drifting orbit and the repetitive ground track is no more maintained it carries onboard the first oceanographic high frequency radar altimeter at ka band altika at 35 75 ghz use of high frequency ka band provides improved ground resolution enabling better observations of ice continental water bodies and coastal areas the jason 2 ocean surface topography mission by cnes nasa eumetsat and noaa is a follow on mission to jason 1 lambin et al 2010 it was launched on the same non sun synchronous orbit as jason 1 at an altitude of 1336 km and 66 degree inclination angle with a repetivity of 10 days covering 95 of ice free oceans in october 2016 it was shifted to the interleaved orbit and from july 2017 jason 2 operated on a new long repeat orbit at roughly 1309 5 km altitude since july 2018 it operates on an interleaved long repeat orbit it carries poseidon 3 altimeter which emits pulses at two frequencies 13 6 ghz ku band and 5 3 ghz c band in this study the ku band wave height data is used for the assimilation period jason 3 is a follow on altimetric mission to topex poseidon jason 1 and jason 2 it is a joint mission by nasa noaa cnes and eumetsat launched on january 17 2016 it flies at an orbit of altitude 1336 km with a repeat period of approximately 10 days like jason 2 it carries a dual frequency ku and c band radar altimeter poseidon 3 which measures altimeter range sigma0 swh and ionospheric correction the ku band swh data is used for the assimilation 3 3 validation data sets in order to evaluate the impact of assimilation model predictions are validated using the in situ buoy observations in the indian ocean government of india established the national data buoy programme ndbp in 1997 at the national institute of ocean technology niot chennai for collecting systematic real time meteorological and oceanographic observations a network of moored buoys was deployed in arabian sea as and bay of bengal bob that are equipped with a mru motion reference unit for wave measurements the mru is an inertial altitude heading reference system with dynamic linear motion measurement capability the data are recorded at a rate of 1 hz for 17 min every 3 h a fast fourier transform fft is applied on these wave records to obtain the power spectrum wave parameters are calculated using both directional and non directional analysis which are then transmitted to shore station in the wave spectrum measurements between 0 04 and 0 1 hz is considered as low frequency swell components and 0 1 0 5 hz as high frequency sea components in addition to moored buoys incois s waman wave monitoring along near shore buoy network of directional wave rider buoys dwrb are also used for the validation of the model forecast datawell 2006 integral wave parameters such as swh maximum wave height peak wave period tp and peak wave direction are derived from the wave spectrum these data are received in real time at incois through the high frequency modes of indian national satellite system insat geographical locations of the moored and wave rider buoys used in the present study are shown in fig 1 b 3 4 data assimilation scheme the da procedure combines observation and model wave field to determine best possible state of waves that closely represents the true state of waves its gross purpose is to improve the analyzed state which would result in improvement of wave forecast we have used the oi technique gandin 1965 for satellite da here the analysis field of swh x a which is a statistical combination of the model simulated swh and observed swh from other sources is calculated as 6 x a x b b h t h b h t r 1 y 0 h x b where x b is the background state generated from the model simulated swh and y 0 is the observed state b is the background error covariance matrix and r is the observation error covariance h is the interpolation operator which maps the model onto the observation space the background error covariance matrix b is largely unknown for the wave field and estimating its spatial structure is considered as the most important component in the da algorithm daley 1993 in the majority of studies on wave da standard statistical correlation functions such as gaussian functions are used to parameterize the background error covariance for example chen et al 2004 adopted the formulation in which the covariance between any two points is assumed to have a gaussian spatial distribution here 7 b i j a e x p d i j l 2 where b i j is the background error covariance between model grid points i and j a is the model error variance d i j is the distance between the model grid points i and j and l is the estimate of correlation spatial scale of the model error the value of a controls the relative weight between the observation and the model and it can be calculated by comparing the model simulated data with the observed data typically over the indian ocean region ww3 simulated swh have 0 5m error with respect to jason 2 observations seemanth et al 2016 hence in the present study model error variance is taken as 0 25 m2 l can be estimated using the correlation scale of wave height variability several previous studies have used different values for l for example chen et al 2004 considered 2 99 after testing several values young and glowacki 1996 chosen l as 350 km greenslade 2001 considered three values 300 500 and 700 km and found that the lowest rmse in swh are obtained with the smallest correlation scale hence in the present study we have taken l 3 degrees observation errors are generally assumed to be spatially uncorrelated and thus this assumption reduces the observation error covariance r to a diagonal matrix with the variance along the diagonal since the same variance is assumed for all observation locations the observation error covariance matrix can be written as 8 r v i where v is the variance value for altimeter derived swh and i is an m by m identity matrix m is the number of observations in the present study we have used 0 0625 m2 as the variance value considering the error in altimeter measured swh to be 0 25m typically error in altimeter derived swh is of this order 0 25m when they are compared to buoy observations hector et al 2015 suchandra et al 2015b the interpolation operator h is an n by m matrix n is the number of model points h is generated by calculating the weights given to the model grid points when the model values are bi linearly interpolated onto the observation space since ww3 is a spectral wave model it is necessary to calculate an analysis wave spectrum f a n f θ where f is frequency and θ is direction from the analysis field of swh x a this is done by scaling the background model spectra f m f θ using the following equation esteva 1988 9 f a n f θ x a x b 2 f m f θ in this approach the total energy under the modified spectrum correspond to the observed swh whereas the shape of the spectrum remains unchanged the primary assumption here is that the model correctly predicts the distribution of energies between high frequency wind seas and low frequency swell waves this approach has certain limitations if the primary spectral change between assimilation location and forecast location is in the wind sea range this method will overpredict changes in swell and underpredict changes in higher frequency components leading to underprediction of changes in the mean wave period also if wave energy is added from a different direction this method will not capture the changes in the mean spectral direction 3 5 data assimilation wave forecasting system the ww3 version 4 18 tolman and the wavewatch iii development group 2014 set up at incois consists of four nested domains including global 10 10 resolution indian ocean 0 50 0 50 resolution northern indian ocean nio 0 250 0 250 resolution and coastal 0 10 0 10 resolution domains with two way interaction between them fig 1a for the grid generation the bathymetry is derived from etopo1 data and shoreline data is derived from global self consistent hierarchical high resolution gshhs database the output spectrum is discretized with 29 frequencies initial frequency of 0 035 hz with an increment factor of 1 1 and 36 directions with 100 increment input and dissipation source term is modeled using the st4 physics ardhuin et al 2010 non linear wave wave interaction is parameterized using the discrete interaction approximation of hasselmann et al 1985 and bottom friction is modeled using the joint north sea wave project jonswap parameterization hasselmann et al 1973 the operational model is run one time in a day at the 0000 utc model cycle and start with a 24 h analysis for the previous day using previous day s analysis winds to ensure the continuity of swell saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 observed swh from the near real time product is assimilated into this 24 h analysis cycle at every 6 h at each assimilation cycle altimeter observations within a 3 h temporal window centered at analysis hour are considered thus spatial and temporal distribution of the assimilated tracks varies widely over the domain typically 2 7 altimeter tracks are obtained for assimilation at each model time step updated model initial condition at the 24th hour of previous day 0000 utc of current day is used for initialising the next 5 days forecast also these restart files are stored for initialising the analysis cycle for the next day s forecast assimilation is performed in the indian ocean nio and coastal domains of the model the model provides 120 h 5 days forecasts and simulated wave parameters are stored at every 6 h the da scheme was tested for 2 months period april may 2018 in the indian ocean region for this a control run noda is also performed without assimilating any altimeter data forecasts from both sets of runs da and noda are validated with the indian ocean buoy observations available during this period we have considered wind speed ws and seven integral wave parameters for the comparison of model forecast with the offshore buoy observations those are significant wave height hs mean wave period tm peak period tp swell significant height hsa wind sea significant height hsb swell mean period tma and wind sea mean period tmb for the shallow water comparison two wave parameters hs and tp available from the coastal buoys are considered hs is defined as the average of one third of the highest waves observed over a certain span of time it is computed as 10 h s 4 m 0 where m 0 is the zeroth order moment of the spectrum the nth order moment m n of the spectrum is defined as 11 m n 0 f n e f d f where e f denotes the variance density at frequency f the definition of tm from the buoy is 12 t m m 0 m 2 tp is defined as the wave period associated with the most energetic waves in the total wave spectrum at a specific point it is worth mentioning that the sea state at any given point in time is a combination of two major categories of waves first is the local wind generated waves commonly referred as sea second is the waves generated from distant storm that propagate at the observational location without much attenuation called swells the wave height and period of the wind generated waves are referred in buoy observations as wind sea significant height and wind sea mean period respectively whereas that of the swells are swell significant height and swell mean period in order to validate hsa hsb tma and tmb with the buoy data one dimensional spectra obtained from the model are separated into low frequency swell 0 04 0 1 hz and high frequency wind sea 0 1 0 5 hz components here a threshold frequency criterion of 0 1 hz is chosen to keep it same as that used in the buoy measured wave spectrum then the wave parameters hsa hsb tma and tmb are derived from each part of the spectrum separately by using equations 10 and 12 statistical parameters such as root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and skill score are estimated for quantitative analysis skill score indicates the percentage improvement or deterioration of da runs with reference to the noda runs and is calculated as 13 s k i l l s c o r e 1 r m s e d a r m s e n o d a 100 4 results and discussion during april may 2018 wave observations from six moored buoys bd08 bd11 bd14 ad06 ad07 and ad09 were available in the nio region fig 1b fig 2 shows the graphical representation of model error statistics of wave heights computed for all the six buoys together we initially evaluated the impact of swh assimilation on forecasted wave heights the statistical values indicate that the assimilation of swh offers a better forecast it shows fig 2c an improvement of 15 in swh prediction during the initial 24 h and then it decreases to 8 in the following hours marginal improvement of 4 is seen after 78 h lead prediction the statistics of the partitioned wave heights clearly shows that the improvement in the swh has resulted from the improvement in swell forecast da significantly improves the swell forecast till 72 h 13 18 and then there is marginal improvement up to 117 h 6 12 swells have a longer memory of assimilation emmanouil et al 2007 as they are not affected by the local winds hence a correction in swells which originates in the southern latitudes due to assimilation of altimeter data translates to the nio region as these swells travel to the northern latitudes several studies have shown the impact of southern ocean swells on nio wave climate remya et al 2012 2016 sabique et al 2012 these researchers have noted that the southern ocean swell takes 4 5 days time to reach nio this could be the reason for the observed improvement in the swell forecast even up to 5 days in the nio region previous studies by greenslade 2001 and emmanouil et al 2007 also noticed that the impact of assimilation on swell forecast persists for the whole forecast period over swell dominated regions in the case of wind sea significant height improvement of 4 6 is seen up to 18 h and then it decreases drastically this clearly suggests that the impact of assimilation is trivial and does not stay longer in the wind sea part as it is majorly driven by local winds wave prediction is basically considered as a forcing problem rather than an initial value problem lefèvre and aouf 2012 and wave models are highly sensitive to the input wind forcing several earlier studies also confirmed this by showing a positive impact of assimilation till 24 48 h forecast lead time chen et al 2004 although the assimilated parameter is swh the model spectra is scaled using equation 9 here we evaluate the improvement in wave period forecast due to da little improvement is seen in mean wave period 5 9 during the first 5 days of forecast fig 3 a c statistics of partitioned wave period shows that the improvement in the mean wave period is due to the improvement in the swell wave period there is a significant improvement up to first 3 days 12 16 and thereafter little improvement is seen until 5th day 5 10 assimilation did not show much impact on the wind sea mean period fig 3g i on the contrary a slight degradation of forecast is noted till 72 h of forecast for tp assimilation shows a positive impact up to 11 till 78 h forecast after which no impact is seen fig 3j l the time series plots of wave heights and periods first day forecast shown in figs 4 7 supports the statistics given above two representative locations ad06 and bd08 have been considered each from as and bob for the first day forecast comparison figs 4 and 5 shows the comparison of forecasted wind speed and wave parameters at ad06 the observed wave heights are less than 4 m during the study period the time evolution of the forecasted wave heights is in good agreement with the observation and improvement in hs due to da is apparent in this time series comparison it is also clear that this improvement is mainly contributed by the swell waves fig 4a c the comparison of wave periods shows improvement in tp and tma due to da fig 5a d figs 6 and 7 show the comparison of forecasted wave parameters at bd08 mooring located in the northern bob here hs clearly shows improvement in the forecast due to da which was mainly due to the improvement in the swell the comparison of wave periods also shows improvement in tp and tma due to da table 1 provides the model error statistics of the first day forecast comparison at 6 offshore buoy locations eight wave rider buoys along the indian coast fig 1b and one buoy off the seychelles are used for evaluating the impact of da in coastal areas fig 8 shows the graphical representation of model error statistics for the comparison of swh and tp as function of forecast time forecasted swh shows moderate improvement 6 11 in the initial 36 h after which it reduces during pre monsoon season indian coastal regions experience the co existence of pre existing swells and local wind seas which are generated by sea breeze rashmi et al 2013 remya and kumar 2013 as discussed earlier lesser memory of wind sea could be the reason for minimal impact of assimilation after 36 h forecast as a result the improvement seen in the coastal locations was less as compared to that in the deep water buoy locations in case of tp there is little improvement up to 8 which might have resulted from the improvement in the swell table 2 provides the error statistics in the first day forecast at the individual wave rider buoy locations the improvement of hs is mainly seen in the swell dominated seychelles location with a skill score of 26 peak wave period shows marginal improvement at most of the locations due to da 4 1 a swell surge event case study we have seen the impact of assimilation on the swell forecast in the above sections and hence we carry out a detailed analysis of one swell surge event known locally as kallakkadal that happened during 21 24 april 2018 this case study is performed to find the impact of assimilation during swell events the kallakkadal is a term used by the fisherman in the state of kerala in southwest of india to refer to flash flooding events it is considered as one of the major forecast problems along the indian coasts and these are caused by high swell waves without any sign in the local winds sometimes leading to severe flooding recent research by remya et al 2016 specifically focused on this event and they established the link between nio high swell events and meteorological conditions in the southern ocean they have confirmed that long period swell waves 18 s seen during kallakkadal events are generated in the southern indian ocean by severe low pressure system occurring 3 5 days prior to the kallakkadal events the quasi stationary nature of the southern ocean low pressure systems provides strong 25 m s and long duration 3 days surface winds over a large fetch an essential condition for the generation of long period swells incois separately issues warning for such events when we analyzed this 21 24 april 2018 event the meteorological conditions over southern ocean clearly showed a cut off low on 16th april 2018 near 500 s 400 e south of africa approximately 9000 km away from the indian coast circled in fig 9 we followed the methodology of remya et al 2016 to identify the cut off low the system remained quasi stationary in the generation area for a duration of 36 h the long duration intense surface wind 26 m s associated with this system caused the swell propagation to the indian coastal region figs 9 and 10 these swells hit the southern tip of india on 21st april incois issued the warning two days prior to the events and hence the wave forecasts of 18th and 19th april were crucial in taking decisions hence we analyzed the impact of assimilation on the 18th and 19th wave forecast satellite tracks considered in the assimilation cycle for issuing the forecast of 18th and 19th april 2018 are shown in the left panel of fig 10 the middle panel shows the scalar field of swh at 00 utc of 18th and 19th april without any assimilation and the right panel shows the swh field obtained after da middle and right panel also provides an along track comparison of model simulations with altimeter swh which are assimilated at 00 utc through color legend overlay from the comparison it can be seen that the noda model overestimates the swh at the generation area one can clearly see the large mismatch between tracks and background swh field in noda while the mismatch is less in da runs the swell waves hit the seychelles on 19th april 14 utc and at this time 1 4 m wave height with a peak wave period of 22 s was observed in the incois wave rider buoy seychelles is the only place where we could get in situ observations in the southern ocean the comparison of wave spectra which holds complete information of wave fields at seychelles is shown in fig 11 for 18th and 19th april forecast on 18th april forecast improvement due to da was not significant and the model could not pick the observed peak energy density fig 11a however the maximum energy density was accurately reproduced by the da model on 19th april forecast and the improvement was significant in terms of correcting the maximum energy density fig 11b for further analysis we have chosen 06 utc of 20th april when the energy density is found maximum during the event figs 11c and d depict the comparison of one dimensional spectra valid for 20th april 06 utc the observed peak energy density 30 33 m2 hz during this time was not picked by both da and noda models initialised from 18th april maximum energy density forecasted by the model was only around 25 m2 hz however the da model showed correction of energy density in the frequency range 0 06 0 07 hz fig 11c 19th april forecast shows significant correction in the peak energy density because of da here da model produced a peak energy density of 29 6 m2 hz which was close to the observed value noda model clearly underpredicted the peak energy density with a magnitude of about 25 5 m2 hz fig 11d the correction of energy density in the frequency range 0 06 0 07 hz was noticed in the da model forecast for 19th april also from this analysis it once again proves that the da improves the lower frequency part of the spectrum i e the swell waves the swell waves reached the representative buoy locations in deep sea and coastal waters on 21st and 22nd april a comparison of forecasted swh and tp from da and noda models initialised from 19th april is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that almost at all the buoy locations swh and tp are better forecasted by the da model as against the noda forecasts 5 summary and conclusions in the present work a da algorithm based on the oi technique is implemented in the wave forecasting system at the indian operational center incois in order to improve the predictability of this wave forecasting system swh data from saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 were used for the assimilation comparison of the model simulations with the in situ buoy observations showed clear improvement in the forecast after assimilating altimeter data swh prediction for the deep water locations showed an improvement of 15 in the initial 24 h in the case of mean wave period an improvement of 5 9 was observed during the first 5 days forecast for peak wave period assimilation showed a positive impact up to 11 till 78 h forecast after which no impact was seen at shallow water locations an improvement of 6 11 was noted in the forecasted swh during the initial 36 h and peak wave period forecast showed an improvement up to 8 the improvement is much more significant in the case of swell forecast throughout the forecast period after the implementation of da the swell significant height forecast improved by 13 18 in the initial 72 h and then 6 12 up to 117 h forecast similarly considerable improvement is attained in the swell wave period forecast 12 16 up to 3 days these results are further supported by a case study of a swell surge event kallakkadal and found that the altimeter da improved the predictability of such events da has minimal impact in the wind sea forecast as it is primarily driven by an uncorrected wind field which can have large errors the swells on the other hand have a longer memory of assimilation as they are not affected by the local winds this study proves that in a situation of coexisting wind sea and swell systems the da can improve the ability of the model to represent the spectrum it can thus be concluded that the da scheme implemented in the incois operational wave forecasting system using remotely sensed data is effective in improving the regional wave forecast as a further step wave spectra assimilation from synthetic aperture radar sar is planned with an advanced scheme of assimilation the evaluation of the impact of da will be then assessed during various seasons and also for the tropical cyclone condition the present da wave forecasting system is operational at incois and the forecasted wave parameters are being disseminated through incois web portal https www incois gov in portal osf osfglobal jsp region global area indianocean param swh and various other

20307,in the present work we have operationally implemented a data assimilation da scheme in the wave forecasting system at the indian operational agency indian national centre for ocean information services incois significant wave height swh measurements from the saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 altimeters were assimilated using the optimal interpolation technique the impact of altimeter da towards improving the reliability of wave predictions in the indian ocean is evaluated by validating the forecasted wave parameters with buoy observations the assimilation of altimeter data showed considerable improvement in the wave predictions swh forecast in the northern indian ocean region improved up to 15 in the first 24 h period the improvement in forecasted wave parameters were due to the correction in swell forecast which persists throughout the forecast period for wind sea forecast impact of da was less visible 4 6 improvement up to forecast lead time of 24 h as it is primarily driven by local wind fields the positive impact of da on the swell forecast is further established considering a swell surge event named kallakkadal keywords data assimilation altimeter wave forecast optimal interpolation indian ocean kallakkadal 1 introduction accurate prediction of ocean surface wave conditions is crucial for various human activities at the sea for example naval operations ship routing tourism fisheries port and harbour construction and offshore industries numerical wave modelling is one of the approaches to accomplish this goal and continual advances in this area have resulted in the community standard third generation spectral wave models komen et al 1994 such as wave model wam simulating waves nearshore swan and wavewatch iii ww3 different operational centres around the world for instance the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf national center for environmental prediction ncep usa the australian bureau of meteorology and the indian national centre for ocean information services incois india use these state of the art numerical models for operational wave forecast however the accuracy of wave forecasting depends mainly on the model forcing fields source term parameterizations and effect of numerics the input wind forcing is usually obtained from numerical weather prediction nwp models which have their own errors in the recent past several studies have made efforts to improve the parameterizations and numerics of the wave models cavaleri et al 2007 roland and ardhuin 2014 stopa et al 2016 in spite of all the advancement that has happened in the wave modelling models are still far from perfect particularly in the coastal regions cavaleri et al 2018 another approach to improve wave forecasting is by updating the model initial conditions through the assimilation of wave observations into the model data assimilation da in wave models has progressed with the availability of wave observations from radar altimeter on board different satellites studies by esteva 1988 janssen et al 1989 and lionello et al 1992 were among the first such attempts using seasat and geosat altimeter data since then a number of earth observing satellites carrying altimeters have been launched by different space agencies and near real time global wave observations available from these sensors are being used to improve the accuracy of operational wave forecast for example ers 1 altimeter observed wave heights were assimilated in the operational wave model at the norwegian meteorological institute breivik and reistad 1994 similarly greenslade 2001 assimilated ers 2 significant wave height swh data in the operational wave model at the australian bureau of meteorology the author has found an improvement in the model performance throughout the forecast period 96 h and the highest impact was observed at the locations where the sea state was dominated by swell operational wave da at ecmwf started with ingestion of ers 1 altimeter wave heights followed by ers 2 envisat and jason ifs documentation 2017 likewise altimeter data from multiple sources ers 2 and jason 1 were assimilated in a global wave model and its impact on wave analysis and forecast were evaluated by skandrani et al 2004 over the indian ocean region emmanouil et al 2007 studied the impact of altimeter da using envisat data they reported that the assimilation showed a considerable improvement in wave forecasting for the indian ocean region because of the longer memory of swell envisat wave height were also assimilated into a coastal wave model swan for the indian ocean region suchandra et al 2014 after the launch of first ka band altimeter saral altika suchandra et al 2015a used these wave height data for the assimilation all the above mentioned studies were based on the optimal interpolation oi assimilation method researchers have also attempted other methods such as ensemble based almeida et al 2016 peng and lei 2015 sannasiraj et al 2006 kalman filter based pinto et al 2005 voorrips et al 1999 and variational based orzech et al 2013 veeramony et al 2010 however these algorithms require much larger computational resources compared to the conventional oi which is otherwise computationally fast relatively simpler and operationally feasible at global scale moreover advantage of using advanced assimilation methods for wave da has not yet been established lefèvre and aouf 2012 in india incois is the operational agency which provides ocean forecast and advisory services to the society industry government agencies and scientific community it started the ocean state forecast osf service in the year 2005 by issuing forecast of ocean surface waves and winds balakrishnan nair et al 2013 high resolution wave forecast is a component of incois osf which is using state of the art wave models such as mike21 spectral wave model mike21 sw swan ww3 etc the regional wave forecast is given using ww3 model and its performance is found reliable in various high wave conditions remya et al 2016 2020 the system is also used for the special case of coastal flooding known as kallakkadal forecast remya et al 2016 however no da technique was operationally incorporated in the incois ww3 model in the present work we have implemented an assimilation algorithm based on oi to ingest the near real time observation of swh from saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 altimeters into the operational wave model ww3 at incois the impact of altimeter assimilation on the operational wave forecast in the indian ocean region is presented here 2 model description the ww3 is a third generation wind wave spectral model developed at noaa ncep with physics and numerics similar to those of the wam model wamdi group 1988 it solves the random phase spectral action density balance equation for wave number direction spectra which in spherical coordinates is 1 n t 1 cos φ φ φ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ 2 φ c g cos θ u φ r 3 λ c g sin θ u λ r cos 4 θ g θ c g tan φ cos θ r where t is time λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave direction n is the wave action density spectrum described in five dimensions λ φ k θ t k is the wave number the overdot symbol denotes the wave action propagation speed in λ φ k θ space c g is group velocity u φ and u λ are current components r is radius of earth σ is relative frequency and s is the total of source sink terms in deep water the net source term s is generally considered to consist of three parts 5 s s i n s n l s d s where s i n is wind wave interaction term s n l is non linear wave wave interactions term and s d s is dissipation term in shallow water additional processes are to be considered most notably wave bottom interactions s b o t and depth induced breaking s d b with model version 3 14 a mosaic approach is available where an arbitrary number of grids can be considered with variable spatial resolutions and with full two way interactions between all grids tolman 2008 to describe wave propagation both a first order accurate and third order accurate numerical scheme are available tolman 1995 for source term integration in time a dynamically adjusted time stepping algorithm is used for detailed description of the model see tolman and the wavewatch iii development group 2014 3 data and methodology 3 1 forcing data the forecasting system uses 10 m analysis and forecast wind components obtained from the ecmwf as the forcing field the ecmwf integrated forecast system ifs uses four dimensional 4d variational assimilation scheme that assimilates several meteorological observations rabier et al 2000 ifs documentation 2017 the spatial and temporal resolutions of the forecasted winds are 0 250 0 250 and 3 h respectively 3 2 assimilation data sets swh observations obtained from the operational geophysical data record ogdr products of saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 are used for assimilation after applying the quality flags these along track observations are generally available with 3 5 h latency only those observations where the difference between the observed and modeled swh is less than 5 times the standard deviation of the difference are considered for the assimilation this threshold is applied to prevent spurious altimeter data from being assimilated into the model it allows for more than 99 of observation getting assimilated with less than 1 rejection saral altika is a joint centre national d etudes spatiales cnes indian space research organization isro altimeter mission verron et al 2015 it is at an altitude of 800 km in a polar orbit with 35 days exact repeat cycle from july 2016 it is in drifting orbit and the repetitive ground track is no more maintained it carries onboard the first oceanographic high frequency radar altimeter at ka band altika at 35 75 ghz use of high frequency ka band provides improved ground resolution enabling better observations of ice continental water bodies and coastal areas the jason 2 ocean surface topography mission by cnes nasa eumetsat and noaa is a follow on mission to jason 1 lambin et al 2010 it was launched on the same non sun synchronous orbit as jason 1 at an altitude of 1336 km and 66 degree inclination angle with a repetivity of 10 days covering 95 of ice free oceans in october 2016 it was shifted to the interleaved orbit and from july 2017 jason 2 operated on a new long repeat orbit at roughly 1309 5 km altitude since july 2018 it operates on an interleaved long repeat orbit it carries poseidon 3 altimeter which emits pulses at two frequencies 13 6 ghz ku band and 5 3 ghz c band in this study the ku band wave height data is used for the assimilation period jason 3 is a follow on altimetric mission to topex poseidon jason 1 and jason 2 it is a joint mission by nasa noaa cnes and eumetsat launched on january 17 2016 it flies at an orbit of altitude 1336 km with a repeat period of approximately 10 days like jason 2 it carries a dual frequency ku and c band radar altimeter poseidon 3 which measures altimeter range sigma0 swh and ionospheric correction the ku band swh data is used for the assimilation 3 3 validation data sets in order to evaluate the impact of assimilation model predictions are validated using the in situ buoy observations in the indian ocean government of india established the national data buoy programme ndbp in 1997 at the national institute of ocean technology niot chennai for collecting systematic real time meteorological and oceanographic observations a network of moored buoys was deployed in arabian sea as and bay of bengal bob that are equipped with a mru motion reference unit for wave measurements the mru is an inertial altitude heading reference system with dynamic linear motion measurement capability the data are recorded at a rate of 1 hz for 17 min every 3 h a fast fourier transform fft is applied on these wave records to obtain the power spectrum wave parameters are calculated using both directional and non directional analysis which are then transmitted to shore station in the wave spectrum measurements between 0 04 and 0 1 hz is considered as low frequency swell components and 0 1 0 5 hz as high frequency sea components in addition to moored buoys incois s waman wave monitoring along near shore buoy network of directional wave rider buoys dwrb are also used for the validation of the model forecast datawell 2006 integral wave parameters such as swh maximum wave height peak wave period tp and peak wave direction are derived from the wave spectrum these data are received in real time at incois through the high frequency modes of indian national satellite system insat geographical locations of the moored and wave rider buoys used in the present study are shown in fig 1 b 3 4 data assimilation scheme the da procedure combines observation and model wave field to determine best possible state of waves that closely represents the true state of waves its gross purpose is to improve the analyzed state which would result in improvement of wave forecast we have used the oi technique gandin 1965 for satellite da here the analysis field of swh x a which is a statistical combination of the model simulated swh and observed swh from other sources is calculated as 6 x a x b b h t h b h t r 1 y 0 h x b where x b is the background state generated from the model simulated swh and y 0 is the observed state b is the background error covariance matrix and r is the observation error covariance h is the interpolation operator which maps the model onto the observation space the background error covariance matrix b is largely unknown for the wave field and estimating its spatial structure is considered as the most important component in the da algorithm daley 1993 in the majority of studies on wave da standard statistical correlation functions such as gaussian functions are used to parameterize the background error covariance for example chen et al 2004 adopted the formulation in which the covariance between any two points is assumed to have a gaussian spatial distribution here 7 b i j a e x p d i j l 2 where b i j is the background error covariance between model grid points i and j a is the model error variance d i j is the distance between the model grid points i and j and l is the estimate of correlation spatial scale of the model error the value of a controls the relative weight between the observation and the model and it can be calculated by comparing the model simulated data with the observed data typically over the indian ocean region ww3 simulated swh have 0 5m error with respect to jason 2 observations seemanth et al 2016 hence in the present study model error variance is taken as 0 25 m2 l can be estimated using the correlation scale of wave height variability several previous studies have used different values for l for example chen et al 2004 considered 2 99 after testing several values young and glowacki 1996 chosen l as 350 km greenslade 2001 considered three values 300 500 and 700 km and found that the lowest rmse in swh are obtained with the smallest correlation scale hence in the present study we have taken l 3 degrees observation errors are generally assumed to be spatially uncorrelated and thus this assumption reduces the observation error covariance r to a diagonal matrix with the variance along the diagonal since the same variance is assumed for all observation locations the observation error covariance matrix can be written as 8 r v i where v is the variance value for altimeter derived swh and i is an m by m identity matrix m is the number of observations in the present study we have used 0 0625 m2 as the variance value considering the error in altimeter measured swh to be 0 25m typically error in altimeter derived swh is of this order 0 25m when they are compared to buoy observations hector et al 2015 suchandra et al 2015b the interpolation operator h is an n by m matrix n is the number of model points h is generated by calculating the weights given to the model grid points when the model values are bi linearly interpolated onto the observation space since ww3 is a spectral wave model it is necessary to calculate an analysis wave spectrum f a n f θ where f is frequency and θ is direction from the analysis field of swh x a this is done by scaling the background model spectra f m f θ using the following equation esteva 1988 9 f a n f θ x a x b 2 f m f θ in this approach the total energy under the modified spectrum correspond to the observed swh whereas the shape of the spectrum remains unchanged the primary assumption here is that the model correctly predicts the distribution of energies between high frequency wind seas and low frequency swell waves this approach has certain limitations if the primary spectral change between assimilation location and forecast location is in the wind sea range this method will overpredict changes in swell and underpredict changes in higher frequency components leading to underprediction of changes in the mean wave period also if wave energy is added from a different direction this method will not capture the changes in the mean spectral direction 3 5 data assimilation wave forecasting system the ww3 version 4 18 tolman and the wavewatch iii development group 2014 set up at incois consists of four nested domains including global 10 10 resolution indian ocean 0 50 0 50 resolution northern indian ocean nio 0 250 0 250 resolution and coastal 0 10 0 10 resolution domains with two way interaction between them fig 1a for the grid generation the bathymetry is derived from etopo1 data and shoreline data is derived from global self consistent hierarchical high resolution gshhs database the output spectrum is discretized with 29 frequencies initial frequency of 0 035 hz with an increment factor of 1 1 and 36 directions with 100 increment input and dissipation source term is modeled using the st4 physics ardhuin et al 2010 non linear wave wave interaction is parameterized using the discrete interaction approximation of hasselmann et al 1985 and bottom friction is modeled using the joint north sea wave project jonswap parameterization hasselmann et al 1973 the operational model is run one time in a day at the 0000 utc model cycle and start with a 24 h analysis for the previous day using previous day s analysis winds to ensure the continuity of swell saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 observed swh from the near real time product is assimilated into this 24 h analysis cycle at every 6 h at each assimilation cycle altimeter observations within a 3 h temporal window centered at analysis hour are considered thus spatial and temporal distribution of the assimilated tracks varies widely over the domain typically 2 7 altimeter tracks are obtained for assimilation at each model time step updated model initial condition at the 24th hour of previous day 0000 utc of current day is used for initialising the next 5 days forecast also these restart files are stored for initialising the analysis cycle for the next day s forecast assimilation is performed in the indian ocean nio and coastal domains of the model the model provides 120 h 5 days forecasts and simulated wave parameters are stored at every 6 h the da scheme was tested for 2 months period april may 2018 in the indian ocean region for this a control run noda is also performed without assimilating any altimeter data forecasts from both sets of runs da and noda are validated with the indian ocean buoy observations available during this period we have considered wind speed ws and seven integral wave parameters for the comparison of model forecast with the offshore buoy observations those are significant wave height hs mean wave period tm peak period tp swell significant height hsa wind sea significant height hsb swell mean period tma and wind sea mean period tmb for the shallow water comparison two wave parameters hs and tp available from the coastal buoys are considered hs is defined as the average of one third of the highest waves observed over a certain span of time it is computed as 10 h s 4 m 0 where m 0 is the zeroth order moment of the spectrum the nth order moment m n of the spectrum is defined as 11 m n 0 f n e f d f where e f denotes the variance density at frequency f the definition of tm from the buoy is 12 t m m 0 m 2 tp is defined as the wave period associated with the most energetic waves in the total wave spectrum at a specific point it is worth mentioning that the sea state at any given point in time is a combination of two major categories of waves first is the local wind generated waves commonly referred as sea second is the waves generated from distant storm that propagate at the observational location without much attenuation called swells the wave height and period of the wind generated waves are referred in buoy observations as wind sea significant height and wind sea mean period respectively whereas that of the swells are swell significant height and swell mean period in order to validate hsa hsb tma and tmb with the buoy data one dimensional spectra obtained from the model are separated into low frequency swell 0 04 0 1 hz and high frequency wind sea 0 1 0 5 hz components here a threshold frequency criterion of 0 1 hz is chosen to keep it same as that used in the buoy measured wave spectrum then the wave parameters hsa hsb tma and tmb are derived from each part of the spectrum separately by using equations 10 and 12 statistical parameters such as root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and skill score are estimated for quantitative analysis skill score indicates the percentage improvement or deterioration of da runs with reference to the noda runs and is calculated as 13 s k i l l s c o r e 1 r m s e d a r m s e n o d a 100 4 results and discussion during april may 2018 wave observations from six moored buoys bd08 bd11 bd14 ad06 ad07 and ad09 were available in the nio region fig 1b fig 2 shows the graphical representation of model error statistics of wave heights computed for all the six buoys together we initially evaluated the impact of swh assimilation on forecasted wave heights the statistical values indicate that the assimilation of swh offers a better forecast it shows fig 2c an improvement of 15 in swh prediction during the initial 24 h and then it decreases to 8 in the following hours marginal improvement of 4 is seen after 78 h lead prediction the statistics of the partitioned wave heights clearly shows that the improvement in the swh has resulted from the improvement in swell forecast da significantly improves the swell forecast till 72 h 13 18 and then there is marginal improvement up to 117 h 6 12 swells have a longer memory of assimilation emmanouil et al 2007 as they are not affected by the local winds hence a correction in swells which originates in the southern latitudes due to assimilation of altimeter data translates to the nio region as these swells travel to the northern latitudes several studies have shown the impact of southern ocean swells on nio wave climate remya et al 2012 2016 sabique et al 2012 these researchers have noted that the southern ocean swell takes 4 5 days time to reach nio this could be the reason for the observed improvement in the swell forecast even up to 5 days in the nio region previous studies by greenslade 2001 and emmanouil et al 2007 also noticed that the impact of assimilation on swell forecast persists for the whole forecast period over swell dominated regions in the case of wind sea significant height improvement of 4 6 is seen up to 18 h and then it decreases drastically this clearly suggests that the impact of assimilation is trivial and does not stay longer in the wind sea part as it is majorly driven by local winds wave prediction is basically considered as a forcing problem rather than an initial value problem lefèvre and aouf 2012 and wave models are highly sensitive to the input wind forcing several earlier studies also confirmed this by showing a positive impact of assimilation till 24 48 h forecast lead time chen et al 2004 although the assimilated parameter is swh the model spectra is scaled using equation 9 here we evaluate the improvement in wave period forecast due to da little improvement is seen in mean wave period 5 9 during the first 5 days of forecast fig 3 a c statistics of partitioned wave period shows that the improvement in the mean wave period is due to the improvement in the swell wave period there is a significant improvement up to first 3 days 12 16 and thereafter little improvement is seen until 5th day 5 10 assimilation did not show much impact on the wind sea mean period fig 3g i on the contrary a slight degradation of forecast is noted till 72 h of forecast for tp assimilation shows a positive impact up to 11 till 78 h forecast after which no impact is seen fig 3j l the time series plots of wave heights and periods first day forecast shown in figs 4 7 supports the statistics given above two representative locations ad06 and bd08 have been considered each from as and bob for the first day forecast comparison figs 4 and 5 shows the comparison of forecasted wind speed and wave parameters at ad06 the observed wave heights are less than 4 m during the study period the time evolution of the forecasted wave heights is in good agreement with the observation and improvement in hs due to da is apparent in this time series comparison it is also clear that this improvement is mainly contributed by the swell waves fig 4a c the comparison of wave periods shows improvement in tp and tma due to da fig 5a d figs 6 and 7 show the comparison of forecasted wave parameters at bd08 mooring located in the northern bob here hs clearly shows improvement in the forecast due to da which was mainly due to the improvement in the swell the comparison of wave periods also shows improvement in tp and tma due to da table 1 provides the model error statistics of the first day forecast comparison at 6 offshore buoy locations eight wave rider buoys along the indian coast fig 1b and one buoy off the seychelles are used for evaluating the impact of da in coastal areas fig 8 shows the graphical representation of model error statistics for the comparison of swh and tp as function of forecast time forecasted swh shows moderate improvement 6 11 in the initial 36 h after which it reduces during pre monsoon season indian coastal regions experience the co existence of pre existing swells and local wind seas which are generated by sea breeze rashmi et al 2013 remya and kumar 2013 as discussed earlier lesser memory of wind sea could be the reason for minimal impact of assimilation after 36 h forecast as a result the improvement seen in the coastal locations was less as compared to that in the deep water buoy locations in case of tp there is little improvement up to 8 which might have resulted from the improvement in the swell table 2 provides the error statistics in the first day forecast at the individual wave rider buoy locations the improvement of hs is mainly seen in the swell dominated seychelles location with a skill score of 26 peak wave period shows marginal improvement at most of the locations due to da 4 1 a swell surge event case study we have seen the impact of assimilation on the swell forecast in the above sections and hence we carry out a detailed analysis of one swell surge event known locally as kallakkadal that happened during 21 24 april 2018 this case study is performed to find the impact of assimilation during swell events the kallakkadal is a term used by the fisherman in the state of kerala in southwest of india to refer to flash flooding events it is considered as one of the major forecast problems along the indian coasts and these are caused by high swell waves without any sign in the local winds sometimes leading to severe flooding recent research by remya et al 2016 specifically focused on this event and they established the link between nio high swell events and meteorological conditions in the southern ocean they have confirmed that long period swell waves 18 s seen during kallakkadal events are generated in the southern indian ocean by severe low pressure system occurring 3 5 days prior to the kallakkadal events the quasi stationary nature of the southern ocean low pressure systems provides strong 25 m s and long duration 3 days surface winds over a large fetch an essential condition for the generation of long period swells incois separately issues warning for such events when we analyzed this 21 24 april 2018 event the meteorological conditions over southern ocean clearly showed a cut off low on 16th april 2018 near 500 s 400 e south of africa approximately 9000 km away from the indian coast circled in fig 9 we followed the methodology of remya et al 2016 to identify the cut off low the system remained quasi stationary in the generation area for a duration of 36 h the long duration intense surface wind 26 m s associated with this system caused the swell propagation to the indian coastal region figs 9 and 10 these swells hit the southern tip of india on 21st april incois issued the warning two days prior to the events and hence the wave forecasts of 18th and 19th april were crucial in taking decisions hence we analyzed the impact of assimilation on the 18th and 19th wave forecast satellite tracks considered in the assimilation cycle for issuing the forecast of 18th and 19th april 2018 are shown in the left panel of fig 10 the middle panel shows the scalar field of swh at 00 utc of 18th and 19th april without any assimilation and the right panel shows the swh field obtained after da middle and right panel also provides an along track comparison of model simulations with altimeter swh which are assimilated at 00 utc through color legend overlay from the comparison it can be seen that the noda model overestimates the swh at the generation area one can clearly see the large mismatch between tracks and background swh field in noda while the mismatch is less in da runs the swell waves hit the seychelles on 19th april 14 utc and at this time 1 4 m wave height with a peak wave period of 22 s was observed in the incois wave rider buoy seychelles is the only place where we could get in situ observations in the southern ocean the comparison of wave spectra which holds complete information of wave fields at seychelles is shown in fig 11 for 18th and 19th april forecast on 18th april forecast improvement due to da was not significant and the model could not pick the observed peak energy density fig 11a however the maximum energy density was accurately reproduced by the da model on 19th april forecast and the improvement was significant in terms of correcting the maximum energy density fig 11b for further analysis we have chosen 06 utc of 20th april when the energy density is found maximum during the event figs 11c and d depict the comparison of one dimensional spectra valid for 20th april 06 utc the observed peak energy density 30 33 m2 hz during this time was not picked by both da and noda models initialised from 18th april maximum energy density forecasted by the model was only around 25 m2 hz however the da model showed correction of energy density in the frequency range 0 06 0 07 hz fig 11c 19th april forecast shows significant correction in the peak energy density because of da here da model produced a peak energy density of 29 6 m2 hz which was close to the observed value noda model clearly underpredicted the peak energy density with a magnitude of about 25 5 m2 hz fig 11d the correction of energy density in the frequency range 0 06 0 07 hz was noticed in the da model forecast for 19th april also from this analysis it once again proves that the da improves the lower frequency part of the spectrum i e the swell waves the swell waves reached the representative buoy locations in deep sea and coastal waters on 21st and 22nd april a comparison of forecasted swh and tp from da and noda models initialised from 19th april is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that almost at all the buoy locations swh and tp are better forecasted by the da model as against the noda forecasts 5 summary and conclusions in the present work a da algorithm based on the oi technique is implemented in the wave forecasting system at the indian operational center incois in order to improve the predictability of this wave forecasting system swh data from saral altika jason 2 and jason 3 were used for the assimilation comparison of the model simulations with the in situ buoy observations showed clear improvement in the forecast after assimilating altimeter data swh prediction for the deep water locations showed an improvement of 15 in the initial 24 h in the case of mean wave period an improvement of 5 9 was observed during the first 5 days forecast for peak wave period assimilation showed a positive impact up to 11 till 78 h forecast after which no impact was seen at shallow water locations an improvement of 6 11 was noted in the forecasted swh during the initial 36 h and peak wave period forecast showed an improvement up to 8 the improvement is much more significant in the case of swell forecast throughout the forecast period after the implementation of da the swell significant height forecast improved by 13 18 in the initial 72 h and then 6 12 up to 117 h forecast similarly considerable improvement is attained in the swell wave period forecast 12 16 up to 3 days these results are further supported by a case study of a swell surge event kallakkadal and found that the altimeter da improved the predictability of such events da has minimal impact in the wind sea forecast as it is primarily driven by an uncorrected wind field which can have large errors the swells on the other hand have a longer memory of assimilation as they are not affected by the local winds this study proves that in a situation of coexisting wind sea and swell systems the da can improve the ability of the model to represent the spectrum it can thus be concluded that the da scheme implemented in the incois operational wave forecasting system using remotely sensed data is effective in improving the regional wave forecast as a further step wave spectra assimilation from synthetic aperture radar sar is planned with an advanced scheme of assimilation the evaluation of the impact of da will be then assessed during various seasons and also for the tropical cyclone condition the present da wave forecasting system is operational at incois and the forecasted wave parameters are being disseminated through incois web portal https www incois gov in portal osf osfglobal jsp region global area indianocean param swh and various other

20308,improving the quality of maintenance decision making under uncertainty is important for safety reliability and cost management of marine assets it is worth studying how condition inspections can be objective oriented and inspection information be fully utilized in the maintenance decision making process herein a new maintenance decision analytic modelling approach assisted by value of information voi computation is proposed and applied to a safety critical marine structure three maintenance decision making cases and three inspection strategies are tested below advantages of the proposed approach represent contribution to the current literature the approach can yield optimal maintenance decisions in various decision making cases while condition based maintenance cbm is efficient only in the cases where inspections add value the approach yields maintenance decisions associated with the same or lower life cycle costs lcc than decision rule based approaches e g cbm and gives more improved decisions associated with lower lcc with more in depth inspections the advantages are benefited from voi computation decision analytic modelling and probabilistic modelling of uncertainty crack growth and inspection outcomes maintenance decisions are derived based on integrated crack information via bayesian updating rather than only on inspection results the approach can be used to optimize inspection and maintenance strategies for structural assets keywords structural integrity management imperfect inspection maintenance optimization probabilistic approach monte carlo simulation bayesian decision analysis 1 introduction marine structures and installations are exposed to cyclic and sustained wave loading which cause damage accumulation structural degradation and failure events condition inspections and maintenance are typical asset integrity management and risk management measures with rapid development of sensing and monitoring technology cbm policy or strategy has been studied extensively and applied to a variety of engineering and industry sectors arunraj and maiti 2010 besnard and bertling 2010 niu et al 2010 tan et al 2011 verbert et al 2017 zou et al 2019a condition inspections by e g visual inspections or magnetic particle inspections mpi or continuous monitoring represent important means to examine structural conditions identify cracks validate structural integrity and thus ensure safe operation of assets following inspections repair or replacement activities may then be assigned to recover structural integrity and performance before cracks reach the extent that would lead to unaffordable failures also inspection data can be used to validate existing design codes to identify potential conservatism in codes and to improve design codes besides human errors in the design and manufacture process can potentially be found by operational inspections frangopol and soliman 2016 moan 2011 however inspection and maintenance activities are costly for large engineering structures with a substantial number of crack prone components e g ship structures offshore floating production storage and offloading vessels offshore wind farms etc in these structures cracks are common and can develop at any stage of the asset life cycle direct and indirect costs associated with inspections and repairs can account for a significant part of lcc due to a large number of components and areas involved limited inspection accessibility and huge economic loss during downtime shafiee et al 2015 therefore developing an efficient inspection and maintenance strategy is decisive for structural safety reliability and costs planning and optimizing inspection and maintenance activities in advance can potentially save a large amount of engineering costs without compromising structural safety and reliability optimal crack maintenance planning under uncertainty is often formulated as an optimization problem by integration of probabilistic modelling of fatigue crack growth uncertainty inspection maintenance and life cycle costs dong and frangopol 2016 lassen and recho 2015 soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2017 inspection planning without taking maintenance into account has been tackled by some researchers and probabilistic frameworks have been proposed in which the optimal inspection timings are defined as the timings when structural reliability index is lower than a threshold value or failure probability rate is higher than a threshold value kim and frangopol 2011 lotsberg et al 2016 on the other hand many researchers focus on maintenance modelling and optimization with an objective to minimize expected lcc soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2019b optimization problems are typically formulated based on a predefined maintenance policy or a predefined maintenance decision rule or criterion cbm is one of the most extensively studied maintenance policies in which crack inspection or monitoring is carried out and repairs are performed when crack sizes exceed thresholds alaswad and xiang 2017 do et al 2015 lu et al 2018 in time based maintenance tbm maintenance activities are carried at pre defined timings or service lives of a structure without adopting condition inspection or monitoring although the maintenance criteria of the forementioned maintenance policies differ optimization of the maintenance policy can only be performed based on a pre defined maintenance criterion in cbm the criterion s is judged based on addition information provided by inspection or monitoring assuming that additional information adds value to maintenance decision making however additional information may not lead to a change in the optimal maintenance decision if the optimal decisions with and without availability of additional information are the same then this is no value in obtaining the additional information whether inspection or monitoring information add value or not is unknown at the time of selecting a specific type of maintenance policy or defining a decision rule hence decision rule based maintenance optimization methods are reasonable only in limited maintenance decision cases that is to say a tbm policy can be the optimal one in the maintenance decision cases where additional information doesn t add value while a cbm or pm policy can be the optimal one in the decision cases where additional information adds value a maintenance modelling and optimization approach that is applicable to both maintenance decision cases where additional information adds value and does not add value is thus desirable although in recent years some mathematical approaches have been proposed to compute the expected information value from future structural inspection or monitoring iannacone et al 2021 kamariotis et al 2021 long et al 2020 malings and pozzi 2018 zou et al 2019a zou et al 2021a it is still worthy addressing a critical research question that is how maintenance decision making can be improved by more advanced inspections and information value computation in different decision making contexts this paper proposes an approach which bridges the forementioned research gap via integrated decision and information value modelling optimal maintenance decisions are derived via systematic decision analytic modelling and integration of crack growth predictions based on a probabilistic fracture mechanics model with crack inspection data which is one of main advantages of the proposed approach and contribution to the current literature the proposed approach has been a tested under different inspection strategies and different cost inputs which define maintenance decision making contexts and b compared with decision rule based probabilistic maintenance optimization approaches in terms of expected lcc associated with obtained maintenance decisions it is shown that the maintenance decisions derived by the proposed approach are associated with lower lcc than decision rule based approaches in both maintenance decision cases where additional inspection information adds value and does not add value in comparison in the cases where some of inspections do not add value decision rule based approaches e g cbm strategy which rely solely on inspection data to make maintenance decisions may lead to maintenance decisions associated with higher lcc moreover it is clearly shown that benefiting from information integration and fully information utilization the expected lcc associated with the optimal decision obtained by the proposed approach becomes lower and lower with more in depth inspections which is another major advantage of the proposed approach and contribution to the literature the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes a typical marine structural system exposed to fatigue loading caused by waves section 3 establishes a probabilistic crack growth model which gives initial crack growth information and the basis for maintenance decision making section 4 discusses lifetime maintenance planning for the structural system the inspection strategies under investigation and maintenance decision rules section 5 formulates the proposed maintenance decision analytic modelling and voi computation approach section 6 provides results by the approach i e the optimal maintenance decisions and voi by three different inspection strategies and in three different maintenance decision contexts or cases discussions are presented on the advantages of the proposed approach compared with detection or condition based maintenance optimization section 7 provides conclusions drawn from this study 2 structural model herein we examine a safety critical marine structural model i e a fatigue prone welded stiffened plate of a marine platform fig 1 exposed to cyclic and repetitive fatigue loading caused by waves typically frames are adopted to improve the stability of the plate however fatigue performance of the stiffened plate is reduced due to poor welding qualities and initial flaws in materials a crack is likely to initiate and propagate along the weld toe of the joint as shown by fig 1 if the crack is not maintained timely crack growth would cause leaking and rupture of the structural system such structural failure would result in significant loss of money and people s lives as well as damages to the environment and platform owner s reputation moan 2018 fatigue reliability of the welded joint is a problem that needs to be properly addressed and managed in the whole life cycle of the marine platform the required service life of the platform is t s l 20 years the frequency of wave loading is about 0 16 hz lotsberg et al 2016 and thus the number of annual fatigue load cycles is approximately n 0 5 10 6 at the design stage fatigue limit state has been checked via structural design codes the fatigue resistance is of this type of the welded joint falls into f class and a representative s n curve is given by a classification society dnv 2014 a fatigue design factor fdf of 3 has been adopted and the maximum allowable equivalent stress range is 21 03 mpa the plate thickness is t 25 mm the design parameters are summarized in table 1 in which a 1 and a 2 are fatigue strength coefficients and m 1 and m 2 are fatigue strength exponents of the s n curve 3 probabilistic crack growth according to fracture mechanics fatigue deterioration occurs due to presence of initial flaws or cracks the initial size a 0 initial cracks propagate along the front of local stress concentration field to a critical size a c which defines final failure fig 2 the critical crack size is often defined based on serviceability analysis herein the stiffened plate in fig 1 would not keep watertight if a through thickness crack develops so the critical crack size a c is set to be equal to the plate thickness i e a c t the crack propagation life n p is not sensitive to the value of a c because the final fracture usually occurs very quickly as illustrated by fig 2 the relationship between crack growth rate and local stress range is given by equation 1 according to the one dimensional paris law paris and erdogan 1963 1 d a d n c δ k m δ k t h δ k k m a t where a is crack size in the depth direction n is the number of fatigue load cycles d a d n is crack propagation rate c and m are material parameters δ k is stress intensity factor range k m a t is material fracture toughness δ k t h is a threshold value of δ k the stress intensity factor range δ k is given by equation 2 the values of the input parameters are listed in table 1 2 δ k δ σ y a π a where y a is geometry function and δ σ is stress range crack propagation essentially is a stochastic process in this study main sources of uncertainty associated with the paris model equation 1 are taken into account explicitly i e uncertainty in measuring or calculating the initial crack size a 0 crack growth rate c and stress range δ σ doshi and vhanmane 2013 lotsberg et al 2016 the equivalent initial crack size a 0 is exponentially distributed and the mean value e a 0 0 04 lotsberg et al 2016 according to the reference the equivalent initial crack size is a virtual size which is calibrated to the s n curve so that the crack initiation life is included in the crack growth prediction with the paris model uncertainty associated with calculation of stress range δ σ originates from wave load characterization method structural response stress concentration factor calculation methods the effects of welding notch etc herein the uncertainty associated with calculation of δ σ is modelled by a normally distributed variable b the statistical descriptors for b are the mean value e b 1 and the standard deviation sd μ b 0 15 lassen and recho 2015 the crack growth rate c is often regarded as a material property although it is also dependent on other factors for marine structures the crack growth rate c is usually adopted to be lognormally distributed lotsberg et al 2016 and m 3 the probabilistic models and statistical descriptors of all random variables are summarized in table 2 one dimensional probabilistic crack growth models have been widely adopted in the literature on maintenance modelling and optimization kim et al 2013 soliman et al 2016 the selection of a crack growth model depends on the aim of study and the available input data a more sophisticated model can take more crack growth physical details into account but generally requires more input data and is more difficult to characterize model uncertainty in addition a more sophisticated model typically requires more computational efforts to obtain crack growth predictions when such a model is integrated into a probabilistic modelling optimization framework it would be computationally difficult to solve the optimization problem to obtain an optimal maintenance decision or strategy the paris model probabilistic models in table 2 and resultant crack propagation predictions represent existing information available to a decision maker dm while making maintenance decisions which is also called prior information faber 2012 the dm can also collect additional information e g by crack inspections or measurements in this study the prior crack information is integrated with additional crack inspection information via bayesian updating and the eventual maintenance decision is derived based on integrated crack information which is called posterior information faber 2012 decision rule based approaches by which maintenance decisions are directly linked to inspection results e g detection or condition based maintenance strategies may give suboptimal decisions which is demonstrated by the results and discussions in section 6 4 life cycle maintenance interventions the actual fatigue life of the structural system may be shorter than predicted at the structural design stage by the s n approach due to presence of initial cracks and various sources of uncertainty first of all s n curves are normally established based on specimens with smaller initial flaws while initial cracks in actual structures are often bigger also the fatigue loading condition and history at the operation stage can be different from envisaged at the structural design stage in addition there may be human errors in the structural design and manufacture process therefore it is crucial to develop and implement an efficient inspection and maintenance strategy at the operation stage to ensure structural integrity and safety in this study section 5 we develop a maintenance decision analytic modelling and information value computational approach herein the developed approach is applied to optimization of two scheduled maintenance interventions n 2 the maintenance interventions would be carried out at an equal time interval δ t 7 years that is to say the intervention timings are t 1 7 years and t 2 14 years respectively after the beginning of service before each intervention an inspection may be adopted or not in this study whether to adopt an inspection is not pre defined but determined by the proposed approach based on rational information value computation at each intervention time the available maintenance decision alternatives are no action and repair r if an inspection is adopted before an intervention a maintenance decision is not directly dependent on the inspection result but is derived based on decision analytic modelling and optimization results it is assumed that after a repair the structural system is renewed to its initial state garbatov and soares 2001 huynh et al 2017 zitrou et al 2013 zou et al 2019b by this renewal model the behaviour of maintained structure can be simulated by the probabilistic crack growth model in section 3 and a small failure probability of maintained structure in its remaining service life can be taken into account the information value brought by three different inspection strategies listed in table 3 are studied in inspection strategy 1 is1 crack detection is carried out at both interventions while in inspection strategy 3 is3 crack measurement is performed if the inspection result is detection at both interventions it is clear that more information is provided by is3 than is1 in inspection strategy 2 is2 crack detection is carried out at both interventions while crack measurement is performed only at the 2nd intervention if the inspection result is detection the information provided by is2 is more than is1 but less than is3 inspection uncertainty is taken into account via the probability of detection pod function given by equation 3 dong and frangopol 2016 madsen et al 1991 the equation is established based on experimental test data by the equation the detection probability of a crack with a depth a can be calculated due to uncertainty the detectable crack size a d of a non destructive testing method is modelled as a variable by using equation 3 the detectable crack size a d follows an exponential distribution in this study magnetic particle inspection mpi is used for crack inspection and the mean value of a d is 0 89 mm dong and frangopol 2016 other inspection methods can also be employed e g visual inspection as long as the mean value of a d is provided 3 p o d a f a 1 exp a e a d where e a d is the mean detectable crack size of an inspection method detection based maintenance d and condition based maintenance c are widely adopted maintenance decision rules when inspection strategies 1 and 3 are employed respectively kim et al 2013 soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2019a zou et al 2019b details of the decision rules are provided in table 4 5 maintenance decision analytic modelling a limit state function is given by equation 4 where h t 0 signifies failure as mentioned in section 3 the limit state function is established based on serviceability analysis and a c t 4 h t a c a t based on the limit state function the probability of failure by time t is can be calculated by equation 5 note that lifetime failure probability is p f t s l structural reliability index is calculated by equation 6 where φ 1 is the inverse function of standard normal cumulative density function the failure probability and reliability index can be obtained by advanced structural reliability methods such as monte carlo simulations ditlevsen and madsen 1996 5 p f t p h t 0 6 β t φ 1 1 p f t the expected life cycle costs associated with a specific maintenance decision is established via decision tree analysis soliman et al 2016 zou gonzález et al 2019b for example fig 3 illustrates decision tree analysis of two maintenance interventions scheduled to the time t 1 and t 2 at both interventions inspection strategy 1 see table 1 is adopted in fig 3 f d and r mean the event of failure detection and repair respectively while f and d mean survival and no detection in fig 3 at both interventions the decision is r if the inspection result is d and no action if the inspection result is d this is a maintenance strategy directly relying on an inspection i e detection based maintenance table 4 note that there are other decision alternatives for example the decision can also be 1 r no matter what the inspection result is or 2 no action no matter what the inspection result is these two decision alternatives are also feasible if the information provide by an inspection result is not strong enough to lead to a decision change as mentioned in sections 1 and 3 more information doesn t necessarily lead to an improved decision and the value of information provided by an inspection is unknown unless explicitly calculated decision tree analysis can be done for other maintenance decision alternatives in a similar manner by decision tree analysis the probability of failure is calculated by summation of the probability of failure associated with each failure branch in the decision tree in this study structural maintenance at the operation stage of the asset is addressed thus design and construction costs are fixed and not included in the lcc calculation the lcc given by equation 7 is comprised of expected costs of inspections repairs and failures calculated by equation 8 10 the expected costs of failure c f represents failure risk in terms of economic loss given by the cost consequence of failure c f 0 multiplied by the probability of failure p f n 7 l c c c i c r c f 8 c f p f n c f 0 9 c i k 1 n p i k c i 0 1 1 r t k 10 c r k 1 n p r k c r 0 1 1 r t k where p f n is the probability of failure taking into account the effect of n maintenance interventions n is pre defined c f 0 is cost consequence of failure p i k and p r k are the probability of inspection and repair at the kth maintenance intervention t k is the time of the kth maintenance intervention c i 0 and c r 0 are costs associated with an inspection and a repair activity respectively and r is the average annual discount rate 5 1 prior decision modelling and optimization a given the probabilistic models of input random parameters a 0 c b the distribution of crack size a t at time t

updated distribution of crack size a i t is simulated i e posterior information via bayesian theorem and accordingly the addition information is integrated with prior information e g the prior distribution of a t b then posterior decision modelling and optimization is conducted based on the updated a i t the posterior optimal decision and posterior minimum lcc are obtained by equations 13

determined by the posterior crack size distribution a i t and expected life cycle costs l c c d a i t associated with each decision alternative d c the value of the information i which is called

when assessing the efficiency of an inspection strategy e g any of the inspection strategies in table 3 two inspections are planed but not implemented so the set of two inspection results i e the additional information i is unknown and thus is treated as a random variable the distribution of i is obtained based on the prior distribution of a t and the crack detection reliability of the adopted inspection method which is characterized by the variable a d the value of information provided by an inspection strategy is calculated as the expectation value of v o i i with respect to the random variable i according to equation 16 it is clear that when different inspection strategies in table 3 are adopted the voi is different 16 v o i e i v o i i when different inspection strategies are adopted the number of possible inspection results is different accordingly the number of possible maintenance decision or strategy alternatives in posterior decision analytic modelling is different when inspection strategy 1 is adopted the available decision alternatives for one intervention are no action detection based maintenance d repair r and the number of decision alternatives for two interventions is 3 2 9 when inspection strategy 3 is adopted the decision alternatives for one intervention are no action condition based maintenance c detection based maintenance d repair r and the number of decision alternatives for two interventions is 4 2 16 when inspection strategy 2 is adopted the decision alternatives for the 1st intervention are no action detection based maintenance d repair r and the decision alternatives for the 2nd intervention are no action condition based maintenance c detection based maintenance d repair r the number of decision alternatives for two interventions is 3 4 12 the prior and posterior optimal maintenance decisions are derived based on the prior and posterior minimum life cycle costs respectively hence both the prior and posterior optimal maintenance decisions depend heavily on the input cost parameters c f 0 c r 0 c i 0 which characterize the maintenance decision context in this study sensitivity to the input cost parameters is given by investigating the impacts of three different decision contexts the baseline case the high maintenance cost case and the high failure cost case in the baseline case c i 0 1 c r 0 c i 0 10 c f 0 c i 0 100 zou et al 2021b in the high maintenance cost case the costs of a repair are increased to c r 0 c i 0 40 in the high failure cost case the costs of failure are much higher and c f 0 c i 0 10000 in summary the proposed method comprises of 5 steps as follows a simulate crack growth by monte carlo simulations based on the probabilistic fracture model and obtain the distribution of crack depth with time a t b calculate the initial i e without any maintenance plan lifetime failure probability p f t s l c simulate the events of crack detection and no detection based on the distributions of a t 1 a t 2 a d and obtain the probabilities of detection d and no detection d at the scheduled inspection times t 1 t 2 d based on decision tree analysis calculate the expectation values of lcc associated with different maintenance decision alternatives and the voi under different inspection strategies e derive the optimal maintenance decision and inspection strategy based on the minimum lcc and the maximum voi respectively the above described study contributes to the current literature with a rational maintenance decision analytic modelling approach which is widely applicable to a variety of maintenance decision making problems benefiting from direct modelling of all feasible decision alternatives without introducing any decision rule three typical maintenance decision cases are identified to show the wide applicability and advantages of the proposed approach compared with the current decision rule based approach moreover the proposed approach yields optimal maintenance decisions on the basis of rational information value computation and is able to make full use of information three inspection strategies are identified to show that the proposed approach is able to yield more improved maintenance decisions with more in depth inspections 6 results and discussions the proposed approach in section 5 is illustrated on the structural model in section 2 in comparison with decision rule based maintenance optimization approaches i e detection based d and condition based c maintenance optimization approaches kim et al 2013 soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2019a b generally it is shown that under some maintenance decision contexts i e cost structure the information value provided by is1 is equal to zero and d may be a suboptimal decision or strategy which is associated with higher life cycle costs than the optimal decision derived by the proposed approach similarly under some maintenance decision contexts the information value provided by is3 is equal to zero and c may be a suboptimal decision or strategy which is associated with higher life cycle costs than the optimal decision derived by the proposed approach it is also found that under some maintenance decision contexts the information value provided by is3 can be equal to is1 although is3 represents more in depth inspections table 5 7 summarize the obtained results for three maintenance decision contexts cases respectively i e high maintenance cost case baseline case and high failure cost case in each table the results by the proposed and decision rule based approaches are provided adopting three inspection strategies respectively the results are obtained based on monte carlo simulations with 5 10 6 samples for each random variables in the three tables the lcc and voi are given as their expectation values and the unit is the costs of one inspection the voi is obtained by the proposed approach i e by equation 16 for comparison purpose the voi by the decision rule based approach is provided which is defined as the life cycle costs by the decision rule based approach minus the prior min lcc in the tables the optimal maintenance threshold its unit is mm is applicable only when the obtained optimal decision is c in the tables when is2 is adopted the listed optimal threshold is for the 2nd maintenance intervention because a crack size measurement is involved only at the 2nd intervention see table 3 fig 4 shows the voi provided by 3 inspection strategies in 3 maintenance decision cases fig 5 7 compare the minimum life cycle costs obtained by the proposed and decision rules based approaches in 3 maintenance decision cases respectively fig 4 generally shows that voi is3 voi is2 voi is1 i e the voi by more in depth inspections is generally higher the only exception is that in the high failure cost case voi is3 voi is2 which indicates that crack size measurement at the 1st intervention in is3 is valueless this is reasonable because when the costs of failure are very high more intense maintenance is desirable especially at the time of the 1st intervention when the remaining service life is still very long i e 14 years as can be found in table 7 the optimal decision at the 1st intervention is d detection based maintenance which represents more intense maintenance than c condition based maintenance and thus a crack size measurement at the 1st intervention is unnecessary figs 5 7 show that the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower or equal to the decision rule based approach which show one of advantages of the proposed approach and contribution to the current literature when is1 or is2 is adopted and part of crack detections measurements if any at both interventions do not add value the minimum life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower for example in fig 5 and table 5 when is1 is adopted the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are much lower and the obtained optimal decision is d which indicates that crack detection activity at the 2nd intervention is valueless when is2 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are also lower and the obtained optimal decision is c which means that crack detection activity at the 1st intervention is valueless in fig 6 and table 6 when is1 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower and the obtained optimal decision is d which indicates that crack detection activity at the 2nd intervention is valueless by the decision rule based approach maintenance decisions depend directly and solely on inspection results so when part of the inspection activities do not add value the approach can lead to higher life cycle costs than the proposed approach even higher than prior minimum life cycle costs without involving inspections see table 5 when is1 is adopted the proposed approach however yields optimal maintenance decisions based on rational decision analytic modelling integrating both prior crack prediction results and inspection results when all crack detections measurements if any at both interventions add value the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same for example in fig 6 and table 6 when is2 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same the optimal decisions obtained by the two approaches are also the same i e d c which indicates that both the crack detection at the 1st intervention and the crack detection measurement at the 2nd intervention add value in fig 7 and table 7 when is1 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same and the optimal decisions are also the same i e d d when is2 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same and the optimal decisions are also the same i e d c when is3 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower than the decision rule based approach in all cases high maintenance cost case fig 5 baseline case fig 6 and high failure cost case fig 7 by the decision rule based approach the same threshold is adopted at both interventions which restricts full utilization of the voi and leads to higher life cycle costs the reason is that inspection results obtained at different timings have different implications on the lifetime failure probability and lcc and the failure risks of a component repaired at different timings in its remaining service life are also different thus maintenance threshold values at different timings should be different as evidenced by table 5 7 the optimal maintenance thresholds for the two interventions are different and the optimal threshold for the 1st intervention is smaller than the 2nd intervention figs 5 7 demonstrate that the minimum life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach generally becomes lower with more in depth inspections from inspection strategy 1 to 2 to 3 which show another major advantage of the proposed approach and contribution to the current literature this also proves that the proposed approach can fully utilize the information provided by inspection strategies if the information adds value to maintenance decision making on the contrary figs 6 and 7 show that the life cycle costs obtained by the decision rule based approach can get higher with more in depth inspections from inspection strategy 2 to 3 which indicates that the approach doesn t make full use of the information provided by different inspection strategies table 5 7 shows that the optimal maintenance thresholds obtained by both approaches are the biggest in the high maintenance cost case and the smallest in the high failure cost case this is reasonable because when the costs of maintenance are high less maintenance should be performed and adopting a big maintenance threshold reduces the probability of maintenance when the costs of failure are high more intense maintenance is desirable and adopting a small maintenance threshold increases the probability of maintenance in summary the proposed approach can result in optimal maintenance decision associate with the minimum life cycle costs reliably whether inspections add value or not benefiting from utilization of both crack prediction results and inspection results when two inspections are planned it is do found that the voi from one of the inspections or part of the inspection activities e g crack size measurement can be equal to zero and c condition based maintenance is not the optimal decision the decision rule based approach can lead to higher life cycle costs when part of inspection activities does not add value in addition the decision rule based approach adopts the same thresholds at both interventions which restricts full utilization of information value 7 conclusions marine structures and installations are important engineering assets that support human activities on seas nevertheless structural deterioration e g crack initiation and growth is an inevitable problem for marine assets exposed to repetitive fatigue loads caused by waves welded joints represent the weakest areas in terms of structural integrity timely maintenance of fatigue cracks in welded joints is thus crucial for ensuring structural integrity restoring structural reliability and mitigating failure risk optimal maintenance planning however is often challenging on one hand maintenance costs of marine structures are typically very high due to poor accessibility and high downtime costs on the other hand it is difficult to predict crack initiation and growth accurately because both fatigue loading and fatigue resistance are subjected to high levels of uncertainty thus improving the quality of maintenance decision making under uncertainty is of great significance to safety reliability and costs of marine assets maintenance planning is often formulated as an optimization problem based on some pre defined decision rules e g detection or condition based maintenance strategies according to these decision rules maintenance decisions depend directly and solely on inspection or monitoring results however it should be stressed that inspection information is often imperfect and not always reliable due to uncertainties associated with inspection activities in addition it incurs additional costs to carry out inspections furthermore additional inspection information may not lead to a change in maintenance decisions and not add value thus such decision rule based approaches are reasonable only in maintenance decision making cases where inspections add value it is however not known whether inspection information adds value or not unless information value is explicitly quantified in this paper a systematic maintenance decision analytic modelling and information value computational approach has been developed in support of reliable and optimal maintenance decision making under uncertainty it has been proved that the approach can reliably yield optimal maintenance decisions in both decision making cases where inspections add value and do not add value the information value provided by inspections is computed explicitly it has been shown that the approach results in maintenance decisions associated with lower life cycle costs than decision rule based approaches benefitting from integration of prior crack prediction information with additional inspection information and fully information utilization in the decision making process moreover it has also been proved that the approach yields more improved decisions associated with lower life cycle costs with more in depth inspections the strengths of the proposed approach are attributed to decision analytic modelling information integration and explicit information value computation the proposed approach incorporates many considerations which are essential for maintenance decision making such as uncertainty failure probability failure risk life cycle costs and information value probabilistic modelling of uncertainty crack growth and inspection outcomes is carried out then the add value by inspections is quantified on the basis of direct maintenance decision analytic modelling integrated crack information is obtained by updating prior crack predictions with inspection data the optimal maintenance decision is derived rationally by rating the expected life cycle costs associated with all decision alternatives which are assessed based on integrated crack information hence the optimal maintenance decision is obtained based on integrated crack information rather than only on crack inspection results the proposed approach enables maintenance policy makers to address maintenance decision making problems under uncertainty in a more rational systematic and efficient way and can be used at the maintenance planning stage the obtained optimal maintenance decisions may be different when the values of input parameters are different e g parameters related to crack growth modelling inspection method and cost ratios however the proposed probabilistic approach provides a framework to derive the optimal decision rationally when relevant input parameters are given in the near future we will refine the approach so that more maintenance decision variables can be derived via the approach for example when a large number of hot spot areas are considered the number of hot spots to be inspected would be a decision variable that needs to be optimised this can be achieved by modelling multiple hot spot areas as a multi component system and then formulate the decision optimization problem based on the methodology proposed in this paper credit authorship contribution

20308,improving the quality of maintenance decision making under uncertainty is important for safety reliability and cost management of marine assets it is worth studying how condition inspections can be objective oriented and inspection information be fully utilized in the maintenance decision making process herein a new maintenance decision analytic modelling approach assisted by value of information voi computation is proposed and applied to a safety critical marine structure three maintenance decision making cases and three inspection strategies are tested below advantages of the proposed approach represent contribution to the current literature the approach can yield optimal maintenance decisions in various decision making cases while condition based maintenance cbm is efficient only in the cases where inspections add value the approach yields maintenance decisions associated with the same or lower life cycle costs lcc than decision rule based approaches e g cbm and gives more improved decisions associated with lower lcc with more in depth inspections the advantages are benefited from voi computation decision analytic modelling and probabilistic modelling of uncertainty crack growth and inspection outcomes maintenance decisions are derived based on integrated crack information via bayesian updating rather than only on inspection results the approach can be used to optimize inspection and maintenance strategies for structural assets keywords structural integrity management imperfect inspection maintenance optimization probabilistic approach monte carlo simulation bayesian decision analysis 1 introduction marine structures and installations are exposed to cyclic and sustained wave loading which cause damage accumulation structural degradation and failure events condition inspections and maintenance are typical asset integrity management and risk management measures with rapid development of sensing and monitoring technology cbm policy or strategy has been studied extensively and applied to a variety of engineering and industry sectors arunraj and maiti 2010 besnard and bertling 2010 niu et al 2010 tan et al 2011 verbert et al 2017 zou et al 2019a condition inspections by e g visual inspections or magnetic particle inspections mpi or continuous monitoring represent important means to examine structural conditions identify cracks validate structural integrity and thus ensure safe operation of assets following inspections repair or replacement activities may then be assigned to recover structural integrity and performance before cracks reach the extent that would lead to unaffordable failures also inspection data can be used to validate existing design codes to identify potential conservatism in codes and to improve design codes besides human errors in the design and manufacture process can potentially be found by operational inspections frangopol and soliman 2016 moan 2011 however inspection and maintenance activities are costly for large engineering structures with a substantial number of crack prone components e g ship structures offshore floating production storage and offloading vessels offshore wind farms etc in these structures cracks are common and can develop at any stage of the asset life cycle direct and indirect costs associated with inspections and repairs can account for a significant part of lcc due to a large number of components and areas involved limited inspection accessibility and huge economic loss during downtime shafiee et al 2015 therefore developing an efficient inspection and maintenance strategy is decisive for structural safety reliability and costs planning and optimizing inspection and maintenance activities in advance can potentially save a large amount of engineering costs without compromising structural safety and reliability optimal crack maintenance planning under uncertainty is often formulated as an optimization problem by integration of probabilistic modelling of fatigue crack growth uncertainty inspection maintenance and life cycle costs dong and frangopol 2016 lassen and recho 2015 soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2017 inspection planning without taking maintenance into account has been tackled by some researchers and probabilistic frameworks have been proposed in which the optimal inspection timings are defined as the timings when structural reliability index is lower than a threshold value or failure probability rate is higher than a threshold value kim and frangopol 2011 lotsberg et al 2016 on the other hand many researchers focus on maintenance modelling and optimization with an objective to minimize expected lcc soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2019b optimization problems are typically formulated based on a predefined maintenance policy or a predefined maintenance decision rule or criterion cbm is one of the most extensively studied maintenance policies in which crack inspection or monitoring is carried out and repairs are performed when crack sizes exceed thresholds alaswad and xiang 2017 do et al 2015 lu et al 2018 in time based maintenance tbm maintenance activities are carried at pre defined timings or service lives of a structure without adopting condition inspection or monitoring although the maintenance criteria of the forementioned maintenance policies differ optimization of the maintenance policy can only be performed based on a pre defined maintenance criterion in cbm the criterion s is judged based on addition information provided by inspection or monitoring assuming that additional information adds value to maintenance decision making however additional information may not lead to a change in the optimal maintenance decision if the optimal decisions with and without availability of additional information are the same then this is no value in obtaining the additional information whether inspection or monitoring information add value or not is unknown at the time of selecting a specific type of maintenance policy or defining a decision rule hence decision rule based maintenance optimization methods are reasonable only in limited maintenance decision cases that is to say a tbm policy can be the optimal one in the maintenance decision cases where additional information doesn t add value while a cbm or pm policy can be the optimal one in the decision cases where additional information adds value a maintenance modelling and optimization approach that is applicable to both maintenance decision cases where additional information adds value and does not add value is thus desirable although in recent years some mathematical approaches have been proposed to compute the expected information value from future structural inspection or monitoring iannacone et al 2021 kamariotis et al 2021 long et al 2020 malings and pozzi 2018 zou et al 2019a zou et al 2021a it is still worthy addressing a critical research question that is how maintenance decision making can be improved by more advanced inspections and information value computation in different decision making contexts this paper proposes an approach which bridges the forementioned research gap via integrated decision and information value modelling optimal maintenance decisions are derived via systematic decision analytic modelling and integration of crack growth predictions based on a probabilistic fracture mechanics model with crack inspection data which is one of main advantages of the proposed approach and contribution to the current literature the proposed approach has been a tested under different inspection strategies and different cost inputs which define maintenance decision making contexts and b compared with decision rule based probabilistic maintenance optimization approaches in terms of expected lcc associated with obtained maintenance decisions it is shown that the maintenance decisions derived by the proposed approach are associated with lower lcc than decision rule based approaches in both maintenance decision cases where additional inspection information adds value and does not add value in comparison in the cases where some of inspections do not add value decision rule based approaches e g cbm strategy which rely solely on inspection data to make maintenance decisions may lead to maintenance decisions associated with higher lcc moreover it is clearly shown that benefiting from information integration and fully information utilization the expected lcc associated with the optimal decision obtained by the proposed approach becomes lower and lower with more in depth inspections which is another major advantage of the proposed approach and contribution to the literature the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes a typical marine structural system exposed to fatigue loading caused by waves section 3 establishes a probabilistic crack growth model which gives initial crack growth information and the basis for maintenance decision making section 4 discusses lifetime maintenance planning for the structural system the inspection strategies under investigation and maintenance decision rules section 5 formulates the proposed maintenance decision analytic modelling and voi computation approach section 6 provides results by the approach i e the optimal maintenance decisions and voi by three different inspection strategies and in three different maintenance decision contexts or cases discussions are presented on the advantages of the proposed approach compared with detection or condition based maintenance optimization section 7 provides conclusions drawn from this study 2 structural model herein we examine a safety critical marine structural model i e a fatigue prone welded stiffened plate of a marine platform fig 1 exposed to cyclic and repetitive fatigue loading caused by waves typically frames are adopted to improve the stability of the plate however fatigue performance of the stiffened plate is reduced due to poor welding qualities and initial flaws in materials a crack is likely to initiate and propagate along the weld toe of the joint as shown by fig 1 if the crack is not maintained timely crack growth would cause leaking and rupture of the structural system such structural failure would result in significant loss of money and people s lives as well as damages to the environment and platform owner s reputation moan 2018 fatigue reliability of the welded joint is a problem that needs to be properly addressed and managed in the whole life cycle of the marine platform the required service life of the platform is t s l 20 years the frequency of wave loading is about 0 16 hz lotsberg et al 2016 and thus the number of annual fatigue load cycles is approximately n 0 5 10 6 at the design stage fatigue limit state has been checked via structural design codes the fatigue resistance is of this type of the welded joint falls into f class and a representative s n curve is given by a classification society dnv 2014 a fatigue design factor fdf of 3 has been adopted and the maximum allowable equivalent stress range is 21 03 mpa the plate thickness is t 25 mm the design parameters are summarized in table 1 in which a 1 and a 2 are fatigue strength coefficients and m 1 and m 2 are fatigue strength exponents of the s n curve 3 probabilistic crack growth according to fracture mechanics fatigue deterioration occurs due to presence of initial flaws or cracks the initial size a 0 initial cracks propagate along the front of local stress concentration field to a critical size a c which defines final failure fig 2 the critical crack size is often defined based on serviceability analysis herein the stiffened plate in fig 1 would not keep watertight if a through thickness crack develops so the critical crack size a c is set to be equal to the plate thickness i e a c t the crack propagation life n p is not sensitive to the value of a c because the final fracture usually occurs very quickly as illustrated by fig 2 the relationship between crack growth rate and local stress range is given by equation 1 according to the one dimensional paris law paris and erdogan 1963 1 d a d n c δ k m δ k t h δ k k m a t where a is crack size in the depth direction n is the number of fatigue load cycles d a d n is crack propagation rate c and m are material parameters δ k is stress intensity factor range k m a t is material fracture toughness δ k t h is a threshold value of δ k the stress intensity factor range δ k is given by equation 2 the values of the input parameters are listed in table 1 2 δ k δ σ y a π a where y a is geometry function and δ σ is stress range crack propagation essentially is a stochastic process in this study main sources of uncertainty associated with the paris model equation 1 are taken into account explicitly i e uncertainty in measuring or calculating the initial crack size a 0 crack growth rate c and stress range δ σ doshi and vhanmane 2013 lotsberg et al 2016 the equivalent initial crack size a 0 is exponentially distributed and the mean value e a 0 0 04 lotsberg et al 2016 according to the reference the equivalent initial crack size is a virtual size which is calibrated to the s n curve so that the crack initiation life is included in the crack growth prediction with the paris model uncertainty associated with calculation of stress range δ σ originates from wave load characterization method structural response stress concentration factor calculation methods the effects of welding notch etc herein the uncertainty associated with calculation of δ σ is modelled by a normally distributed variable b the statistical descriptors for b are the mean value e b 1 and the standard deviation sd μ b 0 15 lassen and recho 2015 the crack growth rate c is often regarded as a material property although it is also dependent on other factors for marine structures the crack growth rate c is usually adopted to be lognormally distributed lotsberg et al 2016 and m 3 the probabilistic models and statistical descriptors of all random variables are summarized in table 2 one dimensional probabilistic crack growth models have been widely adopted in the literature on maintenance modelling and optimization kim et al 2013 soliman et al 2016 the selection of a crack growth model depends on the aim of study and the available input data a more sophisticated model can take more crack growth physical details into account but generally requires more input data and is more difficult to characterize model uncertainty in addition a more sophisticated model typically requires more computational efforts to obtain crack growth predictions when such a model is integrated into a probabilistic modelling optimization framework it would be computationally difficult to solve the optimization problem to obtain an optimal maintenance decision or strategy the paris model probabilistic models in table 2 and resultant crack propagation predictions represent existing information available to a decision maker dm while making maintenance decisions which is also called prior information faber 2012 the dm can also collect additional information e g by crack inspections or measurements in this study the prior crack information is integrated with additional crack inspection information via bayesian updating and the eventual maintenance decision is derived based on integrated crack information which is called posterior information faber 2012 decision rule based approaches by which maintenance decisions are directly linked to inspection results e g detection or condition based maintenance strategies may give suboptimal decisions which is demonstrated by the results and discussions in section 6 4 life cycle maintenance interventions the actual fatigue life of the structural system may be shorter than predicted at the structural design stage by the s n approach due to presence of initial cracks and various sources of uncertainty first of all s n curves are normally established based on specimens with smaller initial flaws while initial cracks in actual structures are often bigger also the fatigue loading condition and history at the operation stage can be different from envisaged at the structural design stage in addition there may be human errors in the structural design and manufacture process therefore it is crucial to develop and implement an efficient inspection and maintenance strategy at the operation stage to ensure structural integrity and safety in this study section 5 we develop a maintenance decision analytic modelling and information value computational approach herein the developed approach is applied to optimization of two scheduled maintenance interventions n 2 the maintenance interventions would be carried out at an equal time interval δ t 7 years that is to say the intervention timings are t 1 7 years and t 2 14 years respectively after the beginning of service before each intervention an inspection may be adopted or not in this study whether to adopt an inspection is not pre defined but determined by the proposed approach based on rational information value computation at each intervention time the available maintenance decision alternatives are no action and repair r if an inspection is adopted before an intervention a maintenance decision is not directly dependent on the inspection result but is derived based on decision analytic modelling and optimization results it is assumed that after a repair the structural system is renewed to its initial state garbatov and soares 2001 huynh et al 2017 zitrou et al 2013 zou et al 2019b by this renewal model the behaviour of maintained structure can be simulated by the probabilistic crack growth model in section 3 and a small failure probability of maintained structure in its remaining service life can be taken into account the information value brought by three different inspection strategies listed in table 3 are studied in inspection strategy 1 is1 crack detection is carried out at both interventions while in inspection strategy 3 is3 crack measurement is performed if the inspection result is detection at both interventions it is clear that more information is provided by is3 than is1 in inspection strategy 2 is2 crack detection is carried out at both interventions while crack measurement is performed only at the 2nd intervention if the inspection result is detection the information provided by is2 is more than is1 but less than is3 inspection uncertainty is taken into account via the probability of detection pod function given by equation 3 dong and frangopol 2016 madsen et al 1991 the equation is established based on experimental test data by the equation the detection probability of a crack with a depth a can be calculated due to uncertainty the detectable crack size a d of a non destructive testing method is modelled as a variable by using equation 3 the detectable crack size a d follows an exponential distribution in this study magnetic particle inspection mpi is used for crack inspection and the mean value of a d is 0 89 mm dong and frangopol 2016 other inspection methods can also be employed e g visual inspection as long as the mean value of a d is provided 3 p o d a f a 1 exp a e a d where e a d is the mean detectable crack size of an inspection method detection based maintenance d and condition based maintenance c are widely adopted maintenance decision rules when inspection strategies 1 and 3 are employed respectively kim et al 2013 soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2019a zou et al 2019b details of the decision rules are provided in table 4 5 maintenance decision analytic modelling a limit state function is given by equation 4 where h t 0 signifies failure as mentioned in section 3 the limit state function is established based on serviceability analysis and a c t 4 h t a c a t based on the limit state function the probability of failure by time t is can be calculated by equation 5 note that lifetime failure probability is p f t s l structural reliability index is calculated by

tree analysis soliman et al 2016 zou gonzález et al 2019b for example fig 3 illustrates decision tree analysis of two maintenance interventions scheduled to the time t 1 and t 2 at both interventions inspection strategy 1 see table 1 is adopted in fig 3 f d and r mean the event of failure detection and repair respectively while f and d mean survival and no detection in fig 3 at both interventions the decision is r if the inspection result is d and no action if the inspection result is d this is a maintenance strategy directly relying on an inspection i e detection based maintenance table 4 note that there are other decision alternatives for example the decision can also be 1 r no matter what the inspection result is or 2 no action no matter what the inspection result is these two decision alternatives are also feasible if the information provide by an inspection result is not strong enough to lead to a decision change as mentioned in sections 1 and 3 more information doesn t necessarily lead to an improved decision and the value of information provided by an inspection is unknown unless explicitly calculated decision tree analysis can be done for other maintenance decision alternatives in a similar manner by decision tree analysis the probability of failure is calculated by summation of the probability of failure associated with each failure branch in the decision tree in this study structural maintenance at the operation stage of the asset is addressed thus design and construction costs are fixed and not included in the lcc calculation the lcc given

updated distribution of crack size a i t is simulated i e posterior information via bayesian theorem and accordingly the addition information is integrated with prior information e g the prior distribution of a t b then posterior decision modelling and optimization is conducted based on the updated a i t the posterior optimal decision and posterior minimum lcc are obtained by equations 13 and 14 the obtained decision d opt i and l c c min i are conditional on the additional information i however it should be noted the decision d opt i is not determined solely by the information i but determined by the posterior crack size distribution a i t and expected life cycle costs l c c d a i t associated with each decision alternative d c the value of the information i which is called conditional voi is obtained by equation 15 d from equation 11 15 it can be seen that additional information i e g cack detection or no detection adds value i e v o i i 0 only when the posterior optimal decision d opt i is different from the prior one d opt i e leading to a change in the optimal decision this highlights the importance of systematic decision modelling and voi computation before collecting additional information 13 d opt i arg min d l c c d a i t 14 l c c min i l c c d opt i a i t 15 v o i i l c c min l c c min i 5 3 pre posterior decision modelling and optimization when assessing the efficiency of an inspection strategy e g any of the inspection strategies in table 3 two inspections are planed but not implemented so the set of two inspection results i e the additional information i is unknown and thus is treated as a random variable the distribution of i is obtained based on the prior distribution of a t and the crack detection reliability of the adopted inspection method which is characterized by the variable a d the value of information provided by an inspection strategy is calculated as the expectation value of v o i i with respect to the random variable i according to equation 16 it is clear that when different inspection strategies in table 3 are adopted the voi is different 16 v o i e i v o i i when different inspection strategies are adopted the number of possible inspection results is different accordingly the number of possible maintenance decision or strategy alternatives in posterior decision analytic modelling is different when inspection strategy 1 is adopted the available decision alternatives for one intervention are no action detection based maintenance d repair r and the number of decision alternatives for two interventions is 3 2 9 when inspection strategy 3 is adopted the decision alternatives for one intervention are no action condition based maintenance c detection based maintenance d repair r and the number of decision alternatives for two interventions is 4 2 16 when inspection strategy 2 is adopted the decision alternatives for the 1st intervention are no action detection based maintenance d repair r and the decision alternatives for the 2nd intervention are no action condition based maintenance c detection based maintenance d repair r the number of decision alternatives for two interventions is 3 4 12 the prior and posterior optimal maintenance decisions are derived based on the prior and posterior minimum life cycle costs respectively hence both the prior and posterior optimal maintenance decisions depend heavily on the input cost parameters c f 0 c r 0 c i 0 which characterize the maintenance decision context in this study sensitivity to the input cost parameters is given by investigating the impacts of three different decision contexts the baseline case the high maintenance cost case and the high failure cost case in the baseline case c i 0 1 c r 0 c i 0 10 c f 0 c i 0 100 zou et al 2021b in the high maintenance cost case the costs of a repair are increased to c r 0 c i 0 40 in the high failure cost case the costs of failure are much higher and c f 0 c i 0 10000 in summary the proposed method comprises of 5 steps as follows a simulate crack growth by monte carlo simulations based on the probabilistic fracture model and obtain the distribution of crack depth with time a t b calculate the initial i e without any maintenance plan lifetime failure probability p f t s l c simulate the events of crack detection and no detection based on the distributions of a t 1 a t 2 a d and obtain the probabilities of detection d and no detection d at the scheduled inspection times t 1 t 2 d based on decision tree analysis calculate the expectation values of lcc associated with different maintenance decision alternatives and the voi under different inspection strategies e derive the optimal maintenance decision and inspection strategy based on the minimum lcc and the maximum voi respectively the above described study contributes to the current literature with a rational maintenance decision analytic modelling approach which is widely applicable to a variety of maintenance decision making problems benefiting from direct modelling of all feasible decision alternatives without introducing any decision rule three typical maintenance decision cases are identified to show the wide applicability and advantages of the proposed approach compared with the current decision rule based approach moreover the proposed approach yields optimal maintenance decisions on the basis of rational information value computation and is able to make full use of information three inspection strategies are identified to show that the proposed approach is able to yield more improved maintenance decisions with more in depth inspections 6 results and discussions the proposed approach in section 5 is illustrated on the structural model in section 2 in comparison with decision rule based maintenance optimization approaches i e detection based d and condition based c maintenance optimization approaches kim et al 2013 soliman et al 2016 zou et al 2019a b generally it is shown that under some maintenance decision contexts i e cost structure the information value provided by is1 is equal to zero and d may be a suboptimal decision or strategy which is associated with higher life cycle costs than the optimal decision derived by the proposed approach similarly under some maintenance decision contexts the information value provided by is3 is equal to zero and c may be a suboptimal decision or strategy which is associated with higher life cycle costs than the optimal decision derived by the proposed approach it is also found that under some maintenance decision contexts the information value provided by is3 can be equal to is1 although is3 represents more in depth inspections table 5 7 summarize the obtained results for three maintenance decision contexts cases respectively i e high maintenance cost case baseline case and high failure cost case in each table the results by the proposed and decision rule based approaches are provided adopting three inspection strategies respectively the results are obtained based on monte carlo simulations with 5 10 6 samples for each random variables in the three tables the lcc and voi are given as their expectation values and the unit is the costs of one inspection the voi is obtained by the proposed approach i e by equation 16 for comparison purpose the voi by the decision rule based approach is provided which is defined as the life cycle costs by the decision rule based approach minus the prior min lcc in the tables the optimal maintenance threshold its unit is mm is applicable only when the obtained optimal decision is c in the tables when is2 is adopted the listed optimal threshold is for the 2nd maintenance intervention because a crack size measurement is involved only at the 2nd intervention see table 3 fig 4 shows the voi provided by 3 inspection strategies in 3 maintenance decision cases fig 5 7 compare the minimum life cycle costs obtained by the proposed and decision rules based approaches in 3 maintenance decision cases respectively fig 4 generally shows that voi is3 voi is2 voi is1 i e the voi by more in depth inspections is generally higher the only exception is that in the high failure cost case voi is3 voi is2 which indicates that crack size measurement at the 1st intervention in is3 is valueless this is reasonable because when the costs of failure are very high more intense maintenance is desirable especially at the time of the 1st intervention when the remaining service life is still very long i e 14 years as can be found in table 7 the optimal decision at the 1st intervention is d detection based maintenance which represents more intense maintenance than c condition based maintenance and thus a crack size measurement at the 1st intervention is unnecessary figs 5 7 show that the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower or equal to the decision rule based approach which show one of advantages of the proposed approach and contribution to the current literature when is1 or is2 is adopted and part of crack detections measurements if any at both interventions do not add value the minimum life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower for example in fig 5 and table 5 when is1 is adopted the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are much lower and the obtained optimal decision is d which indicates that crack detection activity at the 2nd intervention is valueless when is2 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are also lower and the obtained optimal decision is c which means that crack detection activity at the 1st intervention is valueless in fig 6 and table 6 when is1 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower and the obtained optimal decision is d which indicates that crack detection activity at the 2nd intervention is valueless by the decision rule based approach maintenance decisions depend directly and solely on inspection results so when part of the inspection activities do not add value the approach can lead to higher life cycle costs than the proposed approach even higher than prior minimum life cycle costs without involving inspections see table 5 when is1 is adopted the proposed approach however yields optimal maintenance decisions based on rational decision analytic modelling integrating both prior crack prediction results and inspection results when all crack detections measurements if any at both interventions add value the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same for example in fig 6 and table 6 when is2 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same the optimal decisions obtained by the two approaches are also the same i e d c which indicates that both the crack detection at the 1st intervention and the crack detection measurement at the 2nd intervention add value in fig 7 and table 7 when is1 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same and the optimal decisions are also the same i e d d when is2 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the two approaches are the same and the optimal decisions are also the same i e d c when is3 is considered the life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach are lower than the decision rule based approach in all cases high maintenance cost case fig 5 baseline case fig 6 and high failure cost case fig 7 by the decision rule based approach the same threshold is adopted at both interventions which restricts full utilization of the voi and leads to higher life cycle costs the reason is that inspection results obtained at different timings have different implications on the lifetime failure probability and lcc and the failure risks of a component repaired at different timings in its remaining service life are also different thus maintenance threshold values at different timings should be different as evidenced by table 5 7 the optimal maintenance thresholds for the two interventions are different and the optimal threshold for the 1st intervention is smaller than the 2nd intervention figs 5 7 demonstrate that the minimum life cycle costs obtained by the proposed approach generally becomes lower with more in depth inspections from inspection strategy 1 to 2 to 3 which show another major advantage of the proposed approach and contribution to the current literature this also proves that the proposed approach can fully utilize the information provided by inspection strategies if the information adds value to maintenance decision making on the contrary figs 6 and 7 show that the life cycle costs obtained by the decision rule based approach can get higher with more in depth inspections from inspection strategy 2 to 3 which indicates that the approach doesn t make full use of the information provided by different inspection strategies table 5 7 shows that the optimal maintenance thresholds obtained by both approaches are the biggest in the high maintenance cost case and the smallest in the high failure cost case this is reasonable because when the costs of maintenance are high less maintenance should be performed and adopting a big maintenance threshold reduces the probability of maintenance when the costs of failure are high more intense maintenance is desirable and adopting a small maintenance threshold increases the probability of maintenance in summary the proposed approach can result in optimal maintenance decision associate with the minimum life cycle costs reliably whether inspections add value or not benefiting from utilization of both crack prediction results and inspection results when two inspections are planned it is do found that the voi from one of the inspections or part of the inspection activities e g crack size measurement can be equal to zero and c condition based maintenance is not the optimal decision the decision rule based approach can lead to higher life cycle costs when part of inspection activities does not add value in addition the decision rule based approach adopts the same thresholds at both interventions which restricts full utilization of information value 7 conclusions marine structures and installations are important engineering assets that support human activities on seas nevertheless structural deterioration e g crack initiation and growth is an inevitable problem for marine assets exposed to repetitive fatigue loads caused by waves welded joints represent the weakest areas in terms of structural integrity timely maintenance of fatigue cracks in welded joints is thus crucial for ensuring structural integrity restoring structural reliability and mitigating failure risk optimal maintenance planning however is often challenging on one hand maintenance costs of marine structures are typically very high due to poor accessibility and high downtime costs on the other hand it is difficult to predict crack initiation and growth accurately because both fatigue loading and fatigue resistance are subjected to high levels of uncertainty thus improving the quality of maintenance decision making under uncertainty is of great significance to safety reliability and costs of marine assets maintenance planning is often formulated as an optimization problem based on some pre defined decision rules e g detection or condition based maintenance strategies according to these decision rules maintenance decisions depend directly and solely on inspection or monitoring results however it should be stressed that inspection information is often imperfect and not always reliable due to uncertainties associated with inspection activities in addition it incurs additional costs to carry out inspections furthermore additional inspection information may not lead to a change in maintenance decisions and not add value thus such decision rule based approaches are reasonable only in maintenance decision making cases where inspections add value it is however not known whether inspection information adds value or not unless information value is explicitly quantified in this paper a systematic maintenance decision analytic modelling and information value computational approach has been developed in support of reliable and optimal maintenance decision making under uncertainty it has been proved that the approach can reliably yield optimal maintenance decisions in both decision making cases where inspections add value and do not add value the information value provided by inspections is computed explicitly it has been shown that the approach results in maintenance decisions associated with lower life cycle costs than decision rule based approaches benefitting from integration of prior crack prediction information with additional inspection information and fully information utilization in the decision making process moreover it has also been proved that the approach yields more improved decisions associated with lower life cycle costs with more in depth inspections the strengths of the proposed approach are attributed to decision analytic modelling information integration and explicit information value computation the proposed approach incorporates many considerations which are essential for maintenance decision making such as uncertainty failure probability failure risk life cycle costs and information value probabilistic modelling of uncertainty crack growth and inspection outcomes is carried out then the add value by inspections is quantified on the basis of direct maintenance decision analytic modelling integrated crack information is obtained by updating prior crack predictions with inspection data the optimal maintenance decision is derived rationally by rating the expected life cycle costs associated with all decision alternatives which are assessed based on integrated crack information hence the optimal maintenance decision is obtained based on integrated crack information rather than only on crack inspection results the proposed approach enables maintenance policy makers to address maintenance decision making problems under uncertainty in a more rational systematic and efficient way and can be used at the maintenance planning stage the obtained optimal maintenance decisions may be different when the values of input parameters are different e g parameters related to crack growth modelling inspection method and cost ratios however the proposed probabilistic approach provides a framework to derive the optimal decision rationally when relevant input parameters are given in the near future we will refine the approach so that more maintenance decision variables can be derived via the approach for example when a large number of hot spot areas are considered the number of hot spots to be inspected would be a decision variable that needs to be optimised this can be achieved by modelling multiple hot spot areas as a multi component system and then formulate the decision optimization problem based on the methodology proposed in this paper credit authorship contribution

prediction of the heavy weather seakeeping performance of naval ships is important from both an operational and safety point of view heavy weather seakeeping of naval ships has traditionally been investigated by means of scale model testing in large seakeeping basins from a safety point of view a large number of conditions needs to be investigated furthermore in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the results a large number of wave encounters has to be met during the tests including severe and rare events this makes scale model testing time consuming and expensive during the last decades low to high fidelity simulation methods have been developed for investigating heavy weather seakeeping of ships these methods range from blended seakeeping maneuvering methods using linear or non linear strip theory added mass damping and diffraction data bases via 3d panel methods using various degrees of linearization to high fidelity unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation solvers the use of numerical simulation methods has gained considerable interest also from the civil shipbuilding industry the imo second generation intact stability criteria sgisc petacco and gualeni 2020 requires the use of validated numerical simulation methods to investigate intact stability of ships for their so called level 3 criteria developments for imo sgisc purposes may benefit the naval shipbuilding community and vice versa so far relatively little work has been published on the suitability of simulation methods for level 3 stability criteria computational fluid

standard deviation and probability distribution of time series and the expected value and probability distribution of mean crossing amplitudes moreover the identification of conditions e g wave sequences with their characteristics causing large roll angles severe events and capsize rare events and the capability to recreate deterministically such events are also addressed urans studies are built on earlier research on the stochastic validation of ship responses in irregular waves diez et al 2018 and the validation and identification of severe slamming events in irregular waves judge et

to the world meteorological organization wmo definition the statistics of ship motions rudder angle immersion probes water on deck are addressed which was never done before validation studies include roll decay at zero speed with variable roll gyradius and self propulsion in calm water to assess revolution per minute rpm values versus efd data the stochastic validation of free running cfd is achieved by statistical assessment of efd data provided by the maritime research institute of netherlands marin van walree and visser 2010 and cfd results of input waves and ship response times series these are achieved by wave energy spectrum autocovariance and bootstrap analysis following 4 additionally dynamic mode decomposition dmd schmid 2010 is used with both efd and cfd time histories to unveil the underlying ship dynamics diez et al 2021 and shed light on the differences between cfd and efd finally five zero crossing waves statistics and k means clustering lloyd 1982 are used for the identification of wave sequences causing large roll angles for both efd and cfd in the remainder of this paper these sequences are referred to as causal sequences finally as a proof of concept the

test case the hull form under investigation is the marin model 7967 which is equivalent to 5415m this is a geosim replica of the dtmb 5415 model but with different appendages designed by marin the dtmb 5415 is an open to public naval combatant hull geometry fig 1 top shows the 1 35 48 scale model and fig 1 bottom shows the model during a test run the main particulars of the ship are given in table 1 2 1 test conditions the experiments were performed by 27 and consisted of free running tests in waves with measurement of motions and water levels on the weather deck it is noted that the loading condition of the model did not satisfy naval stability criteria in order to achieve large roll amplitude motions in waves the model was manufactured at marin of wood and appended with skeg twin split bilge keels twin rudders and rudder seats slanted outwards shafts with v type brackets and struts and counter rotating twin propellers the rudder was of the spade type the lateral area of the rudders was 2 15 4 m 2 i e 2 1 8 of the lateral area of the vessel l p p t the propellers were fixed pitch type with the direction of rotation inward over the top the model was self propelled and

coefficients are shown in table 2 the sway motion was included with a weak gain to keep the model near the center of the basin the free running tests were performed with propeller rpm fixed to the self propulsion point of the model for the envisaged speed the self propulsion point was determined with speed trail test in calm water the experiments were conducted in marin s seakeeping and maneuvering basin measuring 170 40 5 m in length width and depth respectively the basin wave makers enabled generation of regular and long short crested irregular waves from any direction relative to the free sailing model beaches on the opposite sides absorbed the incoming waves a main carriage x direction and a sub carriage y direction followed the model and provided the required power and data storage no wind makers were included in the experiments the experimental data were made available by the cooperative research navies crn group see 27 2 2 efd validation data set efd data set includes

run length and number of repetitions runs from 2 to 7 the experiments were conducted in irregular long crested waves following a jonswap spectrum the spectral shape was obtained from wave height

and on the weather deck at nine locations two locations are used here as shown in fig 2 in addition four acoustic wave probes fixed to the main carriage x direction were used to record the incident wave elevation at locations surrounding the model details of the location of wave elevation probes for the model at rest relative to the longitudinal midship location station 10 st 10 are shown in fig

rare event capsizing and ii has the largest number of runs the test case collects 7 efd runs at nominal fr 0 33 with nominal peak period t p 9 2 s and wave heading of 300 deg it is close to the resonance condition for the roll as shown in fig 3 the nominal significant wave height h 1 3 is close to 6 m and lays in between sea states 6 very rough and 7 high according to the wmo definition nevertheless the actual significant wave height observed in the experiments equals 7 m which identifies a sea state equal to 7 and is used to select a desired set of cfd runs a total of 130 encounter

the water and negative in the air the 6 dof rigid body equations of motion are solved to calculate linear and angular motions of the ship a simplified non interactive body force model is used for the propeller which prescribes axisymmetric body force with axial and tangential components the body force field is applied at the position occupied by the propellers described by a disk volume extended radially from r h to r p and axially from p 1 x y z to p 2 x y z which also define the propeller axis whose values are listed in table 3 the propeller model requires the open water curves and advance

derivatives in the turbulence and momentum equations are discretized using second order finite euler backward difference convection terms in the turbulence and momentum equations are discretized with higher order upwind formula the viscous terms in the momentum and turbulent equations are computed with similar considerations using a second order difference scheme the piso algorithm is solved using the petsc toolkit suggar is used to obtain the overset interpolation information an mpi based domain decomposition approach is used where each decomposed block is mapped to one processor for boundary conditions the no slip condition is applied on the solid surfaces the far field boundary conditions are imposed on the top and bottom of the background the irregular wave boundary conditions are applied for inlet outlet and side surfaces of the domain the irregular wave boundary is based on a linear superposition of n 80 elemental wave components the amplitude ζ i for each component is derived from the spectrum as 7 ζ i 2 s ω i δ ω i where ω i is the wave angular frequency and δ ω i is the frequency band around ω i the ω i values for the components are selected evenly distributed within 0 41 and 1 47 rad s for the current study as in the efd campaign with a constant δ ω 0 0135 rad s the phase for each component is selected randomly nominal jonswap spectrum for the encounter

each rudder such that inboard and outboard sides are conformal o topology grids are used for the rudder seats shafts and shaft brackets a cartesian grid is used to impose the far field boundary conditions and to resolve the flow far from the hull with a refinement cartesian block close to the stern the total number of grid points is about 45m details of the grids are shown in table 4 and fig 6 simulation nondimensional time step is set equal to 0 004 which corresponds to 0 008 s in model scale and a data rate equal to 129 2 hz at nominal speed with no motions the ship travels one ship length in 250 time steps and one wavelength corresponding to the modal period in 350 time steps for the current test case cfd simulation time was approximately 1m cpu hours for a full scale duration of 1 hour on a hpc system with 2 7 ghz intel xeon platinum cores grid sensitivity analysis for the fully appended model is very time consuming and beyond the scope of the present work nevertheless grid verification for the bare hull was performed in earlier work serani et al 2021 where grid convergence index uncertainties were found smaller than 2 and 4 for resistance and the motions rms on average in regular head waves for the hull appended with bilge keels only 30 showed insensitivity to the grid using grid refinement ratio of 2 0 25 and finest boundary layer and bilge keels grids of 2 3m points with an uncertainty smaller than 1 associated to the roll angle in roll decay analysis 4 stochastic validation methods the current work follows the approach proposed by 4 for irregular wave validation studies statistical assessment and validation are studied for time series values of wave elevation ζ ship motions rudder angle ship x and y velocities and immersion probes assessment and validation methods include fourier analysis for the assessment of the wave energy spectrum moments analysis of the autocovariance ac and moving block bootstrap mbb for the statistical uncertainty of expected value ev standard deviation sd and quantiles of the wave elevation primary variable the statistical uncertainty of wave amplitude secondary variable ev sd and quantile is evaluated by standard bootstrap efron 1981 method assuming independent and identically distributed random variable the combined use of the kernel density estimator miecznikowski et al 2010 with bootstrap methods provides validation values and uncertainties for the probability density function pdf the same methodologies are used to evaluate the statistical uncertainties associated with the ship motions rudder angle ship x and y velocities and immersion probes where ac and mbb methods are used for primary variables and bootstrap is used for secondary variables errors and confidence intervals of the statistical estimators are used to define validation criteria of cfd outputs versus efd benchmark values 4 1 spectral moments the wave energy spectrum moments m 0 m 1 and m 2 are evaluated as 8 m k 0 ω k s ω d ω k 0 1 2 where s ω a 2 ω 2 and a is the elemental wave component amplitude numerically eq 8 is evaluated using discrete fourier transform of the time series 4 2 statistics of interest statistics of interest are the expected value ev standard deviation sd cumulative distribution function cdf and probability density function pdf they are evaluated numerically using a sample of m items items are extracted from time series as ξ i ξ t i i 1 m for secondary variables amplitudes m mean crossing waves are identified and the associated ξ i defined note that the sample size is different for primary and secondary variables the statistics of interest are evaluated as follows 9 ev ξ 1 m i 1 m ξ i 10 sd ξ 1 m 1 i 1 m ξ i ev ξ 2 11 cdf ξ y 1 m i 1 m δ ξ i y the pdf is here evaluated using kernel density estimation miecznikowski et al 2010 as 12 pdf ξ y 1 m h i 1 m 1 2 π exp y ξ i 2 2 h 2 where h sd ξ m 1 5 is a bandwidth silverman 2018 4 3 autocovariance analysis the analysis of the ac is used to provide confidence intervals for ev and sd of primary variables time series values validation values are directly provided by eqs 9 and 10 whereas confidence intervals are evaluated using the variance of the mean v ar ev and the variance of the variance v ar sd 2 belenky et al 2015 respectively defined as 13 v ar ev sd 2 m 2 m i 1 m i 1 i m r τ i 14 v ar sd 2 2sd 4 m 4 m i 1 m i 1 i m r τ i 2 where r τ i is the autocovariance function here used in the following weighted form 15 r τ i 1 m j 1 m i ξ j ev ξ ξ j 1 ev ξ the statistical uncertainties associated to ev and sd are evaluated at the 95 confidence interval assuming a normal distribution for the ev estimated as 16 u ev 2 v ar ev and by the central limit theorem for the sd as 17 u sd sd 1 2 v ar sd 2 sd 2 1 4 4 moving block bootstrap method to define the validation values and confidence intervals of statistical estimators of eqs 9 12 a mbb method is applied to time series using a number c m l 1 of moving blocks each formed by ξ i i j j l 1 where j is the block index and l 2 φ c 2 3 m 1 3 is an optimal block length carlstein et al 1986 with 18 φ m i 1 m 1 ξ i 1 ev ξ ξ i ev ξ m 1 i 1 m ξ i ev ξ 2 and c 1 φ 1 φ from the original set of c blocks a number of c m l blocks are drawn at random with replacement and concatenated in the order they are picked forming a new bootstrapped series of size m q 100 bootstrapped series are used here ev and sd are evaluated as per eqs 9 and 10 the cdf is assessed by quantile function q evaluated at probabilities p 0 025 0 1 0 2 0 8 0 9 0 975 sorting all the ξ t i i 1 m within each bootstrapped series such that ξ t i 1 ξ t i ξ t i 1 then 19 q p ξ p m the validation value for ev and its 95 confidence lower and upper bounds are evaluated as 20 ev median ev b ev 0 5 q 21 ev l ev 0 025 q and ev u ev 0 975 q where ev b represents the ev value of the q th bootstrapped series ordered such as ev b 1 ev b ev b 1 finally 22 u ev 0 5 ev u ev l the validation values and confidence interval for sd are similarly evaluated 4 5 bootstrap method the validation and confidence intervals of secondary variables are evaluated by the bootstrap method efron 1981 the method constructs an empirical probability function from the sample assumed independent and identically distributed assigning a probability of 1 n to each item this represents the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the actual distribution the associated empirical cdf is given by eq 11 from the empirical cdf it is calculated a number b of new sets each containing new random items ξ i i 1 n defined as 23 ξ i cdf 1 p i where p i are n uniformly distributed random items in 0 1 ordering the original items such that ξ i 1 ξ i ξ i 1 the new items ξ i are 24 ξ i j p i n validation values and 95 confidence intervals for ev sd and quantiles are evaluated similarly to mbb method 4 6 validation metrics input irregular wave from both efd and cfd is assessed and validated versus nominal benchmark values from the spectrum specifically the error associated with efd and cfd wave energy spectrum moments is evaluated as 25 e m k efd or cfd m k n where superscripts n indicates nominal values for primary and secondary variables the validation error for ev is evaluated as 26 e ev cfd ev efd and associated validation uncertainty is assessed as following 27 u v u ev cfd 2 u ev efd 2 validation is achieved if e u v sd validation error and uncertainty are similarly assessed 4 7 dynamic mode decomposition dmd schmid 2010 is applied to motion time histories as an additional approach to assess the underlying ship dynamics diez et al 2021 and shed light onto similarities and differences between efd and cfd results dmd is a data driven and equation free dimensionality reduction reduced order modeling method which provides a linear representation of a possibly nonlinear system dynamics by means of a set of complex conjugate modes ϕ k and frequencies ω k the resulting reduced order model can be used for diagnostic state estimation future state prediction and control kutz et al 2016 here dmd is used to unveil motion correlation and compare efd and cfd modes frequencies and modal participation details of assumptions and equations for dmd in general may be found in 11 example applications to ship maneuvering in waves are given in 5 5 causal sequence identification approach severe events ses are defined using an arbitrary threshold value σ based on the roll amplitude sd whereas capsizings are assumed rare events by definition ses occur when the roll amplitude is greater than ev σ sd their analysis includes the assessment of the wave sequence causing the event specifically z 5 zero crossing waves are here considered as shown in fig 7 the assessment is based on the within the sequence ev and sd of wave height amplitude and encounter period as well as on their weighted counterpart ev w and sd w respectively defined as 28 ev w ξ i 1 z w i ξ i i 1 z w i 29 sd w ξ 1 z 1 i 1 z ξ i ev w ξ 2 1 z i 1 z w i where w i are the weights additionally the k means clustering method lloyd 1982 is used to identify the data cluster associated to ses or at least large roll angles it allows to build partitions of the data in k different sets clusters defined by representative points centroids here wave sequence parameters are used to form the desired data points d j the assignment of data points to k clusters is achieved by minimization of the within cluster sum of squares wcss 30 wcss i 1 k d j k i d j μ i 2 where μ i are the cluster centroids evaluated by averaging all data points within the i th cluster k i the wcss in eq 30 is used as evaluation metrics to identify the optimal number of clusters k specifically the elbow method ketchen and shook 1996 is used with the wcss metrics as additional clustering metrics the silhouette is used the silhouette method provides a metrics of consistency of data within clusters rousseeuw 1987 assume a i as the average euclidean distance between d i and any other data point within the cluster d i belongs to assume then c i as the smallest average euclidean distance of d i to all data points in any other cluster d i does not belong to the silhouette associated to d i is defined as 31 s i a i c i max a i c i and is a measure of how similar the data point is to points in its own cluster as opposed to other clusters it may be noted that s i ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates maximum similarity the average silhouette of all data points is used as a metrics for proper data clustering 32 s avg i 1 h s i note that for k 1 the silhouette is not defined by convention for k 1 it is s avg 0 6 numerical results in this section numerical results are presented for the wave elevation at probe 2 see fig 2 the ship motions surge sway heave roll pitch yaw the rudder angle x and y velocities and immersion probes r3 and r5 including the statistics of primary time series values and secondary amplitudes variables errors and uncertainties for the statistical estimators provided by bootstrap methods are normalized with 2sd ship motions are observed in the carriage coordinate system and projected onto the ship axes unless differently specified values are expressed for the full scale results are also presented for the dmd of relevant variables and the analysis of wave sequences causing severe events 6 1 roll decay validation in calm water fig 8 shows 5415m roll decay at zero speed in calm water comparing efd and cfd results in 27 a k x x 0 413 b value was determined by means of roll decay tests in the marin basin at zero speed a natural roll period equal to t 16 30 s in full scale was then determined from the recorded roll motion time series with an assumed added mass in water the k x x was determined and ballast was adjusted to meet the required value the weakness in this approach is the assumed added mass for roll which is normally in between 10 and 20 of the mass moment of inertia in air the actual value used depends on the appendage configuration for destroyer type ships with relatively large twin rudders propeller axes brackets and bilge keels it is difficult to establish an accurate value for the added mass for this reason cfd preliminary tests and validation of k x x b value are conducted using the following four values 0 385 0 400 0 413 and 0 428 cfd replicates efd tests by releasing the ship from an initial roll angle of 21 deg using 6 dof simulations validation results are summarized in table 5 including average decay period t based on first 3 periods logarithmic decrement δ and percent errors e a k x x 0 385 b is found to match efd results with an error of 0 3 for the average decay period and about 10 error for the logarithmic decrement this value is selected for the cfd simulations that follow it may be noted that the error between efd and cfd estimation of the k x x is close to 7 that is lower than the typical uncertainty of efd results about 8 for twin propeller and rudder configurations the k x x assessment is still an open issue for validation studies and different cfd solvers have shown similar discrepancy with efd see e g visonneau et al 2020 sanada et al 2020 furthermore it is worth noting that nowadays marin uses an oscillating table to determine the full inertia matrix of the models the measurement accuracy for the k x x is much better than that obtained from a swing table and the problem of assuming an added mass in water does not exist anymore 6 2 self propulsion rpm validation in calm water fig 9 and table 6 show the rpm validation using self propulsion computations in calm water the test is conducted with the self propelled ship aiming at constant speed corresponding to fr 0 33 the cfd simulation achieves the target fr with an rpm lower than efd of about 3 and equal to 922 in model scale see the corresponding nominal j in fig 4 since the aim of the present work is to perform cfd simulations at the same efd speed at least considering the nominal speed this value is used for cfd simulations in irregular waves 6 3 input wave validation eight cfd runs are computed to achieve a total of 215 encounter waves input wave validation is based on wave probe 2 since it is the least affected by the ship wake and or motion generated waves validation is presented in terms of spectral moments m 0 m 1 and m 2 in table 7 cfd errors versus nominal values are smaller than efd and the average absolute error of cfd vs efd is equal to 24 to achieve a closer agreement between efd and cfd input waves a subset of cfd runs is selected to this aim cfd runs are sorted based on their wave probe 2 root mean square rms a subset of 5 cfd runs is then selected considering a trade off between the cumulative rms see fig 10 top and the cumulative number of roll periods see fig 10 bottom compared to those provided by efd data rms values in fig 10 top are shown along with the associated uncertainty evaluated by ac analysis selecting 5 cfd runs the average absolute error of cfd vs efd for the input wave reduces to 6 4 see table 7 efd and cfd encounter spectra are compared to the nominal jonswap in fig 5 it may be noted that the wave probe can be to some extent affected by the wave produced by the ship motion the energy shift towards higher frequencies of efd and cfd compared to the nominal distribution is quite noticeable indicating a nonlinear wave development and possibly effects of interaction with the ship finally the ac of efd and selected cfd runs for wave probe 2 is shown in fig 11 the curves are quite reasonable also considering that the spectrum is quite narrow banded table 8 shows the encounter wave validation for primary variables time series values using ac and mbb methods and secondary variables amplitudes using the bootstrap method validation is achieved for wave elevation sd about 5 2 error by mbb method and wave amplitude ev about 5 8 error by bootstrap method errors are normalized with 2sd as a metric of data range finally fig 12 shows the quantiles and pdf of wave elevation and amplitude using mbb and bootstrap methods respectively both efd and cfd values are shown along with nominal and theoretical distribution revealing a good agreement 6 4 ship motions and velocities rudder angle and immersion probes validation results are summarized in figs 13 and 14 and tables 9 and 10 specifically fig 13 compares efd and cfd ship motions primary and secondary variables showing pdf and quantile function whereas velocities rudder angle and immersion probes results are shown in fig 14 the results are in good agreement primary variables see table 9 are validated with an average error of 9 6 and 8 8 for ev and sd respectively and the corresponding uncertainties are equal to 11 1 and 11 5 considering ship motions only secondary variables see motion avg row in table 10 ev s are validated with an average error equal to 10 6 and the validation uncertainty equal to 16 9 secondary variables sds are validated on average with an error equal to 13 2 and the validation uncertainty equal to 17 3 planar motions surge sway and yaw present the higher errors discrepancies with respect to efd this can be related to the use of the simplified body force propeller model instead of the actual discretized propeller especially for the surge nevertheless surge sway and yaw show the largest uncertainties for both efd and cfd a deeper analysis would require reducing the uncertainties and therefore run longer efd distribution for the roll angle shows an evident bi modal shape which is very well captured by cfd see fig 13 this confirms the resonant condition for the roll motion which contributes achieving large roll angles it may be noted that the bi modal double peak shape of the roll pdf is mainly due to the sinusoidal shape of the roll signal additionally even if there were no bulwarks on the model and the water is not trapped on the deck for large roll angle the righting moment m x s where s stays for ship reference system reduces due to the weight of the water on the deck as shown in fig 15 also contributing to the bi modal shape of the roll pdf as an example fig 15 shows one roll period of a regular wave cfd run described in the following subsection and the corresponding total righting moment along with the hull and deck contributions it is clearly visible how the water on the deck reduces the total righting moment furthermore the flow of water around the sharp deck edge causes additional roll damping also contributing to the pdf double peak fig 15 bottom shows the moment contributions as a function of the roll angle during the regular wave run it may be noted how the resulting moment is asymmetric and also depends on the roll rate positive versus negative rate being the motion affected by the wave direction nonlinearities emerge clearly for large roll angles especially for negative values when the deck faces the wave further indications of water on deck are derived from the immersion probes signals here probes r3 and r5 are used laying in between stations 7 and 8 at port and starboard sides see fig 2 respectively efd and cfd distributions are in a fairly reasonable agreement as fig 14 shows both efd and cfd distributions of both probes primary variable present a significant peak corresponding to 5 m immersion this corresponds to the peaks observed in the bi modal roll distribution in fig 13 it is interesting to note how efd and cfd peaks are very well aligned for starboard side probe 5 which sees the wave stepping away from the ship for port side probe 3 which sees the wave approaching and impacting the ship cfd overpredicts the peak location suggesting wave breaking and spray effects are significant and not well captured by the level set method based on the current analysis efd and cfd speed loss equal to 1 3 and 3 4 respectively this difference may be due to having used a different rpm for cfd compared to efd namely efd rpm equals 950 nominally providing with the target speed corresponding to fr 0 33 in calm water cfd provided with an rpm equal to 922 for the same nominal speed of fr 0 33 in calm water as observed in fig 14 efd and cfd distributions of x velocity are reasonably close nevertheless cfd shows a slightly smaller mean value and a smaller variability which again may be due to the use of the simplified body force propeller model finally to unveil the underlying dynamics and the motion correlation dmd of efd and cfd time histories is performed the ship 6 dof surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw and the rudder angle are used as dmd variables variables are standardized and an exact full rank dmd is applied diez et al 2021 twenty encounter periods from the largest variance runs are used for the analysis with both efd and cfd modes ϕ k are ranked based on their modal participation ℜ q k 2 where q k are the coordinates of the system state dmd variables in the modes basis couples of complex conjugate modes frequencies are grouped together in the modal participation analysis fig 16 top shows the participation of efd and cfd modes fig 16 center presents the modal participation as a function of the mode angular frequency ℑ ω k finally fig 16 bottom shows the magnitude of the mode components for the two most energetic couples of complex conjugate modes it may be noted how overall the modal participation is reasonably captured by cfd computations but modes 3 and 4 that are significantly underrepresented in cfd compared to efd fig 16 top the most energetic and fast modes are very well captured by cfd and correspond to the roll resonance condition as fig 16 center shows conversely modes 3 and 4 correspond to a slower dynamics and not well captured by cfd finally fig 16 bottom shows how modes 1 and 2 most energetic fast mainly involves roll pitch yaw rudder and to a lesser extent heave whereas modes 3 and 4 mainly involves planar motion variables i e surge sway yaw and to a lesser extent rudder dmd results suggest that the differences between cfd and efd in surge probability distribution and in general errors for planar motion variables have a double origin firstly the modes involving planar motion variables k 3 4 are underrepresented in cfd computations secondly looking at the mode components derived from cfd it emerges how the surge is underrepresented if compared to efd this again may be attributed to the simplified body force propeller model and will motivate future studies on the most convenient approach to propeller modeling 6 5 causal sequence identification due to the use of sequences and the finite number of efd and cfd runs the number of usable waves is lower than the actual number of recorded waves specifically the number of usable waves is equal to 92 and 102 for efd and cfd respectively the percentage of severe events is evaluated versus the threshold value σ for the roll amplitude selecting a threshold of σ 1 5 sd corresponding to a roll amplitude of 39 and 37 deg for efd and cfd respectively about 15 and 5 of the events are considered as severe for efd and cfd respectively see table 11 the corresponding wave sequences are shown in fig 17 for all wave sequences the ev w and sd w are evaluated for wave heights amplitudes and encounter periods the weights used are inversely proportional to the wave index where 1 indicates the closest to the severe event and 5 the farthest in the past average values for all waves and only those causing severe events are summarized in table 12 it can be noted that all the wave sequences have an encounter period close to the natural roll period confirming that the ship is sailing close to the resonant condition for roll the common denominator of the wave sequences causing the ses is identified in small values of the sd for both wave height and encounter period this mean that the ses are caused by nearly regular waves close to resonance condition as an additional analysis k means clustering is performed for the roll amplitude caused by the sequence wave height and encounter period within the sequence sds standardized data are used the optimal number of clusters for the representation of current data is defined by the wcss and the silhouette these are shown in fig 18 which reveals that four clusters are a good compromise for current data clusterization clusters of efd and cfd are shown in fig 19 results are consistent with earlier findings and show how reducing wave height and encounter period sd s produces larger roll angles see cluster 1 for both efd and cfd efd and cfd results are remarkably consistent 6 6 deterministic reconstruction of severe and rare events by regular wave cfd simulations the deterministic reconstruction of ses is based on regular wave cfd simulations it may be noted that the choice of running regular as opposed to irregular waves is determined after severe and rare events are identified along with the corresponding wave sequences and statistical and clustering analyses is performed for the current test case and both efd and cfd data severe rare events are caused by wave sequences characterized by encounter waves with almost identical height and period small sd of these parameters within the wave sequence close to resonance condition for the roll motion therefore it can be concluded that in this case approximately regular waves are causing severe rare events and therefore regular waves are used for the recreation of such events accordingly two proof of concept approaches are shown here 1 reconstruction of ses using wave amplitude and period identified as condition causing ses 2 reconstruction of rare events capsizing increasing the wave amplitude a regular wave is used characterized by wave amplitude and encounter period as per table 12 a 0 2 85 m and t e 15 96 s fig 20 compares the cfd stochastic wave sequences causing the ses and the deterministic regular wave used for the first proof of concept for the second proof of concept a parametric analysis increasing the wave amplitude is conducted specifically three further cfd simulations are performed with a 1 1 1 2 and 1 4 times a 0 the results of the deterministic reconstruction of severe and rare events are shown in fig 21 wave elevation at probe 2 and ship motions using the deterministic wave the roll motion reaches the se threshold whereas the rare event capsizing is achieved with a 1 4 a 0 it may be noted that in this latter case the encounter wave frequency suddenly increases see fig 21 top after about 100 s as the ship is upside down and stopping its course as well as the numerical carriage it is also worth noting that capsizing is not associated with surf riding ahead and broaching roll resonance produces large roll angles in the highly nonlinear regime causing one of the propellers to operate out of the water with the subsequent reduced thrust and slip back from the wave crest into the throat as fig 21 shows it is also interesting to note how the inflection point for the roll inception of capsizing occurs when the pitch is at its peak bow down finally a comparison of the ship attitude in deterministic wave at the first eight roll peaks is shown in fig 22 the results are compared to those obtained in irregular waves for one of the sequences causing severe roll angles first column showing a remarkable agreement 7 conclusions and future work the stochastic assessment and validation of urans simulations of free running 5415m model in stern quartering waves at sea state 7 is presented validation studies also include roll decay at zero speed and self propulsion rpm studies roll decay and self propulsion studies are successfully performed specifically efd k x x b value of 0 413 produce a 6 error for the roll damped period when used with cfd therefore a k x x b value equal to 0 385 is selected for cfd runs in waves achieving an error for the roll period equal to only 0 3 cfd self propelled simulations in calm water achieve the target fr 0 33 with an rpm lower than efd of about 3 this is used for cfd runs in waves the stochastic validation of the input wave is achieved by spectral analysis autocovariance and bootstrap methods efd data include 7 runs for a total of 130 encounter waves cfd simulations include 8 runs for a total of 215 encounter waves efd versus nominal spectrum shows an error of 41 for the zero th moment therefore selected cfd runs are used to achieve an input wave as close as possible to efd specifically 5 runs are used with 132 encounter waves these provide with an error equal to 6 1 for the zero th moment 1 5 for the wave sd and 5 8 for the wave amplitude ev efd and cfd stochastic uncertainties are both close to 10 a reduction of the uncertainty would require both efd and cfd to run longer note that ev and sd errors and uncertainties are normalized with 2sd which is used as a metric for the data range the statistical assessment and validation of cfd versus efd response is achieved by bootstrap methods ship motions sds are validated on average with an error of 8 3 and an associated uncertainty of 14 3 ship velocity ev s are validated with an error equal to 6 2 and an uncertainty equal to 11 3 rudder angle sd is also validated with error and uncertainty equal to 4 1 and 12 3 respectively planar motion variables present the higher errors discrepancies compared to efd which may be attributed to the use of the simplified body force propeller model especially for the surge this is confirmed by the dmd analysis where two modes clearly emerges from motion time histories the first and fast dynamics is associated to roll resonance mainly involves roll pitch yaw rudder and to a lesser extent heave and is very well captured by cfd the second and slower dynamics mainly involves planar motion variables and to a lesser extent rudder and is underrepresented in cfd results finally immersion probes ev s and sds show an average error close to 12 with an associated uncertainty close to 9 likely due to the use of the level set method in combination with rough waves and large motions for the same variables amplitudes are assessed showing similar trends although with larger errors and uncertainties conditions causing severe events large roll angles are identified considering sequences of five encounter waves and their statistics average ev w and sd w of wave amplitude height and encounter periods severe events are identified when the roll amplitude exceeds its ev 1 5 sd which corresponds to 39 and 37 degrees for efd and cfd respectively about 15 and 5 of efd and cfd sequences respectively are identified as causing extremely large roll angles these sequences are characterized by an almost regular wave inducing roll resonance specifically the within sequence sd w of both wave height and encounter period reduces significantly if compared to all sequences in efd and cfd records this result is confirmed by k means clustering analysis which shows how the cluster with the largest roll amplitudes corresponds to small within sequence sds of wave height and period efd and cfd produce remarkably close results based on this analysis two proof of concept results are achieved first severe events large roll angle are reconstructed by regular wave cfd simulations second a rare event capsizing is achieved by increasing the wave amplitude it may be noted how large roll angles arise in the nonlinear regime and identify conditions where the ship is on the verge of capsizing results show how capsizing is mainly due to roll resonance as opposed to surf riding and broaching instabilities overall the objectives of current study are achieved namely cfd urans validation for heavy weather identification of severe and rare events and deterministic reconstruction as a proof of concept the results are in general affected by the use of a simplified non interactive body forced model for the propeller that for the objective of the present study statistical validation of relevant variables in irregular waves was deemed reasonable within the activities of the nato avt 280 task group to achieve better validation results the use of more sophisticated body force models as well as a fully discretized propellers is under investigation within the nato avt 348 task group on the assessment of experiments and prediction methods for naval ships maneuvering in waves nevertheless since these methodologies can be quite expensive a good compromise between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency can be given by coupling potential flow and rans solvers as shown in 3 it may be finally emphasized that stochastic cfd simulations are too expensive to be advocated as a method to identify rare events on a large sample basis nevertheless if rare events are identified either anecdotally by captain by expensive model tests data and or by reduced order models lower fidelity but faster such that large samples can be achieved and assuming sufficient environmental information is available cfd is able to a reproduce statistically the response based on a smaller sample and b deterministically reconstruct severe events for detailed studies future work will include further analysis for the identification and assessment of the severe events based on stochastic distribution of regular waves he et al 2013 and sequential sampling strategy mohamad and sapsis 2018 extensions to other test cases not in resonance conditions are also advisable and will be considered for future studies finally the current work lay the ground for the deterministic

large roll and rare capsize events via regular wave computations keywords urans free running irregular waves stochastic validation dynamic mode decomposition data clustering 1 introduction the prediction of the heavy weather seakeeping performance of naval ships is important from both an operational and safety point of view heavy weather seakeeping of naval ships has traditionally been investigated by means of scale model testing in large seakeeping basins from a safety point of view a large number of conditions needs to be investigated furthermore in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the results a large number of wave encounters has to be met during the tests including severe and rare events this makes scale model testing time consuming and expensive during the last decades low to high fidelity simulation methods have been developed for investigating heavy weather seakeeping of ships these methods range from blended seakeeping maneuvering methods using linear or non linear strip theory added mass damping and diffraction data bases via 3d panel methods using various degrees of linearization to high fidelity unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation solvers the use of numerical simulation methods has gained considerable interest also from the civil shipbuilding industry the imo second generation intact stability criteria sgisc petacco and gualeni 2020 requires the use of validated numerical simulation methods to investigate intact stability of ships for their so called level 3 criteria developments for imo sgisc purposes may benefit the naval shipbuilding community and vice versa so far relatively little work has been published on the suitability of simulation methods for level 3 stability criteria computational fluid dynamic cfd by urans computations has shown the capability of predicting parametric rolling surf riding broaching and course keeping in regular and irregular waves for low to high sea states 20 show cfd parametric rolling prediction while 18 present cfd computations of surf riding periodic motion and broaching both for the onr tumblehome onrt in regular waves free running cfd computations in calm water and regular waves are shown for the onrt and the 5415m models by 29 and 25 respectively irregular waves free running computations for the 5415m at sea state 5 by urans and potential flow computations are presented in 19 while the performance of a trimaran in short crested head waves are presented by 31 deterministic validation methods by potential flow are presented in 26 stochastic validation procedures are presented in 4 and applied to cfd simulations of the delft catamaran in irregular wave at sea state 5 the objective of the present work is to assess the capability of a urans solver to reproduce accurately the statistics of the incoming waves and ship response of a free running destroyer in stern quartering irregular waves at sea state 7 statistics of interest are the standard deviation and probability distribution of time series and the expected value and probability distribution of mean crossing amplitudes moreover the identification of conditions e g wave sequences with their characteristics causing large roll angles severe events and capsize rare events and the capability to recreate deterministically such events are also addressed urans studies are built on earlier research on the stochastic validation of ship responses in irregular waves diez et al 2018 and the validation and identification of severe slamming events in irregular waves judge et al 2020 namely free running cfd simulations of the 5415m with appendages skeg twin split bilge keels twin rudders and rudder seats slanted outwards shafts and struts are assessed for course keeping in irregular stern quartering waves following a jonswap spectrum at target froude number fr equal to 0 33 the nominal significant wave height is equal to 7 m corresponding to sea state 7 high according to the world meteorological organization wmo definition the statistics of ship motions rudder angle immersion probes water on deck are addressed which was never done before validation studies include roll decay at zero speed with variable roll gyradius and self propulsion in calm water to assess revolution per minute rpm values versus efd data the stochastic validation of free running cfd is achieved by statistical assessment of efd data provided by the maritime research institute of netherlands marin van walree and visser 2010 and cfd results of input waves and ship response times series these are achieved by wave energy spectrum autocovariance and bootstrap analysis following 4 additionally dynamic mode decomposition dmd schmid 2010 is used with both efd and cfd time histories to unveil the underlying ship dynamics diez et al 2021 and shed light on the differences between cfd and efd finally five zero crossing waves statistics and k means clustering lloyd 1982 are used for the identification of wave sequences causing large roll angles for both efd and cfd in the remainder of this paper these sequences are referred to as causal sequences finally as a proof of concept the characteristics of causal sequences are used to define regular wave conditions with the aim to achieve 1 severe large roll angles and 2 rare events capsizing by increasing the wave amplitude the present study is conducted within the nato science and technology organization applied vehicle technology avt research task group avt 280 on the evaluation of prediction methods for ship performance in heavy weather where several prediction methods hull forms and conditions were addressed the test case in this paper addresses the most severe conditions sea state 7 among those studied in avt 280 2 test case the hull form under investigation is the marin model 7967 which is equivalent to 5415m this is a geosim replica of the dtmb 5415 model but with different appendages designed by marin the dtmb 5415 is an open to public naval combatant hull geometry fig 1 top shows the 1 35 48 scale model and fig 1 bottom shows the model during a test run the main particulars of the ship are given in table 1 2 1 test conditions the experiments were performed by 27 and consisted of free running tests in waves with measurement of motions and water levels on the weather deck it is noted that the loading condition of the model did not satisfy naval stability criteria in order to achieve large roll amplitude motions in waves the model was manufactured at marin of wood and appended with skeg twin split bilge keels twin rudders and rudder seats slanted outwards shafts with v type brackets and struts and counter rotating twin propellers the rudder was of the spade type the lateral area of the rudders was 2 15 4 m 2 i e 2 1 8 of the lateral area of the vessel l p p t the propellers were fixed pitch type with the direction of rotation inward over the top the model was self propelled and kept on course by a proportional derivative pd controller actuating the rudder angle β at time t as follows 1 β t k p ψ ψ target ψ t k d ψ d ψ target ψ t d t k p y y target y t the pd controller coefficients are shown in table 2 the sway motion was included with a weak gain to keep the model near the center of the basin the free running tests were performed with propeller rpm fixed to the self propulsion point of the model for the envisaged speed the self propulsion point was determined with speed trail test in calm water the experiments were conducted in marin s seakeeping and maneuvering basin measuring 170 40 5 m in length width and depth respectively the basin wave makers enabled generation of regular and long short crested irregular waves from any direction relative to the free sailing model beaches on the opposite sides absorbed the incoming waves a main carriage x direction and a sub carriage y direction followed the model and provided the required power and data storage no wind makers were included in the experiments the experimental data were made available by the cooperative research navies crn group see 27 2 2 efd validation data set efd data set includes a total of 16 test cases specifically efd test cases differ in nominal significant wave height 7 5 10 0 and 12 5 m modal period 9 and 10 5 s wave heading 300 and 330 deg nominal speed 12 18 and 24 kn run length and number of repetitions runs from 2 to 7 the experiments were conducted in irregular long crested waves following a jonswap spectrum the spectral shape was obtained from wave height measurements with a static wave probe in the center of the basin the spectrum s as a function of the angular frequency ω is defined as 2 s ω α g 2 ω 5 e 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ e ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 with 3 ω p 2 π t p and 4 σ 0 07 for ω ω p σ 0 09 for ω ω p where g is gravity acceleration ω p is the peak angular frequency associated with the spectral component with maximum wave energy and α 0 0168 in full scale γ 3 3 and σ are the spectral shape parameters the measured signals include motions velocities and accelerations for the ship six degrees of freedom dof and the wave elevation along the waterline and on the weather deck at nine locations two locations are used here as shown in fig 2 in addition four acoustic wave probes fixed to the main carriage x direction were used to record the incident wave elevation at locations surrounding the model details of the location of wave elevation probes for the model at rest relative to the longitudinal midship location station 10 st 10 are shown in fig 2 the stochastic validation of cfd results is presented for test case 217 van walree and visser 2010 which is selected as benchmark for current study since i presents large roll angles including one rare event capsizing and ii has the largest number of runs the test case collects 7 efd runs at nominal fr 0 33 with nominal peak period t p 9 2 s and wave heading of 300 deg it is close to the resonance condition for the roll as shown in fig 3 the nominal significant wave height h 1 3 is close to 6 m and lays in between sea states 6 very rough and 7 high according to the wmo definition nevertheless the actual significant wave height observed in the experiments equals 7 m which identifies a sea state equal to 7 and is used to select a desired set of cfd runs a total of 130 encounter waves were recorded with an average of 20 encounter waves per run the average run length per run is close to 300 s in full scale the model scale data rate is equal to 198 8 hz severe roll motions of more than 50 deg were recorded 3 cfd method the code cfdship iowa v4 5 huang et al 2008 is used for the cfd computations cfdship iowa is an overset block structured cfd solver designed for ship applications using either an absolute or a relative inertial non orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system for arbitrary moving control volumes turbulence models include blended k ɛ k ω based isotropic and anisotropic rans and des approaches with either integration to the wall or wall functions a single phase level set method is used for free surface capturing captive semi captive and full 6 dof capabilities for multi objects with parent child hierarchy are available the actual propeller or body force propeller model can be employed for propulsion proportional integral derivative pid controllers are available to correct the error between a measured process variable and a desired set point by calculating and then outputting a corrective action that can adjust the process accordingly numerical methods include advanced iterative solvers higher order finite differences with the conservative formulation piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators or projection methods for pressure velocity coupling and parallelization with mpi based domain decomposition dynamic overset grids use suggar the structured unstructured and generalized overset grid assembler code developed by noack 2005 to compute the domain connectivity 3 1 computational setup for the current study absolute inertial earth fixed coordinates are employed the turbulence is computed by the isotropic menter s blended k ɛ k ω bkw model with shear stress transport sst using no wall function the location of the free surface is given by the zero value of the level set function positive in the water and negative in the air the 6 dof rigid body equations of motion are solved to calculate linear and angular motions of the ship a simplified non interactive body force model is used for the propeller which prescribes axisymmetric body force with axial and tangential components the body force field is applied at the position occupied by the propellers described by a disk volume extended radially from r h to r p and axially from p 1 x y z to p 2 x y z which also define the propeller axis whose values are listed in table 3 the propeller model requires the open water curves and advance coefficient j as input and provides the torque and thrust forces the open water curves see fig 4 are defined as a second order polynomial fit of the experimental k t j and k q j curves as follow 5 k t j c t 0 c t 1 j c t 2 j 2 6 k q j c q 0 c q 1 j c q 2 j 2 the trust and torque coefficient for the polynomial fit are summarized in table 3 the advance coefficient j is based on the ship instantaneous velocity at the center of gravity and does not consider the actual propeller inflow the governing equations are discretized using finite difference schemes on body fitted curvilinear grids the time derivatives in the turbulence and momentum equations are discretized using second order finite euler backward difference convection terms in the turbulence and momentum equations are discretized with higher order upwind formula the viscous terms in the momentum and turbulent equations are computed with similar considerations using a second order difference scheme the piso algorithm is solved using the petsc toolkit suggar is used to obtain the overset interpolation information an mpi based domain decomposition approach is used where each decomposed block is mapped to one processor for boundary conditions the no slip condition is applied on the solid surfaces the far field boundary conditions are imposed on the top and bottom of the background the irregular wave boundary conditions are applied for inlet outlet and side surfaces of the domain the irregular wave boundary is based on a linear superposition of n 80 elemental wave components the amplitude ζ i for each component is derived from the spectrum as 7 ζ i 2 s ω i δ ω i where ω i is the wave angular frequency and δ ω i is the frequency band around ω i the ω i values for the components are selected evenly distributed within 0 41 and 1 47 rad s for the current study as in the efd campaign with a constant δ ω 0 0135 rad s the phase for each component is selected randomly nominal jonswap spectrum for the encounter wave is shown in fig 5 free running cfd simulations are conducted for the 5415m model model scale l p p 4 m at fr 0 33 and re 6 62e 06 with constant propeller rpm to mimic the experimental procedures self propulsion computations in calm water with speed controller are used to find the rpm providing the nominal froude number 3 2 domain grids and time step the computational domain is a rectangular cuboid defined by 2 0 x l p p 1 1 1 21 y l p p 1 21 1 00 z l p p 0 25 the ship axis is aligned with the x axis with the bow at x l p p 0 and the stern at x l p p 1 the free surface at rest lies at z l p p 0 the model is appended with the skeg bilge keels rudders rudder seats shafts and shaft brackets as in the experimental model but not appended with actual propellers the computational grids are overset with independent grids for the hull appendages refinement and background and then assembled to generate the total grid the hull boundary layer grids are generated with a hyperbolic grid generator using a double o topology one each for the starboard and the port sides the bilge keels and skeg use h topology grids and overset the boundary layer grids two double o grids are used for each rudder such that inboard and outboard sides are conformal o topology grids are used for the rudder seats shafts and shaft brackets a cartesian grid is used to impose the far field boundary conditions and to resolve the flow far from the hull with a refinement cartesian block close to the stern the total number of grid points is about 45m details of the grids are shown in table 4 and fig 6 simulation nondimensional time step is set equal to 0 004 which corresponds to 0 008 s in model scale and a data rate equal to 129 2 hz at nominal speed with no motions the ship travels one ship length in 250 time steps and one wavelength corresponding to the modal period in 350 time steps for the current test case cfd simulation time was approximately 1m cpu hours for a full scale duration of 1 hour on a hpc system with 2 7 ghz intel xeon platinum cores grid sensitivity analysis for the fully appended model is very time consuming and beyond the scope of the present work nevertheless grid verification for the bare hull was performed in earlier work serani et al 2021 where grid convergence index uncertainties were found smaller than 2 and 4 for resistance and the motions rms on average in regular head waves for the hull appended with bilge keels only 30 showed insensitivity to the grid using grid refinement ratio of 2 0 25 and finest boundary layer and bilge keels grids of 2 3m points with an uncertainty smaller than 1 associated to the roll angle in roll decay analysis 4 stochastic validation methods the current work follows the approach proposed by 4 for irregular wave validation studies statistical assessment and validation are studied for time series values of wave elevation ζ ship motions rudder angle ship x and y velocities and immersion probes assessment and validation methods include fourier analysis for the assessment of the wave energy spectrum moments analysis of the autocovariance ac and moving block bootstrap mbb for the statistical uncertainty of expected value ev standard deviation sd and quantiles of the wave elevation primary variable the statistical uncertainty of wave amplitude secondary variable ev sd and quantile is evaluated by standard bootstrap efron 1981 method assuming independent and identically distributed random variable the combined use of the kernel density estimator miecznikowski et al 2010 with bootstrap methods provides validation values and uncertainties for the probability density function pdf the same methodologies are used to evaluate the statistical uncertainties associated with the ship motions rudder angle ship x and y velocities and immersion probes where ac and mbb methods are used for primary variables and bootstrap is used for secondary variables errors and confidence intervals of the statistical estimators are used to define validation criteria of cfd outputs versus efd benchmark values 4 1 spectral moments the wave energy spectrum moments m 0 m 1 and m 2 are evaluated as 8 m k 0 ω k s ω d ω k 0 1 2 where s ω a 2 ω 2 and a is the elemental wave component amplitude numerically eq 8 is evaluated using discrete fourier transform of the time series 4 2 statistics of interest statistics of interest are the expected value ev standard deviation sd cumulative distribution function cdf and probability density function pdf they are evaluated numerically using a sample of m items items are extracted from time series as ξ i ξ t i i 1 m for secondary variables amplitudes m mean crossing waves are identified and the associated ξ i defined note that the sample size is different for primary and secondary variables the statistics of interest are evaluated as follows 9 ev ξ 1 m i 1 m ξ i 10 sd ξ 1 m 1 i 1 m ξ i ev ξ 2 11 cdf ξ y 1 m i 1 m δ ξ i y the pdf is here evaluated using kernel density estimation miecznikowski et al 2010 as 12 pdf ξ y 1 m h i 1 m 1 2 π exp y ξ i 2 2 h 2 where h sd ξ m 1 5 is a bandwidth silverman 2018 4 3 autocovariance analysis the analysis of the ac is used to provide confidence intervals for ev and sd of primary variables time series values validation values are directly provided by eqs 9 and 10 whereas confidence intervals are evaluated using the variance of the mean v ar ev and the variance of the variance v ar sd 2 belenky et al 2015 respectively defined as 13 v ar ev sd 2 m 2 m i 1 m i 1 i m r τ i 14 v ar sd 2 2sd 4 m 4 m i 1 m i 1 i m r τ i 2 where r τ i is the autocovariance function here used in the following weighted form 15 r τ i 1 m j 1 m i ξ j ev ξ ξ j 1 ev ξ the statistical uncertainties associated to ev and sd are evaluated at the 95 confidence interval assuming a normal distribution for the ev estimated as 16 u ev 2 v ar ev and by the central limit theorem for the sd as 17 u sd sd 1 2 v ar sd 2 sd 2 1 4 4 moving block bootstrap method to define the validation values and confidence intervals of statistical estimators of eqs 9 12 a mbb method is applied to time series using a number c m l 1 of moving blocks each formed by ξ i i j j l 1 where j is the block index and l 2 φ c 2 3 m 1 3 is an optimal block length carlstein et al 1986 with 18 φ m i 1 m 1 ξ i 1 ev ξ ξ i ev ξ m 1 i 1 m ξ i ev ξ 2 and c 1 φ 1 φ from the original set of c blocks a number of c m l blocks are drawn at random with replacement and concatenated in the order they are picked forming a new bootstrapped series of size m q 100 bootstrapped series are used here ev and sd are evaluated as per eqs 9 and 10 the cdf is assessed by quantile function q evaluated at probabilities p 0 025 0 1 0 2 0 8 0 9 0 975 sorting all the ξ t i i 1 m within each bootstrapped series such that ξ t i 1 ξ t i ξ t i 1 then 19 q p ξ p m the validation value for ev and its 95 confidence lower and upper bounds are evaluated as 20 ev median ev b ev 0 5 q 21 ev l ev 0 025 q and ev u ev 0 975 q where ev b represents the ev value of the q th bootstrapped series ordered such as ev b 1 ev b ev b 1 finally 22 u ev 0 5 ev u ev l the validation values and confidence interval for sd are similarly evaluated 4 5 bootstrap method the validation and confidence intervals of secondary variables are evaluated by the bootstrap method efron 1981 the method constructs an empirical probability function from the sample assumed independent and identically distributed assigning a probability of 1 n to each item this represents the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the actual distribution the associated empirical cdf is given by eq 11 from the empirical cdf it is calculated a number b of new sets each containing new random items ξ i i 1 n defined as 23 ξ i cdf 1 p i where p i are n uniformly distributed random items in 0 1 ordering the original items such that ξ i 1 ξ i ξ i 1 the new items ξ i are 24 ξ i j p i n validation values and 95 confidence intervals for ev sd and quantiles are evaluated similarly to mbb method 4 6 validation metrics input irregular wave from both efd and cfd is assessed and validated versus nominal benchmark values from the spectrum specifically the error associated with efd and cfd wave energy spectrum moments is evaluated as 25 e m k efd or cfd m k n where superscripts n indicates nominal values for primary and secondary variables the validation error for ev is evaluated as 26 e ev cfd ev efd and associated validation uncertainty is assessed as following 27 u v u ev cfd 2 u ev efd 2 validation is achieved if e u v sd validation error and uncertainty are similarly assessed 4 7 dynamic mode decomposition dmd schmid 2010 is applied to motion time histories as an additional approach to assess the underlying ship dynamics diez et al 2021 and shed light onto similarities and differences between efd and cfd results dmd is a data driven and equation free dimensionality reduction reduced order modeling method which provides a linear representation of a possibly nonlinear system dynamics by means of a set of complex conjugate modes ϕ k and frequencies ω k the resulting reduced order model can be used for diagnostic state estimation future state prediction and control kutz et al 2016 here dmd is used to unveil motion correlation and compare efd and cfd modes frequencies and modal participation details of assumptions and equations for dmd in general may be found in 11 example applications to ship maneuvering in waves are given in 5 5 causal sequence identification approach severe events ses are defined using an arbitrary threshold value σ based on the roll amplitude sd whereas capsizings are assumed rare events by definition ses occur when the roll amplitude is greater than ev σ sd their analysis includes the assessment of the wave sequence causing the event specifically z 5 zero crossing waves are here considered as shown in fig 7 the assessment is based on the within the sequence ev and sd of wave height amplitude and encounter period as well as on their weighted counterpart ev w and sd w respectively defined as 28 ev w ξ i 1 z w i ξ i i 1 z w i 29 sd w ξ 1 z 1 i 1 z ξ i ev w ξ 2 1 z i 1 z w i where w i are the weights additionally the k means clustering method lloyd 1982 is used to identify the data cluster associated to ses or at least large roll angles it allows to build partitions of the data in k different sets clusters defined by representative points centroids here wave sequence parameters are used to form the desired data points d j the assignment of data points to k clusters is achieved by minimization of the within cluster sum of squares wcss 30 wcss i 1 k d j k i d j μ i 2 where μ i are the cluster centroids evaluated by averaging all data points within the i th cluster k i the wcss in eq 30 is used as evaluation metrics to identify the optimal number of clusters k specifically the elbow method ketchen and shook 1996 is used with the wcss metrics as additional clustering metrics the silhouette is used the silhouette method provides a metrics of consistency of data within clusters rousseeuw 1987 assume a i as the average euclidean distance between d i and any other data point within the cluster d i belongs to assume then c i as the smallest average euclidean distance of d i to all data points in any other cluster d i does not belong to the silhouette associated to d i is defined as 31 s i a i c i max a i c i and is a measure of how similar the data point is to points in its own cluster as opposed to other clusters it may be noted that s i ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates maximum similarity the average silhouette of all data points is used as a metrics for proper data clustering 32 s avg i 1 h s i note that for k 1 the silhouette is not defined by convention for k 1 it is s avg 0 6 numerical results in this section numerical results are presented for the wave elevation at probe 2 see fig 2 the ship motions surge sway heave roll pitch yaw the rudder angle x and y velocities and immersion probes r3 and r5 including the statistics of primary time series values and secondary amplitudes variables errors and uncertainties for the statistical estimators provided by bootstrap methods are normalized with 2sd ship motions are observed in the carriage coordinate system and projected onto the ship axes unless differently specified values are expressed for the full scale results are also presented for the dmd of relevant variables and the analysis of wave sequences causing severe events 6 1 roll decay validation in calm water fig 8 shows 5415m roll decay at zero speed in calm water comparing efd and cfd results in 27 a k x x 0 413 b value was determined by means of roll decay tests in the marin basin at zero speed a natural roll period equal to t 16 30 s in full scale was then determined from the recorded roll motion time series with an assumed added mass in water the k x x was determined and ballast was adjusted to meet the required value the weakness in this approach is the assumed added mass for roll which is normally in between 10 and 20 of the mass moment of inertia in air the actual value used depends on the appendage configuration for destroyer type ships with relatively large twin rudders propeller axes brackets and bilge keels it is difficult to establish an accurate value for the added mass for this reason cfd preliminary tests and validation of k x x b value are conducted using the following four values 0 385 0 400 0 413 and 0 428 cfd replicates efd tests by releasing the ship from an initial roll angle of 21 deg using 6 dof simulations validation results are summarized in table 5 including average decay period t based on first 3 periods logarithmic decrement δ and percent errors e a k x x 0 385 b is found to match efd results with an error of 0 3 for the average decay period and about 10 error for the logarithmic decrement this value is selected for the cfd simulations that follow it may be noted that the error between efd and cfd estimation of the k x x is close to 7 that is lower than the typical uncertainty of efd results about 8 for twin propeller and rudder configurations the k x x assessment is still an open issue for validation studies and different cfd solvers have shown similar discrepancy with efd see e g visonneau et al 2020 sanada et al 2020 furthermore it is worth noting that nowadays marin uses an oscillating table to determine the full inertia matrix of the models the measurement accuracy for the k x x is much better than that obtained from a swing table and the problem of assuming an added mass in water does not exist anymore 6 2 self propulsion rpm validation in calm water fig 9 and table 6 show the rpm validation using self propulsion computations in calm water the test is conducted with the self propelled ship aiming at constant speed corresponding to fr 0 33 the cfd simulation achieves the target fr with an rpm lower than efd of about 3 and equal to 922 in model scale see the corresponding nominal j in fig 4 since the aim of the present work is to perform cfd simulations at the same efd speed at least considering the nominal speed this value is used for cfd simulations in irregular waves 6 3 input wave validation eight cfd runs are computed to achieve a total of 215 encounter waves input wave validation is based on wave probe 2 since it is the least affected by the ship wake and or motion generated waves validation is presented in terms of spectral moments m 0 m 1 and m 2 in table 7 cfd errors versus nominal values are smaller than efd and the average absolute error of cfd vs efd is equal to 24 to achieve a closer agreement between efd and cfd input waves a subset of cfd runs is selected to this aim cfd runs are sorted based on their wave probe 2 root mean square rms a subset of 5 cfd runs is then selected considering a trade off between the cumulative rms see fig 10 top and the cumulative number of roll periods see fig 10 bottom compared to those provided by efd data rms values in fig 10 top are shown along with the associated uncertainty evaluated by ac analysis selecting 5 cfd runs the average absolute error of cfd vs efd for the input wave reduces to 6 4 see table 7 efd and cfd encounter spectra are compared to the nominal jonswap in fig 5 it may be noted that the wave probe can be to some extent affected by the wave produced by the ship motion the energy shift towards higher frequencies of efd and cfd compared to the nominal distribution is quite noticeable indicating a nonlinear wave development and possibly effects of interaction with the ship finally the ac of efd and selected cfd runs for wave probe 2 is shown in fig 11 the curves are quite reasonable also considering that the spectrum is quite narrow banded table 8 shows the encounter wave validation for primary variables time series values using ac and mbb methods and secondary variables amplitudes using the bootstrap method validation is achieved for wave elevation sd about 5 2 error by mbb method and wave amplitude ev about 5 8 error by bootstrap method errors are normalized with 2sd as a metric of data range finally fig 12 shows the quantiles and pdf of wave elevation and amplitude using mbb and bootstrap methods respectively both efd and cfd values are shown along with nominal and theoretical distribution revealing a good agreement 6 4 ship motions and velocities rudder angle and immersion probes validation results are summarized in figs 13 and 14 and tables 9 and 10 specifically fig 13 compares efd and cfd ship motions primary and secondary variables showing pdf and quantile function whereas velocities rudder angle and immersion probes results are shown in fig 14 the results are in good agreement primary variables see table 9 are validated with an average error of 9 6 and 8 8 for ev and sd respectively and the corresponding uncertainties are equal to 11 1 and 11 5 considering ship motions only secondary variables see motion avg row in table 10 ev s are validated with an average error equal to 10 6 and the validation uncertainty equal to 16 9 secondary variables sds are validated on average with an error equal to 13 2 and the validation uncertainty equal to 17 3 planar motions surge sway and yaw present the higher errors discrepancies with respect to efd this can be related to the use of the simplified body force propeller model instead of the actual discretized propeller especially for the surge nevertheless surge sway and yaw show the largest uncertainties for both efd and cfd a deeper analysis would require reducing the uncertainties and therefore run longer efd distribution for the roll angle shows an evident bi modal shape which is very well captured by cfd see fig 13 this confirms the resonant condition for the roll motion which contributes achieving large roll angles it may be noted that the bi modal double peak shape of the roll pdf is mainly due to the sinusoidal shape of the roll signal additionally even if there were no bulwarks on the model and the water is not trapped on the deck for large roll angle the righting moment m x s where s stays for ship reference system reduces due to the weight of the water on the deck as shown in fig 15 also contributing to the bi modal shape of the roll pdf as an example fig 15 shows one roll period of a regular wave cfd run described in the following subsection and the corresponding total righting moment along with the hull and deck contributions it is clearly visible how the water on the deck reduces the total righting moment furthermore the flow of water around the sharp deck edge causes additional roll damping also contributing to the pdf double peak fig 15 bottom shows the moment contributions as a function of the roll angle during the regular wave run it may be noted how the resulting moment is asymmetric and also depends on the roll rate positive versus negative rate being the motion affected by the wave direction nonlinearities emerge clearly for large roll angles especially for negative values when the deck faces the wave further indications of water on deck are derived from the immersion probes signals here probes r3 and r5 are used laying in between stations 7 and 8 at port and starboard sides see fig 2 respectively efd and cfd distributions are in a fairly reasonable agreement as fig 14 shows both efd and cfd distributions of both probes primary variable present a significant peak corresponding to 5 m immersion this corresponds to the peaks observed in the bi modal roll distribution in fig 13 it is interesting to note how efd and cfd peaks are very well aligned for starboard side probe 5 which sees the wave stepping away from the ship for port side probe 3 which sees the wave approaching and impacting the ship cfd overpredicts the peak location suggesting wave breaking and spray effects are significant and not well captured by the level set method based on the current analysis efd and cfd speed loss equal to 1 3 and 3 4 respectively this difference may be due to having used a different rpm for cfd compared to efd namely efd rpm equals 950 nominally providing with the target speed corresponding to fr 0 33 in calm water cfd provided with an rpm equal to 922 for the same nominal speed of fr 0 33 in calm water as observed in fig 14 efd and cfd distributions of x velocity are reasonably close nevertheless cfd shows a slightly smaller mean value and a smaller variability which again may be due to the use of the simplified body force propeller model finally to unveil the underlying dynamics and the motion correlation dmd of efd and cfd time histories is performed the ship 6 dof surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw and the rudder angle are used as dmd variables variables are standardized and an exact full rank dmd is applied diez et al 2021 twenty encounter periods from the largest variance runs are used for the analysis with both efd and cfd modes ϕ k are ranked based on their modal participation ℜ q k 2 where q k are the coordinates of the system state dmd variables in the modes basis couples of complex conjugate modes frequencies are grouped together in the modal participation analysis fig 16 top shows the participation of efd and cfd modes fig 16 center presents the modal participation as a function of the mode angular frequency ℑ ω k finally fig 16 bottom shows the magnitude of the mode components for the two most energetic couples of complex conjugate modes it may be noted how overall the modal participation is reasonably captured by cfd computations but modes 3 and 4 that are significantly underrepresented in cfd compared to efd fig 16 top the most energetic and fast modes are very well captured by cfd and correspond to the roll resonance condition as fig 16 center shows conversely modes 3 and 4 correspond to a slower dynamics and not well captured by cfd finally fig 16 bottom shows how modes 1 and 2 most energetic fast mainly involves roll pitch yaw rudder and to a lesser extent heave whereas modes 3 and 4 mainly involves planar motion variables i e surge sway yaw and to a lesser extent rudder dmd results suggest that the differences between cfd and efd in surge probability distribution and in general errors for planar motion variables have a double origin firstly the modes involving planar motion variables k 3 4 are underrepresented in cfd computations secondly looking at the mode components derived from cfd it emerges how the surge is underrepresented if compared to efd this again may be attributed to the simplified body force propeller model and will motivate future studies on the most convenient approach to propeller modeling 6 5 causal sequence identification due to the use of sequences and the finite number of efd and cfd runs the number of usable waves is lower than the actual number of recorded waves specifically the number of usable waves is equal to 92 and 102 for efd and cfd respectively the percentage of severe events is evaluated versus the threshold value σ for the roll amplitude selecting a threshold of σ 1 5 sd corresponding to a roll amplitude of 39 and 37 deg for efd and cfd respectively about 15 and 5 of the events are considered as severe for efd and cfd respectively see table 11 the corresponding wave sequences are shown in fig 17 for all wave sequences the ev w and sd w are evaluated for wave heights amplitudes and encounter periods the weights used are inversely proportional to the wave index where 1 indicates the closest to the severe event and 5 the farthest in the past average values for all waves and only those causing severe events are summarized in table 12 it can be noted that all the wave sequences have an encounter period close to the natural roll period confirming that the ship is sailing close to the resonant condition for roll the common denominator of the wave sequences causing the ses is identified in small values of the sd for both wave height and encounter period this mean that the ses are caused by nearly regular waves close to resonance condition as an additional analysis k means clustering is performed for the roll amplitude caused by the sequence wave height and encounter period within the sequence sds standardized data are used the optimal number of clusters for the representation of current data is defined by the wcss and the silhouette these are shown in fig 18 which reveals that four clusters are a good compromise for current data clusterization clusters of efd and cfd are shown in fig 19 results are consistent with earlier findings and show how reducing wave height and encounter period sd s produces larger roll angles see cluster 1 for both efd and cfd efd and cfd results are remarkably consistent 6 6 deterministic reconstruction of severe and rare events by regular wave cfd simulations the deterministic reconstruction of ses is based on regular wave cfd simulations it may be noted that the choice of running regular as opposed to irregular waves is determined after severe and rare events are identified along with the corresponding wave sequences and statistical and clustering analyses is performed for the current test case and both efd and cfd data severe rare events are caused by wave sequences characterized by encounter waves with almost identical height and period small sd of these parameters within the wave sequence close to resonance condition for the roll motion therefore it can be concluded that in this case approximately regular waves are causing severe rare events and therefore regular waves are used for the recreation of such events accordingly two proof of concept approaches are shown here 1 reconstruction of ses using wave amplitude and period identified as condition causing ses 2 reconstruction of rare events capsizing increasing the wave amplitude a regular wave is used characterized by wave amplitude and encounter period as per table 12 a 0 2 85 m and t e 15 96 s fig 20 compares the cfd stochastic wave sequences causing the ses and the deterministic regular wave used for the first proof of concept for the second proof of concept a parametric analysis increasing the wave amplitude is conducted specifically three further cfd simulations are performed with a 1 1 1 2 and 1 4 times a 0 the results of the deterministic reconstruction of severe and rare events are shown in fig 21 wave elevation at probe 2 and ship motions using the deterministic wave the roll motion reaches the se threshold whereas the rare event capsizing is achieved with a 1 4 a 0 it may be noted that in this latter case the encounter wave frequency suddenly increases see fig 21 top after about 100 s as the ship is upside down and stopping its course as well as the numerical carriage it is also worth noting that capsizing is not associated with surf riding ahead and broaching roll resonance produces large roll angles in the highly nonlinear regime causing one of the propellers to operate out of the water with the subsequent reduced thrust and slip back from the wave crest into the throat as fig 21 shows it is also interesting to note how the inflection point for the roll inception of capsizing occurs when the pitch is at its peak bow down finally a comparison of the ship attitude in deterministic wave at the first eight roll peaks is shown in fig 22 the results are compared to those obtained in irregular waves for one of the sequences causing severe roll angles first column showing a remarkable agreement 7 conclusions and future work the stochastic assessment and validation of urans simulations of free running 5415m model in stern quartering waves at sea state 7 is presented validation studies also include roll decay at zero speed and self propulsion rpm studies roll decay and self propulsion studies are successfully performed specifically efd k x x b value of 0 413 produce a 6 error for the roll damped period when used with cfd therefore a k x x b value equal to 0 385 is selected for cfd runs in waves achieving an error for the roll period equal to only 0 3 cfd self propelled simulations in calm water achieve the target fr 0 33 with an rpm lower than efd of about 3 this is used for cfd runs in waves the stochastic validation of the input wave is achieved by spectral analysis autocovariance and bootstrap methods efd data include 7 runs for a total of 130 encounter waves cfd simulations include 8 runs for a total of 215 encounter waves efd versus nominal spectrum shows an error of 41 for the zero th moment therefore selected cfd runs are used to achieve an input wave as close as possible to efd specifically 5 runs are used with 132 encounter waves these provide with an error equal to 6 1 for the zero th moment 1 5 for the wave sd and 5 8 for the wave amplitude ev efd and cfd stochastic uncertainties are both close to 10 a reduction of the uncertainty would require both efd and cfd to run longer note that ev and sd errors and uncertainties are normalized with 2sd which is used as a metric for the data range the statistical assessment and validation of cfd versus efd response is achieved by bootstrap methods ship motions sds are validated on average with an error of 8 3 and an associated uncertainty of 14 3 ship velocity ev s are validated with an error equal to 6 2 and an uncertainty equal to 11 3 rudder angle sd is also validated with error and uncertainty equal to 4 1 and 12 3 respectively planar motion variables present the higher errors discrepancies compared to efd which may be attributed to the use of the simplified body force propeller model especially for the surge this is confirmed by the dmd analysis where two modes clearly emerges from motion time histories the first and fast dynamics is associated to roll resonance mainly involves roll pitch yaw rudder and to a lesser extent heave and is very well captured by cfd the second and slower dynamics mainly involves planar motion variables and to a lesser extent rudder and is underrepresented in cfd results finally immersion probes ev s and sds show an average error close to 12 with an associated uncertainty close to 9 likely due to the use of the level set method in combination with rough waves and large motions for the same variables amplitudes are assessed showing similar trends although with larger errors and uncertainties conditions causing severe events large roll angles are identified considering sequences of five encounter waves and their statistics average ev w and sd w of wave amplitude height and encounter periods severe events are identified when the roll amplitude exceeds its ev 1 5 sd which corresponds to 39 and 37 degrees for efd and cfd respectively about 15 and 5 of efd and cfd sequences respectively are identified as causing extremely large roll angles these sequences are characterized by an almost regular wave inducing roll resonance specifically the within sequence sd w of both wave height and encounter period reduces significantly if compared to all sequences in efd and cfd records this result is confirmed by k means clustering analysis which shows how the cluster with the largest roll amplitudes corresponds to small within sequence sds of wave height and period efd and cfd produce remarkably close results based on this analysis two proof of concept results are achieved first severe events large roll angle are reconstructed by regular wave cfd simulations second a rare event capsizing is achieved by increasing the wave amplitude it may be noted how large roll angles arise in the nonlinear regime and identify conditions where the ship is on the verge of capsizing results show how capsizing is mainly due to roll resonance as opposed to surf riding and broaching instabilities overall the objectives of current study are achieved namely cfd urans validation for heavy weather identification of severe and rare events and deterministic reconstruction as a proof of concept the results are in general affected by the use of a simplified non interactive body forced model for the propeller that for the objective of the present study statistical validation of relevant variables in irregular waves was deemed reasonable within the activities of the nato avt 280 task group to achieve better validation results the use of more sophisticated body force models as well as a fully discretized propellers is under investigation within the nato avt 348 task group on the assessment of experiments and prediction methods for naval ships maneuvering in waves nevertheless since these methodologies can be quite expensive a good compromise between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency can be given by coupling potential flow and rans solvers as shown in 3 it may be finally emphasized that stochastic cfd simulations are too expensive to be advocated as a method to identify rare events on a large sample basis nevertheless if rare events are identified either anecdotally by captain by expensive model tests data and or by reduced order models lower fidelity but faster such that large samples can be achieved and assuming sufficient environmental information is available cfd is able to a reproduce statistically the response based on a smaller sample and b deterministically reconstruct severe events for detailed studies future work will include further analysis for the identification and assessment of the severe events based on stochastic distribution of regular waves he et al 2013 and sequential sampling strategy mohamad and sapsis 2018 extensions to other test cases not in resonance conditions are also advisable and will be considered for future studies finally the current work lay the ground for the deterministic
