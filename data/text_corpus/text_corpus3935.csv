19675,the accumulation of fog fat oil and grease deposits in sewer pumping stations results in an increase in maintenance costs malfunctioning of pumps and a potential increase of wastewater spills in receiving open water bodies it is thought that a variety of parameters e g geometry of the pump sump pump operation socioeconomic parameters of the catchment influences the built up of fog based on a database containing data of 126 pumping stations located in five dutch municipalities a statistical model was built it is shown that 3 parameters are most significant in explaining the occurrence of fog deposits mean income of the population in a catchment the amount of energy kinetic and potential per m3 per day and the density of restaurants bars and hotels in a catchment further it is shown that there are significant differences between municipalities that can be traced back to the local design paradigm for example in amsterdam the design philosophy of discharging in the pump sump under the water surface and hence maintaining a low level of turbulence in the pump sump results in an increase of the probability of the formation of fog graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer system pumping station fat oil and grease fog deposits generalized linear mixed modelling 1 introduction sewer systems are vital for public health and city life sewer blockages are found to be the dominant failure mechanism in sewer systems arthur et al 2009 ashley et al 2004 in the united states almost half of all sewer blockages are related to fat oil and grease fog deposits epa 2004 fog deposits are accumulated suspended solids in sewer systems and have an adhesive character they can become firmly attached to interior sewer pipe walls thereby substantially reducing and sometimes even completely blocking the wastewater flow desilva et al 2011 they have a grainy sandstone like texture with high yield strengths keener et al 2008 that require intensive cleaning activities such as hydraulic jetting dirksen et al 2012 mattsson et al 2014 it is often thought that fog deposits in public sewer lines result from solidified cooking oils as they are poured down the drain and cool down in downstream sewer lines the formation mechanisms however have appeared to be much more complex keener et al 2008 showed they are basically metallic soaps mainly consisting of saturated fatty acids and calcium later research described the mechanism of fog deposit formation in sewer pipes as the saponification process between calcium and free fatty acids together with the aggregation of excess calcium unreacted fatty acids and debris in wastewater that are drawn towards the solid core matrix of saponified solids he et al 2013 in addition recent work of gross et al 2017 showed that fog deposits can also be the result of acids crystallization implying that fog deposits can also be formed without the presence of metals collected samples from different locations within the sewer network showed a wide range in physical and chemical properties he et al 2011 keener et al 2008 nieuwenhuis et al 2017 shin et al 2015 williams et al 2012 different formation processes and accumulation mechanisms were suggested for different network locations he et al 2011 williams et al 2012 which is also in line with the recent laboratory study of gross et al 2017 both at upstream and downstream locations fog deposits are known to accumulate in sewer pipes fog deposits typically tend to accumulate slightly above the low flow water mark keener et al 2008 williams et al 2012 dirksen et al 2012 and dominic et al 2013 identified sagging sewers in particular to be vulnerable to the accumulation of fog for lateral house connections post et al 2016 showed that accumulation of fog is the main failure mechanism in inverted siphons declining parts with the presence of air pockets are particularly prone to fog blockages de groot 2015 in pumping stations fog deposits with three different appearances were found franke et al 2011 mentioned the floating layers of fog accumulating on the walls of pump sumps these layers potentially interfere with the functioning of level regulators in the pump sump depending on the type of level regulators additionally williams et al 2012 collected fog samples in the shape of fat balls from the water surface of pumping stations and dirksen et al 2012 mentioned the occasional detachment of bar shaped deposits in sewer pipes these may end up in pump sumps as such bar shaped deposits were observed in pump sumps during the site visits conducted for this study previous studies mainly focused on the chemical aspects of fog deposit formation although these studies have revealed general information on locations in public sewer systems that are prone to fog accumulation they did not focus on the particular sewer contexts of fog accumulations in addition previous studies hardly elaborated on the probable impact of domestic disposal patterns on fog deposits they focused mainly on food service establishments fses dominic et al 2013 he et al 2011 williams et al 2012 and the fishing and meat industries cammarota and freire 2006 mattsson et al 2014 as the main contributors to fog problems a recent case study in the netherlands showed however that lateral house connections are more susceptible to blockages than main sewers and that fog is the dominant failure mechanism in lateral house connections post et al 2016 this demonstrates that domestic disposal patterns are an important contributor to fog deposits similarly wallace et al 2017 mentioned the contribution of domestic wastewater to fog blockages and a survey done among 127 norwegian and swedish sewer operators reported that respectively 48 and 22 experienced fog related problems in residential areas mattsson et al 2014 they explicitly mentioned the severity of fog accumulation in areas with high rise apartment buildings and a relatively high number of immigrants mattsson et al 2014 considering that aspects of lifestyle may be attributed to demographic groups it is hypothesized that fog problems are related to demographics and vary considerably in severity among catchments and in corresponding pumping stations in addition it is expected that pumping stations with structural configurations that enable low flow velocities are more prone to fog build up the research presented here aims at finding evidence for both hypotheses to this end a statistical study on 126 wastewater pumping stations in five municipalities has been performed 2 materials for investigating the impact of domestic disposal patterns fog deposits were considered on the scale of catchment areas this allowed using demographics of catchments for studying the influence of population disposal patterns statistically data on catchments and corresponding pumping stations were collected in five relatively large dutch municipalities table 1 provides an overview of the participating municipalities and their general characteristics they varied in demographics type of catchments and pumping stations the dataset of residential catchments was composed in close collaboration with the municipalities resulting in binomial data on fog accumulation in pump sumps each observation is represented by one catchment and its pumping station describing the presence or absence of severe accumulation of fog as judged by the sewer manager this judgement represents the state of fog accumulation over multiple years and at least one year it was based on a combination of 1 visual inspection by operators during regular maintenance and 2 available information about cleaning efforts required as the municipalities did not systematically record fog accumulation this was the best available data to avoid discrepancies between cities parameter definitions were discussed beforehand pumping stations without consensus on the severity of fog accumulation or that were lacking crucial information e g construction drawings were excluded from the dataset 2 1 parameter selection the investigated parameters represent general system characteristics and socio demographic from here on called demographic characteristics that are potential indicators for fog disposal patterns or the fog accumulation process statistical analyses require comparable parameters and one representative value per observation the three parameters vertical velocity pump on time and kinetic energy density are therefore introduced representing the geometry of the pumping stations and the hydraulic loading table 2 these parameters are related to the motion of water and hence are suspected to affect the accumulation of fog 2 1 1 vertical velocity the average vertical velocity v vert mh 1 is calculated as 1 v v e r t q p u m p a s u m p where q pump is the pump capacity under dry weather conditions in m3h 1 and a sump m2 the surface area of the pump sump since pumping stations operate under dry weather conditions for about 80 of the time tukker et al 2012 the dry weather flow dwf is taken as the representative hydraulic loading for variable frequency drive vfd pumps the operating schemes have been provided by the municipalities allowing to determine representative values for q pump during dwf 2 1 2 daily operation time the average daily operation time t operation in hours per day is calculated as 2 t o p e r a t i o n q d w f t q p u m p where q dwf is the hourly dwf m3h 1 t is the time h in this case 24 h and q pump is the pump capacity during dwf m3h 1 2 1 3 kinetic energy density the values for kinetic energy density i e the incoming energy per pump sump per day e daypump in jm 3d 1 are based on the values for hourly dwf as provided by the municipalities for each pumping station hourly values for the kinetic energy e kin h jh 1 are summed over the day and divided by the representative water volume in the pump sump v sump m3 3 e d a y p u m p t 1 24 e k i n h v s u m p the amount of kinetic energy that got into the water in the pump sump is calculated as the kinetic energy at the invert level of the inflowing pipe s e kin inv j and the potential energy e pot j of the inflowing water with respect to representative water depth in the pump sump the water level in the pump sump is assumed to be constant 4 e k i n e k i n i n v e p o t where e pot is 5 e p o t m g h where m kg is the mass of the incoming water g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 and h m the fall height of the incoming water assuming a constant water level in the pump sump and where e kin inv is 6 e k i n i n v 1 2 m v 2 where m kg is the mass of the incoming water and v ms 1 the flow velocity the velocities are derived from hourly values for the dwf according to the hourly distribution percentages and the cross sectional area of flow 7 v q d w f a where q dwf m3h 1 is the hourly dwf and a m2 is the cross sectional area of flow the velocity v mh 1 is assumed to be constant for every hour and and the incoming dwf is assumed to be equally divided among all inlet pipes the cross sectional area a m2 depends on the water depth at the location of the inlet during the particular hour this is derived from the representative water depth in the pump sump z m i e the water depth following from the water level in between the switch on and switch off levels of the dwf pump the invert level of the inlet pipe z i m and the average water depth in the pipe at the location of inflow during the particular hour d m for the calculations of the cross sectional area and or the flow velocity and corresponding kinetic energy three situations for representative water depths z at the location of inlet are distinguished see fig 1 for z z i the outlet of the pipe is classified as free outflow close to the end of such pipes flow conditions are critical implying that the non dimensional froude number f r is known and specified as 8 f r v c g d m 1 where v c ms 1 is the critical flow velocity g ms 2 is the gravitational acceleration and d m m is the hydraulic mean depth specified as the cross sectional area of flow per flow width at the water surface for such flow conditions the empirical equation of straub 1978 applies 9 and the critical depth dc m is derived 9 d c d 0 567 q d w f 0 506 d 1 264 where q dwf m3s 1 is the hourly dwf d m is the diameter and dc m the critical depth where 0 02 d c d 0 85 thereafter using geometric and trigonometric equations the hydraulic mean depth d m m as displayed in fig 1 is determined and from 8 the critical flow velocity v c ms 1 is derived for one pumping station the value is slightly below the lower limit d c d 0 007 and for seven pumping stations this value is exceeding the upper limit d c d 1 31 in these cases d c d is assumed to be equal to the lower and upper limits as the specified conditions are only violated for minimum and maximum dwf values the possible influence of the tail water is neglected and the water depth at the outflow is assumed to be equal to the critical depth thus neglecting the drawdown effect for z z i z i d water depth d m is used from 10 with the value of d m confined by d c m 10 d z z i for z z i d full pipe flow is considered geometrical details like the shape of the pump sump or the position of inflow are not considered as the nature of statistical analysis does not allow for such details 2 1 4 demographic data online available geographical data from statistics netherlands on neighbourhood level was used to obtain weighted demographic data per catchment the geographical maps were composed from data from the key registers cadaster and regional data from statistics netherlands statistics netherlands and kadaster 2012 data from the year 2012 was used as this was the most recent dataset covering all parameters needed merging data from different years was infeasible due to changes over the years in the borders of administrative neighbourhoods table 3 provides an overview of the potential explanatory parameters selected from the statistics netherlands database calculations are performed with quantum gis software version 2 0 1 dufour qgis 2013 using the geoprocessing intersect tool a gis layer with the contributing areas of neighbourhoods in each individual catchment was created further data processing is performed using r statistics software version 0 99 893 r core team 2016 the database shows missing values data points that were identified as nihil were replaced by zero and data points that were identified as susceptible to reliability and secrecy were replaced by na not available the total number of inhabitants for each neighbourhood was calculated based on the population density and the surface area of each neighbourhood as derived from qgis calculations representative values for the number of food service establishments fse were derived by summing the average number of restaurants cafes and cafeterias within a travel distance of 1 km for the inhabitants this value was divided by the surface area to obtain a representative value for the fse density the household density for each catchment was calculated by taking the number of households divided by the surface area of each neighbourhood estimations of the demographic characteristics per catchment were obtained by weighing the characteristics according to the catchment s population that the contributing neighbourhoods contained using the catchment weights characteristics per catchment were derived in proportion to their populations the numbers of inhabitants per catchment were based on the population density of the neighbourhoods and the contributing surface areas of the neighbourhoods after pre processing of the data the database of the selected pumping and their system characteristics was merged with the demographic catchment data 2 2 resulting dataset table 4 provides an overview of the data the dataset consisted of 128 observations in total spread over five cities the number of pumping stations varied largely among cities in the entire dataset 53 pumping stations were categorized as clean seventy five pumping stations showed severe accumulation of fog 3 methods this study focused on quantifying the relationship between catchment demographics representing fog disposal patterns the accumulation of fog in pump sumps and whether the pump sump geometry influenced the accumulation of fog a statistical analysis was performed instead of a conventional generalized linear model glm a generalized linear mixed model glmm was applied to account for correlations between the pumping stations that were located in the same city we applied the procedure as presented in fig 2 the procedure consists of four steps data exploration model component selection model selection and model validation 3 1 data exploration a detailed data exploration was performed first relationships between explanatory parameters were investigated following the removal of collinear parameters a glmm was applied on the remaining dataset based on this glmm outliers were detected 3 1 1 collinearity pairwise correlations among explanatory parameters were examined with visual inspection tools and pearson correlation coefficients 0 65 in addition variance inflation factors vifs were used to examine linear dependence among three or more continuous explanatory parameters a maximum vif value of 3 was used more strict than the cut off range of 5 10 as suggested by montgomery et al 1992 one collinear parameter at a time was removed until the values for the vif and pearson correlation coefficient were below the preselected thresholds 3 1 2 sewer operator dependency the pumping stations were examined for operator dependency the data exploration revealed that pumping stations located in the same city showed similarities in their characteristics as this study aims to identify parameters influencing the accumulation of fog in pumping stations revealing the potential effect of unknown city specific parameters was not in the interest of this research a glmm with a random component that accounted for the operator city effect was therefore applied this mixed model structure which is further elaborated in section 3 2 allows making statements on the relationships for similar cities in general it describes the notion of an operator and or city effect inherently of what comprises such effects 3 1 3 outliers based on the glmm with a random component that accounted for the operator city effect and the fixed component containing all parameters that remained after removal of the collinear parameters the dataset was studied for the presence of outliers observations were considered outliers when the severity of fog accumulation was likely to be caused by industry and when the simplifications on pumping station geometry and system layout caused a large discrepancy between the actual values and the calculated values since the response parameter is binary and only covers the presence or absence of fog in the pump sump there is no possibility for outliers in this parameter outliers in the explanatory parameters were investigated exploiting cleveland s dot plots and using cooks distance statistics cook 1977 as a cooks distance cut off the value 4 n k 1 1 with n for the number of observations and k for the number of regression coefficients was set the threshold value was used to enhance graphical interpretation after which the points identified were examined in more detail after removal of the outliers the parameters were checked for collinearity again the removed outliers did not cause the vif values and correlation coefficients to rise above the threshold values set 3 2 glmm component selection and model selection both the glmm component selection and the model selection see fig 2 were based on the protocol for the top down strategy for linear mixed models as recommended by diggle et al 2002 and applied by zuur et al 2009 this protocol suggests starting with a glmm where the fixed component contains all explanatory parameters in the second step the optimal structure of the random component is chosen this induced a correlation structure between pumping stations that were located in the same city the third step focuses on obtaining the optimal fixed structure by means of backward selection the first model contains all explanatory parameters after which the terms are dropped one by one until all terms were significant p 0 05 3 2 1 conditional probability distribution and random component conditional on the random effect b i that accounted for the city effect of city i where the pumping station j was located the distribution of the presence absence of fog accumulation y ij is assumed to be binomially distributed with probability π ij b i the linear predictor η contains both a fixed and a random component following the form of the linear regression model 11 η x i j z i j β x b z where β x is the fixed component and accounts for the fixed effect and b z for the random effect the fixed component is a linear function of the explanatory parameters β is the matrix containing the weights assigned to the explanatory parameters x is the design matrix of the explanatory parameters the random component extends the linear function of the fixed component with a compound symmetrical correlation structure adding a random intercept conditional on city to the fixed intercept it models the inter city variation and assumes that pumping stations that are located in the same city are equally correlated 3 2 2 fixed component the fixed component of the linear predictor is 12 η f i x e d x i j 1 x i j m β 0 β 1 x i j 1 β m x i j m where j is the pumping station in city i m represents the total number of explanatory parameters β i is the coefficient corresponding to the particular explanatory parameter x and β 0 is the intercept term all continuous explanatory parameters were standardized prior to fitting facilitating the comparison of the parameter s weights 3 2 3 link function the relationship between the conditional mean and the explanatory parameters is determined by the logistic link 13 π i j e η β i x i j b i z i j 1 e η β i x i j b i z i j 3 2 4 model specification the final model is 14 ln π i j 1 π i j β x i j b i n 0 σ 2 where π ij is the probability that fog accumulates in the pumping station j in city i β is the vector representing the model coefficients x ij is the vector containing the explanatory parameters for pumping station j which is located in city i b i is the random intercept for city i and is assumed n 0 σ 2 3 3 model selection and model validation a stepwise backwards selection approach was applied to find the optimal model the assumptions for this final model were verified using visual tools the outcome of the glmm was verified by means of a permutational manova as implemented in the vegan package r core team 2016 4 results this section presents the results of the procedure described in section 3 in the model selection process nine parameters were dropped table 5 the cooks distance statistics designated 15 of the 128 observations as potential outliers after further exploration of these marked observations i e by inspecting construction drawings and catchment datasheets two observations were removed as outliers the first pumping station was located in the hague more than 25 of the design dwf of this catchment was attributed to industrial wastewater the other station was located in amsterdam this pumping station had two inlet pipes one of which was a pressurized pipe that transported 72 of all incoming wastewater this specific situation resulted in deviating conditions the thirteen remaining marked observations were also checked for particularities in the pump sump geometry and system type no such particularities were found since the high leverage is thought to result from natural variation in pumping stations and since the cooks distance values were still far below the frequently used cut off level of 1 no further observations were removed from the dataset fig 3 illustrates the differences in a pumping station design philosophy between cities the conditional boxplots of the kinetic energy density show a larger variation between cities than within cities for almere the median kinetic energy density is 1 6 106 jm 3d 1 which is three orders of magnitude higher than for amsterdam where the median value is only 2 5 103 jm 3d 1 non log transformed in amsterdam the construction of most pumping stations is such that they have continuously submerged inlet pipes this decreases the flow velocity in the inlet pipes considerably and hence decreases the kinetic energy in contrast almost all inlet pipes of pumping stations in the city of almere are located above the representative water level this increases the kinetic energy in addition the almere pump sumps are relatively small which has a positive effect on the kinetic energy per unit of volume and time this example illustrates the presence of a city specific design philosophy which is supported by the observations made during the data collection and by the authors knowledge on the dutch sewer systems while kinetic energy density is one of the independent parameters in the final model there could be other unknown city specific parameters influencing the build up of fog deposits it was therefore decided to use a mixed model structure and deviated slightly from the protocol of diggle et al 2002 incorporating a random effect for city mitigates the potential effect of unknown city specific parameters allowing for valid inferences given the available parameters such a glmm structure allows the intercept to be random over cities and assumes a different reference probability for the accumulation of fog for each city table 6 gives an overview of the model selection process and presents the dropping order of the explanatory parameters this was based on the relative quality of models as judged by the akaike s information criterion aic and the significance of the model parameters the parameter that gave the largest drop in aic if it was excluded from the model was dropped first for the final model the p values of the estimated regression coefficients should stay stable i e these should not change considerably if one of the parameters is dropped during the model selection process six parameters household size population density housing association properties total population sewer system type and vertical flow velocity were dropped the final model contains three continuous parameters personal income kinetic energy density and fse density as shown in table 6 the model with the parameters vertical flow velocity and sewer system type was preferred by the aic over the final model and all estimations for the regression parameters were significant nevertheless this model was rejected as the optimal model after the parameter sewer system type was dropped and the model was fitted again the regression parameter of vertical flow velocity turned out to be non significant anymore making this model not trustworthy 4 1 final model the final glmm contains the explanatory parameters personal income kinetic energy density and fse density only the glmer function from the lme4 package was used for the bernoulli glmm and the model was fit by the default maximum likelihood with a laplacian approximation as the glmm likelihoods involve high order integrals lacking analytical solutions the likelihood values are approximated using numerical integration the final model to estimate the probability of the accumulation of fog in the pump sump model is specified as 15 ln π i j 1 π i j 0 394 1 652 i n c o m e i j 1 068 e n e r g y i j 1 749 f s e i j b i b i n 0 0 820 where π ij is the probability that fog accumulates in the pumping station j which is located in city i table 7 presents the estimated regression coefficients and model fits for this final glmm with standardized parameters the probability of fog accumulation in the pump sump increases in response to a decrease in the average personal income of a catchment area and an increase in the number of restaurants cafes and cafeterias within a travel distance of 1 km in the catchment area this probability can be reduced by increasing the daily amount of incoming kinetic energy per unit of volume of water in the pump sump table 8 shows the city specific intercepts a further discussion on the explanatory parameters and the city specific intercepts is given in section 5 2 and 5 3 the dispersion coefficient defined as the pearson residual deviance divided by the residual degrees of freedom in which the mixed effects were calculated to be one degree of freedom is 0 86 since this value approximates 1 no over or under dispersion could be detected the regression parameter estimates are all significant at the 5 level the parameter fse density is however at the margin of significance with a p value of 0 0493 using wald z statistics comparable results are found when a glm is fitted as a function of solely the parameter fse density and gives a slightly higher p value of 0 0661 as the predictor fse density was justifiable on the basis of physical considerations it was decided to keep the parameter in the final model fog blockages in sewer lines frequently occur in the proximity of restaurant and bar areas and most of the fog deposits analysed were collected from sewer lines downstream from fse areas keener et al 2008 shin et al 2015 williams et al 2012 a larger sample size is required to obtain more information on the significance of this relationship 5 model validation and discussion 5 1 model validation visual tools are used to verify the model assumptions for the final model deviance residuals are used for this model validation enhancing checking for the presence of patterns mccullagh and nelder 1989 the cooks distance statistics is used to check for influential observations once again no extreme observations were discovered in comparison with the first cooks distance plot 5 1 1 residual plots fig 4 shows the residuals plotted versus the fitted values both for all observations at once and conditional on city although residual plots of binomial glmms provide only limited information it is thought that the different cities react comparably to the model fig 5 shows the deviance residuals against the standardized explanatory parameters for all assessed parameters to validate the model the residual spread should be similar for all values of the explanatory parameter and no patterns should be present for the binomial glmm the deviance residuals r ij d are defined as such that for y ij 0 r ij d is negative and for y ij 1 r ij d is positive the upper row shows the standardized parameters that were included in the final model for these parameters the spread was less for higher values suggesting violation of the homogeneity assumption additionally in the residual plot for kinetic energy density a pattern can be observed all residuals are negative for higher values of kinetic energy density most of the parameters that are not included in the model do not show such strong patterns the parameters vertical flow velocity household size housing association properties and to a certain extent sewer system type displayed residual spreads that are approximately equal for all values of the parameters adding the parameters population density and or total population did not resolve the patterns nor did adding higher order or interaction terms as the patterns could not be resolved it is concluded that the assumption of independence and constant variance homogeneity is violated this could have affected the estimated regression coefficients 5 1 2 permutational manova to verify the outcomes of the glmm a permutational manova which is more robust to heterogeneity was applied a backward selection on the explanatory parameters table 6 resulted in a model with the last three parameters equal to the three parameters of the final glmm model p 0 001 and thereby confirms the outcomes of the glmm 5 2 operator dependency fig 6 illustrates the glmm predicted probabilities of the accumulation of fog in pump sumps along standardized personal income values based on a population mean for the parameters fse density and kinetic energy density the thick curve represents the population average and the two dashed curves represent the inter city variation 95 of the values for bi are estimated to fall between these two curves the high variance 0 820 reveals that there is a substantial inter city variation to explain the variation between the five participating cities in more detail a plot of the predicted probabilities of accumulation of fog per city was made fig 7 this plot shows the predicted probabilities also along the standardized values for personal income but for the other parameters the mean values for each city individually were calculated the graph illustrates that each city has different intercepts for a representative pumping station in arnhem thus a pumping station with mean values for all parameters for the city of arnhem the predicted probability that fog accumulates in this pumping station is approximately 0 4 while for amsterdam this probability equals 0 8 this shows that pumping stations in amsterdam are more prone to the accumulation of fog given the explanatory parameters this is also thought to be affected by the relatively low values for kinetic energy density in amsterdam and high values for the fse density making the pumping stations more prone to the accumulation of fog 5 3 the role of kinetic energy density and socioeconomic factors related to fog disposal the parameter kinetic energy density jm 3d 1 is the only non demographic parameter in the model and its manipulation provides a possible approach to preventing the accumulation of fog for example for catchments with a low average income and a high fse density a high kinetic energy per pump sump may prevent the accumulation of fog in the pump sump the significant role that kinetic energy density plays is demonstrated in fig 8 showing the probability of fog accumulation along the standardized parameter for kinetic energy density for three different income classes the continuous parameter personal income was discretized into three intervals the observations were equally divided among the intervals and the mean value for the observations within one interval was taken as the representative interval value fig 8 demonstrates the importance of kinetic energy for catchments with lower incomes for a pumping station that is located in a catchment in the low income class with a mean value for kinetic energy density thus the standardized kinetic energy density equals 0 the predicted probability of fog accumulation is approximately 0 9 for a pumping station located in the same catchment having different pumping station characteristics resulting in a value for the standardized kinetic energy density of 4 this probability would be only 0 1 this example illustrates the influence of kinetic energy density on preventing the accumulation of fog in pump sumps for catchments with a low income population for catchments belonging to the high income class while having an average fse density the model suggests that the daily amount of kinetic energy per unit of volume is of less importance it thereby demonstrates that besides structural configurations i e the kinetic energy density also demographics i e fog from fses and domestic dwellings influence the accumulation of fog the high estimated probabilities of fog accumulation in areas with lower incomes are in line with the observations of mattsson et al 2014 they explicitly mentioned the occurrence of severe fog accumulation in areas with high rise apartment buildings and a relatively high number of immigrants no such significant relationships could be revealed from this study though high rise apartment buildings were not included as such in this study and population density turned out to be a non significant parameter the on the basis of multi collinearity dropped covariate percentage of immigrants with non western origin however was highly correlated with the parameter personal income r 0 69 suggesting that this covariate may be related to the accumulation of fog too nevertheless a dutch governmental study on food habits and lifestyle rivm 2002 seems to contradict this statement it reported a lower relative fat consumption for turkish and moroccan immigrants both in comparison with groups with low socioeconomic status and with the overall mean of the dutch population it should be noted however that the turkish and moroccan population in the netherlands represent only around 36 of the entire population that has a non western origins statistics netherlands 2016a and it is unknown whether the turkish and moroccan population with low incomes were subtracted from the group with low socioeconomic status moreover fog disposal is in addition to fat consumption also related to cooking and dishwashing habits as such the rivm 2002 study does not allow to conclude on fog disposal in relation to ethnical groups similarly no such conclusions could be drawn in relation to income the dutch national food consumption survey rivm 2011 reported on the intake of fat subdivided into educational level and the level of education and the average income are strongly correlated statistics netherlands 2016b this survey revealed only a minor difference 5 in the daily fat consumption between the different groups and moreover people with a moderate education level had the highest mean fat intake 90 1 g day nevertheless literature evidence on a relation between income and broader fog related issues does exist a study that analysed differences in the fat intake across social groups for nine european countries found that people with a lower socioeconomic status consumed slightly more fat than people with a higher socioeconomic status lopez azpiazu et al 2003 another literature review on the geography of fast food outlets found a positive relation between fast food outlets and deprivation fraser et al 2010 hence both studies observed a relation between income and issues related to fog it is thought that people of one income group share particular fog disposal patterns which could be related to fog intake and or cooking and dishwashing habits the results of this study suggest that fog issues in pump sumps may be reduced by minimising the fog disposal or by increasing the kinetic energy density measures to reduce fog disposal may involve educational campaigns aiming to change the behaviour of people like the well known uk bin it don t block it campaign or installing grease traps at fses and ascertaining that the grease traps are being operated and maintained properly additionally more robust systems could resolve fog issues e g if preventive measures do not suffice for pumping stations fog accumulation could be overcome by a particular design of pumping stations that accompany higher kinetic energy densities as this typically requires deeper pump sumps the design of a pumping station should balance investment costs and operational costs for fog removal while at the same time it should avoid excessive air entrainment from earlier research see e g lubbers 2007 it is known that the geometry of pump sumps have a large influence on the risk of air entrainment which may lead to a significant increase in energy losses in wastewater pressure mains and in extreme cases to complete loss of hydraulic capacity pothof 2011 pothof and clemens 2010 in addition to kinetic energy density other parameters related to flow velocities and patterns could influence the fog accumulation process dirksen et al 2012 found that sagging sewers are more vulnerable to the accumulation of fog and dominic et al 2013 stated that particular sewer constructions which decrease flow velocities could enhance fog accumulation furthermore since the dropped parameter daily operation time was correlated with kinetic energy density r 0 77 a higher daily operation time could also decrease the probability of the accumulation of fog in practice this suggests however operation of pumps beyond the normal operational envelope which may decrease the service life further physical research on the exact impact of kinetic energy density and flow patterns on fog accumulation is required although the model assumptions of independency and homogeneity were violated the reported results provide important insights into factors influencing the accumulation of fog for future statistical research it is recommended to systematically record the accumulation of fog and use a more balanced dataset i e to have more observations with higher values also a larger sample size could solve the observed heterogeneity 6 conclusions this research provides insight into important aspects of catchment demographics and pumping station characteristics that are related to the accumulation of fog in pumping stations generalized linear mixed model glmm procedures are used to analyse the data consisting of 126 observations of catchments and corresponding pumping stations located in five different cities this study presents a procedure to model the probability of the presence or absence of fog in pump sumps as a function of demographic and general system characteristics of catchment areas the final model contains three parameters representing the average catchment income fse food service establishments density and kinetic energy density of wastewater the high significance of the parameter personal income demonstrates that it is possible to identify a relationship between fog disposal and the accumulation of fog in sewer systems on a catchment scale this suggests that some aspects of lifestyle i e fog disposal patterns are shared by particular demographic groups thereby resulting in significant variation in the probability of fog accumulation in pumping stations between catchment areas additionally the analysis shows that geometrical configurations of pumping stations may play an essential role in the prevention of severe fog accumulation the model reveals that severe accumulation of fog in pump sumps is negatively related to the average income earned per person in the catchments it is expected that particular fog disposal patterns are shared by individuals of one income group as income cannot influence the accumulation of fog in itself particular diets cleaning habits and typical moments of fog disposal might be aspects comprising such disposal patterns and further research is required to obtain insights into how these aspects may influence the accumulation of fog as the dropped parameter percentage of non western immigrants was highly correlated with income these particular disposal patterns might be culture bound furthermore the model revealed that fse density is positively correlated with the presence of fog deposits in pump sumps as the accumulation of fog is generally known to be severe in restaurant and bar areas it is thought that the presence of fses directly contributes to the accumulation of fog next to income and the presence of fses the model finds a negative relationship between the total kinetic energy of dwf per storage volume and presence absence of fog in pump sumps the results of this study can provide useful information for municipalities in every country to define more effective maintenance strategies or to prevent the accumulation of fog it could e g suggest the kind of data that could be recorded by municipalities or motive particular structural configurations of pump sumps in particular for catchments receiving wastewater from areas with a low average income and or where the fse density is high increased construction costs to increase the kinetic energy density may be justified to decrease fog removal costs as the assumptions of both independence and homogeneity however were violated the outcomes of the model should be interpreted with care for future statistical research it is recommended to systematically record the accumulation of fog use a more balanced dataset and perform simulation based cross validation to compare model predictions against data this could improve the predictive performance of the model thereby providing information for preventing the accumulation of fog and making municipal maintenance strategies more effective the outcomes of this study also provide direction for future experimental design further research will focus on the multiphase flow phenomena in wastewater pumping stations and on the influence that geometry has with respect to the accumulation of fog air entrainment and sediment deposits the ultimate goal is to obtain a sound understanding of these processes and to derive a design strategy for wastewater pump sumps that function optimally e g no air entrainment while their maintenance needs

19675,the accumulation of fog fat oil and grease deposits in sewer pumping stations results in an increase in maintenance costs malfunctioning of pumps and a potential increase of wastewater spills in receiving open water bodies it is thought that a variety of parameters e g geometry of the pump sump pump operation socioeconomic parameters of the catchment influences the built up of fog based on a database containing data of 126 pumping stations located in five dutch municipalities a statistical model was built it is shown that 3 parameters are most significant in explaining the occurrence of fog deposits mean income of the population in a catchment the amount of energy kinetic and potential per m3 per day and the density of restaurants bars and hotels in a catchment further it is shown that there are significant differences between municipalities that can be traced back to the local design paradigm for example in amsterdam the design philosophy of discharging in the pump sump under the water surface and hence maintaining a low level of turbulence in the pump sump results in an increase of the probability of the formation of fog graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer system pumping station fat oil and grease fog deposits generalized linear mixed modelling 1 introduction sewer systems are vital for public health and city life sewer blockages are found to be the dominant failure mechanism in sewer systems arthur et al 2009 ashley et al 2004 in the united states almost half of all sewer blockages are related to fat oil and grease fog deposits epa 2004 fog deposits are accumulated suspended solids in sewer systems and have an adhesive character they can become firmly attached to interior sewer pipe walls thereby substantially reducing and sometimes even completely blocking the wastewater flow desilva et al 2011 they have a grainy sandstone like texture with high yield strengths keener et al 2008 that require intensive cleaning activities such as hydraulic jetting dirksen et al 2012 mattsson et al 2014 it is often thought that fog deposits in public sewer lines result from solidified cooking oils as they are poured down the drain and cool down in downstream sewer lines the formation mechanisms however have appeared to be much more complex keener et al 2008 showed they are basically metallic soaps mainly consisting of saturated fatty acids and calcium later research described the mechanism of fog deposit formation in sewer pipes as the saponification process between calcium and free fatty acids together with the aggregation of excess calcium unreacted fatty acids and debris in wastewater that are drawn towards the solid core matrix of saponified solids he et al 2013 in addition recent work of gross et al 2017 showed that fog deposits can also be the result of acids crystallization implying that fog deposits can also be formed without the presence of metals collected samples from different locations within the sewer network showed a wide range in physical and chemical properties he et al 2011 keener et al 2008 nieuwenhuis et al 2017 shin et al 2015 williams et al 2012 different formation processes and accumulation mechanisms were suggested for different network locations he et al 2011 williams et al 2012 which is also in line with the recent laboratory study of gross et al 2017 both at upstream and downstream locations fog deposits are known to accumulate in sewer pipes fog deposits typically tend to accumulate slightly above the low flow water mark keener et al 2008 williams et al 2012 dirksen et al 2012 and dominic et al 2013 identified sagging sewers in particular to be vulnerable to the accumulation of fog for lateral house connections post et al 2016 showed that accumulation of fog is the main failure mechanism in inverted siphons declining parts with the presence of air pockets are particularly prone to fog blockages de groot 2015 in pumping stations fog deposits with three different appearances were found franke et al 2011 mentioned the floating layers of fog accumulating on the walls of pump sumps these layers potentially interfere with the functioning of level regulators in the pump sump depending on the type of level regulators additionally williams et al 2012 collected fog samples in the shape of fat balls from the water surface of pumping stations and dirksen et al 2012 mentioned the occasional detachment of bar shaped deposits in sewer pipes these may end up in pump sumps as such bar shaped deposits were observed in pump sumps during the site visits conducted for this study previous studies mainly focused on the chemical aspects of fog deposit formation although these studies have revealed general information on locations in public sewer systems that are prone to fog accumulation they did not focus on the particular sewer contexts of fog accumulations in addition previous studies hardly elaborated on the probable impact of domestic disposal patterns on fog deposits they focused mainly on food service establishments fses dominic et al 2013 he et al 2011 williams et al 2012 and the fishing and meat industries cammarota and freire 2006 mattsson et al 2014 as the main contributors to fog problems a recent case study in the netherlands showed however that lateral house connections are more susceptible to blockages than main sewers and that fog is the dominant failure mechanism in lateral house connections post et al 2016 this demonstrates that domestic disposal patterns are an important contributor to fog deposits similarly wallace et al 2017 mentioned the contribution of domestic wastewater to fog blockages and a survey done among 127 norwegian and swedish sewer operators reported that respectively 48 and 22 experienced fog related problems in residential areas mattsson et al 2014 they explicitly mentioned the severity of fog accumulation in areas with high rise apartment buildings and a relatively high number of immigrants mattsson et al 2014 considering that aspects of lifestyle may be attributed to demographic groups it is hypothesized that fog problems are related to demographics and vary considerably in severity among catchments and in corresponding pumping stations in addition it is expected that pumping stations with structural configurations that enable low flow velocities are more prone to fog build up the research presented here aims at finding evidence for both hypotheses to this end a statistical study on 126 wastewater pumping stations in five municipalities has been performed 2 materials for investigating the impact of domestic disposal patterns fog deposits were considered on the scale of catchment areas this allowed using demographics of catchments for studying the influence of population disposal patterns statistically data on catchments and corresponding pumping stations were collected in five relatively large dutch municipalities table 1 provides an overview of the participating municipalities and their general characteristics they varied in demographics type of catchments and pumping stations the dataset of residential catchments was composed in close collaboration with the municipalities resulting in binomial data on fog accumulation in pump sumps each observation is represented by one catchment and its pumping station describing the presence or absence of severe accumulation of fog as judged by the sewer manager this judgement represents the state of fog accumulation over multiple years and at least one year it was based on a combination of 1 visual inspection by operators during regular maintenance and 2 available information about cleaning efforts required as the municipalities did not systematically record fog accumulation this was the best available data to avoid discrepancies between cities parameter definitions were discussed beforehand pumping stations without consensus on the severity of fog accumulation or that were lacking crucial information e g construction drawings were excluded from the dataset 2 1 parameter selection the investigated parameters represent general system characteristics and socio demographic from here on called demographic characteristics that are potential indicators for fog disposal patterns or the fog accumulation process statistical analyses require comparable parameters and one representative value per observation the three parameters vertical velocity pump on time and kinetic energy density are therefore introduced representing the geometry of the pumping stations and the hydraulic loading table 2 these parameters are related to the motion of water and hence are suspected to affect the accumulation of fog 2 1 1 vertical velocity the average vertical velocity v vert mh 1 is calculated as 1 v v e r t q p u m p a s u m p where q pump is the pump capacity under dry weather conditions in m3h 1 and a sump m2 the surface area of the pump sump since pumping stations operate under dry weather conditions for about 80 of the time tukker et al 2012 the dry weather flow dwf is taken as the representative hydraulic loading for variable frequency drive vfd pumps the operating schemes have been provided by the municipalities allowing to determine representative values for q pump during dwf 2 1 2 daily operation time the average daily operation time t operation in hours per day is calculated as 2 t o p e r a t i o n q d w f t q p u m p where q dwf is the hourly dwf m3h 1 t is the time h in this case 24 h and q pump is the pump capacity during dwf m3h 1 2 1 3 kinetic energy density the values for kinetic energy density i e the incoming energy per pump sump per day e daypump in jm 3d 1 are based on the values for hourly dwf as provided by the municipalities for each pumping station hourly values for the kinetic energy e kin h jh 1 are summed over the day and divided by the representative water volume in the pump sump v sump m3 3 e d a y p u m p t 1 24 e k i n h v s u m p the amount of kinetic energy that got into the water in the pump sump is calculated as the kinetic energy at the invert level of the inflowing pipe s e kin inv j and the potential energy e pot j of the inflowing water with respect to representative water depth in the pump sump the water level in the pump sump is assumed to be constant 4 e k i n e k i n i n v e p o t where e pot is 5 e p o t m g h where m kg is the mass of the incoming water g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 and h m the fall height of the incoming water assuming a constant water level in the pump sump and where e kin inv is 6 e k i n i n v 1 2 m v 2 where m kg is the mass of the incoming water and v ms 1 the flow velocity the velocities are derived from hourly values for the dwf according to the hourly distribution percentages and the cross sectional area of flow 7 v q d w f a where q dwf m3h 1 is the hourly dwf and a m2 is the cross sectional area of flow the velocity v mh 1 is assumed to be constant for every hour and and the incoming dwf is assumed to be equally divided among all inlet pipes the cross sectional area a m2 depends on the water depth at the location of the inlet during the particular hour this is derived from the representative water depth in the pump sump z m i e the water depth following from the water level in between the switch on and switch off levels of the dwf pump the invert level of the inlet pipe z i m and the average water depth in the pipe at the location of inflow during the particular hour d m for the calculations of the cross sectional area and or the flow velocity and corresponding kinetic energy three situations for representative water depths z at the location of inlet are distinguished see fig 1 for z z i the outlet of the pipe is classified as free outflow close to the end of such pipes flow conditions are critical implying that the non dimensional froude number f r is known and specified as 8 f r v c g d m 1 where v c ms 1 is the critical flow velocity g ms 2 is the gravitational acceleration and d m m is the hydraulic mean depth specified as the cross sectional area of flow per flow width at the water surface for such flow conditions the empirical equation of straub 1978 applies 9 and the critical depth dc m is derived 9 d c d 0 567 q d w f 0 506 d 1 264 where q dwf m3s 1 is the hourly dwf d m is the diameter and dc m the critical depth where 0 02 d c d 0 85 thereafter using geometric and trigonometric equations the hydraulic mean depth d m m as displayed in fig 1 is determined and from 8 the critical flow velocity v c ms 1 is derived for one pumping station the value is slightly below the lower limit d c d 0 007 and for seven pumping stations this value is exceeding the upper limit d c d 1 31 in these cases d c d is assumed to be equal to the lower and upper limits as the specified conditions are only violated for minimum and maximum dwf values the possible influence of the tail water is neglected and the water depth at the outflow is assumed to be equal to the critical depth thus neglecting the drawdown effect for z z i z i d water depth d m is used from 10 with the value of d m confined by d c m 10 d z z i for z z i d full pipe flow is considered geometrical details like the shape of the pump sump or the position of inflow are not considered as the nature of statistical analysis does not allow for such details 2 1 4 demographic data online available geographical data from statistics netherlands on neighbourhood level was used to obtain weighted demographic data per catchment the geographical maps were composed from data from the key registers cadaster and regional data from statistics netherlands statistics netherlands and kadaster 2012 data from the year 2012 was used as this was the most recent dataset covering all parameters needed merging data from different years was infeasible due to changes over the years in the borders of administrative neighbourhoods table 3 provides an overview of the potential explanatory parameters selected from the statistics netherlands database calculations are performed with quantum gis software version 2 0 1 dufour qgis 2013 using the geoprocessing intersect tool a gis layer with the contributing areas of neighbourhoods in each individual catchment was created further data processing is performed using r statistics software version 0 99 893 r core team 2016 the database shows missing values data points that were identified as nihil were replaced by zero and data points that were identified as susceptible to reliability and secrecy were replaced by na not available the total number of inhabitants for each neighbourhood was calculated based on the population density and the surface area of each neighbourhood as derived from qgis calculations representative values for the number of food service establishments fse were derived by summing the average number of restaurants cafes and cafeterias within a travel distance of 1 km for the inhabitants this value was divided by the surface area to obtain a representative value for the fse density the household density for each catchment was calculated by taking the number of households divided by the surface area of each neighbourhood estimations of the demographic characteristics per catchment were obtained by weighing the characteristics according to the catchment s population that the contributing neighbourhoods contained using the catchment weights characteristics per catchment were derived in proportion to their populations the numbers of inhabitants per catchment were based on the population density of the neighbourhoods and the contributing surface areas of the neighbourhoods after pre processing of the data the database of the selected pumping and their system characteristics was merged with the demographic catchment data 2 2 resulting dataset table 4 provides an overview of the data the dataset consisted of 128 observations in total spread over five cities the number of pumping stations varied largely among cities in the entire dataset 53 pumping stations were categorized as clean seventy five pumping stations showed severe accumulation of fog 3 methods this study focused on quantifying the relationship between catchment demographics representing fog disposal patterns the accumulation of fog in pump sumps and whether the pump sump geometry influenced the accumulation of fog a statistical analysis was performed instead of a conventional generalized linear model glm a generalized linear mixed model glmm was applied to account for correlations between the pumping stations that were located in the same city we applied the procedure as presented in fig 2 the procedure consists of four steps data exploration model component selection model selection and model validation 3 1 data exploration a detailed data exploration was performed first relationships between explanatory parameters were investigated following the removal of collinear parameters a glmm was applied on the remaining dataset based on this glmm outliers were detected 3 1 1 collinearity pairwise correlations among explanatory parameters were examined with visual inspection tools and pearson correlation coefficients 0 65 in addition variance inflation factors vifs were used to examine linear dependence among three or more continuous explanatory parameters a maximum vif value of 3 was used more strict than the cut off range of 5 10 as suggested by montgomery et al 1992 one collinear parameter at a time was removed until the values for the vif and pearson correlation coefficient were below the preselected thresholds 3 1 2 sewer operator dependency the pumping stations were examined for operator dependency the data exploration revealed that pumping stations located in the same city showed similarities in their characteristics as this study aims to identify parameters influencing the accumulation of fog in pumping stations revealing the potential effect of unknown city specific parameters was not in the interest of this research a glmm with a random component that accounted for the operator city effect was therefore applied this mixed model structure which is further elaborated in section 3 2 allows making statements on the relationships for similar cities in general it describes the notion of an operator and or city effect inherently of what comprises such effects 3 1 3 outliers based on the glmm with a random component that accounted for the operator city effect and the fixed component containing all parameters that remained after removal of the collinear parameters the dataset was studied for the presence of outliers observations were considered outliers when the severity of fog accumulation was likely to be caused by industry and when the simplifications on pumping station geometry and system layout caused a large discrepancy between the actual values and the calculated values since the response parameter is binary and only covers the presence or absence of fog in the pump sump there is no possibility for outliers in this parameter outliers in the explanatory parameters were investigated exploiting cleveland s dot plots and using cooks distance statistics cook 1977 as a cooks distance cut off the value 4 n k 1 1 with n for the number of observations and k for the number of regression coefficients was set the threshold value was used to enhance graphical interpretation after which the points identified were examined in more detail after removal of the outliers the parameters were checked for collinearity again the removed outliers did not cause the vif values and correlation coefficients to rise above the threshold values set 3 2 glmm component selection and model selection both the glmm component selection and the model selection see fig 2 were based on the protocol for the top down strategy for linear mixed models as recommended by diggle et al 2002 and applied by zuur et al 2009 this protocol suggests starting with a glmm where the fixed component contains all explanatory parameters in the second step the optimal structure of the random component is chosen this induced a correlation structure between pumping stations that were located in the same city the third step focuses on obtaining the optimal fixed structure by means of backward selection the first model contains all explanatory parameters after which the terms are dropped one by one until all terms were significant p 0 05 3 2 1 conditional probability distribution and random component conditional on the random effect b i that accounted for the city effect of city i where the pumping station j was located the distribution of the presence absence of fog accumulation y ij is assumed to be binomially distributed with probability π ij b i the linear predictor η contains both a fixed and a random component following the form of the linear regression model 11 η x i j z i j β x b z where β x is the fixed component and accounts for the fixed effect and b z for the random effect the fixed component is a linear function of the explanatory parameters β is the matrix containing the weights assigned to the explanatory parameters x is the design matrix of the explanatory parameters the random component extends the linear function of the fixed component with a compound symmetrical correlation structure adding a random intercept conditional on city to the fixed intercept it models the inter city variation and assumes that pumping stations that are located in the same city are equally correlated 3 2 2 fixed component the fixed component of the linear predictor is 12 η f i x e d x i j 1 x i j m β 0 β 1 x i j 1 β m x i j m where j is the pumping station in city i m represents the total number of explanatory parameters β i is the coefficient corresponding to the particular explanatory parameter x and β 0 is the intercept term all continuous explanatory parameters were standardized prior to fitting facilitating the comparison of the parameter s weights 3 2 3 link function the relationship between the conditional mean and the explanatory parameters is determined by the logistic link 13 π i j e η β i x i j b i z i j 1 e η β i x i j b i z i j 3 2 4 model specification the final model is 14 ln π i j 1 π i j β x i j b i n 0 σ 2 where π ij is the probability that fog accumulates in the pumping station j in city i β is the vector representing the model coefficients x ij is the vector containing the explanatory parameters for pumping station j which is located in city i b i is the random intercept for city i and is assumed n 0 σ 2 3 3 model selection and model validation a stepwise backwards selection approach was applied to find the optimal model the assumptions for this final model were verified using visual tools the outcome of the glmm was verified by means of a permutational manova as implemented in the vegan package r core team 2016 4 results this section presents the results of the procedure described in section 3 in the model selection process nine parameters were dropped table 5 the cooks distance statistics designated 15 of the 128 observations as potential outliers after further exploration of these marked observations i e by inspecting construction drawings and catchment datasheets two observations were removed as outliers the first pumping station was located in the hague more than 25 of the design dwf of this catchment was attributed to industrial wastewater the other station was located in amsterdam this pumping station had two inlet pipes one of which was a pressurized pipe that transported 72 of all incoming wastewater this specific situation resulted in deviating conditions the thirteen remaining marked observations were also checked for particularities in the pump sump geometry and system type no such particularities were found since the high leverage is thought to result from natural variation in pumping stations and since the cooks distance values were still far below the frequently used cut off level of 1 no further observations were removed from the dataset fig 3 illustrates the differences in a pumping station design philosophy between cities the conditional boxplots of the kinetic energy density show a larger variation between cities than within cities for almere the median kinetic energy density is 1 6 106 jm 3d 1 which is three orders of magnitude higher than for amsterdam where the median value is only 2 5 103 jm 3d 1 non log transformed in amsterdam the construction of most pumping stations is such that they have continuously submerged inlet pipes this decreases the flow velocity in the inlet pipes considerably and hence decreases the kinetic energy in contrast almost all inlet pipes of pumping stations in the city of almere are located above the representative water level this increases the kinetic energy in addition the almere pump sumps are relatively small which has a positive effect on the kinetic energy per unit of volume and time this example illustrates the presence of a city specific design philosophy which is supported by the observations made during the data collection and by the authors knowledge on the dutch sewer systems while kinetic energy density is one of the independent parameters in the final model there could be other unknown city specific parameters influencing the build up of fog deposits it was therefore decided to use a mixed model structure and deviated slightly from the protocol of diggle et al 2002 incorporating a random effect for city mitigates the potential effect of unknown city specific parameters allowing for valid inferences given the available parameters such a glmm structure allows the intercept to be random over cities and assumes a different reference probability for the accumulation of fog for each city table 6 gives an overview of the model selection process and presents the dropping order of the explanatory parameters this was based on the relative quality of models as judged by the akaike s information criterion aic and the significance of the model parameters the parameter that gave the largest drop in aic if it was excluded from the model was dropped first for the final model the p values of the estimated regression coefficients should stay stable i e these should not change considerably if one of the parameters is dropped during the model selection process six parameters household size population density housing association properties total population sewer system type and vertical flow velocity were dropped the final model contains three continuous parameters personal income kinetic energy density and fse density as shown in table 6 the model with the parameters vertical flow velocity and sewer system type was preferred by the aic over the final model and all estimations for the regression parameters were significant nevertheless this model was rejected as the optimal model after the parameter sewer system type was dropped and the model was fitted again the regression parameter of vertical flow velocity turned out to be non significant anymore making this model not trustworthy 4 1 final model the final glmm contains the explanatory parameters personal income kinetic energy density and fse density only the glmer function from the lme4 package was used for the bernoulli glmm and the model was fit by the default maximum likelihood with a laplacian approximation as the glmm likelihoods involve high order integrals lacking analytical solutions the likelihood values are approximated using numerical integration the final model to estimate the probability of the accumulation of fog in the pump sump model is specified as 15 ln π i j 1 π i j 0 394 1 652 i n c o m e i j 1 068 e n e r g y i j 1 749 f s e i j b i b i n 0 0 820 where π ij is the probability that fog accumulates in the pumping station j which is located in city i table 7 presents the estimated regression coefficients and model fits for this final glmm with standardized parameters the probability of fog accumulation in the pump sump increases in response to a decrease in the average personal income of a catchment area and an increase in the number of restaurants cafes and cafeterias within a travel distance of 1 km in the catchment area this probability can be reduced by increasing the daily amount of incoming kinetic energy per unit of volume of water in the pump sump table 8 shows the city specific intercepts a further discussion on the explanatory parameters and the city specific intercepts is given in section 5 2 and 5 3 the dispersion coefficient defined as the pearson residual deviance divided by the residual degrees of freedom in which the mixed effects were calculated to be one degree of freedom is 0 86 since this value approximates 1 no over or under dispersion could be detected the regression parameter estimates are all significant at the 5 level the parameter fse density is however at the margin of significance with a p value of 0 0493 using wald z statistics comparable results are found when a glm is fitted as a function of solely the parameter fse density and gives a slightly higher p value of 0 0661 as the predictor fse density was justifiable on the basis of physical considerations it was decided to keep the parameter in the final model fog blockages in sewer lines frequently occur in the proximity of restaurant and bar areas and most of the fog deposits analysed were collected from sewer lines downstream from fse areas keener et al 2008 shin et al 2015 williams et al 2012 a larger sample size is required to obtain more information on the significance of this relationship 5 model validation and discussion 5 1 model validation visual tools are used to verify the model assumptions for the final model deviance residuals are used for this model validation enhancing checking for the presence of patterns mccullagh and nelder 1989 the cooks distance statistics is used to check for influential observations once again no extreme observations were discovered in comparison with the first cooks distance plot 5 1 1 residual plots fig 4 shows the residuals plotted versus the fitted values both for all observations at once and conditional on city although residual plots of binomial glmms provide only limited information it is thought that the different cities react comparably to the model fig 5 shows the deviance residuals against the standardized explanatory parameters for all assessed parameters to validate the model the residual spread should be similar for all values of the explanatory parameter and no patterns should be present for the binomial glmm the deviance residuals r ij d are defined as such that for y ij 0 r ij d is negative and for y ij 1 r ij d is positive the upper row shows the standardized parameters that were included in the final model for these parameters the spread was less for higher values suggesting violation of the homogeneity assumption additionally in the residual plot for kinetic energy density a pattern can be observed all residuals are negative for higher values of kinetic energy density most of the parameters that are not included in the model do not show such strong patterns the parameters vertical flow velocity household size housing association properties and to a certain extent sewer system type displayed residual spreads that are approximately equal for all values of the parameters adding the parameters population density and or total population did not resolve the patterns nor did adding higher order or interaction terms as the patterns could not be resolved it is concluded that the assumption of independence and constant variance homogeneity is violated this could have affected the estimated regression coefficients 5 1 2 permutational manova to verify the outcomes of the glmm a permutational manova which is more robust to heterogeneity was applied a backward selection on the explanatory parameters table 6 resulted in a model with the last three parameters equal to the three parameters of the final glmm model p 0 001 and thereby confirms the outcomes of the glmm 5 2 operator dependency fig 6 illustrates the glmm predicted probabilities of the accumulation of fog in pump sumps along standardized personal income values based on a population mean for the parameters fse density and kinetic energy density the thick curve represents the population average and the two dashed curves represent the inter city variation 95 of the values for bi are estimated to fall between these two curves the high variance 0 820 reveals that there is a substantial inter city variation to explain the variation between the five participating cities in more detail a plot of the predicted probabilities of accumulation of fog per city was made fig 7 this plot shows the predicted probabilities also along the standardized values for personal income but for the other parameters the mean values for each city individually were calculated the graph illustrates that each city has different intercepts for a representative pumping station in arnhem thus a pumping station with mean values for all parameters for the city of arnhem the predicted probability that fog accumulates in this pumping station is approximately 0 4 while for amsterdam this probability equals 0 8 this shows that pumping stations in amsterdam are more prone to the accumulation of fog given the explanatory parameters this is also thought to be affected by the relatively low values for kinetic energy density in amsterdam and high values for the fse density making the pumping stations more prone to the accumulation of fog 5 3 the role of kinetic energy density and socioeconomic factors related to fog disposal the parameter kinetic energy density jm 3d 1 is the only non demographic parameter in the model and its manipulation provides a possible approach to preventing the accumulation of fog for example for catchments with a low average income and a high fse density a high kinetic energy per pump sump may prevent the accumulation of fog in the pump sump the significant role that kinetic energy density plays is demonstrated in fig 8 showing the probability of fog accumulation along the standardized parameter for kinetic energy density for three different income classes the continuous parameter personal income was discretized into three intervals the observations were equally divided among the intervals and the mean value for the observations within one interval was taken as the representative interval value fig 8 demonstrates the importance of kinetic energy for catchments with lower incomes for a pumping station that is located in a catchment in the low income class with a mean value for kinetic energy density thus the standardized kinetic energy density equals 0 the predicted probability of fog accumulation is approximately 0 9 for a pumping station located in the same catchment having different pumping station characteristics resulting in a value for the standardized kinetic energy density of 4 this probability would be only 0 1 this example illustrates the influence of kinetic energy density on preventing the accumulation of fog in pump sumps for catchments with a low income population for catchments belonging to the high income class while having an average fse density the model suggests that the daily amount of kinetic energy per unit of volume is of less importance it thereby demonstrates that besides structural configurations i e the kinetic energy density also demographics i e fog from fses and domestic dwellings influence the accumulation of fog the high estimated probabilities of fog accumulation in areas with lower incomes are in line with the observations of mattsson et al 2014 they explicitly mentioned the occurrence of severe fog accumulation in areas with high rise apartment buildings and a relatively high number of immigrants no such significant relationships could be revealed from this study though high rise apartment buildings were not included as such in this study and population density turned out to be a non significant parameter the on the basis of multi collinearity dropped covariate percentage of immigrants with non western origin however was highly correlated with the parameter personal income r 0 69 suggesting that this covariate may be related to the accumulation of fog too nevertheless a dutch governmental study on food habits and lifestyle rivm 2002 seems to contradict this statement it reported a lower relative fat consumption for turkish and moroccan immigrants both in comparison with groups with low socioeconomic status and with the overall mean of the dutch population it should be noted however that the turkish and moroccan population in the netherlands represent only around 36 of the entire population that has a non western origins statistics netherlands 2016a and it is unknown whether the turkish and moroccan population with low incomes were subtracted from the group with low socioeconomic status moreover fog disposal is in addition to fat consumption also related to cooking and dishwashing habits as such the rivm 2002 study does not allow to conclude on fog disposal in relation to ethnical groups similarly no such conclusions could be drawn in relation to income the dutch national food consumption survey rivm 2011 reported on the intake of fat subdivided into educational level and the level of education and the average income are strongly correlated statistics netherlands 2016b this survey revealed only a minor difference 5 in the daily fat consumption between the different groups and moreover people with a moderate education level had the highest mean fat intake 90 1 g day nevertheless literature evidence on a relation between income and broader fog related issues does exist a study that analysed differences in the fat intake across social groups for nine european countries found that people with a lower socioeconomic status consumed slightly more fat than people with a higher socioeconomic status lopez azpiazu et al 2003 another literature review on the geography of fast food outlets found a positive relation between fast food outlets and deprivation fraser et al 2010 hence both studies observed a relation between income and issues related to fog it is thought that people of one income group share particular fog disposal patterns which could be related to fog intake and or cooking and dishwashing habits the results of this study suggest that fog issues in pump sumps may be reduced by minimising the fog disposal or by increasing the kinetic energy density measures to reduce fog disposal may involve educational campaigns aiming to change the behaviour of people like the well known uk bin it don t block it campaign or installing grease traps at fses and ascertaining that the grease traps are being operated and maintained properly additionally more robust systems could resolve fog issues e g if preventive measures do not suffice for pumping stations fog accumulation could be overcome by a particular design of pumping stations that accompany higher kinetic energy densities as this typically requires deeper pump sumps the design of a pumping station should balance investment costs and operational costs for fog removal while at the same time it should avoid excessive air entrainment from earlier research see e g lubbers 2007 it is known that the geometry of pump sumps have a large influence on the risk of air entrainment which may lead to a significant increase in energy losses in wastewater pressure mains and in extreme cases to complete loss of hydraulic capacity pothof 2011 pothof and clemens 2010 in addition to kinetic energy density other parameters related to flow velocities and patterns could influence the fog accumulation process dirksen et al 2012 found that sagging sewers are more vulnerable to the accumulation of fog and dominic et al 2013 stated that particular sewer constructions which decrease flow velocities could enhance fog accumulation furthermore since the dropped parameter daily operation time was correlated with kinetic energy density r 0 77 a higher daily operation time could also decrease the probability of the accumulation of fog in practice this suggests however operation of pumps beyond the normal operational envelope which may decrease the service life further physical research on the exact impact of kinetic energy density and flow patterns on fog accumulation is required although the model assumptions of independency and homogeneity were violated the reported results provide important insights into factors influencing the accumulation of fog for future statistical research it is recommended to systematically record the accumulation of fog and use a more balanced dataset i e to have more observations with higher values also a larger sample size could solve the observed heterogeneity 6 conclusions this research provides insight into important aspects of catchment demographics and pumping station characteristics that are related to the accumulation of fog in pumping stations generalized linear mixed model glmm procedures are used to analyse the data consisting of 126 observations of catchments and corresponding pumping stations located in five different cities this study presents a procedure to model the probability of the presence or absence of fog in pump sumps as a function of demographic and general system characteristics of catchment areas the final model contains three parameters representing the average catchment income fse food service establishments density and kinetic energy density of wastewater the high significance of the parameter personal income demonstrates that it is possible to identify a relationship between fog disposal and the accumulation of fog in sewer systems on a catchment scale this suggests that some aspects of lifestyle i e fog disposal patterns are shared by particular demographic groups thereby resulting in significant variation in the probability of fog accumulation in pumping stations between catchment areas additionally the analysis shows that geometrical configurations of pumping stations may play an essential role in the prevention of severe fog accumulation the model reveals that severe accumulation of fog in pump sumps is negatively related to the average income earned per person in the catchments it is expected that particular fog disposal patterns are shared by individuals of one income group as income cannot influence the accumulation of fog in itself particular diets cleaning habits and typical moments of fog disposal might be aspects comprising such disposal patterns and further research is required to obtain insights into how these aspects may influence the accumulation of fog as the dropped parameter percentage of non western immigrants was highly correlated with income these particular disposal patterns might be culture bound furthermore the model revealed that fse density is positively correlated with the presence of fog deposits in pump sumps as the accumulation of fog is generally known to be severe in restaurant and bar areas it is thought that the presence of fses directly contributes to the accumulation of fog next to income and the presence of fses the model finds a negative relationship between the total kinetic energy of dwf per storage volume and presence absence of fog in pump sumps the results of this study can provide useful information for municipalities in every country to define more effective maintenance strategies or to prevent the accumulation of fog it could e g suggest the kind of data that could be recorded by municipalities or motive particular structural configurations of pump sumps in particular for catchments receiving wastewater from areas with a low average income and or where the fse density is high increased construction costs to increase the kinetic energy density may be justified to decrease fog removal costs as the assumptions of both independence and homogeneity however were violated the outcomes of the model should be interpreted with care for future statistical research it is recommended to systematically record the accumulation of fog use a more balanced dataset and perform simulation based cross validation to compare model predictions against data this could improve the predictive performance of the model thereby providing information for preventing the accumulation of fog and making municipal maintenance strategies more effective the outcomes of this study also provide direction for future experimental design further research will focus on the multiphase flow phenomena in wastewater pumping stations and on the influence that geometry has with respect to the accumulation of fog air entrainment and sediment deposits the ultimate goal is to obtain a sound understanding of these processes and to derive a design strategy for wastewater pump sumps that function optimally e g no air entrainment while their maintenance needs notably removing fog and sediments are minimised acknowledgements the research is performed within the dutch kennisprogramma urban drainage knowledge programme urban drainage the involved parties are

19676,dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous and plays an important role in regulating water quality ecological function and the fate and transport of trace elements and pollutants in aquatic environments both the colloidal precursors i e 1 kda and bulk dom collected from a freshwater estuary were incubated in the dark for 21 days to examine dynamic changes in molecular size and composition induced by microbial degradation and self assembly results showed that the concentrations of total organic carbon carbohydrates and protein like substances decreased by 11 30 during incubation while those of humic and fulvic like substances remained relatively constant indicating humic substances are more resistant to microbial utilization compared to carbohydrates and protein like dom despite the different extents in decline these dom components had a similar transformation pathway from the 1 kda to colloids 1 kda 0 45 μm and further to microparticles 0 45 μm overall carbohydrates and protein like substances especially the high molecular weight components were preferentially decomposed by microorganisms whereas humic and fulvic like dom components significantly coagulated through abiotic self assembly the contrasting degradation transformation pathways between the humic like and protein like substances along the size continuum as also characterized by flow field flow fractionation analysis demonstrated that the dynamic transformation and degradation of dom is regulated by both molecular size and organic composition this finding provides new insights into the biogeochemical cycling pathways of heterogeneous dom and its environmental fate and ecological role in aquatic systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter size continuum colloids microbial degradation self assembly 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and is composed of proteins carbohydrates humic substances and others with a continuous molecular weight and size spectrum from 1 nm to 0 45 μm kellerman et al 2014 philippe and schaumann 2014 xu and guo 2017 in aquatic environments dom could undergo alterations and transformation via different biotic and abiotic processes such as aggregation dissolution adsorption desorption sedimentation autoxidation and photochemical and microbial degradation catalán et al 2016 he et al 2016 bravo et al 2017 galeron et al 2018 resulting in a dynamic change in dom abundance molecular size and chemical composition in aquatic systems changes in the molecular size distribution of dom components may in turn influence their environmental behavior and ecological function for example macromolecular dom fractions can be microbially degraded into intermediate and low molecular sized fractions thus accelerating the pathways of carbon transport from the hydrosphere to the atmosphere fasching et al 2014 low molecular weight lmw dom fractions however could also coagulate or self assemble to form colloids and or micelle like microparticles honeyman and santschi 1989 kerner et al 2003 which can prolong the presence of carbon in the water column and or sediments and influences the cycling of contaminants and bioactive elements philippe and schaumann 2014 in addition dom with different molecular sizes may exhibit various roles in influencing the colloidal behavior it has been shown that lmw dom could stabilize colloids whereas high molecular size biopolymers would destabilize them wilkinson et al 1997 buffle et al 1998 however specific cycling pathways of different dom size fractions and components within the bulk dom pool and controlling mechanisms in dom transformation remain poorly understood despite applications of novel mass spectrometry techniques such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry to dom characterization at the molecular level have been widely reported e g kujawinski et al 2004 koch et al 2005 kellerman et al 2014 lv et al 2016 galeron et al 2018 in addition to photochemical degradation biotic degradation and abiotic processes are the two most important mechanisms resulting in dom transformation in aquatic environments chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 he et al 2016 compared with photochemical reactions that occurred only in the photic zone microbial degradation proceeded ubiquitously and can contribute up to 60 of dom consumption depending on sources of dom and its specific size fractions and chemical components e g hur et al 2009 benner and amon 2015 abiotic processes important to dom transformation may include self assembly chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 although autoxidative degradation may be also important e g rontani et al 2017 galeron et al 2018 indeed the self assembly of dom has received continuous attention due to its critical role in carbon cycling and nutrient dynamics chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 verdugo et al 2004 ding et al 2008 however previous studies on the self assembly were mainly focused on mathematical model honeyman and santschi 1989 or the time dependent increase in hydrodynamic diameters chin et al 1998 lacking direct measurements of dom composition size fractionation and or partitioning between dissolved and colloidal phases although subsequent studies have examined the partitioning of bulk dom in different size fractions kerner et al 2003 knowledge on changes in continuous size distribution and organic components during dom self assembly is lacking moreover previous studies examined the effects of biotic and abiotic processes separately which may not represent natural environments where the two processes coexist and interact each other zhang et al 2014 therefore studies on the coupling effect of both biological and physicochemical processes on the transformation of dom between different molecular sizes and components should provide new insights into better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of dom with respect to fate transport ecological role and environmental impacts of dom in aquatic systems in this study water samples were collected from a freshwater estuary for dom size fractionation chemical characterization and incubation experiments to elucidate the dynamic transformation of dom among different molecular size fractions time series and size fractionated dom samples were measured for dissolved organic carbon doc uv visible and fluorescence spectra and carbohydrates to examine changes in chemical composition during biotic degradation and self assembly in addition asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation flfff was applied to track dom size spectra and their variations during incubation to reveal the transformation mechanisms of different dom components along the size continuum our hypothesis is that biotic degradation and self assembly contribute unequally to changes in dom size spectra and chemical composition the main objectives of this study were to 1 explore the dynamic variations in dom physicochemical properties and their relation to both biotic and abiotic processes 2 track the transformation pathway of different dom components among the lmw 1 kda colloidal 1 kda 0 45 μm and microparticle 0 45 μm fractions and 3 quantify the counteracting roles of microbial degradation and self assembly in the transformation of different dom components along the size continuum 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection incubation experiments and sample processing surface water samples were collected in october 2016 from the milwaukee river estuary which is the confluence of the milwaukee river the kinnickinnic river and the menomonee river rachdawong and christensen 1997 freshwater discharge during our sampling time period was 10 m3 second the water temperature specific conductivity and chlorophyll a were 9 5 c 437 μs cm 1 and 6 53 μg l 1 respectively water samples were pumped directly from surface water 0 5 m depth through a polycarbonate cartridge 0 45 μm ge into the acid cleaned hdpe plastic bottles using a peristaltic pump to obtain the bulk dom sample the 0 45 μm filtrate sample was divided into two parts one for dom characterization and incubation experiments and the other for ultrafiltration using a 1 kda membrane to obtain the 1 kda dom sample fig 1 two liters of the bulk dom or 1 kda dom samples were placed in acid cleaned hdpe containers for dark incubation the microorganisms retained on the 0 45 μm filters and 1 kda ultrafilters were diluted 40 fold to obtain microbial inocula for the bulk and 1 kda dom samples aliquots 1 ml of the prepared inoculum solution were added to the corresponding incubation containers and incubated at 10 c similar to the in situ water temperature 9 5 c for 21 days in the dark with mild agitation two times per day time series samples were collected at 2 4 8 15 and 21 d respectively during incubation contribution of organic matter due to the addition of microbial inocula comprised about 0 1 in mass of the bulk doc fig s1 in the si and the variations in bacterial abundance during the incubation period based on the analysis of flow cytometer gong et al 2017 indicated a negligible effect of microbial inoculation on doc fig s2 in the si the initial and time series bulk dom samples 0 45 μm were processed for the measurements of doc spectral parameters including chromophoric and fluorescent dom and carbohydrates to evaluate the role of microbial degradation in changes of dom composition and size fig 1 the time series bulk dom samples from incubation experiments were re filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and then ultrafiltered with different molecular weight cutoff mwco membranes to examine changes in dom abundance and thus the role of self assembly in regulating the phase partitioning of dom components two millipore ultrafiltration discs ym 1 and ym 10 with a nominal mwco of 1 kda and 10 kda respectively were used along with a stirred cell unit amicon 8050 for the ultrafiltration of the 0 45 μm filtrate to obtain three different dom size fractions namely the 1 kda 1 10 kda and 10 kda 0 45 μm fractions before and during the dark incubation the initial and time series 1 kda samples were measured for the same set of dom species without further micro or ultra filtration fig 1 therefore changes in dom abundance with time here were mostly the result of microbial degradation since self assembly only changed the size but not the mass of dom in addition the difference between the 1 kda incubated samples and the ultrafiltrate of bulk dom samples via 1 kda membrane i e concentration difference between steps 4 and 6 in fig 1 can be considered as the contribution of self assembly each incubation experiment was conducted in duplicate and one way anova and t test were performed to examine the significance in differences between different sample data sets removal or apparent degradation rate constants were calculated based on the first order reaction equation c c 0 e k t where c is the concentration of a specific component at time t c 0 is its initial concentration and k is the rate constant 2 2 measurements of doc and optical properties concentrations of doc were measured on a shimadzu toc l analyzer equipped with an asi l autosampler uv vis absorption spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer agilent 8453 over a wavelength range of 190 1000 nm with 1 nm increment optical parameters such as absorption coefficients at a specific wavelength λ a λ and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 were used to characterize the abundance of chromophoric dom and its aromaticity respectively and parameter s275 295 was used to probe the changes in molecular weights helms et al 2008 detailed information on the calculation of these optical parameters is given in the supporting information si fluorescence eem spectra were gathered with scanning emission em wavelength ranging from 240 to 600 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 480 nm at 5 nm increments on a spectrofluorometer horiba fluoromax 4 to characterize protein humic and fulvic like components the blank scans were performed every 10 analyses using ultrapure water and areas affected by rayleigh and raman scattering peaks were eliminated by setting data to zero samples with high absorbance were diluted with ultrapure water 18 2 mω to reach absorbance 0 02 at 260 nm in order to minimize the inner filter effect zhou et al 2016 fluorescence indices including fluorescence index fix the ratio of em intensity at 450 nm to that of 500 nm for a fixed ex wavelength of 370 nm biological index bix the ratio of em intensity at 380 nm divided by the intensity maximum observed between 420 and 435 nm at ex wavelength of 310 nm and humification index hix the ratio of em intensity of 435 480 nm divided by the sum of em intensity in the 300 345 and 435 480 nm at excitation wavelength of 254 nm were obtained based on previous studies huguet et al 2009 mcknight et al 2001 zsolnay et al 1999 a total of 60 eem spectra were obtained for parafac analysis which was conducted in matlabr2013a mathworks natick ma using the domfluor toolbox http www models life ku dk detailed procedures about the parafac analysis can be found elsewhere stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013 2 3 measurements of total carbohydrates concentrations of total dissolved carbohydrates were measured using the 2 4 6 tripyridyl s triazine tptz method myklestad et al 1997 hung et al 2001 which also determines acid polysaccharides detailed procedures on the carbohydrate measurement which had been described previously xu and guo 2017 are given in the si 2 4 flow field flow fractionation analysis the flow field flow fractionation flfff is an analytical technique that can provide continuous size distributions and characterizations of dom when coupled with online detectors our asymmetrical flfff system af2000 postnova was equipped with a 0 3 kda polyether sulfone ultrafiltration membrane zhou and guo 2015 a mixed solution with 10 mm nacl aq and 5 mm h3bo3 aq and ph of 8 adjusted with naoh was used as the carrier solution two online fluorescence detectors rf20a shimadzu were used to detect the humic and protein like dom at ex em at 350 450 nm and 275 340 nm respectively the continuous size distributions of dom samples were obtained by converting the retention time into diffusion coefficient and equivalent hydrodynamic diameter stolpe et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 the weighted average mw of dom samples was calculated as m w i 1 n h i m i i 1 n h i where h i and m i are the signal height and molar mass of corresponding fluorescent components detailed cleaning calibration and analytical procedures are described in zhou and guo 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of doc between different molecular sizes concentrations of doc in the bulk and 1 kda water samples were 725 1 and 241 3 μm c giving rise to a concentration of 485 3 μm c in the 1 kda 0 45 μm colloidal fraction fig 2 the percentage of colloidal organic carbon observed here was 67 0 0 3 of the bulk doc which was comparable with that in other aquatic environments such as the mississippi river 64 69 guo et al 2009 and lake biwa 55 69 wu et al 2003 but higher than coastal seawater in the northern gulf of mexico 40 zhou et al 2016 following the incubation the doc abundance decreased significantly p 0 01 from 725 1 to 645 5 μm c in the bulk dom sample and from 241 3 to 164 3 μm c in the 1 kda dom fraction whereas doc in the colloidal fraction exhibited little decrease from 485 3 μm c to 480 7 μm c the removal rate constant of doc for the 1 kda fraction 0 0165 0 001 d 1 was higher than that for the bulk dom 0 0046 0 0005 d 1 p 0 01 table s1 in the si resulting in an increase in colloidal percentage from 67 0 0 3 to 74 0 0 2 another interesting observation was that filterable microparticles 0 45 μm were gradually formed with a rate constant of 0 0657 0 0003 d 1 table s1 in the si and an overall abundance of 29 9 0 2 μm c in the 0 45 μm fraction after incubation fig 2a these results indicate a dynamic transformation and or repartitioning of dom among the 1 kda dom colloidal dom and microparticles during incubation two major processes were responsible for this dynamic transformation microbial degradation and self assembly as calculated from data in fig 2 a total of 11 1 0 8 of the bulk doc was removed during incubation where microbial degradation and self assembly contributed 7 0 0 7 and 4 1 0 1 respectively similarly doc in the 1 kda sample decreased by 31 7 0 5 where the self assembly process accounted for a higher percentage 25 0 0 5 than microbial degradation 6 7 0 9 p 0 01 fig 2b these results demonstrate that significant dom transformation occurs between different size fractions through both degradation and coagulation in aquatic environments although microbial degradation contributed significantly to the decline of the bulk dom pool coagulation self assembly became the dominant process responsible for the variations of dom in the 1 kda pool the aggregation potential of the 1 kda dom has also been reported in previous studies based on the decreased doc concentration in the 1 kda ultrafiltrate after a consecutive ultrafiltration e g guo et al 2000 the predominant contribution of self assembly observed in the 1 kda lmw dom pool could be due to cation bridging e g ca2 stolpe et al 2010 and or possible hydrophobic properties of dom fractions mcphedran et al 2013 and low bioreactivity compared to its high molecular weight hmw counterparts benner and amon 2015 3 2 size dependent changes in carbohydrates during incubation the concentration of carbohydrates in the bulk dom pool was 106 6 μm c fig 2c comprising 14 6 0 5 of the total doc the carbohydrate concentration is similar to that reported for other river waters although the carbohydrate doc ratio is relatively lower compared to other study areas hung et al 2001 guéguen et al 2006 wang et al 2013 during the incubation the carbohydrates in the bulk and 1 kda dom pools decreased substantially from 106 6 to 83 2 μm c and from 46 2 to 27 1 μm c respectively corresponding to an overall decrease of 22 and 40 in their total abundance and showing a preferential removal of carbohydrates compared to the other dom pools 11 for the bulk doc and 32 for the 1 kda doc however the colloidal carbohydrate fraction only had a slight decrease from 60 3 to 56 3 μm c or a decrease of 7 reflecting an active transformation between the lmw and colloidal carbohydrates and or preferential degradation of lmw carbohydrates the difference in the removal rate constants between the bulk and 1 kda carbohydrate fractions 0 0083 0 0001 vs 0 0197 0 001 d 1 table s1 in the si again elucidates the heterogeneous nature of dom and the molecular size dependent transformation during incubation the incubation eventually resulted in the formation of carbohydrate microparticles with a production rate constant of 0 0349 0 0004 d 1 and a final particulate carbohydrate abundance of 2 4 0 1 μm c due to the removal of dissolved carbohydrate into the particulate phase the colloidal carbohydrate percentage increased from 57 1 0 6 to 67 1 0 1 of the total doc pool during incubation fig 2c despite a slight decrease in colloidal carbohydrate abundance from 60 3 to 56 3 μm c within the 21 8 0 2 decrease in the bulk carbohydrates from 106 6 to 83 2 μm c during incubation 19 6 0 2 or 90 of the total decrease resulted from microbial degradation while 2 4 0 1 or 11 of the total decrease was from self assembly the 1 kda carbohydrates on the other hand exhibited a higher overall consumption 40 1 with microbial degradation and self assembly contributing 75 and 25 of the total decline respectively fig 2d interestingly the percentage of carbohydrate consumption by microbial degradation was higher in the bulk dom pool 90 compared to the 1 kda dom pool 75 indicating higher biological reactivity of colloidal or hmw dom this is consistent with previous studies showing that hmw dom is younger and biologically more labile in aquatic environments guo et al 1996 benner and amon 2015 in contrast the percentage of carbohydrates removed by self assembly was only 25 in the 1 kda dom pool and 11 in the bulk dom pool during incubation higher apparent carbohydrate removal percentage in the 1 kda dom pool is somewhat surprising likely due to the result of lower biological activity of the 1 kda dom pool allowing physicochemical transformation of carbohydrates from lmw to colloidal microparticle phase chin et al 1998 ding et al 2008 the role of self assembly in the formation of polysaccharide gels had been reported in marine systems verdugo et al 2004 pletikapić et al 2014 as shown here physical coagulation or self assembly also played an important role in the transformation and cycling of organic carbon in the freshwater environment removing up to 11 of the 0 45 μm carbohydrate and 25 of the 1 kda carbohydrate pool fig 2c d however within the same incubation time period microbial degradation was still the major process for the removal of carbohydrates in both the bulk and 1 kda dom pools compared with oligotrophic ecosystems river estuarine and coastal waters contain higher dom abundance guo et al 1996 and thus microbial utilization of carbohydrates should play a critical role in changes in the composition of dom and its environmental behavior benner and amon 2015 3 3 changes in dom characteristics during incubation spectral parameters including suva254 and spectral slope were used to characterize the variations in dom properties during incubation table 1 for the bulk dom the suva254 values significantly increased from 3 40 0 01 to 3 58 0 02 l mg c m indicating preferential utilization of non chromophoric or less chromophoric moieties and or the microbial transformation of labile compounds into aromatic carbon structures spectral slope values however exhibited a slight decrease from 1 582 0 004 10 2 to 1 572 0 001 10 2 nm 1 supporting size transformation from lmw to hmw through self assembly and demonstrating an incubation induced mw enhancement helms et al 2008 these results are also consistent with those observed for allochthonous e g leaf litter and autochthonous e g algae dom samples hur et al 2011 fluorescence eem spectra contained typical humic ex em 320 430 nm fulvic ex em 240 430 nm and protein like ex em 240 300 nm peaks in all samples fig s3 in the si indices derived from the eem spectra including hix fix and bix showed different variations in that the values of fix and bix remained almost constant whereas those of hix exhibited an evident increase during the incubation fig s4 in the si indicating that less humified dom components had relatively higher biological reactivity these results are consistent with changes of suva254 table 1 which showed microbial utilization could result in the enrichment of more condensed aromatic structures and or more conjugation of aliphatic chains hur et al 2011 fuentes et al 2006 parafac analysis was also applied to track the variations of dom components four independent fluorescent components were identified from all eem contours fig 3 component 1 c1 and c2 with similar ex em maxima 260 280 420 480 nm were ascribed to humic like substances osburn et al 2012 c3 ex em 280 520 nm to the fulvic like substance devilbiss et al 2016 and c4 ex em 280 320 nm to tyrosine like substance xu et al 2013 as depicted in fig 3 fluorescent c1 c2 and c3 had a similar variation trend in that the total intensities the sum of bulk and microparticle fractions remained nearly constant during dark incubation showing a fairly refractory nature for the humic and fulvic like substances results from the dark incubation of the 1 kda samples further confirmed their resistance to microbial utilization fig s5 in the si thus self assembly was mainly responsible for the variations in the humic and fulvic like substances despite the constancy of their total abundance a dynamic transformation was observed among different molecular sized dom components within the bulk dom pool for example the intensities of all dom components in the 1 kda fraction decreased while those in the colloidal and microparticle fractions increased showing evident transformation from the 1 kda precursor to colloids and further to microparticles during incubation fig 3 compared with other fluorescent dom components i e c1 c2 and c3 the protein like component c4 exhibited a different variation pattern during the incubation the decreasing abundance in the bulk and the 1 kda dom pools as well as the formation of microparticles fig 3 and fig s5 indicates the contribution from both microbial degradation and self assembly the higher rate constant in c4 removal in the 1 kda dom pool 0 0179 0 0001 d 1 than the bulk dom pool 0 0116 0 0001 d 1 table s1 in the si p 0 01 agrees well with the enhancement of colloidal percentage from 47 0 0 2 to 50 0 1 6 again demonstrating an active transformation of protein like dom from the 1 kda to colloidal and microparticles within the bulk dom pool as also observed for carbohydrates fig 2 for the incubation of bulk dom samples the c4 fluorescent intensity decreased by 30 8 1 3 from 21 1 0 4 to 14 6 0 6 ppb qse within which self assembly accounted for 6 8 of the decline from zero to 0 45 0 01 ppb qse leaving 93 2 from microbial degradation however the intensity of c4 in the 1 kda dom pool decreased by 34 9 0 6 from 11 1 0 0 to 7 3 0 1 ppb qse with the microbial degradation and self assembly contributing 56 2 and 43 8 respectively of the decline therefore unlike for the humic fulvic like substances microbial degradation was the major pathway responsible for the variations in protein like substances both in the bulk and the 1 kda dom pools during dark incubation similar to those of carbohydrates fig 2 3 4 variations in size spectra of organic components based on fifff analysis both the humic and protein like substances in the bulk dom sample were characterized by a single major peak ranging from 1 5 nm to 6 nm with a central peak located at around 2 5 nm fig s6 in the si although the size spectra collected at different incubation times were similar in terms of shapes and intensities time dependent heterogeneity in molecular size distribution was observed fig 4 for the humic like substances the percentage in the small sized fraction 1 kda decreased with time fluctuated in the medium sized fraction 1 100 kda and increased in the large sized fraction 100 kda 0 45 μm showing a dom size transformation from the 1 kda components to colloidal and to microparticle fractions through self assembly or coagulation processes consequently the mw of humic like substances increased slightly from 2 93 104 da in the initial solution to 3 08 104 da after the incubation table 1 the protein like substances however were characterized by a different size transformation pattern fig 4 and table 1 for example the percentage in the large sized fraction gradually decreased whereas those in the medium and small sized fractions increased indicating a dynamic transformation from large sized protein like substances to medium and small sized moieties due to the active microbial degradation of large sized dom the decreased mw from 4 16 104 to 2 79 104 da for protein like components in contrast to humic like dom components demonstrates the predominant influence of microbial degradation over self assembly for protein like substances results combining ultrafiltration and fifff analysis here provided direct evidence that self assembly was the dominant process inducing the dynamic transformation of humic like substances from lmw to hmw along the size continuum whereas microbial degradation was the major pathway for the molecular size transformation of protein like substances largely from hmw to lmw size fractions 3 5 environmental implications knowledge of size distribution reactivity and transformation of dom between dissolved colloidal and particulate phases and or among trophic levels can increase our understanding of carbon and nutrient cycles particle dynamics and fate and transport of contaminants in aquatic systems chin et al 1998 pomeroy et al 2007 maizel and remucal 2017 however many previous studies dealing with dom size transformation and size reactivity did not involve chemical composition of dom amon and benner 1996 chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 as shown in previous sections we found that humic like components in the 1 kda dom can be self assembled to form colloids and microparticles within 2 20 days the self assembly therefore makes dom more efficiently available to phagotrophic organisms than through the microbial loop especially for humic like dom components our results thus provide new evidence to elucidate that dom can be directly transferred to higher trophic levels via abiotic processes and microparticle formation which could be seen as a bypass of microbial loop kerner et al 2003 pomeroy et al 2007 the results agree with our hypothesis although previous studies on dom coagulation and microgel formation were highlighted for both seawater chin et al 1998 verdugo et al 2004 and river water kerner et al 2003 these studies have been limited mainly to measurements of hydrodynamic diameter or bulk doc compared to a 10 formation potential for marine microgel the assembly capacity of freshwater dom was only 4 1 0 1 substantially lower than that in marine environments the lower assembly capacity could be attributed to the relatively low ca2 abundance low salinity 0 4 vs 35 and the lower potential of ca binding to doc polyanionic chains in freshwater environments verdugo et al 2004 in addition since dom contains heterogeneous organic components information on the bulk doc may not be representative of the assembly process of different dom components using ultrafiltration eems and flfff techniques the self assembly of various organic components in both the bulk and 1 kda dom pools has been investigated here for the first time simultaneously with the degradation pathway the transformation processes were component and molecular size specific with contrasting pathways for humic like and protein like substances and unique for carbohydrate dom components overall in the bulk dom pool the fulvic like substances exhibited highest self assembly potential 5 6 0 2 followed by humic like 2 6 4 0 carbohydrate 2 4 0 1 and protein like substances 2 1 0 1 p 0 05 for the 1 kda dom pool however the self assembly potential decreased in the order of fulvic like 33 9 6 2 humic like 19 9 28 0 protein like 15 3 0 1 carbohydrates 10 0 1 4 therefore the self assembly potential of dom in freshwater environments was significantly related to both organic composition and molecular size along with the self assembly microbial degradation was another important process in regulating dom size and composition in aquatic environments nevertheless previous studies dealt with physicochemical and biological processes separately chin et al 1998 hur et al 2011 kellerman et al 2014 our results here thus provide a more comprehensive understanding of the coupling effects from both microbial degradation and self assembly on the transformation of different sized dom pools and various dom components in aquatic systems the size transformation pathway from lmw dom to colloidal organic matter observed here especially for carbohydrates and likely transparent exopolymers and their precursors guo et al 2000 bar zeev et al 2015 can serve as a conduit through which surface reactive trace elements and organic pollutants are scavenged or removed from the water column affecting water quality and their environmental fate and biogeochemical cycling processes in aquatic environments our results can also provide new guidance for the biogeochemical study of dom including sampling sample storage processing and analysis characterization for example dom samples in many studies were usually stored for transport prior to processing and analysis kitis et al 2001 the stability of humic and fulvic substances did not seem to be an issue in the dark cold storage but microbial consumption could be significant for carbohydrates and protein like dom substances during storage affecting dom composition and size spectra thus dom samples should be processed as soon as possible for the characterization of molecular size and chemical composition 4 conclusions the results support our hypothesis that microbial degradation and self assembly contribute unequally to the changes in molecular size and composition of freshwater dom carbohydrates and protein like substances underwent obvious microbial utilization while humic and fulvic like substances were somewhat resistant within 2 20 days both the total doc and different dom components exhibited a molecular size dependent transformation in that the 1 kda precursors were self assembled to form colloids and microparticles this dynamic transformation was evident from both organic component and molecular size the self assembly was responsible for the dynamic variations of the humic and fulvic like substances along the size continuum whereas microbial degradation became the major mechanism for the molecular size dependent change in carbohydrates and protein like substances our new results on the coupling effect from microbial degradation and self assembly on changes in dom composition and size spectra should provide new insights into the heterogeneity of natural dom and provide a better understanding of dom reactivity environmental fate and ecological role along the dom size continuum in aquatic systems acknowledgements we thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions on the manuscript this study was

19676,dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous and plays an important role in regulating water quality ecological function and the fate and transport of trace elements and pollutants in aquatic environments both the colloidal precursors i e 1 kda and bulk dom collected from a freshwater estuary were incubated in the dark for 21 days to examine dynamic changes in molecular size and composition induced by microbial degradation and self assembly results showed that the concentrations of total organic carbon carbohydrates and protein like substances decreased by 11 30 during incubation while those of humic and fulvic like substances remained relatively constant indicating humic substances are more resistant to microbial utilization compared to carbohydrates and protein like dom despite the different extents in decline these dom components had a similar transformation pathway from the 1 kda to colloids 1 kda 0 45 μm and further to microparticles 0 45 μm overall carbohydrates and protein like substances especially the high molecular weight components were preferentially decomposed by microorganisms whereas humic and fulvic like dom components significantly coagulated through abiotic self assembly the contrasting degradation transformation pathways between the humic like and protein like substances along the size continuum as also characterized by flow field flow fractionation analysis demonstrated that the dynamic transformation and degradation of dom is regulated by both molecular size and organic composition this finding provides new insights into the biogeochemical cycling pathways of heterogeneous dom and its environmental fate and ecological role in aquatic systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter size continuum colloids microbial degradation self assembly 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in aquatic environments and is composed of proteins carbohydrates humic substances and others with a continuous molecular weight and size spectrum from 1 nm to 0 45 μm kellerman et al 2014 philippe and schaumann 2014 xu and guo 2017 in aquatic environments dom could undergo alterations and transformation via different biotic and abiotic processes such as aggregation dissolution adsorption desorption sedimentation autoxidation and photochemical and microbial degradation catalán et al 2016 he et al 2016 bravo et al 2017 galeron et al 2018 resulting in a dynamic change in dom abundance molecular size and chemical composition in aquatic systems changes in the molecular size distribution of dom components may in turn influence their environmental behavior and ecological function for example macromolecular dom fractions can be microbially degraded into intermediate and low molecular sized fractions thus accelerating the pathways of carbon transport from the hydrosphere to the atmosphere fasching et al 2014 low molecular weight lmw dom fractions however could also coagulate or self assemble to form colloids and or micelle like microparticles honeyman and santschi 1989 kerner et al 2003 which can prolong the presence of carbon in the water column and or sediments and influences the cycling of contaminants and bioactive elements philippe and schaumann 2014 in addition dom with different molecular sizes may exhibit various roles in influencing the colloidal behavior it has been shown that lmw dom could stabilize colloids whereas high molecular size biopolymers would destabilize them wilkinson et al 1997 buffle et al 1998 however specific cycling pathways of different dom size fractions and components within the bulk dom pool and controlling mechanisms in dom transformation remain poorly understood despite applications of novel mass spectrometry techniques such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry to dom characterization at the molecular level have been widely reported e g kujawinski et al 2004 koch et al 2005 kellerman et al 2014 lv et al 2016 galeron et al 2018 in addition to photochemical degradation biotic degradation and abiotic processes are the two most important mechanisms resulting in dom transformation in aquatic environments chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 he et al 2016 compared with photochemical reactions that occurred only in the photic zone microbial degradation proceeded ubiquitously and can contribute up to 60 of dom consumption depending on sources of dom and its specific size fractions and chemical components e g hur et al 2009 benner and amon 2015 abiotic processes important to dom transformation may include self assembly chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 although autoxidative degradation may be also important e g rontani et al 2017 galeron et al 2018 indeed the self assembly of dom has received continuous attention due to its critical role in carbon cycling and nutrient dynamics chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 verdugo et al 2004 ding et al 2008 however previous studies on the self assembly were mainly focused on mathematical model honeyman and santschi 1989 or the time dependent increase in hydrodynamic diameters chin et al 1998 lacking direct measurements of dom composition size fractionation and or partitioning between dissolved and colloidal phases although subsequent studies have examined the partitioning of bulk dom in different size fractions kerner et al 2003 knowledge on changes in continuous size distribution and organic components during dom self assembly is lacking moreover previous studies examined the effects of biotic and abiotic processes separately which may not represent natural environments where the two processes coexist and interact each other zhang et al 2014 therefore studies on the coupling effect of both biological and physicochemical processes on the transformation of dom between different molecular sizes and components should provide new insights into better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of dom with respect to fate transport ecological role and environmental impacts of dom in aquatic systems in this study water samples were collected from a freshwater estuary for dom size fractionation chemical characterization and incubation experiments to elucidate the dynamic transformation of dom among different molecular size fractions time series and size fractionated dom samples were measured for dissolved organic carbon doc uv visible and fluorescence spectra and carbohydrates to examine changes in chemical composition during biotic degradation and self assembly in addition asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation flfff was applied to track dom size spectra and their variations during incubation to reveal the transformation mechanisms of different dom components along the size continuum our hypothesis is that biotic degradation and self assembly contribute unequally to changes in dom size spectra and chemical composition the main objectives of this study were to 1 explore the dynamic variations in dom physicochemical properties and their relation to both biotic and abiotic processes 2 track the transformation pathway of different dom components among the lmw 1 kda colloidal 1 kda 0 45 μm and microparticle 0 45 μm fractions and 3 quantify the counteracting roles of microbial degradation and self assembly in the transformation of different dom components along the size continuum 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection incubation experiments and sample processing surface water samples were collected in october 2016 from the milwaukee river estuary which is the confluence of the milwaukee river the kinnickinnic river and the menomonee river rachdawong and christensen 1997 freshwater discharge during our sampling time period was 10 m3 second the water temperature specific conductivity and chlorophyll a were 9 5 c 437 μs cm 1 and 6 53 μg l 1 respectively water samples were pumped directly from surface water 0 5 m depth through a polycarbonate cartridge 0 45 μm ge into the acid cleaned hdpe plastic bottles using a peristaltic pump to obtain the bulk dom sample the 0 45 μm filtrate sample was divided into two parts one for dom characterization and incubation experiments and the other for ultrafiltration using a 1 kda membrane to obtain the 1 kda dom sample fig 1 two liters of the bulk dom or 1 kda dom samples were placed in acid cleaned hdpe containers for dark incubation the microorganisms retained on the 0 45 μm filters and 1 kda ultrafilters were diluted 40 fold to obtain microbial inocula for the bulk and 1 kda dom samples aliquots 1 ml of the prepared inoculum solution were added to the corresponding incubation containers and incubated at 10 c similar to the in situ water temperature 9 5 c for 21 days in the dark with mild agitation two times per day time series samples were collected at 2 4 8 15 and 21 d respectively during incubation contribution of organic matter due to the addition of microbial inocula comprised about 0 1 in mass of the bulk doc fig s1 in the si and the variations in bacterial abundance during the incubation period based on the analysis of flow cytometer gong et al 2017 indicated a negligible effect of microbial inoculation on doc fig s2 in the si the initial and time series bulk dom samples 0 45 μm were processed for the measurements of doc spectral parameters including chromophoric and fluorescent dom and carbohydrates to evaluate the role of microbial degradation in changes of dom composition and size fig 1 the time series bulk dom samples from incubation experiments were re filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and then ultrafiltered with different molecular weight cutoff mwco membranes to examine changes in dom abundance and thus the role of self assembly in regulating the phase partitioning of dom components two millipore ultrafiltration discs ym 1 and ym 10 with a nominal mwco of 1 kda and 10 kda respectively were used along with a stirred cell unit amicon 8050 for the ultrafiltration of the 0 45 μm filtrate to obtain three different dom size fractions namely the 1 kda 1 10 kda and 10 kda 0 45 μm fractions before and during the dark incubation the initial and time series 1 kda samples were measured for the same set of dom species without further micro or ultra filtration fig 1 therefore changes in dom abundance with time here were mostly the result of microbial degradation since self assembly only changed the size but not the mass of dom in addition the difference between the 1 kda incubated samples and the ultrafiltrate of bulk dom samples via 1 kda membrane i e concentration difference between steps 4 and 6 in fig 1 can be considered as the contribution of self assembly each incubation experiment was conducted in duplicate and one way anova and t test were performed to examine the significance in differences between different sample data sets removal or apparent degradation rate constants were calculated based on the first order reaction equation c c 0 e k t where c is the concentration of a specific component at time t c 0 is its initial concentration and k is the rate constant 2 2 measurements of doc and optical properties concentrations of doc were measured on a shimadzu toc l analyzer equipped with an asi l autosampler uv vis absorption spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer agilent 8453 over a wavelength range of 190 1000 nm with 1 nm increment optical parameters such as absorption coefficients at a specific wavelength λ a λ and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 were used to characterize the abundance of chromophoric dom and its aromaticity respectively and parameter s275 295 was used to probe the changes in molecular weights helms et al 2008 detailed information on the calculation of these optical parameters is given in the supporting information si fluorescence eem spectra were gathered with scanning emission em wavelength ranging from 240 to 600 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 480 nm at 5 nm increments on a spectrofluorometer horiba fluoromax 4 to characterize protein humic and fulvic like components the blank scans were performed every 10 analyses using ultrapure water and areas affected by rayleigh and raman scattering peaks were eliminated by setting data to zero samples with high absorbance were diluted with ultrapure water 18 2 mω to reach absorbance 0 02 at 260 nm in order to minimize the inner filter effect zhou et al 2016 fluorescence indices including fluorescence index fix the ratio of em intensity at 450 nm to that of 500 nm for a fixed ex wavelength of 370 nm biological index bix the ratio of em intensity at 380 nm divided by the intensity maximum observed between 420 and 435 nm at ex wavelength of 310 nm and humification index hix the ratio of em intensity of 435 480 nm divided by the sum of em intensity in the 300 345 and 435 480 nm at excitation wavelength of 254 nm were obtained based on previous studies huguet et al 2009 mcknight et al 2001 zsolnay et al 1999 a total of 60 eem spectra were obtained for parafac analysis which was conducted in matlabr2013a mathworks natick ma using the domfluor toolbox http www models life ku dk detailed procedures about the parafac analysis can be found elsewhere stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013 2 3 measurements of total carbohydrates concentrations of total dissolved carbohydrates were measured using the 2 4 6 tripyridyl s triazine tptz method myklestad et al 1997 hung et al 2001 which also determines acid polysaccharides detailed procedures on the carbohydrate measurement which had been described previously xu and guo 2017 are given in the si 2 4 flow field flow fractionation analysis the flow field flow fractionation flfff is an analytical technique that can provide continuous size distributions and characterizations of dom when coupled with online detectors our asymmetrical flfff system af2000 postnova was equipped with a 0 3 kda polyether sulfone ultrafiltration membrane zhou and guo 2015 a mixed solution with 10 mm nacl aq and 5 mm h3bo3 aq and ph of 8 adjusted with naoh was used as the carrier solution two online fluorescence detectors rf20a shimadzu were used to detect the humic and protein like dom at ex em at 350 450 nm and 275 340 nm respectively the continuous size distributions of dom samples were obtained by converting the retention time into diffusion coefficient and equivalent hydrodynamic diameter stolpe et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 the weighted average mw of dom samples was calculated as m w i 1 n h i m i i 1 n h i where h i and m i are the signal height and molar mass of corresponding fluorescent components detailed cleaning calibration and analytical procedures are described in zhou and guo 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of doc between different molecular sizes concentrations of doc in the bulk and 1 kda water samples were 725 1 and 241 3 μm c giving rise to a concentration of 485 3 μm c in the 1 kda 0 45 μm colloidal fraction fig 2 the percentage of colloidal organic carbon observed here was 67 0 0 3 of the bulk doc which was comparable with that in other aquatic environments such as the mississippi river 64 69 guo et al 2009 and lake biwa 55 69 wu et al 2003 but higher than coastal seawater in the northern gulf of mexico 40 zhou et al 2016 following the incubation the doc abundance decreased significantly p 0 01 from 725 1 to 645 5 μm c in the bulk dom sample and from 241 3 to 164 3 μm c in the 1 kda dom fraction whereas doc in the colloidal fraction exhibited little decrease from 485 3 μm c to 480 7 μm c the removal rate constant of doc for the 1 kda fraction 0 0165 0 001 d 1 was higher than that for the bulk dom 0 0046 0 0005 d 1 p 0 01 table s1 in the si resulting in an increase in colloidal percentage from 67 0 0 3 to 74 0 0 2 another interesting observation was that filterable microparticles 0 45 μm were gradually formed with a rate constant of 0 0657 0 0003 d 1 table s1 in the si and an overall abundance of 29 9 0 2 μm c in the 0 45 μm fraction after incubation fig 2a these results indicate a dynamic transformation and or repartitioning of dom among the 1 kda dom colloidal dom and microparticles during incubation two major processes were responsible for this dynamic transformation microbial degradation and self assembly as calculated from data in fig 2 a total of 11 1 0 8 of the bulk doc was removed during incubation where microbial degradation and self assembly contributed 7 0 0 7 and 4 1 0 1 respectively similarly doc in the 1 kda sample decreased by 31 7 0 5 where the self assembly process accounted for a higher percentage 25 0 0 5 than microbial degradation 6 7 0 9 p 0 01 fig 2b these results demonstrate that significant dom transformation occurs between different size fractions through both degradation and coagulation in aquatic environments although microbial degradation contributed significantly to the decline of the bulk dom pool coagulation self assembly became the dominant process responsible for the variations of dom in the 1 kda pool the aggregation potential of the 1 kda dom has also been reported in previous studies based on the decreased doc concentration in the 1 kda ultrafiltrate after a consecutive ultrafiltration e g guo et al 2000 the predominant contribution of self assembly observed in the 1 kda lmw dom pool could be due to cation bridging e g ca2 stolpe et al 2010 and or possible hydrophobic properties of dom fractions mcphedran et al 2013 and low bioreactivity compared to its high molecular weight hmw counterparts benner and amon 2015 3 2 size dependent changes in carbohydrates during incubation the concentration of carbohydrates in the bulk dom pool was 106 6 μm c fig 2c comprising 14 6 0 5 of the total doc the carbohydrate concentration is similar to that reported for other river waters although the carbohydrate doc ratio is relatively lower compared to other study areas hung et al 2001 guéguen et al 2006 wang et al 2013 during the incubation the carbohydrates in the bulk and 1 kda dom pools decreased substantially from 106 6 to 83 2 μm c and from 46 2 to 27 1 μm c respectively corresponding to an overall decrease of 22 and 40 in their total abundance and showing a preferential removal of carbohydrates compared to the other dom pools 11 for the bulk doc and 32 for the 1 kda doc however the colloidal carbohydrate fraction only had a slight decrease from 60 3 to 56 3 μm c or a decrease of 7 reflecting an active transformation between the lmw and colloidal carbohydrates and or preferential degradation of lmw carbohydrates the difference in the removal rate constants between the bulk and 1 kda carbohydrate fractions 0 0083 0 0001 vs 0 0197 0 001 d 1 table s1 in the si again elucidates the heterogeneous nature of dom and the molecular size dependent transformation during incubation the incubation eventually resulted in the formation of carbohydrate microparticles with a production rate constant of 0 0349 0 0004 d 1 and a final particulate carbohydrate abundance of 2 4 0 1 μm c due to the removal of dissolved carbohydrate into the particulate phase the colloidal carbohydrate percentage increased from 57 1 0 6 to 67 1 0 1 of the total doc pool during incubation fig 2c despite a slight decrease in colloidal carbohydrate abundance from 60 3 to 56 3 μm c within the 21 8 0 2 decrease in the bulk carbohydrates from 106 6 to 83 2 μm c during incubation 19 6 0 2 or 90 of the total decrease resulted from microbial degradation while 2 4 0 1 or 11 of the total decrease was from self assembly the 1 kda carbohydrates on the other hand exhibited a higher overall consumption 40 1 with microbial degradation and self assembly contributing 75 and 25 of the total decline respectively fig 2d interestingly the percentage of carbohydrate consumption by microbial degradation was higher in the bulk dom pool 90 compared to the 1 kda dom pool 75 indicating higher biological reactivity of colloidal or hmw dom this is consistent with previous studies showing that hmw dom is younger and biologically more labile in aquatic environments guo et al 1996 benner and amon 2015 in contrast the percentage of carbohydrates removed by self assembly was only 25 in the 1 kda dom pool and 11 in the bulk dom pool during incubation higher apparent carbohydrate removal percentage in the 1 kda dom pool is somewhat surprising likely due to the result of lower biological activity of the 1 kda dom pool allowing physicochemical transformation of carbohydrates from lmw to colloidal microparticle phase chin et al 1998 ding et al 2008 the role of self assembly in the formation of polysaccharide gels had been reported in marine systems verdugo et al 2004 pletikapić et al 2014 as shown here physical coagulation or self assembly also played an important role in the transformation and cycling of organic carbon in the freshwater environment removing up to 11 of the 0 45 μm carbohydrate and 25 of the 1 kda carbohydrate pool fig 2c d however within the same incubation time period microbial degradation was still the major process for the removal of carbohydrates in both the bulk and 1 kda dom pools compared with oligotrophic ecosystems river estuarine and coastal waters contain higher dom abundance guo et al 1996 and thus microbial utilization of carbohydrates should play a critical role in changes in the composition of dom and its environmental behavior benner and amon 2015 3 3 changes in dom characteristics during incubation spectral parameters including suva254 and spectral slope were used to characterize the variations in dom properties during incubation table 1 for the bulk dom the suva254 values significantly increased from 3 40 0 01 to 3 58 0 02 l mg c m indicating preferential utilization of non chromophoric or less chromophoric moieties and or the microbial transformation of labile compounds into aromatic carbon structures spectral slope values however exhibited a slight decrease from 1 582 0 004 10 2 to 1 572 0 001 10 2 nm 1 supporting size transformation from lmw to hmw through self assembly and demonstrating an incubation induced mw enhancement helms et al 2008 these results are also consistent with those observed for allochthonous e g leaf litter and autochthonous e g algae dom samples hur et al 2011 fluorescence eem spectra contained typical humic ex em 320 430 nm fulvic ex em 240 430 nm and protein like ex em 240 300 nm peaks in all samples fig s3 in the si indices derived from the eem spectra including hix fix and bix showed different variations in that the values of fix and bix remained almost constant whereas those of hix exhibited an evident increase during the incubation fig s4 in the si indicating that less humified dom components had relatively higher biological reactivity these results are consistent with changes of suva254 table 1 which showed microbial utilization could result in the enrichment of more condensed aromatic structures and or more conjugation of aliphatic chains hur et al 2011 fuentes et al 2006 parafac analysis was also applied to track the variations of dom components four independent fluorescent components were identified from all eem contours fig 3 component 1 c1 and c2 with similar ex em maxima 260 280 420 480 nm were ascribed to humic like substances osburn et al 2012 c3 ex em 280 520 nm to the fulvic like substance devilbiss et al 2016 and c4 ex em 280 320 nm to tyrosine like substance xu et al 2013 as depicted in fig 3 fluorescent c1 c2 and c3 had a similar variation trend in that the total intensities the sum of bulk and microparticle fractions remained nearly constant during dark incubation showing a fairly refractory nature for the humic and fulvic like substances results from the dark incubation of the 1 kda samples further confirmed their resistance to microbial utilization fig s5 in the si thus self assembly was mainly responsible for the variations in the humic and fulvic like substances despite the constancy of their total abundance a dynamic transformation was observed among different molecular sized dom components within the bulk dom pool for example the intensities of all dom components in the 1 kda fraction decreased while those in the colloidal and microparticle fractions increased showing evident transformation from the 1 kda precursor to colloids and further to microparticles during incubation fig 3 compared with other fluorescent dom components i e c1 c2 and c3 the protein like component c4 exhibited a different variation pattern during the incubation the decreasing abundance in the bulk and the 1 kda dom pools as well as the formation of microparticles fig 3 and fig s5 indicates the contribution from both microbial degradation and self assembly the higher rate constant in c4 removal in the 1 kda dom pool 0 0179 0 0001 d 1 than the bulk dom pool 0 0116 0 0001 d 1 table s1 in the si p 0 01 agrees well with the enhancement of colloidal percentage from 47 0 0 2 to 50 0 1 6 again demonstrating an active transformation of protein like dom from the 1 kda to colloidal and microparticles within the bulk dom pool as also observed for carbohydrates fig 2 for the incubation of bulk dom samples the c4 fluorescent intensity decreased by 30 8 1 3 from 21 1 0 4 to 14 6 0 6 ppb qse within which self assembly accounted for 6 8 of the decline from zero to 0 45 0 01 ppb qse leaving 93 2 from microbial degradation however the intensity of c4 in the 1 kda dom pool decreased by 34 9 0 6 from 11 1 0 0 to 7 3 0 1 ppb qse with the microbial degradation and self assembly contributing 56 2 and 43 8 respectively of the decline therefore unlike for the humic fulvic like substances microbial degradation was the major pathway responsible for the variations in protein like substances both in the bulk and the 1 kda dom pools during dark incubation similar to those of carbohydrates fig 2 3 4 variations in size spectra of organic components based on fifff analysis both the humic and protein like substances in the bulk dom sample were characterized by a single major peak ranging from 1 5 nm to 6 nm with a central peak located at around 2 5 nm fig s6 in the si although the size spectra collected at different incubation times were similar in terms of shapes and intensities time dependent heterogeneity in molecular size distribution was observed fig 4 for the humic like substances the percentage in the small sized fraction 1 kda decreased with time fluctuated in the medium sized fraction 1 100 kda and increased in the large sized fraction 100 kda 0 45 μm showing a dom size transformation from the 1 kda components to colloidal and to microparticle fractions through self assembly or coagulation processes consequently the mw of humic like substances increased slightly from 2 93 104 da in the initial solution to 3 08 104 da after the incubation table 1 the protein like substances however were characterized by a different size transformation pattern fig 4 and table 1 for example the percentage in the large sized fraction gradually decreased whereas those in the medium and small sized fractions increased indicating a dynamic transformation from large sized protein like substances to medium and small sized moieties due to the active microbial degradation of large sized dom the decreased mw from 4 16 104 to 2 79 104 da for protein like components in contrast to humic like dom components demonstrates the predominant influence of microbial degradation over self assembly for protein like substances results combining ultrafiltration and fifff analysis here provided direct evidence that self assembly was the dominant process inducing the dynamic transformation of humic like substances from lmw to hmw along the size continuum whereas microbial degradation was the major pathway for the molecular size transformation of protein like substances largely from hmw to lmw size fractions 3 5 environmental implications knowledge of size distribution reactivity and transformation of dom between dissolved colloidal and particulate phases and or among trophic levels can increase our understanding of carbon and nutrient cycles particle dynamics and fate and transport of contaminants in aquatic systems chin et al 1998 pomeroy et al 2007 maizel and remucal 2017 however many previous studies dealing with dom size transformation and size reactivity did not involve chemical composition of dom amon and benner 1996 chin et al 1998 kerner et al 2003 as shown in previous sections we found that humic like components in the 1 kda dom can be self assembled to form colloids and microparticles within 2 20 days the self assembly therefore makes dom more efficiently available to phagotrophic organisms than through the microbial loop especially for humic like dom components our results thus provide new evidence to elucidate that dom can be directly transferred to higher trophic levels via abiotic processes and microparticle formation which could be seen as a bypass of microbial loop kerner et al 2003 pomeroy et al 2007 the results agree with our hypothesis although previous studies on dom coagulation and microgel formation were highlighted for both seawater chin et al 1998 verdugo et al 2004 and river water kerner et al 2003 these studies have been limited mainly to measurements of hydrodynamic diameter or bulk doc compared to a 10 formation potential for marine microgel the assembly capacity of freshwater dom was only 4 1 0 1 substantially lower than that in marine environments the lower assembly capacity could be attributed to the relatively low ca2 abundance low salinity 0 4 vs 35 and the lower potential of ca binding to doc polyanionic chains in freshwater environments verdugo et al 2004 in addition since dom contains heterogeneous organic components information on the bulk doc may not be representative of the assembly process of different dom components using ultrafiltration eems and flfff techniques the self assembly of various organic components in both the bulk and 1 kda dom pools has been investigated here for the first time simultaneously with the degradation pathway the transformation processes were component and molecular size specific with contrasting pathways for humic like and protein like substances and unique for carbohydrate dom components overall in the bulk dom pool the fulvic like substances exhibited highest self assembly potential 5 6 0 2 followed by humic like 2 6 4 0 carbohydrate 2 4 0 1 and protein like substances 2 1 0 1 p 0 05 for the 1 kda dom pool however the self assembly potential decreased in the order of fulvic like 33 9 6 2 humic like 19 9 28 0 protein like 15 3 0 1 carbohydrates 10 0 1 4 therefore the self assembly potential of dom in freshwater environments was significantly related to both organic composition and molecular size along with the self assembly microbial degradation was another important process in regulating dom size and composition in aquatic environments nevertheless previous studies dealt with physicochemical and biological processes separately chin et al 1998 hur et al 2011 kellerman et al 2014 our results here thus provide a more comprehensive understanding of the coupling effects from both microbial degradation and self assembly on the transformation of different sized dom pools and various dom components in aquatic systems the size transformation pathway from lmw dom to colloidal organic matter observed here especially for carbohydrates and likely transparent exopolymers and their precursors guo et al 2000 bar zeev et al 2015 can serve as a conduit through which surface reactive trace elements and organic pollutants are scavenged or removed from the water column affecting water quality and their environmental fate and biogeochemical cycling processes in aquatic environments our results can also provide new guidance for the biogeochemical study of dom including sampling sample storage processing and analysis characterization for example dom samples in many studies were usually stored for transport prior to processing and analysis kitis et al 2001 the stability of humic and fulvic substances did not seem to be an issue in the dark cold storage but microbial consumption could be significant for carbohydrates and protein like dom substances during storage affecting dom composition and size spectra thus dom samples should be processed as soon as possible for the characterization of molecular size and chemical composition 4 conclusions the results support our hypothesis that microbial degradation and self assembly contribute unequally to the changes in molecular size and composition of freshwater dom carbohydrates and protein like substances underwent obvious microbial utilization while humic and fulvic like substances were somewhat resistant within 2 20 days both the total doc and different dom components exhibited a molecular size dependent transformation in that the 1 kda precursors were self assembled to form colloids and microparticles this dynamic transformation was evident from both organic component and molecular size the self assembly was responsible for the dynamic variations of the humic and fulvic like substances along the size continuum whereas microbial degradation became the major mechanism for the molecular size dependent change in carbohydrates and protein like substances our new results on the coupling effect from microbial degradation and self assembly on changes in dom composition and size spectra should provide new insights into the heterogeneity of natural dom and provide a better understanding of dom reactivity environmental fate and

19677,solar driven advanced oxidation processes were studied in a pilot scale photoreactor as tertiary treatments of effluents from an urban wastewater treatment plant solar h2o2 heterogeneous photocatalysis with and or without the addition of h2o2 and employing three different photocatalysts and the photo fenton process were investigated chemical sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and diclofenac and biological contaminants faecal contamination indicators their antibiotic resistant counterparts 16s rrna and antibiotic resistance genes as well as the whole bacterial community were characterized heterogeneous photocatalysis using tio2 p25 and assisted with h2o2 p25 h2o2 was the most efficient process on the degradation of the chemical organic micropollutants attaining levels below the limits of quantification in less than 4 h of treatment corresponding to quv 40 kj l 1 this performance was followed by the same process without h2o2 using tio2 p25 or a composite material based on graphene oxide and tio2 regarding the biological indicators total faecal coliforms and enterococci and their antibiotic resistant tetracycline and ciprofloxacin counterparts were reduced to values close or beneath the detection limit 1 cfu 100 ml 1 for all treatments employing h2o2 even upon storage of the treated wastewater for 3 days moreover p25 h2o2 and solar h2o2 were the most efficient processes in the reduction of the abundance gene copy number per volume of wastewater of the analysed genes however this reduction was transient for 16s rrna inti1 and sul1 genes since after 3 days storage of the treated wastewater their abundance increased to values close to pre treatment levels similar behaviour was observed for the genes qnrs using tio2 p25 bla ctx m and bla tem using tio2 p25 and tio2 p25 h2o2 interestingly higher proportions of sequence reads affiliated to the phylum proteobacteria beta and gammaproteobacteria were found after 3 days storage of treated wastewater

wastewater faecal indicators antibiotic resistance genes bacterial community composition 1 introduction conventional urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtps are not specifically designed for the removal of organic micropollutants and in many cases neither for effective disinfection removals of bacterial loads up to 2 log cycles which considers the inactivation of bacteria that can contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes arg into the environment these contaminants can reach the natural waters such as surface and ground waters that are serving as drinking water sources fatta kassinos et al 2011 manaia et al 2016 moreover the continuous disposal of antibiotics and related products into the environment can lead to the development and proliferation of arb decreasing the efficiency of these antibiotics when supplied to human and animals ferro et al 2016 rizzo et al 2013 since high bacterial density can be found in effluents of uwwtps i e bacterial cells are close to each other horizontal gene transfer and selection of arb can be considered important mechanisms for arg enrichment davison 1999 the dissemination of these contaminants urges the development of new technologies able to improve the simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants and microorganisms of concern advanced oxidation processes aops are conceptually based on the generation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho but other reactive species can also be formed aops such as uvc h2o2 and ozonation have been widely studied for the removal of hazardous organic chemical compounds and disinfection and they have been applied as viable solutions to enhance the quality of secondary effluents before discharged or reused ribeiro et al 2015 however several drawbacks have been associated to the aforementioned processes for instance ozonation based treatments are known to produce bromate from bromide which is classified as a possible human carcinogen xiao et al 2017 whereas the processes dependent on high medium vapour pressure lamps such as uv254 nm have higher operating costs and they are less environmentally friendly than those implementing solar radiation furthermore in a recent study becerra castro et al 2016 we have shown that oxidation processes such as uv254 nm ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation might have the potential to act selectively over some bacterial groups in that bench scale study irrespective of the type of treatment used it was observed a significant modification of the residual bacterial community after 3 days storage which was characterized by higher proportions of proteobacteria gamma and betaproteobacteria than those observed in non treated wastewater this is an example of bacterial community disturbance induced by a disinfection treatment which eventually may affect negatively the biological quality of the final stream if the reduction of the bacterial diversity and disequilibrium of the microbial ecosystem favour the possible selection of ubiquitous bacteria associated with acquirement and spread of virulence or args becerra castro et al 2016 among the different aops those driven by natural sunlight have raised a great interest during last decades i e natural solar radiation as source of photons reducing the need to costly lamps or maintenance of systems photocatalysis with irradiated titanium dioxide tio2 and the photo fenton process have demonstrated to be powerful wastewater treatment options a number of experimental studies are available in literature recognizing the high potential of these solar techniques for water decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of water sources malato et al 2009 moreira et al 2016 pablos et al 2013 polo lópez et al 2014 sousa et al 2017 yang et al 2014 especially interest for water disinfection has attracted the solar photo assisted treatment with h2o2 which has achieved fast inactivation of several types of microorganisms in water garcía fernández et al 2012 polo lópez et al 2011b sichel et al 2009 in addition the development of solar compound parabolic collector cpc reactors has resulted in the development of technological solutions with increased efficiency for water treatment giannakis et al 2016 malato et al 2009 however the performance of these solar based processes has not been investigated in terms of changes of the bacterial community composition and simultaneous removal of organic contaminants and arb arg thus the present study aims at comparing the efficiency of different solar driven aops on the simultaneous removal of micropollutants and disinfection of a secondary effluent of an uwwtp solar h2o2 heterogeneous photocatalysis with and or without the addition of h2o2 and the photo fenton process were tested using a pilot plant cpc solar photoreactor for the first time the performance of each process was assessed based on the removal efficiency of organic contaminants and arb arg as well as on the changes of the bacterial community composition microbial characterization was performed before treatment after 5 h of treatment and after 3 days storage of treated wastewater at room temperature thus the simultaneous removal of chemical and biological contaminants by using solar driven aops at pilot scale and considering possible changes in the bacterial community which can affect the water quality is the main novelty of the present work 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials degussa aeroxide tio2 p25 catalyst from evonik corporation

was assessed by using the membrane filtration method faecal coliforms and enterococci are used worldwide as indicators of faecal contamination in particular to assess the microbiological water quality apha 2005 iso9308 1 2000 in addition the ubiquity of these bacteria in human impacted environments and their high persistence in the environment as well as genome plasticity make of faecal coliforms and enterococci important tracers to assess the antibiotic resistance status of environmental samples furthermore in these groups high resistance prevalence has been observed for antibiotics such as

micropollutants i e cbz smx and dfc spiked in urban wastewater under solar driven oxidation treatments are shown in fig 1 control experiments were performed under the same conditions but without the addition of any catalyst or h2o2 i e blank photolysis cbz and smx were very resistant upon irradiation in the absence of a catalyst or h2o2 only 20 6 and 17 4 of removal respectively in contrast dfc was efficiently removed by photolysis after 4 h this result was expected since the dfc absorption spectrum not shown has a tail entering well above the 300 nm moreira et al 2015 the heterogeneous photocatalysts p25 tio2 and go tio2 without the addition of h2o2 converted the targeted organic micropollutants in the following order of decreasing efficiency p25 go tio2 tio2 fig 1 the high photocatalytic efficiency of go tio2 on the degradation of different types of organic micropollutants in synthetic matrices has been already demonstrated in our previous studies namely for diuron alachlor isoproturon and atrazine pesticides classified by the eu as priority pollutants cruz et al 2017 microcystin la cyanotoxin sampaio et al 2015 bisphenol a xenoestrogen maroga mboula et al 2013 diphenhydramine antihistamine pharmaceutical and methyl orange azo dye pastrana martínez et al 2012 the go tio2 photocatalyst has been much more active than p25 under vis light illumination but under near uv vis radiation the activity of this type of photocatalysts depends on the target pollutant the better performance of go tio2 in comparison to bare tio2 has been attributed to the good assembly and interfacial coupling between tio2 and go sheets as well as the respective quenching of photoluminescence inhibiting charge recombination pastrana martínez et al 2012 in the present study p25 was the most efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of the organic micropollutants most probably because of the better performance of p25 under uv radiation the addition of h2o2 to the p25 photocatalytic system increased the degradation efficiency of the targeted micropollutants h2o2 captures and reacts with the photoinduced surface electrons supressing the electron hole recombination and it also reacts with the superoxide radical anions both pathways leading to the formation of additional hydroxyl radicals kositzi et al 2004 pablos et al 2013 there is markedly a competing process which may be mediated by the active surface of the photocatalyst interestingly the removal efficiency decreased when h2o2 was added to the photocatalytic system containing go tio2 degradation of go tio2 may eventually occur for instance by the h2o2 attack to the underlying c c bonds in the superficial defect sites of go xing et al 2014 solar h2o2 and photo fenton processes fe2 h2o2 also led to very modest removals of cbz and smx fig 1a and b respectively one of the downsides of photo fenton is the formation of iron sludge due to the precipitation of iron hydroxide at neutral ph in this work the ph was adjusted to a circumneutral value 5 5 by using h2so4 which could explain the low photo fenton efficiency that is known to be maximized at ph values around 3 agulló barceló et al 2013 garcía fernández et al 2012 giannakis et al 2017 in a previous work klamerth et al 2010 solar photo fenton also operated at mild ph conditions was effective for the degradation of organic micropollutants but the total inorganic carbon was removed by sample acidification since it competes with the organic contaminants for hydroxyl radicals klamerth et al 2009 overall p25 h2o2 followed by the p25 and go tio2 photocatalytic processes were the best performing treatments for removal of the targeted organic micropollutants regarding the mineralization of the organic matter present in the urban wastewater p25 h2o2 solar h2o2 and the photo fenton process were the most efficient treatments doc removals always around 23 3 other processes removing no more than ca 10 of the initial doc however due to the chemical complexity of this matrix and the differences between the doc in the range of mg l 1 and the concentration of the studied organic pollutants in the range of μg l 1 it is not possible to correlate the doc and micropollutants removals 3 2 bacteria inactivation and reactivation the performance of different solar driven processes was assessed before and over the treatment in terms of removal of total faecal coliforms fig 2 a enterococci fig 2c and respective fraction of resistant populations fig 2b and d the reduction of the bacterial indicators loads was observed in all the treatments with the highest inactivation rates leading to values bellow or close the lod 1 cfu 100 ml 1 for the processes where h2o2 was used h2o2 fe2 h2o2 p25 h2o2 go tio2 h2o2 among these and despite the iron precipitation the photo fenton process was the most efficient treatment on the reduction of resistant and non resistant faecal coliforms and enterococci fig 2a d fe2 h2o2 however photo fenton showed similar disinfection profiles to solar h2o2 for faecal coliforms fig 2a and b and to p25 h2o2 for enterococci fig 2c and d these three processes removed those bacteria for quv 30 kj l 1 suggesting that h2o2 plays a major role on disinfection including in the case of solar h2o2 and photo fenton that were not effective for the removal of all the organic micropollutants in contrast moderate inactivation rates were observed for photolysis fig 2a b and c blank except for antibiotic resistant enterococci that were reduced to values below the lod fig 2d blank interestingly p25 h2o2 showed high efficiency on the removal of organic micropollutants and resistant and non resistant enterococci whereas the efficiency for inactivation of resistant and non resistant faecal coliforms was not so high in comparison with solar h2o2 the accepted hypotheses and mechanism that explain the inactivation of microorganisms by exposure to solar h2o2 is based on the accumulated damages inside cells by internal cellular injures occurring under sunlight and accelerated in the presence of h2o2 it is well accepted that solar radiation produces internal damages affecting different intracellular vital components leading to bacterial death or lack of viability aguas et al 2017 a recent study attributed bacterial inactivation during solar photolysis to the combined effect of intracellular production of reactive oxygen species by uv photons absorption and water temperature increase castro alférez et al 2017 when h2o2 is added it may diffuse inside bacteria cells promoting additional internal photo reactions with naturally present iron and other metals via fenton and fenton like reactions activating thus a photo fenton cycle under sunlight at intracellular level also aguas et al 2017 both photo effects act jointly producing an accelerated disinfection that has been also reported to be very efficient for other types of bacteria viral indicators and fungi including escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis rodríguez chueca et al 2014 legionella jordanis polo lópez et al 2017 f specific rna bacteriophage agulló barceló et al 2013 fusarium sp polo lópez et al 2014 sichel et al 2009 phytophthora capsici polo lópez et al 2013 curvularia sp aguas et al 2017 and several antimicrobial resistant bacteria fiorentino et al 2015 although h2o2 assisted processes performed better that non assisted ones heterogeneous photocatalysis without h2o2 also performed quite well on the inactivation of total or resistant populations of faecal coliforms and enterococci among these processes the go tio2 composite was the most efficient catalyst for the removal of total and resistant populations of faecal coliforms fig 2a and b go tio2 the good efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection using this type of composites but prepared by other methods and under visible radiation only was already shown in previous studies cruz ortiz et al 2017 fernández ibáñez et al 2015 its high photocatalytic activity has been attributed to the improvement in charge separation since go may promote the electron transfer with tio2 particles acting as an electron bridge and to the decrease of the bandgap energy of the composite catalysts as well as to an enhancement of the adsorptive properties these authors concluded that hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen were the main species involved in the disinfection process under uv vis irradiation and only singlet oxygen under visible illumination cruz ortiz et al 2017 moreover very recently karaolia et al 2018 the photocatalytic efficiency of p25 in the absence of h2o2 was compared to that of a tio2 reduced go composite on the removal of three organic micropollutants including smx and e coli resistant and non resistant to antibiotics in urban wastewater p25 performed better than tio2 reduced go for the photocatalytic degradation of smx but higher bacteria permanent inactivation was observed in the presence of the composite in accordance with our results however in the same study tio2 reduced go performed better than p25 for the removal of erythromycin i e the opposite of that observed for smx the photocatalytic efficiency thus depending on the target organic molecule in our particular case p25 was better than the go tio2 composite for the removal of all the studied organic micropollutants cbz smx and dfc since microbial inactivation monitored via culture based methods can be transient moreira et al 2016 spuhler et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 further assays testing the regrowth capacity after 3 days storage of the treated wastewater at room temperature were performed bacterial reactivation is influenced by factors such as the storage conditions temperature availability of nutrients and the uv dose among others giannakis et al 2014 ubomba jaswa et al 2009 the bacterial loads before after the treatment and after 3 days storage at room temperature are shown in fig 3 a and b for faecal coliforms and fig 3c and d for enterococci no regrowth was observed in stored wastewater treated by the h2o2 assisted processes and total faecal coliforms and enterococci as well as their arb counterparts were kept below the detection limit in stored wastewater treated by heterogeneous photocatalysis without h2o2 p25 tio2 and go tio2 the bacterial loads of these groups were 2 3 log values lower than before the treatment similar observations were registered for the control blank photolysis these results indicate the inability of these bacterial groups to recover to values close to those found in raw wastewater after the tested solar driven processes this can be also explained by the mode of action attributed to solar h2o2 disinfection where oxidative damages alter the bacteria viability at intracellular level as proven in the literature polo lópez et al 2017 in such report an ema qpcr method for the detection of membrane integrity damages of l jordanis cells under two photo oxidative processes was used i e solar h2o2 and p25 with solar radiation it was confirmed the well accepted mechanism of heterogeneous p25 photocatalysis via oxidative attacks of the external cell membrane whereas the mechanism for solar h2o2 was based on internal photochemical reactions this may explain the results reported in fig 3 on the non recover capability of arb when h2o2 was used in these treatment processes while they can regrow when h2o2 is not in the media polo lópez et al 2017 in general the selected solar driven oxidation processes were effective in reducing faecal indicators including those resistant to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin from wastewater samples 3 3 effect of disinfection on args and bacterial community composition considering that the bacterial community is much more diverse and complex than that assessed based on the cultivation methods used and that some bacteria may be injured and hence unable to grow culture independent methods were carried out to give additional insights on the disinfection effectiveness of the studied solar driven processes since the main purpose of this work was the simultaneous removal of chemical and biological contaminants the processes showing better performance on the degradation of organic micropollutants i e p25 h2o2 p25 and go tio2 photocatalytic processes disinfection p25 h2o2 and solar h2o2 and also the reference process photolysis were selected for further investigation based on culture independent methods fe2 h2o2 was not chosen due to its bad performance for degradation of the organic micropollutants fig 1 among the analysed genes i e 16s rrna inti1 qnrs bla ctx m sul1 bla tem and vana only vana was below the lod before treatment not shown for the other genes p25 h2o2 photocatalysis and solar h2o2 were the most efficient processes i e lower abundance after treatment both leading to log average reduction of 1 value except for bla ctx m 3 log reduction fig 4 however after 3 days storage regardless the treatment used the abundance of 16s rrna gene a house keeping gene of prokaryotes was close or even higher up to 1 log for p25 h2o2 than those found before treatment suggesting the ability of some bacteria to recover after the treatment similar results were observed for inti1 and sul1 genes encoding integrase and conferring resistance to sulphonamides respectively among the studied processes only solar h2o2 and go tio2 prevented the reactivation of bla ctx m and bla tem genes encoding resistance to beta lactams above the pre treatment levels for the qnrs gene a plasmid mediated quinolone resistance gene besides these two processes also p25 h2o2 prevented its reactivation other authors ferro et al 2016 2017 investigated the potential of uv h2o2 process to control the potential spread of arb into the environment despite of a successful inactivation of total coliforms e coli and antibiotic resistant counterparts the genes bla tem qnrs and tetw were still present in wastewater after 240 min of treatment in accordance with the results of the present study overall the studied processes led to a slight reduction in the abundance of targeted genes immediately after treatment only bla ctx m with a relatively low initial abundance was reduced after h2o2 associated treatments to values below the limit of quantification although these types of treatment were observed to cause higher reductions in the other genes analysed none of these args were reduced to levels below loq a further investigation would be necessary to assess whether disinfection driven reductions of args were due the loss of the arg for instance plasmid loss or arg excision with maintenance of the host cell viability or if such reductions were due to cell inactivation however the observation of reactivation after 3 days storage in most of the cases suggest that at least part of the arg removal was due to cell inactivation and not to arg loss these results suggest that at least some of the bacterial cells survived these treatments being able to reproduce during storage however further research on this subject is needed to withdraw safe conclusions regarding the apparent inconsistency between data obtained based on qpcr analyses and cultivation methods in fact it could be expected given the low fitness of the indicators of faecal contamination to grow in water moreover it suggests that regrowth is due to other bacterial populations as it can be confirmed below with the data based on the bacterial community analysis the effect of the different treatment processes on the bacterial communities was another aim of this study out of the 49 phyla found in freshly collected wastewater before treatment proteobacteria 62 7 and bacteroidetes 10 2 were in average n 8 the most abundant fig 5 a t0 proteobacteria comprised mainly members of the classes beta 28 2 gamma 20 10 alpha 7 2 and deltaproteobacteria 5 1 beside these groups several other bacterial classes were detected in the freshly collected wastewater in relative abundances ranging from 2 1 to 4 2 examples are saprospirae flavobacteriia and bacteroidia bacteroidetes clostridia firmicutes planctomycetia planctomycetes zb2 od1 and tm7 1 tm7 the other identified classes had abundances 1 3 fig 5a t0 regardless of the solar driven process treatment followed by storage at room conditions led to important bacterial community rearrangements that in general had the same pattern the relative abundance of the members of proteobacteria was higher p 0 01 in the stored treated wastewater than in the freshly collected wastewater samples whereas it was lower p 0 01 for the majority of members of the other phyla fig 5a t3 the lower values of the alpha diversity indices of the stored treated wastewater samples when compared with those of freshly collected wastewater samples table 1 corroborate this loss of diversity and equitability these rearrangements are well depicted in the pcoa biplot where the bacterial communities of the freshly collected wastewater samples were separated from those treated and stored over axis pc1 31 0 fig 6 squares and stars respectively differences on the structure and composition of the bacterial community of the stored treated wastewater samples were mainly based on the relative abundance of beta and gammaproteobacteria and bacilli fig 5a t3 and fig 6 stars the structure and composition of the bacterial communities of treated stored water was similar nevertheless the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria was higher for photolysis p25 p25 h2o2 solar h2o2 go tio2 varying between 57 and 7 fig 5a consequently the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria followed a kind of inverse order i e go tio2 p25 h2o2 p25 solar h2o2 photolysis varying between 61 and 25 fig 5a despite the lower values when compared with these proteobacterial classes the relative abundance of bacilli followed a similar order 8 and 0 fig 5a the ability of some members of class bacilli to survive under harsh stressful conditions through the production of resistance forms endospores as well as their ability to withstand oxidative stress battistuzzi and hedges 2009 mols and abee 2011 may explain their survival upon these treatments altogether the results obtained suggest that the solar driven aops inactivated less efficiently beta and or gammaproteobacteria or that at least some bacteria belonging to these classes have higher capacity to regrow curiously at the genus level it is possible to observe that members of the ubiquitous genus pseudomonas were in general the group with the sharpest increase during storage followed by rheinheimera and methilotenera fig 5b alterations in the composition and structure of the bacterial communities leading to higher proportions of proteobacteria in stored water than before the treatment were reported in the literature for photolysis ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation becerra castro et al 2016 coupled biological and photocatalysis treatments chen et al 2013 and ozonation coupled to a sequencing batch biofilm reactor esplugas et al 2013 4 conclusions among the tested solar driven oxidation processes photo fenton at circumneutral ph was the worst performing one quite similar to photolysis whereas the combination of p25 and h2o2 was the most efficient approach for the removal of organic micropollutants in the urban wastewater sampled regarding the biological indicators a decrease in the abundance of total faecal coliforms and enterococci and their antibiotic resistant counterparts was found for all the processes employing h2o2 which was permanent after 3 days storage of the treated wastewater p25 h2o2 and solar h2o2 were also able to reduce the total bacterial load assessed based on the abundance of the 16s rrna gene nevertheless the abundance of total bacterial load increased after 3 days storage to values close or higher than those verified before treatment similar observations were found for the genes inti1 and sul1 hence none of the studied processes was able to prevent bacterial reactivation including antibiotic resistant populations thus among all the studied processes p25 h2o2 seemed to be that achieving the best compromise for the removal of both organic micropollutants and biological contaminants although not able to prevent bacterial reactivation interestingly regardless of the oxidation process studied higher relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria beta and gammaproteobacteria namely of genera pseudomonas rheinheimera and methylotenera was observed in treated wastewater after 3 days storage since within the phylum proteobacteria in particular of the classes beta and gammaproteobacteria it is possible to find diverse multidrug resistant bacteria the increase of this group of organisms in stored treated water may deserve further investigation moreover the potential disturbance of the water bacterial communities may have relevant ecology implication and should be considered in the design of advanced oxidation technologies acknowledgments

19677,solar driven advanced oxidation processes were studied in a pilot scale photoreactor as tertiary treatments of effluents from an urban wastewater treatment plant solar h2o2 heterogeneous photocatalysis with and or without the addition of h2o2 and employing three different photocatalysts and the photo fenton process were investigated chemical sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and diclofenac and biological contaminants faecal contamination indicators their antibiotic resistant counterparts 16s rrna and antibiotic resistance genes as well as the whole bacterial community were characterized heterogeneous photocatalysis using tio2 p25 and assisted with h2o2 p25 h2o2 was the most efficient process on the degradation of the chemical organic micropollutants attaining levels below the limits of quantification in less than 4 h of treatment corresponding to quv 40 kj l 1 this performance was followed by the same process without h2o2 using tio2 p25 or a composite material based on graphene oxide and tio2 regarding the biological indicators total faecal coliforms and enterococci and their antibiotic resistant tetracycline and ciprofloxacin counterparts were reduced to values close or beneath the detection limit 1 cfu 100 ml 1 for all treatments employing h2o2 even upon storage of the treated wastewater for 3 days moreover p25 h2o2 and solar h2o2 were the most efficient processes in the reduction of the abundance gene copy number per volume of wastewater of the analysed genes however this reduction was transient for 16s rrna inti1 and sul1 genes since after 3 days storage of the treated wastewater their abundance increased to values close to pre treatment levels similar behaviour was observed for the genes qnrs using tio2 p25 bla ctx m and bla tem using tio2 p25 and tio2 p25 h2o2 interestingly higher proportions of sequence reads affiliated to the phylum proteobacteria beta and gammaproteobacteria were found after 3 days storage of treated wastewater than before its treatment members of the genera pseudomonas rheinheimera and methylotenera were among those with overgrowth graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar advanced oxidation processes urban wastewater faecal indicators antibiotic resistance genes bacterial community composition 1 introduction conventional urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtps are not specifically designed for the removal of organic micropollutants and in many cases neither for effective disinfection removals of bacterial loads up to 2 log cycles which considers the inactivation of bacteria that can contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes arg into the environment these contaminants can reach the natural waters such as surface and ground waters that are serving as drinking water sources fatta kassinos et al 2011 manaia et al 2016 moreover the continuous disposal of antibiotics and related products into the environment can lead to the development and proliferation of arb decreasing the efficiency of these antibiotics when supplied to human and animals ferro et al 2016 rizzo et al 2013 since high bacterial density can be found in effluents of uwwtps i e bacterial cells are close to each other horizontal gene transfer and selection of arb can be considered important mechanisms for arg enrichment davison 1999 the dissemination of these contaminants urges the development of new technologies able to improve the simultaneous removal of organic micropollutants and microorganisms of concern advanced oxidation processes aops are conceptually based on the generation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho but other reactive species can also be formed aops such as uvc h2o2 and ozonation have been widely studied for the removal of hazardous organic chemical compounds and disinfection and they have been applied as viable solutions to enhance the quality of secondary effluents before discharged or reused ribeiro et al 2015 however several drawbacks have been associated to the aforementioned processes for instance ozonation based treatments are known to produce bromate from bromide which is classified as a possible human carcinogen xiao et al 2017 whereas the processes dependent on high medium vapour pressure lamps such as uv254 nm have higher operating costs and they are less environmentally friendly than those implementing solar radiation furthermore in a recent study becerra castro et al 2016 we have shown that oxidation processes such as uv254 nm ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation might have the potential to act selectively over some bacterial groups in that bench scale study irrespective of the type of treatment used it was observed a significant modification of the residual bacterial community after 3 days storage which was characterized by higher proportions of proteobacteria gamma and betaproteobacteria than those observed in non treated wastewater this is an example of bacterial community disturbance induced by a disinfection treatment which eventually may affect negatively the biological quality of the final stream if the reduction of the bacterial diversity and disequilibrium of the microbial ecosystem favour the possible selection of ubiquitous bacteria associated with acquirement and spread of virulence or args becerra castro et al 2016 among the different aops those driven by natural sunlight have raised a great interest during last decades i e natural solar radiation as source of photons reducing the need to costly lamps or maintenance of systems photocatalysis with irradiated titanium dioxide tio2 and the photo fenton process have demonstrated to be powerful wastewater treatment options a number of experimental studies are available in literature recognizing the high potential of these solar techniques for water decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of water sources malato et al 2009 moreira et al 2016 pablos et al 2013 polo lópez et al 2014 sousa et al 2017 yang et al 2014 especially interest for water disinfection has attracted the solar photo assisted treatment with h2o2 which has achieved fast inactivation of several types of microorganisms in water garcía fernández et al 2012 polo lópez et al 2011b sichel et al 2009 in addition the development of solar compound parabolic collector cpc reactors has resulted in the development of technological solutions with increased efficiency for water treatment giannakis et al 2016 malato et al 2009 however the performance of these solar based processes has not been investigated in terms of changes of the bacterial community composition and simultaneous removal of organic contaminants and arb arg thus the present study aims at comparing the efficiency of different solar driven aops on the simultaneous removal of micropollutants and disinfection of a secondary effluent of an uwwtp solar h2o2 heterogeneous photocatalysis with and or without the addition of h2o2 and the photo fenton process were tested using a pilot plant cpc solar photoreactor for the first time the performance of each process was assessed based on the removal efficiency of organic contaminants and arb arg as well as on the changes of the bacterial community composition microbial characterization was performed before treatment after 5 h of treatment and after 3 days storage of treated wastewater at room temperature thus the simultaneous removal of chemical and biological contaminants by using solar driven aops at pilot scale and considering possible changes in the bacterial community which can affect the water quality is the main novelty of the present work 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials degussa aeroxide tio2 p25 catalyst from evonik corporation

freshly prepared solution of bovine liver catalase 0 1 g l 1 in a ratio 0 1 5 0 v v photolysis blank assays were performed to study the effect of solar radiation without the addition of any catalyst

the 5 h treatment and after 3 days of storage of treated wastewater at room temperature the abundance of faecal coliforms enterococci and their tetracycline and ciprofloxacin resistant counterparts was assessed by using the membrane filtration method faecal coliforms and enterococci are used worldwide as indicators of faecal contamination in particular to assess the microbiological water quality apha 2005 iso9308 1 2000 in addition the ubiquity of these bacteria in human impacted environments and their high persistence in the environment as well as genome plasticity make of faecal coliforms and enterococci important tracers to assess the antibiotic resistance status of environmental samples furthermore in these groups high resistance prevalence has been observed for antibiotics such as

were processed and analysed using the qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2010 briefly sequences shorter than 250 bp and with average quality scores lower than 25 were eliminated and bases with average

micropollutants i e cbz smx and dfc spiked in urban wastewater under solar driven oxidation treatments are shown in fig 1 control experiments were performed under the same conditions but without the addition of any catalyst or h2o2 i e blank photolysis cbz and smx were very resistant upon irradiation in the absence of a catalyst or h2o2 only 20 6 and 17 4 of removal respectively in contrast dfc was efficiently removed by photolysis after 4 h this result was expected since the dfc absorption spectrum not shown has a tail entering well above the 300 nm moreira et al 2015 the heterogeneous photocatalysts p25 tio2 and go tio2 without the addition of h2o2 converted the targeted organic micropollutants in the following order of decreasing efficiency p25 go tio2 tio2 fig 1 the high photocatalytic efficiency of go tio2 on the degradation of different types of organic micropollutants in synthetic matrices has been already demonstrated in our previous studies namely for diuron alachlor isoproturon and atrazine pesticides classified by the eu as priority pollutants cruz et al 2017 microcystin la cyanotoxin sampaio et al 2015 bisphenol a xenoestrogen maroga mboula et al 2013 diphenhydramine antihistamine pharmaceutical and methyl orange azo dye pastrana martínez et al 2012 the go tio2 photocatalyst has been much more active than p25 under vis light illumination but under near uv vis radiation the activity of this type of photocatalysts depends on the target pollutant the better performance of go tio2 in comparison to bare tio2 has been attributed to the good assembly and interfacial coupling between tio2 and go sheets as well as the respective quenching of photoluminescence inhibiting charge recombination pastrana martínez et al 2012 in the present study p25 was the most efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of the organic micropollutants most probably because of the better performance of p25 under uv radiation the addition of h2o2 to the p25 photocatalytic system increased the degradation efficiency of the targeted micropollutants h2o2 captures and reacts with the photoinduced surface electrons supressing the electron hole recombination and it also reacts with the superoxide radical anions both pathways leading to the formation of additional hydroxyl radicals kositzi et al 2004 pablos et al 2013 there is markedly a competing process which may be mediated by the active surface of the photocatalyst interestingly the removal efficiency decreased when h2o2 was added to the photocatalytic system containing go tio2 degradation of go tio2 may eventually occur for instance by the h2o2 attack to the underlying c c bonds in the superficial defect sites of go xing et al 2014 solar h2o2 and photo fenton processes fe2 h2o2 also led to very modest removals of cbz and smx fig 1a and b respectively one of the downsides of photo fenton is the formation of iron sludge due to the precipitation of iron hydroxide at neutral ph in this work the ph was adjusted to a circumneutral value 5 5 by using h2so4 which could explain the low photo fenton efficiency that is known to be maximized at ph values around 3 agulló barceló et al 2013 garcía fernández et al 2012 giannakis et al 2017 in a previous work klamerth et al 2010 solar photo fenton also operated at mild ph conditions was effective for the degradation of organic micropollutants but the total inorganic carbon was removed by sample acidification since it competes with the organic contaminants for hydroxyl radicals klamerth et al 2009 overall p25 h2o2 followed by the p25 and go tio2 photocatalytic processes were the best performing treatments for removal of the targeted organic micropollutants regarding the mineralization of the organic matter present in the urban wastewater p25 h2o2 solar h2o2 and the photo fenton process were the most efficient treatments doc removals always around 23 3 other processes removing no more than ca 10 of the initial doc however due to the chemical complexity of this matrix and the differences between the doc in the range of mg l 1 and the concentration of the studied organic pollutants in the range of μg l 1 it is not possible to correlate the doc and micropollutants removals 3 2 bacteria inactivation and reactivation the performance of different solar driven processes was assessed before and over the treatment in terms of removal of total faecal coliforms fig 2 a enterococci fig 2c and respective fraction of resistant populations fig 2b and d the reduction of the bacterial indicators loads was observed in all the treatments with the highest inactivation rates leading to values bellow or close the lod 1 cfu 100 ml 1 for the processes where h2o2 was used h2o2 fe2 h2o2 p25 h2o2 go tio2 h2o2 among these and despite the iron precipitation the photo fenton process was the most efficient treatment on the reduction of resistant and non resistant faecal coliforms and enterococci fig 2a d fe2 h2o2 however photo fenton showed similar disinfection profiles to solar h2o2 for faecal coliforms fig 2a and b and to p25 h2o2 for enterococci fig 2c and d these three processes removed those bacteria for quv 30 kj l 1 suggesting that h2o2 plays a major role on disinfection including in the case of solar h2o2 and photo fenton that were not effective for the removal of all the organic micropollutants in contrast moderate inactivation rates were observed for photolysis fig 2a b and c blank except for antibiotic resistant enterococci that were reduced to values below the lod fig 2d blank interestingly p25 h2o2 showed high efficiency on the removal of organic micropollutants and resistant and non resistant enterococci whereas the efficiency for inactivation of resistant and non resistant faecal coliforms was not so high in comparison with solar h2o2 the accepted hypotheses and mechanism that explain the inactivation of microorganisms by exposure to solar h2o2 is based on the accumulated damages inside cells by internal cellular injures occurring under sunlight and accelerated in the presence of h2o2 it is well accepted that solar radiation produces internal damages affecting different intracellular vital components leading to bacterial death or lack of viability aguas et al 2017 a recent study attributed bacterial inactivation during solar photolysis to the combined effect of intracellular production of reactive oxygen species by uv photons absorption and water temperature increase castro alférez et al 2017 when h2o2 is added it may diffuse inside bacteria cells promoting additional internal photo reactions with naturally present iron and other metals via fenton and fenton like reactions activating thus a photo fenton cycle under sunlight at intracellular level also aguas et al 2017 both photo effects act jointly producing an accelerated disinfection that has been also reported to be very efficient for other types of bacteria viral indicators and fungi including escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis rodríguez chueca et al 2014 legionella jordanis polo lópez et al 2017 f specific rna bacteriophage agulló barceló et al 2013 fusarium sp polo lópez et al 2014 sichel et al 2009 phytophthora capsici polo lópez et al 2013 curvularia sp aguas et al 2017 and several antimicrobial resistant bacteria fiorentino et al 2015 although h2o2 assisted processes performed better that non assisted ones heterogeneous photocatalysis without h2o2 also performed quite well on the inactivation of total or resistant populations of faecal coliforms and enterococci among these processes the go tio2 composite was the most efficient catalyst for the removal of total and resistant populations of faecal coliforms fig 2a and b go tio2 the good efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection using this type of composites but prepared by other methods and under visible radiation only was already shown in previous studies cruz ortiz et al 2017 fernández ibáñez et al 2015 its high photocatalytic activity has been attributed to the improvement in charge separation since go may promote the electron transfer with tio2 particles acting as an electron bridge and to the decrease of the bandgap energy of the composite catalysts as well as to an enhancement of the adsorptive properties these authors concluded that hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen were the main species involved in the disinfection process under uv vis irradiation and only singlet oxygen under visible illumination cruz ortiz et al 2017 moreover very recently karaolia et al 2018 the photocatalytic efficiency of p25 in the absence of h2o2 was compared to that of a tio2 reduced go composite on the removal of three organic micropollutants including smx and e coli resistant and non resistant to antibiotics in urban wastewater p25 performed better than tio2 reduced go for the photocatalytic degradation of smx but higher bacteria permanent inactivation was observed in the presence of the composite in accordance with our results however in the same study tio2 reduced go performed better than p25 for the removal of erythromycin i e the opposite of that observed for smx the photocatalytic efficiency thus depending on the target organic molecule in our particular case p25 was better than the go tio2 composite for the removal of all the studied organic micropollutants cbz smx and dfc since microbial inactivation monitored via culture based methods can be transient moreira et al 2016 spuhler et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 further assays testing the regrowth capacity after 3 days storage of the treated wastewater at room temperature were performed bacterial reactivation is influenced by factors such as the storage conditions temperature availability of nutrients and the uv dose among others giannakis et al 2014 ubomba jaswa et al 2009 the bacterial loads before after the treatment and after 3 days storage at room temperature are shown in fig 3 a and b for faecal coliforms and fig 3c and d for enterococci no regrowth was observed in stored wastewater treated by the h2o2 assisted processes and total faecal coliforms and enterococci as well as their arb counterparts were kept below the detection limit in stored wastewater treated by heterogeneous photocatalysis without h2o2 p25 tio2 and go tio2 the bacterial loads of these groups were 2 3 log values lower than before the treatment similar observations were registered for the control blank photolysis these results indicate the inability of these bacterial groups to recover to values close to those found in raw wastewater after the tested solar driven processes this can be also explained by the mode of action attributed to solar h2o2 disinfection where oxidative damages alter the bacteria viability at intracellular level as proven in the literature polo lópez et al 2017 in such report an ema qpcr method for the detection of membrane integrity damages of l jordanis cells under two photo oxidative processes was used i e solar h2o2 and p25 with solar radiation it was confirmed the well accepted mechanism of heterogeneous p25 photocatalysis via oxidative attacks of the external cell membrane whereas the mechanism for solar h2o2 was based on internal photochemical reactions this may explain the results reported in fig 3 on the non recover capability of arb when h2o2 was used in these treatment processes while they can regrow when h2o2 is not in the media polo lópez et al 2017 in general the selected solar driven oxidation processes were effective in reducing faecal indicators including those resistant to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin from wastewater samples 3 3 effect of disinfection on args and bacterial community composition considering that the bacterial community is much more diverse and complex than that assessed based on the cultivation methods used and that some bacteria may be injured and hence unable to grow culture independent methods were carried out to give additional insights on the disinfection effectiveness of the studied solar driven processes since the main purpose of this work was the simultaneous removal of chemical and biological contaminants the processes showing better performance on the degradation of organic micropollutants i e p25 h2o2 p25 and go tio2 photocatalytic processes disinfection p25 h2o2 and solar h2o2 and also the reference process photolysis were selected for further investigation based on culture independent methods fe2 h2o2 was not chosen due to its bad performance for degradation of the organic micropollutants fig 1 among the analysed genes i e 16s rrna inti1 qnrs bla ctx m sul1 bla tem and vana only vana was below the lod before treatment not shown for the other genes p25 h2o2 photocatalysis and solar h2o2 were the most efficient processes i e lower abundance after treatment both leading to log average reduction of 1 value except for bla ctx m 3 log reduction fig 4 however after 3 days storage regardless the treatment used the abundance of 16s rrna gene a house keeping gene of prokaryotes was close or even higher up to 1 log for p25 h2o2 than those found before treatment suggesting the ability of some bacteria to recover after the treatment similar results were observed for inti1 and sul1 genes encoding integrase and conferring resistance to sulphonamides respectively among the studied processes only solar h2o2 and go tio2 prevented the reactivation of bla ctx m and bla tem genes encoding resistance to beta lactams above the pre treatment levels for the qnrs gene a plasmid mediated quinolone resistance gene besides these two processes also p25 h2o2 prevented its reactivation other authors ferro et al 2016 2017 investigated the potential of uv h2o2 process to control the potential spread of arb into the environment despite of a successful inactivation of total coliforms e coli and antibiotic resistant counterparts the genes bla tem qnrs and tetw were still present in wastewater after 240 min of treatment in accordance with the results of the present study overall the studied processes led to a slight reduction in the abundance of targeted genes immediately after treatment only bla ctx m with a relatively low initial abundance was reduced after h2o2 associated treatments to values below the limit of quantification although these types of treatment were observed to cause higher reductions in the other genes analysed none of these args were reduced to levels below loq a further investigation would be necessary to assess whether disinfection driven reductions of args were due the loss of the arg for instance plasmid loss or arg excision with maintenance of the host cell viability or if such reductions were due to cell inactivation however the observation of reactivation after 3 days storage in most of the cases suggest that at least part of the arg removal was due to cell inactivation and not to arg loss these results suggest that at least some of the bacterial cells survived these treatments being able to reproduce during storage however further research on this subject is needed to withdraw safe conclusions regarding the apparent inconsistency between data obtained based on qpcr analyses and cultivation methods in fact it could be expected given the low fitness of the indicators of faecal contamination to grow in water moreover it suggests that regrowth is due to other bacterial populations as it can be confirmed below with the data based on the bacterial community analysis the effect of the different treatment processes on the bacterial communities was another aim of this study out of the 49 phyla found in freshly collected wastewater before treatment proteobacteria 62 7 and bacteroidetes 10 2 were in average n 8 the most abundant fig 5 a t0 proteobacteria comprised mainly members of the classes beta 28 2 gamma 20 10 alpha 7 2 and deltaproteobacteria 5 1 beside these groups several other bacterial classes were detected in the freshly collected wastewater in relative abundances ranging from 2 1 to 4 2 examples are saprospirae flavobacteriia and bacteroidia bacteroidetes clostridia firmicutes planctomycetia planctomycetes zb2 od1 and tm7 1 tm7 the other identified classes had abundances 1 3 fig 5a t0 regardless of the solar driven process treatment followed by storage at room conditions led to important bacterial community rearrangements that in general had the same pattern the relative abundance of the members of proteobacteria was higher p 0 01 in the stored treated wastewater than in the freshly collected wastewater samples whereas it was lower p 0 01 for the majority of members of the other phyla fig 5a t3 the lower values of the alpha diversity indices of the stored treated wastewater samples when compared with those of freshly collected wastewater samples table 1 corroborate this loss of diversity and equitability these rearrangements are well depicted in the pcoa biplot where the bacterial communities of the freshly collected wastewater samples were separated from those treated and stored over axis pc1 31 0 fig 6 squares and stars respectively differences on the structure and composition of the bacterial community of the stored treated wastewater samples were mainly based on the relative abundance of beta and gammaproteobacteria and bacilli fig 5a t3 and fig 6 stars the structure and composition of the bacterial communities of treated stored water was similar nevertheless the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria was higher for photolysis p25 p25 h2o2 solar h2o2 go tio2 varying between 57 and 7 fig 5a consequently the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria followed a kind of inverse order i e go tio2 p25 h2o2 p25 solar h2o2 photolysis varying between 61 and 25 fig 5a despite the lower values when compared with these proteobacterial classes the relative abundance of bacilli followed a similar order 8 and 0 fig 5a the ability of some members of class bacilli to survive under harsh stressful conditions through the production of resistance forms endospores as well as their ability to withstand oxidative stress battistuzzi and hedges 2009 mols and abee 2011 may explain their survival upon these treatments altogether the results obtained suggest that the solar driven aops inactivated less efficiently beta and or gammaproteobacteria or that at least some bacteria belonging to these classes have higher capacity to regrow curiously at the genus level it is possible to observe that members of the ubiquitous genus pseudomonas were in general the group with the sharpest increase during storage followed by rheinheimera and methilotenera fig 5b alterations in the composition and structure of the bacterial communities leading to higher proportions of proteobacteria in stored water than before the treatment were reported in the literature for photolysis ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation becerra castro et al 2016 coupled biological and photocatalysis treatments chen et al 2013 and ozonation coupled to a sequencing batch biofilm reactor esplugas et al 2013 4 conclusions among the tested solar driven oxidation processes photo fenton at circumneutral ph was the worst performing one quite similar to photolysis whereas the combination of p25 and h2o2 was the most efficient approach for the removal of organic micropollutants in the urban wastewater sampled regarding the biological indicators a decrease in the abundance of total faecal coliforms and enterococci and their antibiotic resistant counterparts was found for all the processes employing h2o2 which was permanent after 3 days storage of the treated wastewater p25 h2o2 and solar h2o2 were also able to reduce the total bacterial load assessed based on the abundance of the 16s rrna gene nevertheless the abundance of total bacterial load increased after 3 days storage to values close or higher than those verified before treatment similar observations were found for the genes inti1 and sul1 hence none of the studied processes was able to prevent bacterial reactivation including antibiotic resistant populations thus among all the studied processes p25 h2o2 seemed to be that achieving the best compromise for the removal of both organic micropollutants and biological contaminants although not able to prevent bacterial reactivation interestingly regardless of the oxidation process studied higher relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria beta and gammaproteobacteria namely of genera pseudomonas rheinheimera and methylotenera was observed in treated wastewater after 3 days storage since within the phylum proteobacteria in particular of the classes beta and gammaproteobacteria it is possible to find diverse multidrug resistant bacteria the increase of this group of organisms in stored treated water may deserve further investigation moreover the potential disturbance of the water bacterial communities may have relevant ecology implication and should be considered in the design of advanced oxidation technologies acknowledgments

19678,microbial community structure in the ozone biofiltration systems of two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities was characterized using 16s rrna gene sequencing collectively these datasets enabled comparisons by facility water type drinking water wastewater pre oxidation ozonation chlorination media type anthracite activated carbon media depth and backwash dynamics proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in drinking water filters whereas bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes and planctomycetes were differentially abundant in wastewater filters a positive correlation was observed between media depth and relative abundance of cyanobacteria in drinking water filters but there was only a slight increase in one alpha diversity metric with depth in the wastewater filters media type had a significant effect on beta but not alpha diversity in drinking water and wastewater filters pre ozonation caused a significant decrease in alpha diversity in the wastewater filters but the effect on beta diversity was not statistically significant an evaluation of backwash dynamics resulted in two notable observations 1 endosymbionts such as neochlamydia and legionella increased in relative abundance following backwashing and 2 nitrogen fixing bradyrhizobium dominated the microbial community in wastewater filters operated with infrequent backwashing bradyrhizobium is known to generate extracellular polymeric substances eps which may adversely impact biofilter performance and effluent water quality these findings have important implications for public health and the operation and resiliency of biofiltration systems keywords ozone drinking water wastewater biofiltration 16s rrna gene sequencing microbial community 1 introduction microbial community structure can have a significant impact on water quality in engineered biological treatment systems conversely operational variability in biological treatment systems may also impact the structure and function of the microbial community particularly with respect to the removal of disinfection byproduct precursors liu et al 2017 and other trace organic compounds torcs mikkelson et al 2015 vuono et al 2015 certain operational conditions may select for bacteria that are specifically adapted to biodegrade torcs through direct metabolic and or co metabolic processes fischer and majewsky 2014 for example recent lab scale studies have identified bacterial genera rhodococcus and mycobacterium capable of degrading n nitrosodimethylamine ndma sharp et al 2010 implementing operational changes that select for these bacteria would be advantageous for drinking water and potable reuse systems because ndma is a potential carcinogen even at the low ng l level in addition to bulk and trace organics characterization of microbial community structure may further our understanding of the public health risks associated with the accumulation of pathogenic bacteria within biological treatment systems the performance of engineered biofiltration systems can be impacted by several variables including influent water quality oxidative pretreatment empty bed contact time ebct and backwashing frequency these variables generally affect the redox environment which is known to influence the development and stability of the microbial community zhu et al 2010 velten et al 2011 jałowiecki et al 2016 these factors have been studied to some degree in drinking water systems li et al 2010 liao et al 2012 2013a 2013b and managed aquifer recharge applications li et al 2012 2013 however few studies have focused on advanced treatment trains in potable reuse applications li et al 2017 and even fewer have directly compared biofiltration systems in drinking water versus wastewater matrices with recent advances in microbiology molecular techniques now provide several powerful tools with which to explore these issues for example quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr can be used to target genes coding for enzymes linked to biodegradation of target contaminants e g ndma nelson and labelle 2013 and quantitative stable isotope probing qsip can be used to identify the specific microorganisms responsible for torc biodegradation e g bisphenol a chandran 2016 these tools facilitate the direct examination of microbial function and activity related to known genes and physiologies however they also risk missing contributions from uncharacterized genes pathways or members of the microbial community a more comprehensive molecular examination can be achieved with meta genomics or transcriptomics which utilize high throughput dna and rna sequencing technologies respectively and offer promising new angles to interrogate microbial community structure and function in the context of biotransformation johnson et al 2015 the use of next generation or high throughput dna sequencing e g illumina platform is rapidly emerging as the default technique for cultivation free assessment of microbial community structure in environmental science and engineering applications douterelo et al 2014 sinclair et al 2015 this approach involves sequencing the 16s rrna gene of bacteria or archaea or the 18s rrna gene of eukaryotes e g fungi and amoebae these genes contain both highly conserved regions that allow for nonspecific amplification of target dna and variable regions that allow for taxonomic differentiation and classification in contrast with metagenomics and transcriptomics targeting the 16s or 18s rrna gene does not necessarily provide insight into microbial function but the resulting data can be used to monitor shifts in microbial community structure caused by changes in environmental or operational conditions the current study integrates 16s rrna gene sequencing datasets for ozone biofiltration systems at two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities these data were synthesized to 1 compare and contrast microbial communities in drinking water and wastewater filters and 2 evaluate the effects of filter design criteria and operational conditions on microbial community structure the variables included oxidative pretreatment ozonation and chlorination media type anthracite granular activated carbon gac and biological activated carbon bac media depth and backwash dynamics this information will facilitate a better understanding of the composition and resiliency of biofiltration systems and will provide a baseline for future studies aimed at elucidating links between bacterial taxa and biodegradation of target constituents 2 methodology 2 1 study sites filter media samples were collected from two drinking water and two wastewater facilities for which the corresponding treatment trains are illustrated in fig 1 operational criteria general water quality parameters and sampling details are summarized in table 1 and the 16s rrna gene sequencing metadata are summarized in the supplementary information si file in tables s1 and s2 because the filter media samples were originally collected for different studies some procedures e g dna extraction and primer selection differed slightly by sample location for this reason it was not advisable to aggregate sequencing data from all four facilities prior to data processing reduction and analysis instead samples from drinking water treatment plant 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and reuse pilot 1 rp1 were combined and analyzed simultaneously while samples from rp2 were analyzed separately in the following sections presentation and discussion of the two datasets remain largely independent to minimize the potential for method bias to yield erroneous conclusions 2 1 1 drinking water treatment plant 1 dwtp1 the first study site dwtp1 was a pilot scale skid containing parallel gac sand and anthracite sand filters fed with ozonated surface water ozone doc 0 8 following ferric chloride coagulation and flocculation the filter columns had a diameter of 25 cm and they contained 122 cm of either anthracite or gac atop 30 cm of sand although samples were only collected at a single depth of 25 cm the gac had been acclimated in a full scale drinking water treatment plant for more than 10 years prior to being transferred to the pilot scale column the anthracite media had been in operation for only 8 months prior to sample collection backwashing with unchlorinated filtrate was performed weekly during the study period three sets of duplicate gac samples and a single anthracite sample n 7 were collected between october and november of 2016 details are summarized in fig 1 table 1 and table s1 2 1 2 drinking water treatment plant 2 dwtp2 the second study site dwtp2 was a full scale drinking water treatment plant with parallel filters containing 183 cm of gac and 20 cm of sand these filters were fed with surface water that had been chloraminated to inhibit quagga mussel growth at the intake and then treated with ozone o3 doc 0 8 ferric chloride coagulation flocculation and breakpoint chlorination the filter influent contained a free chlorine residual of approximately 1 8 mg l as cl2 although this residual was quenched within the first 50 cm of the gac bed the free chlorine was intended to inhibit biological activity in the parallel anthracite filters at this facility not sampled as part of this study samples were collected in november of 2016 from both filters approximately every 15 cm of depth before backwashing n 8 from filter 1 and n 12 from filter 2 and from one of the filters immediately after backwashing n 10 from filter 1 backwashing with chlorinated filtrate was performed weekly during the study period again the chlorine was quenched after passing through the sand and bottom layer of the gac bed collectively these data allow for an assessment of the potential impacts of chlorination media depth and backwashing on microbial community structure details are summarized in fig 1 table 1 and table s1 2 1 3

membrane bioreactor mbr nominal membrane pore size of 0 04 μm with a solids retention time of 8 10 days full nitrification and partial denitrification following ozonation o3 doc 0 8 the water was pumped into parallel biofiltration columns with diameters of 2 54 cm and bed depths of approximately 76 cm the columns contained either bac norit 820 cabot corporation alpharetta ga from the f wayne hill water resources center gwinnett county ga same as rp1 or anthracite provided by the san jose creek water reclamation facility los angeles ca a separate bac column was fed with non ozonated mbr

and dwtp2 received relatively high quality surface water with low nutrient and bulk organic matter concentrations total inorganic nitrogen tin 0 5 mg n l orthophosphate 50 μg l and doc 2 4 mg l pre ozonation with an o3 doc ratio of 0 8 was expected to convert some of the recalcitrant natural organic matter into biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc ratpukdi et al 2010 thereby providing a carbon source electron donor for the microbial community the two wastewater matrices rp1 and rp2 contained higher concentrations of bulk organic matter doc 4 8 7 8 mg l and nitrogen tin 8 11 mg n l but the orthophosphate concentration ranged from 50 μg l for rp1 due to chemical and biological phosphorus removal to 8 7 mg l for rp2 despite the higher doc concentrations in the two wastewaters the bulk organic matter was expected to be biologically recalcitrant due to upstream biological treatment again ozonation with an o3 doc ratio of 0 8 likely converted the recalcitrant bulk organic matter into more bioavailable fractions ratpukdi et al 2010 except for the rp2 control bac column receiving non ozonated mbr filtrate representative eems for drinking water dwtp2 and wastewater rp2 matrices are shown in fig 2 the difference in fluorescence intensity for the raw surface water versus the mbr filtrate is representative of the greater quantity and complexity of the bulk organic matter present in the wastewater matrix the reductions in total fluorescence intensity after ozonation 75 and 88 respectively table s3 represent the bulk organic matter transformation achieved via ozone and oh radical oxidation in contrast with the reduction in fluorescence intensity achieved by ozonation there was an increase in fluorescence intensity observed in both systems after biofiltration i e in the gac bac effluents table s3 presumably due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances eps by the microbial community the increases were particularly notable for region i 108 and 174 respectively table s3 but there were also prominent increases in peak fluorescence for both systems at excitation emission wavelengths of 295 410 nm fig 2 in contrast the total fluorescence in the control bac effluent with no pre ozonation exhibited a 17 decrease relative to the mbr filtrate data not shown the synergistic combination of ozone and biofiltration is effective for achieving net removal of bulk organic matter table 1 arnold et al 2018 moreover it may be possible to maximize total organic carbon toc removal by identifying critical eps producers subramanian et al 2010 and minimizing their abundance via operational modifications this is also important because eps has been identified as an important source of disinfection byproduct dbp precursors liu et al 2017 potential improvements in biofiltration performance and effluent water quality justify the use of advanced molecular methods e g 16s rrna gene sequencing to highlight relationships between design operational criteria and microbial community structure the following sections attempt to identify some of these relationships 3 2 alpha intra sample diversity metrics 3 2 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 a summary of alpha diversity metrics for dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 is shown in table s5 the chao1 metric a statistical estimate of total otu richness was always consistent with observed otu richness which suggests that adequate sequencing depth was achieved for all samples all samples also exhibited high alpha diversity based on the shannon and simpson indices the shannon index simultaneously accounts for otu richness and evenness while the simpson index is less sensitive to richness and gives the probability that any two randomly selected individuals will belong to different otus hill 1973 the shannon indices were generally consistent with soil microbial communities in the literature i e 4 5 hill et al 2003 but notable exceptions included the gac considerably higher at 5 8 and anthracite considerably lower at 3 9 filters at dwtp1 this was due to the corresponding differences in otu richness for these two groups relative to the overall dataset besides the difference in media type the only difference between the gac and anthracite at dwtp1 was that the gac had been in use for 10 years prior to being transferred to the pilot while the anthracite had only been in use for 8 months the gac filters at dwtp2 generally had lower alpha diversity compared to the gac at dwtp1 thereby suggesting that alpha diversity may be facility specific high alpha diversity shannon index 6 0 and simpson index 0 96 was observed for one of the bac filters and the anthracite filter at rp1 but it is unclear why the second bac filter did not have similarly high alpha diversity shannon index 4 6 and simpson index 0 83 results of kruskal wallis or two sample t test alpha diversity comparisons richness evenness shannon index and faith s phylogenetic diversity are summarized in table s6 faith s phylogenetic diversity pd provides an indication of the total branch length of a sample s corresponding phylogenetic tree media type mode filter vs backwash and depth had no significant impacts on alpha diversity however significant differences p 0 05 were observed when controlling only for facility or water type wastewater vs drinking water all alpha diversity metrics were significantly higher for dwtp1 in comparison with dwtp2 while dwtp1 and rp1 only differed for otu richness and faith s pd rp1 was higher in both instances 3 2 2 rp2 summaries of the aforementioned alpha diversity metrics for rp2 are shown in tables s7 and s8 similar to rp1 otu richness for the rp2 samples was considerably higher than the drinking water facilities in the first dataset however the shannon and simpson indices for rp2 were generally lower than those of rp1 thereby suggesting community dominance by fewer types of bacteria the kruskal wallis or t test results indicated that ozonation led to significantly reduced otu richness p 0 05 and alpha diversity based on faith s pd p 0 05 but not for evenness p 0 50 or shannon index p 0 18 media type had no significant impacts on alpha diversity in rp2 but increasing depth led to significant increases in evenness p 0 04 these results indicate that there may be a slight positive correlation between operational stress specifically a reduction in bdoc due to lack of pre ozonation or increased retention time and alpha diversity in wastewater filters which is consistent with li et al 2012 3 3 beta inter sample diversity metrics 3 3 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 abundance unweighted unifrac distances and abundance weighted bray curtis dissimilarities were used to compare beta diversity for dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 fig 3 in these plots the relative positioning of each data point i e sample provides an indication of the similarity of its microbial community to that of other samples in the dataset the corresponding permutational analysis of variance permanova statistics are summarized in table s9 when focusing only on phylogeny i e unweighted unifrac all of the samples clustered tightly by facility with no clear visual impacts from backwashing or depth there were clear differences between dwtp1 and dwtp2 thereby indicating that factors other than water type i e wastewater vs drinking water had a significant impact on microbial community structure there was a slight impact due to media type at dwtp1 with anthracite as the visually apparent outlier fig 3 but not at rp1 when focusing only on abundance i e bray curtis the samples from dwtp1 were relatively similar but with anthracite still appearing as an outlier however there was considerable separation in the dwtp2 samples the differences did not appear to be related to backwashing which suggested that depth was potentially impacting microbial community structure to further evaluate this issue the unweighted unifrac and weighted bray curtis analyses were repeated as a function of depth fig 4 both analyses showed that there were slight albeit insignificant differences in microbial community structure at greater depths in the gac filters at dwtp 2 p 0 10 for all pairwise permanovas for the reference depth of 183 cm a similar visual trend was apparent in the bray curtis data near the surface of the gac this may have been related to the effects of free chlorine penetration during filtration and backwashing prior to complete quenching finally the three samples from rp1 were tightly clustered for the unifrac and bray curtis analyses figs 3 and 4 thereby indicating minimal differences in beta diversity if any resulting from varying media type at rp1 3 3 2 rp2 abundance unweighted unifrac distances and abundance weighted bray curtis dissimilarities were also used to evaluate beta diversity for rp2 fig 3 and the corresponding permanova results are summarized in table s9 potential differences due to operational conditions were more visually apparent for rp2 because the samples were not impacted by the potentially confounding effects of water type or facility despite one outlier duplicate for ozone bac low deep the unifrac and bray curtis beta diversity metrics indicated that neither depth p 0 74 and p 0 53 respectively nor pre ozonation p 0 11 and p 0 20 respectively had a significant impact on beta diversity in rp2 depth may not have been a significant factor for beta diversity at rp2 because of the lack of disinfectant residual and the greater nutrient and bdoc loading in the feedwater at least in comparison with dwtp2 the only other facility sampled at multiple depths similar to dwtp1 media type p 0 04 for unifrac and p 0 03 for bray curtis did have a significant impact on beta diversity which is interesting because bac often achieves greater toc removal than anthracite despite similar biomass density arnold et al 2018 3 4 overview of abundant taxa at the phylum level the preceding sections described differences in alpha and beta diversity as a function of various water quality and operational variables the following sections describe the taxonomic differences contributing to those statistical observations full otu tables are also provided as si files 3 4 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 relative abundance at the phylum level for the samples collected from dwtp1 dwtp2 rp1 is summarized in fig 5 the phylum proteobacteria which consists of a wide variety of pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria was the most abundant phylum comprising more than 65 of the microbial community in every sample except those collected from rp1 the samples from dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 exhibited considerable variability with respect to the remaining phyla the anthracite filter at dwtp1 was composed of 90 proteobacteria but also contained a greater relative abundance of cyanobacteria 3 11 compared to the replicate samples from the parallel gac filter 0 65 0 21 the gac filter contained only 75 proteobacteria but contained relatively large fractions of bacteroidetes 5 31 1 08 acidobacteria 9 15 3 72 planctomycetes 5 35 1 42 and nitrospirae 3 14 1 03 the differential abundance of acidobacteria in gac samples was also confirmed by ancom bacteroidetes and acidobacteria are commonly observed in soil ecosystems but their ecological roles are still unclear eichorst et al 2007 in part because of difficulties in culturing these bacteria kielak et al 2016 planctomycetes are known to contain complex intracellular compartments analogous to eukaryotic organelles including the anammoxosome responsible for nitrification fuerst and sagulenko 2011 finally the nitrospirae are known nitrite oxidizers lucker et al 2010 consistent with the gac at dwtp1 dwtp2 was dominated by proteobacteria and exhibited a high relative abundance of acidobacteria both of which are common to soil environments as confirmed by ancom cyanobacteria were also highly abundant particularly at greater depths the cyanobacteria were primarily from the class melainabacteria which are non photosynthetic anaerobic nitrogen fixers di rienzi et al 2013 importantly they also differ from the cyanobacteria responsible for cyanotoxin production blaha et al 2009 melainabacteria are known to occur in the human gut where they have been linked to fermentation and vitamin synthesis soo et al 2014 but their role in drinking water filters is unclear the occurrence of cyanobacteria in some of the drinking water filters may have been related to low nitrogen levels thereby promoting nitrogen fixation or potentially higher ambient levels of cyanobacteria in the source water thereby allowing for filter colonization filter 1 at dwtp2 contained a noticeable amount of thaumarchaeota prior to backwashing but not after backwashing fig 5 thaumarchaeota were also present in filter 2 although their relative abundance was visually attenuated in fig 5 due to the greater prevalence of acidobacteria thaumarchaeota are archaea known to thrive in low ammonia environments pester et al 2011 no ammonia was expected at dwtp2 due to breakpoint chlorination being performed prior to filtration on the other hand the phylum planctomycetes exhibited a slightly higher relative abundance following filter backwashing which is consistent with kasuga et al 2007 interestingly ancom identified the phylum chlamydiae as being differentially abundant immediately following a filter backwash although these bacteria were not particularly abundant overall certain bacterial species from the phylum chlamydiae neochlamydia hartmannellae are known endosymbionts of free living amoebae e g acanthamoeba and hartmannella horn et al 2000 therefore amoebae present in the filters may harbor these bacteria and prevent them from being eliminated during backwashing in contrast with the drinking water filters proteobacteria only comprised 40 45 and 60 of the microbial communities in the bac and anthracite filters respectively at rp1 some proteobacteria appear to exhibit a competitive advantage in systems with low doc concentrations eiler et al 2003 which might explain their greater relative abundance in drinking water versus wastewater filters the wastewater filters were instead characterized by high relative abundance of firmicutes and chloroflexi according to ancom and also bacteroidetes and planctomycetes firmicutes and bacteroidetes are considered core microbiota of the human gut caporaso et al 2011 and planctomycetes fuerst and sagulenko 2011 and chloroflexi bjornsson et al 2002 have been linked to biological nutrient removal systems recall that rp1 is fed with full scale secondary wastewater effluent from an activated sludge system targeting full nitrification partial denitrification and biological phosphorus removal 3 4 2 rp2 the experimental setup at rp2 allowed for a more targeted evaluation of microbial community structure in wastewater systems because it directly compared the effects of pre ozonation media type and media depth at a single wastewater facility a taxa bar plot at the phylum level is provided in fig 6 similar to dwtp1 and dwtp2 but interestingly in slight contrast with rp1 proteobacteria comprised an overwhelming majority of the microbial community in rp2 in fact proteobacteria comprised as much as 95 of the microbial community near the surface of the ozonated bac column a potential explanation for the difference in relative abundance of proteobacteria between rp1 and rp2 is discussed later in the context of genus level characterization also in contrast with rp1 the filters at rp2 were characterized by low relative abundance of firmicutes and high relative abundance of actinobacteria similar to rp1 all of the filters at rp2 were abundant in chloroflexi and to a lesser degree bacteroidetes bacteroidetes have been linked to degradation of high molecular weight organic compounds thomas et al 2011 which are expected to be abundant in wastewater this might portend a greater relative prevalence in the absence of pre ozonation i e the control bac column but this was not observed at rp2 fig 6 instead bacteroidetes exhibited the greatest relative prevalence in the ozone anthracite system alternatively bacteroidetes may be more prevalent in wastewater filters simply because of their role in the human digestive system with respect to differential abundance between rp2 samples there were three notable observations 1 ancom identified phylum sbr1093 as having high relative abundance in bac 2 bacteroidetes exhibited high relative abundance in anthracite and 3 nitrospirae were differentially abundant in the control bac filter receiving non ozonated mbr filtrate again these bacteria are described as nitrite oxidizing bacteria lucker et al 2010 and are found in a variety of natural and engineered environments daims et al 2015 the nitrite concentration in the mbr filtrate was 0 2 0 1 mg n l but it was an order of magnitude lower 0 02 0 03 mg n l in the ozonated mbr filtrate presumably because nitrite is known to react rapidly with ozone lee et al 2013 therefore the higher nitrite concentration in the mbr filtrate feeding the control filters may explain the higher relative prevalence of nitrospirae 3 5 overview of abundant taxa at the genus level the most abundant otus present in eight representative samples from dwtp1 dwtp2 rp1 are summarized in table 2 and the 20 otus that were present in all 40 samples from that dataset are summarized in table 3 similar to the core microbiota of the human gut caporaso et al 2011 table 3 highlights the core microbiota of the drinking water and wastewater filters in the current study although some of the relative abundances still differ considerably between samples some of these taxa such as hyphomicrobium planctomycetales order and burkholderiales order have also been identified as abundant taxa in other biofiltration studies li et al 2017 finally the most abundant otus for rp2 are summarized in table 4 the potential significance of many of these bacteria was summarized previously in the discussion of abundant phyla so the following sections focus only on several genera of interest 3 5 1 genera neochlamydia and legionella in dwtp2 the phylum chlamydiae was previously identified as being differentially abundant following backwashing at dwtp2 this differential abundance was subsequently linked to a genus level otu classified as neochlamydia which is an endosymbiont linked to free living acanthamoeba and hartmannella horn et al 2000 interestingly as part of a follow up study de vera et al 2018 observed an unexpected spike in acanthamoeba concentration in the effluent from this same filter despite being differentially abundant after backwashing neochlamydia was still rare 0 5 abundance relative to the overall microbial community on the other hand legionella a pathogenic endosymbiont khan 2006 that is critically important to human health exhibited greater relative abundance after backwashing and also comprised up to 5 of the microbial community in some samples table 2 prior to backwashing the relative abundance of legionella in filters 1 and 2 was 0 53 0 30 and 1 31 0 68 respectively table 3 after backwashing the relative abundance of legionella in filter 1 increased to 3 01 1 66 table 3 post backwash samples were not collected for filter 2 therefore legionella appear to be more difficult to remove from filters during backwashing potentially because they are harbored by free living amoebae also the fact that the gac rapidly quenched the free chlorine in the backwash water at dwtp2 may have exacerbated the problem further study is needed to determine whether the presence of legionella in drinking water filters poses increased public health risks and how these potential risks if any can be mitigated 3 5 2 genus bradyrhizobium in rp2 one notable observation during operation of rp2 was that ammonia concentrations increased by an average of 0 4 and 1 2 mg n l in the biofiltration columns receiving non ozonated and ozonated mbr filtrate respectively this result contradicts other research indicating that ozone bac can be effective for nitrification chu et al 2012 this increase in ammonia appeared to be related to backwashing frequency which was approximately monthly at the time of media sample collection the production of ammonia ceased following backwashing this indicates that the bacteria responsible for ammonification accumulated during the long filter runs but were likely detached from the media during the backwash cycle the sequencing results indicated that bradyrhizobium was the dominant genus level otu in all samples from rp2 prior to backwashing with a relative abundance ranging from 19 to 61 bradyrhizobium is an aerobic gram negative nitrogen fixing soil bacterium that belongs to the phylum proteobacteria this is the primary reason proteobacteria were significantly more abundant in rp2 than rp1 bradyrhizboium is naturally occurring in soil and induces the formation of nodules on legume roots bedmar et al 2005 within the nodules the bacteria can produce nitrogenase which is an enzyme responsible for the reduction of n2 to nh4 and may explain the increase in ammonia observed in the bac effluent bradyrhizobium is also known to generate significant quantities of eps skorupska et al 2006 which has been linked to membrane biofouling pang and liu 2007 and is consistent with the notable increase in fluorescence observed in fig 1 high relative abundance of bradyrhizobium has not been widely reported in previous biofiltration studies although rhizobium has been reported in biofilters inoculated with activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants zhai et al 2017 additional testing is needed to confirm that bradyrhizobium was responsible for the unexpected ammonia formation and to identify the operational conditions e g infrequent backwashing responsible for its colonization of the media because of the potential implications of residual ammonia e g free chlorine demand and eps release e g filter clogging dbp formation it is important to understand how to minimize the abundance of this potential nuisance microorganism this is comparable to preventing the proliferation of nocardia which is responsible for nuisance foam production in activated sludge systems pitt and jenkins 1990 4 conclusion the results of this study can be used as a baseline for comparing microbial community structure in other drinking water and wastewater systems the results also highlight a number of potential linkages between microbial community structure and operational conditions in biofiltration systems that warrant further study the most important findings are as follows biological activity within filters sometimes results in increased fluorescence associated with bulk organic matter particularly at ex295 em410 this is presumably due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances which have been identified as important disinfection byproduct precursors it is important to minimize the release of eps to maximize total organic carbon removal in ozone biofiltration systems and to reduce disinfection byproduct formation during final chlorination the phylum proteobacteria tends to have the highest relative abundance in drinking water treatment plants which may be linked to the ability of some proteobacteria to thrive in systems with low dissolved organic carbon concentrations proteobacteria are also abundant in wastewater treatment plants under certain operational conditions e g infrequent backwashing that may select for bradyrhizobium the filters at some drinking water treatment plants contain a high relative abundance of the phylum cyanobacteria and its relative abundance increases as a function of depth this may be due to low nitrogen levels selecting for taxa capable of nitrogen fixation and or high ambient levels of cyanobacteria in the source water allowing for filter colonization the post backwash media samples revealed an increase in relative abundance of endosymbionts such as neochlamydia and legionella which are known to be harbored within free living amoebae the lack of chlorine residual in the filter systems may have facilitated colonization by these potentially pathogenic taxa this is a drawback of gac biofilters which will rapidly quench disinfectant residuals so utilities must balance the advantages of biofiltration with the potential public health risks in various applications also microbial community characterization studies targeting the 18s rrna gene are needed to fully understand the connection between amoebae and endosymbionts in drinking water systems proteobacteria are less abundant in wastewater treatment plants with more frequent backwashing instead the wastewater filters tend to be colonized by bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes and planctomycetes which are commonly associated with soil the human gut and biological nutrient removal systems infrequent backwashing may result in the colonization of biofiltration systems by the genus bradyrhizobium which is a known ammonifier and secreter of extracellular polymeric substances this may adversely impact potable reuse systems that target significant total organic carbon removal and employ free chlorine for final disinfection i e higher disinfection byproduct formation potential microbial community structure appears to be more depth dependent in drinking water filters than wastewater filters potentially due to differences in redox potential and carbon nutrient availability media type appears to cause more notable changes in beta diversity rather than alpha diversity in both drinking water and wastewater systems additional studies are needed to determine whether these differences in beta diversity result in the superior performance of biological activated carbon in comparison with anthracite when targeting total organic carbon removal in ozone biofiltration systems pre ozonation had a significant impact on alpha but not beta diversity in rp2 but this may have been an artifact of the low sample number greater statistical power might support the visual differences observed in the pcoas and taxa bar plots specifically the prevalence of nitrospira in non

19678,microbial community structure in the ozone biofiltration systems of two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities was characterized using 16s rrna gene sequencing collectively these datasets enabled comparisons by facility water type drinking water wastewater pre oxidation ozonation chlorination media type anthracite activated carbon media depth and backwash dynamics proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in drinking water filters whereas bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes and planctomycetes were differentially abundant in wastewater filters a positive correlation was observed between media depth and relative abundance of cyanobacteria in drinking water filters but there was only a slight increase in one alpha diversity metric with depth in the wastewater filters media type had a significant effect on beta but not alpha diversity in drinking water and wastewater filters pre ozonation caused a significant decrease in alpha diversity in the wastewater filters but the effect on beta diversity was not statistically significant an evaluation of backwash dynamics resulted in two notable observations 1 endosymbionts such as neochlamydia and legionella increased in relative abundance following backwashing and 2 nitrogen fixing bradyrhizobium dominated the microbial community in wastewater filters operated with infrequent backwashing bradyrhizobium is known to generate extracellular polymeric substances eps which may adversely impact biofilter performance and effluent water quality these findings have important implications for public health and the operation and resiliency of biofiltration systems keywords ozone drinking water wastewater biofiltration 16s rrna gene sequencing microbial community 1 introduction microbial community structure can have a significant impact on water quality in engineered biological treatment systems conversely operational variability in biological treatment systems may also impact the structure and function of the microbial community particularly with respect to the removal of disinfection byproduct precursors liu et al 2017 and other trace organic compounds torcs mikkelson et al 2015 vuono et al 2015 certain operational conditions may select for bacteria that are specifically adapted to biodegrade torcs through direct metabolic and or co metabolic processes fischer and majewsky 2014 for example recent lab scale studies have identified bacterial genera rhodococcus and mycobacterium capable of degrading n nitrosodimethylamine ndma sharp et al 2010 implementing operational changes that select for these bacteria would be advantageous for drinking water and potable reuse systems because ndma is a potential carcinogen even at the low ng l level in addition to bulk and trace organics characterization of microbial community structure may further our understanding of the public health risks associated with the accumulation of pathogenic bacteria within biological treatment systems the performance of engineered biofiltration systems can be impacted by several variables including influent water quality oxidative pretreatment empty bed contact time ebct and backwashing frequency these variables generally affect the redox environment which is known to influence the development and stability of the microbial community zhu et al 2010 velten et al 2011 jałowiecki et al 2016 these factors have been studied to some degree in drinking water systems li et al 2010 liao et al 2012 2013a 2013b and managed aquifer recharge applications li et al 2012 2013 however few studies have focused on advanced treatment trains in potable reuse applications li et al 2017 and even fewer have directly compared biofiltration systems in drinking water versus wastewater matrices with recent advances in microbiology molecular techniques now provide several powerful tools with which to explore these issues for example quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr can be used to target genes coding for enzymes linked to biodegradation of target contaminants e g ndma nelson and labelle 2013 and quantitative stable isotope probing qsip can be used to identify the specific microorganisms responsible for torc biodegradation e g bisphenol a chandran 2016 these tools facilitate the direct examination of microbial function and activity related to known genes and physiologies however they also risk missing contributions from uncharacterized genes pathways or members of the microbial community a more comprehensive molecular examination can be achieved with meta genomics or transcriptomics which utilize high throughput dna and rna sequencing technologies respectively and offer promising new angles to interrogate microbial community structure and function in the context of biotransformation johnson et al 2015 the use of next generation or high throughput dna sequencing e g illumina platform is rapidly emerging as the default technique for cultivation free assessment of microbial community structure in environmental science and engineering applications douterelo et al 2014 sinclair et al 2015 this approach involves sequencing the 16s rrna gene of bacteria or archaea or the 18s rrna gene of eukaryotes e g fungi and amoebae these genes contain both highly conserved regions that allow for nonspecific amplification of target dna and variable regions that allow for taxonomic differentiation and classification in contrast with metagenomics and transcriptomics targeting the 16s or 18s rrna gene does not necessarily provide insight into microbial function but the resulting data can be used to monitor shifts in microbial community structure caused by changes in environmental or operational conditions the current study integrates 16s rrna gene sequencing datasets for ozone biofiltration systems at two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities these data were synthesized to 1 compare and contrast microbial communities in drinking water and wastewater filters and 2 evaluate the effects of filter design criteria and operational conditions on microbial community structure the variables included oxidative pretreatment ozonation and chlorination media type anthracite granular activated carbon gac and biological activated carbon bac media depth and backwash dynamics this information will facilitate a better understanding of the composition and resiliency of biofiltration systems and will provide a baseline for future studies aimed at elucidating links between bacterial taxa and biodegradation of target constituents 2 methodology 2 1 study sites filter media samples were collected from two drinking water and two wastewater facilities for which the corresponding treatment trains are illustrated in fig 1 operational criteria general water quality parameters and sampling details are summarized in table 1 and the 16s rrna gene sequencing metadata are summarized in the supplementary information si file in tables s1 and s2 because the filter media samples were originally collected for different studies some procedures e g dna extraction and primer selection differed slightly by sample location for this reason it was not advisable to aggregate sequencing data from all four facilities prior to data processing reduction and analysis instead samples from drinking water treatment plant 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and reuse pilot 1 rp1 were combined and analyzed simultaneously while samples from rp2 were analyzed separately in the following sections presentation and discussion of the two datasets remain largely independent to minimize the potential for method bias to yield erroneous conclusions 2 1 1 drinking water treatment plant 1 dwtp1 the first study site dwtp1 was a pilot scale skid containing parallel gac sand and anthracite sand filters fed with ozonated surface water ozone doc 0 8 following ferric chloride coagulation and flocculation the filter columns had a diameter of 25 cm and they contained 122 cm of either anthracite or gac atop 30 cm of sand although samples were only collected at a single depth of 25 cm the gac had been acclimated in a full scale drinking water treatment plant for more than 10 years prior to being transferred to the pilot scale column the anthracite media had been in operation for only 8 months prior to sample collection backwashing with unchlorinated filtrate was performed weekly during the study period three sets of duplicate gac samples and a single anthracite sample n 7 were collected between october and november of 2016 details are summarized in fig 1 table 1 and table s1 2 1 2 drinking water treatment plant 2 dwtp2 the second study site dwtp2 was a full scale drinking water treatment plant with parallel filters containing 183 cm of gac and 20 cm of sand these filters were fed with surface water that had been chloraminated to inhibit quagga mussel growth at the intake and then treated with ozone o3 doc 0 8 ferric chloride coagulation flocculation and breakpoint chlorination the filter influent contained a free chlorine residual of approximately 1 8 mg l as cl2 although this residual was quenched within the first 50 cm of the gac bed the free chlorine was intended to inhibit biological activity in the parallel anthracite filters at this facility not sampled as part of this study samples were collected in november of 2016 from both filters approximately every 15 cm of depth before backwashing n 8 from filter 1 and n 12 from filter 2 and from one of the filters immediately after backwashing n 10 from filter 1 backwashing with chlorinated filtrate was performed weekly during the study period again the chlorine was quenched after passing through the sand and bottom layer of the gac bed collectively these data allow for an assessment of the potential impacts of chlorination media depth and backwashing on microbial community structure details are summarized in fig 1 table 1 and table s1 2 1 3 reuse pilot 1 rp1 the third study site rp1 was a pilot scale ozone biofiltration system containing parallel bac and anthracite filters and was located on site at a full scale wastewater treatment plant the filters were fed with treated municipal wastewater following full scale primary clarification activated sludge treatment solids retention time of 7 days full nitrification partial denitrification biological phosphorus removal secondary clarification and dual media filtration anthracite sand the tertiary treated wastewater was then ozonated o3 doc 0 8 and pumped to the three pilot scale 15 cm diameter biofiltration columns fig s1 module f300 intuitech inc salt lake city ut two columns were packed to a depth of 122 cm with either anthracite or bac atop 30 cm of sand ebct 10 min the third column was packed to a depth of 274 cm with bac atop 30 cm of sand ebct 20 min the bac norit 820 cabot corporation alpharetta ga had been in operation at the f wayne hill water resources center in gwinnett county ga for over 10 years prior to this study and exhaustion of the carbon was assumed based on limited doc removal even when coupled with pre ozonation table 1 backwashing was performed weekly during the study period single samples were collected in october of 2016 from each filter at a depth of 15 cm n 3 details are summarized in fig 1 table 1 and text s1 2 1 4 reuse pilot 2 rp2 the fourth study site rp2 consisted of a pilot scale ozone biofiltration system located on site at a full scale water reclamation facility the system was fed with filtrate from a membrane bioreactor mbr nominal membrane pore size of 0 04 μm with a solids retention time of 8 10 days full nitrification and partial denitrification following ozonation o3 doc 0 8 the water was pumped into parallel biofiltration columns with diameters of 2 54 cm and bed depths of approximately 76 cm the columns contained either bac norit 820 cabot corporation alpharetta ga from the f wayne hill water resources center gwinnett county ga same as rp1 or anthracite provided by the san jose creek water reclamation facility los angeles ca a separate bac column was fed with non ozonated mbr filtrate as a control to evaluate bulk organic removal and microbial community structure in the absence of pre ozonation monthly backwashes with unchlorinated mbr filtrate were sufficient to control

archive under study accession number prjeb22574 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality the general water qualities of the various feed waters are summarized in table 1 the filters at dwtp1 and dwtp2 received relatively high quality surface water with low nutrient and bulk organic matter concentrations total inorganic nitrogen tin 0 5 mg n l orthophosphate 50 μg l and doc 2 4 mg l pre ozonation with an o3 doc ratio of 0 8 was expected to convert some of the recalcitrant natural organic matter into biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc ratpukdi et al 2010 thereby providing a carbon source electron donor for the microbial community the two wastewater matrices rp1 and rp2 contained higher concentrations of bulk organic matter doc 4 8 7 8 mg l and nitrogen tin 8 11 mg n l but the orthophosphate concentration ranged from 50 μg l for rp1 due to chemical and biological phosphorus removal to 8 7 mg l for rp2 despite the higher doc concentrations in the two wastewaters the bulk organic matter was expected to be biologically recalcitrant due to upstream biological treatment again ozonation with an o3 doc ratio of 0 8 likely converted the recalcitrant bulk organic matter into more bioavailable fractions ratpukdi et al 2010 except for the rp2 control bac column receiving non ozonated mbr filtrate representative eems for drinking water dwtp2 and wastewater rp2 matrices are shown in fig 2 the difference in fluorescence intensity for the raw surface water versus the mbr filtrate is representative of the greater quantity and complexity of the bulk organic matter present in the wastewater matrix the reductions in total fluorescence intensity after ozonation 75 and 88 respectively table s3 represent the bulk organic matter transformation achieved via ozone and oh radical oxidation in contrast with the reduction in fluorescence intensity achieved by ozonation there was an increase in fluorescence intensity observed in both systems after biofiltration i e in the gac bac effluents table s3 presumably due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances eps by the microbial community the increases were particularly notable for region i 108 and 174 respectively table s3 but there were also prominent increases in peak fluorescence for both systems at excitation emission wavelengths of 295 410 nm fig 2 in contrast the total fluorescence in the control bac effluent with no pre ozonation exhibited a 17 decrease relative to the mbr filtrate data not shown the synergistic combination of ozone and biofiltration is effective for achieving net removal of bulk organic matter table 1 arnold et al 2018 moreover it may be possible to maximize total organic carbon toc removal by identifying critical eps producers subramanian et al 2010 and minimizing their abundance via operational modifications this is also important because eps has been identified as an important source of disinfection byproduct dbp precursors liu et al 2017 potential improvements in biofiltration performance and effluent water quality justify the use of advanced molecular methods e g 16s rrna gene sequencing to highlight relationships between design operational criteria and microbial community structure the following sections attempt to identify some of these relationships 3 2 alpha intra sample diversity metrics 3 2 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 a summary of alpha diversity metrics for dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 is shown in table s5 the chao1 metric a statistical estimate of total otu richness was always consistent with observed otu richness which suggests that adequate sequencing depth was achieved for all samples all samples also exhibited high alpha diversity based on the shannon and simpson indices the shannon index simultaneously accounts for otu richness and evenness while the simpson index is less sensitive to richness and gives the probability that any two randomly selected individuals will belong to different otus hill 1973 the shannon indices were generally consistent with soil microbial communities in the literature i e 4 5 hill et al 2003 but notable exceptions included the gac considerably higher at 5 8 and anthracite considerably lower at 3 9 filters at dwtp1 this was due to the corresponding differences in otu richness for these two groups relative to the overall dataset besides the difference in media type the only difference between the gac and anthracite at dwtp1 was that the gac had been in use for 10 years prior to being transferred to the pilot while the anthracite had only been in use for 8 months the gac filters at dwtp2 generally had lower alpha diversity compared to the gac at dwtp1 thereby suggesting that alpha diversity may be facility specific high alpha diversity shannon index 6 0 and simpson index 0 96 was observed for one of the bac filters and the anthracite filter at rp1 but it is unclear why the second bac filter did not have similarly high alpha diversity shannon index 4 6 and simpson index 0 83 results of kruskal wallis or two sample t test alpha diversity comparisons richness evenness shannon index and faith s phylogenetic diversity are summarized in table s6 faith s phylogenetic diversity pd provides an indication of the total branch length of a sample s corresponding phylogenetic tree media type mode filter vs backwash and depth had no significant impacts on alpha diversity however significant differences p 0 05 were observed when controlling only for facility or water type wastewater vs drinking water all alpha diversity metrics were significantly higher for dwtp1 in comparison with dwtp2 while dwtp1 and rp1 only differed for otu richness and faith s pd rp1 was higher in both instances 3 2 2 rp2 summaries of the aforementioned alpha diversity metrics for rp2 are shown in tables s7 and s8 similar to rp1 otu richness for the rp2 samples was considerably higher than the drinking water facilities in the first dataset however the shannon and simpson indices for rp2 were generally lower than those of rp1 thereby suggesting community dominance by fewer types of bacteria the kruskal wallis or t test results indicated that ozonation led to significantly reduced otu richness p 0 05 and alpha diversity based on faith s pd p 0 05 but not for evenness p 0 50 or shannon index p 0 18 media type had no significant impacts on alpha diversity in rp2 but increasing depth led to significant increases in evenness p 0 04 these results indicate that there may be a slight positive correlation between operational stress specifically a reduction in bdoc due to lack of pre ozonation or increased retention time and alpha diversity in wastewater filters which is consistent with li et al 2012 3 3 beta inter sample diversity metrics 3 3 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 abundance unweighted unifrac distances and abundance weighted bray curtis dissimilarities were used to compare beta diversity for dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 fig 3 in these plots the relative positioning of each data point i e sample provides an indication of the similarity of its microbial community to that of other samples in the dataset the corresponding permutational analysis of variance permanova statistics are summarized in table s9 when focusing only on phylogeny i e unweighted unifrac all of the samples clustered tightly by facility with no clear visual impacts from backwashing or depth there were clear differences between dwtp1 and dwtp2 thereby indicating that factors other than water type i e wastewater vs drinking water had a significant impact on microbial community structure there was a slight impact due to media type at dwtp1 with anthracite as the visually apparent outlier fig 3 but not at rp1 when focusing only on abundance i e bray curtis the samples from dwtp1 were relatively similar but with anthracite still appearing as an outlier however there was considerable separation in the dwtp2 samples the differences did not appear to be related to backwashing which suggested that depth was potentially impacting microbial community structure to further evaluate this issue the unweighted unifrac and weighted bray curtis analyses were repeated as a function of depth fig 4 both analyses showed that there were slight albeit insignificant differences in microbial community structure at greater depths in the gac filters at dwtp 2 p 0 10 for all pairwise permanovas for the reference depth of 183 cm a similar visual trend was apparent in the bray curtis data near the surface of the gac this may have been related to the effects of free chlorine penetration during filtration and backwashing prior to complete quenching finally the three samples from rp1 were tightly clustered for the unifrac and bray curtis analyses figs 3 and 4 thereby indicating minimal differences in beta diversity if any resulting from varying media type at rp1 3 3 2 rp2 abundance unweighted unifrac distances and abundance weighted bray curtis dissimilarities were also used to evaluate beta diversity for rp2 fig 3 and the corresponding permanova results are summarized in table s9 potential differences due to operational conditions were more visually apparent for rp2 because the samples were not impacted by the potentially confounding effects of water type or facility despite one outlier duplicate for ozone bac low deep the unifrac and bray curtis beta diversity metrics indicated that neither depth p 0 74 and p 0 53 respectively nor pre ozonation p 0 11 and p 0 20 respectively had a significant impact on beta diversity in rp2 depth may not have been a significant factor for beta diversity at rp2 because of the lack of disinfectant residual and the greater nutrient and bdoc loading in the feedwater at least in comparison with dwtp2 the only other facility sampled at multiple depths similar to dwtp1 media type p 0 04 for unifrac and p 0 03 for bray curtis did have a significant impact on beta diversity which is interesting because bac often achieves greater toc removal than anthracite despite similar biomass density arnold et al 2018 3 4 overview of abundant taxa at the phylum level the preceding sections described differences in alpha and beta diversity as a function of various water quality and operational variables the following sections describe the taxonomic differences contributing to those statistical observations full otu tables are also provided as si files 3 4 1 dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 relative abundance at the phylum level for the samples collected from dwtp1 dwtp2 rp1 is summarized in fig 5 the phylum proteobacteria which consists of a wide variety of pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria was the most abundant phylum comprising more than 65 of the microbial community in every sample except those collected from rp1 the samples from dwtp1 dwtp2 and rp1 exhibited considerable variability with respect to the remaining phyla the anthracite filter at dwtp1 was composed of 90 proteobacteria but also contained a greater relative abundance of cyanobacteria 3 11 compared to the replicate samples from the parallel gac filter 0 65 0 21 the gac filter contained only 75 proteobacteria but contained relatively large fractions of bacteroidetes 5 31 1 08 acidobacteria 9 15 3 72 planctomycetes 5 35 1 42 and nitrospirae 3 14 1 03 the differential abundance of acidobacteria in gac samples was also confirmed by ancom bacteroidetes and acidobacteria are commonly observed in soil ecosystems but their ecological roles are still unclear eichorst et al 2007 in part because of difficulties in culturing these bacteria kielak et al 2016 planctomycetes are known to contain complex intracellular compartments analogous to eukaryotic organelles including the anammoxosome responsible for nitrification fuerst and sagulenko 2011 finally the nitrospirae are known nitrite oxidizers lucker et al 2010 consistent with the gac at dwtp1 dwtp2 was dominated by proteobacteria and exhibited a high relative abundance of acidobacteria both of which are common to soil environments as confirmed by ancom cyanobacteria were also highly abundant particularly at greater depths the cyanobacteria were primarily from the class melainabacteria which are non photosynthetic anaerobic nitrogen fixers di rienzi et al 2013 importantly they also differ from the cyanobacteria responsible for cyanotoxin production blaha et al 2009 melainabacteria are known to occur in the human gut where they have been linked to fermentation and vitamin synthesis soo et al 2014 but their role in drinking water filters is unclear the occurrence of cyanobacteria in some of the drinking water filters may have been related to low nitrogen levels thereby promoting nitrogen fixation or potentially higher ambient levels of cyanobacteria in the source water thereby allowing for filter colonization filter 1 at dwtp2 contained a noticeable amount of thaumarchaeota prior to backwashing but not after backwashing fig 5 thaumarchaeota were also present in filter 2 although their relative abundance was visually attenuated in fig 5 due to the greater prevalence of acidobacteria thaumarchaeota are archaea known to thrive in low ammonia environments pester et al 2011 no ammonia was expected at dwtp2 due to breakpoint chlorination being performed prior to filtration on the other hand the phylum planctomycetes exhibited a slightly higher relative abundance following filter backwashing which is consistent with kasuga et al 2007 interestingly ancom identified the phylum chlamydiae as being differentially abundant immediately following a filter backwash although these bacteria were not particularly abundant overall certain bacterial species from the phylum chlamydiae neochlamydia hartmannellae are known endosymbionts of free living amoebae e g acanthamoeba and hartmannella horn et al 2000 therefore amoebae present in the filters may harbor these bacteria and prevent them from being eliminated during backwashing in contrast with the drinking water filters proteobacteria only comprised 40 45 and 60 of the microbial communities in the bac and anthracite filters respectively at rp1 some proteobacteria appear to exhibit a competitive advantage in systems with low doc concentrations eiler et al 2003 which might explain their greater relative abundance in drinking water versus wastewater filters the wastewater filters were instead characterized by high relative abundance of firmicutes and chloroflexi according to ancom and also bacteroidetes and planctomycetes firmicutes and bacteroidetes are considered core microbiota of the human gut caporaso et al 2011 and planctomycetes fuerst and sagulenko 2011 and chloroflexi bjornsson et al 2002 have been linked to biological nutrient removal systems recall that rp1 is fed with full scale secondary wastewater effluent from an activated sludge system targeting full nitrification partial denitrification and biological phosphorus removal 3 4 2 rp2 the experimental setup at rp2 allowed for a more targeted evaluation of microbial community structure in wastewater systems because it directly compared the effects of pre ozonation media type and media depth at a single wastewater facility a taxa bar plot at the phylum level is provided in fig 6 similar to dwtp1 and dwtp2 but interestingly in slight contrast with rp1 proteobacteria comprised an overwhelming majority of the microbial community in rp2 in fact proteobacteria comprised as much as 95 of the microbial community near the surface of the ozonated bac column a potential explanation for the difference in relative abundance of proteobacteria between rp1 and rp2 is discussed later in the context of genus level characterization also in contrast with rp1 the filters at rp2 were characterized by low relative abundance of firmicutes and high relative abundance of actinobacteria similar to rp1 all of the filters at rp2 were abundant in chloroflexi and to a lesser degree bacteroidetes bacteroidetes have been linked to degradation of high molecular weight organic compounds thomas et al 2011 which are expected to be abundant in wastewater this might portend a greater relative prevalence in the absence of pre ozonation i e the control bac column but this was not observed at rp2 fig 6 instead bacteroidetes exhibited the greatest relative prevalence in the ozone anthracite system alternatively bacteroidetes may be more prevalent in wastewater filters simply because of their role in the human digestive system with respect to differential abundance between rp2 samples there were three notable observations 1 ancom identified phylum sbr1093 as having high relative abundance in bac 2 bacteroidetes exhibited high relative abundance in anthracite and 3 nitrospirae were differentially abundant in the control bac filter receiving non ozonated mbr filtrate again these bacteria are described as nitrite oxidizing bacteria lucker et al 2010 and are found in a variety of natural and engineered environments daims et al 2015 the nitrite concentration in the mbr filtrate was 0 2 0 1 mg n l but it was an order of magnitude lower 0 02 0 03 mg n l in the ozonated mbr filtrate presumably because nitrite is known to react rapidly with ozone lee et al 2013 therefore the higher nitrite concentration in the mbr filtrate feeding the control filters may explain the higher relative prevalence of nitrospirae 3 5 overview of abundant taxa at the genus level the most abundant otus present in eight representative samples from dwtp1 dwtp2 rp1 are summarized in table 2 and the 20 otus that were present in all 40 samples from that dataset are summarized in table 3 similar to the core microbiota of the human gut caporaso et al 2011 table 3 highlights the core microbiota of the drinking water and wastewater filters in the current study although some of the relative abundances still differ considerably between samples some of these taxa such as hyphomicrobium planctomycetales order and burkholderiales order have also been identified as abundant taxa in other biofiltration studies li et al 2017 finally the most abundant otus for rp2 are summarized in table 4 the potential significance of many of these bacteria was summarized previously in the discussion of abundant phyla so the following sections focus only on several genera of interest 3 5 1 genera neochlamydia and legionella in dwtp2 the phylum chlamydiae was previously identified as being differentially abundant following backwashing at dwtp2 this differential abundance was subsequently linked to a genus level otu classified as neochlamydia which is an endosymbiont linked to free living acanthamoeba and hartmannella horn et al 2000 interestingly as part of a follow up study de vera et al 2018 observed an unexpected spike in acanthamoeba concentration in the effluent from this same filter despite being differentially abundant after backwashing neochlamydia was still rare 0 5 abundance relative to the overall microbial community on the other hand legionella a pathogenic endosymbiont khan 2006 that is critically important to human health exhibited greater relative abundance after backwashing and also comprised up to 5 of the microbial community in some samples table 2 prior to backwashing the relative abundance of legionella in filters 1 and 2 was 0 53 0 30 and 1 31 0 68 respectively table 3 after backwashing the relative abundance of legionella in filter 1 increased to 3 01 1 66 table 3 post backwash samples were not collected for filter 2 therefore legionella appear to be more difficult to remove from filters during backwashing potentially because they are harbored by free living amoebae also the fact that the gac rapidly quenched the free chlorine in the backwash water at dwtp2 may have exacerbated the problem further study is needed to determine whether the presence of legionella in drinking water filters poses increased public health risks and how these potential risks if any can be mitigated 3 5 2 genus bradyrhizobium in rp2 one notable observation during operation of rp2 was that ammonia concentrations increased by an average of 0 4 and 1 2 mg n l in the biofiltration columns receiving non ozonated and ozonated mbr filtrate respectively this result contradicts other research indicating that ozone bac can be effective for nitrification chu et al 2012 this increase in ammonia appeared to be related to backwashing frequency which was approximately monthly at the time of media sample collection the production of ammonia ceased following backwashing this indicates that the bacteria responsible for ammonification accumulated during the long filter runs but were likely detached from the media during the backwash cycle the sequencing results indicated that bradyrhizobium was the dominant genus level otu in all samples from rp2 prior to backwashing with a relative abundance ranging from 19 to 61 bradyrhizobium is an aerobic gram negative nitrogen fixing soil bacterium that belongs to the phylum proteobacteria this is the primary reason proteobacteria were significantly more abundant in rp2 than rp1 bradyrhizboium is naturally occurring in soil and induces the formation of nodules on legume roots bedmar et al 2005 within the nodules the bacteria can produce nitrogenase which is an enzyme responsible for the reduction of n2 to nh4 and may explain the increase in ammonia observed in the bac effluent bradyrhizobium is also known to generate significant quantities of eps skorupska et al 2006 which has been linked to membrane biofouling pang and liu 2007 and is consistent with the notable increase in fluorescence observed in fig 1 high relative abundance of bradyrhizobium has not been widely reported in previous biofiltration studies although rhizobium has been reported in biofilters inoculated with activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants zhai et al 2017 additional testing is needed to confirm that bradyrhizobium was responsible for the unexpected ammonia formation and to identify the operational conditions e g infrequent backwashing responsible for its colonization of the media because of the potential implications of residual ammonia e g free chlorine demand and eps release e g filter clogging dbp formation it is important to understand how to minimize the abundance of this potential nuisance microorganism this is comparable to preventing the proliferation of nocardia which is responsible for nuisance foam production in activated sludge systems pitt and jenkins 1990 4 conclusion the results of this study can be used as a baseline for comparing microbial community structure in other drinking water and wastewater systems the results also highlight a number of potential linkages between microbial community structure and operational conditions in biofiltration systems that warrant further study the most important findings are as follows biological activity within filters sometimes results in increased fluorescence associated with bulk organic matter particularly at ex295 em410 this is presumably due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances which have been identified as important disinfection byproduct precursors it is important to minimize the release of eps to maximize total organic carbon removal in ozone biofiltration systems and to reduce disinfection byproduct formation during final chlorination the phylum proteobacteria tends to have the highest relative abundance in drinking water treatment plants which may be linked to the ability of some proteobacteria to thrive in systems with low dissolved organic carbon concentrations proteobacteria are also abundant in wastewater treatment plants under certain operational conditions e g infrequent backwashing that may select for bradyrhizobium the filters at some drinking water treatment plants contain a high relative abundance of the phylum cyanobacteria and its relative abundance increases as a function of depth this may be due to low nitrogen levels selecting for taxa capable of nitrogen fixation and or high ambient levels of cyanobacteria in the source water allowing for filter colonization the post backwash media samples revealed an increase in relative abundance of endosymbionts such as neochlamydia and legionella which are known to be harbored within free living amoebae the lack of chlorine residual in the filter systems may have facilitated colonization by these potentially pathogenic taxa this is a drawback of gac biofilters which will rapidly quench disinfectant residuals so utilities must balance the advantages of biofiltration with the potential public health risks in various applications also microbial community characterization studies targeting the 18s rrna gene are needed to fully understand the connection between amoebae and endosymbionts in drinking water systems proteobacteria are less abundant in wastewater treatment plants with more frequent backwashing instead the wastewater filters tend to be colonized by bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes and planctomycetes which are commonly associated with soil the human gut and biological nutrient removal systems infrequent backwashing may result in the colonization of biofiltration systems by the genus bradyrhizobium which is a known ammonifier and secreter of extracellular polymeric substances this may adversely impact potable reuse systems that target significant total organic carbon removal and employ free chlorine for final disinfection i e higher disinfection byproduct formation potential microbial community structure appears to be more depth dependent in drinking water filters than wastewater filters potentially due to differences in redox potential and carbon nutrient availability media type appears to cause more notable changes in beta diversity rather than alpha diversity in both drinking water and wastewater systems additional studies are needed to determine whether these differences in beta diversity result in the superior performance of biological activated carbon in comparison with anthracite when targeting total organic carbon removal in ozone biofiltration systems pre ozonation had a significant impact on alpha but not beta diversity in rp2 but this may have been an artifact of the low sample number greater statistical power might support the visual differences observed in the pcoas and taxa bar plots specifically the prevalence of nitrospira in non

dimensionally stable anode dsa and boron doped diamond bdd and cathodic carbon sponge cs carbon felt cf and stainless steel ss materials on lindane electrooxidation and mineralization were investigated special attention was paid to determine the role of chlorine active species during the electrooxidation process the results showed that better performances were obtained when using a bdd anode and cf cathode cell the influence of the current density was assessed to optimize the oxidation of lindane and the mineralization of its aqueous solution a quick 10 min and complete oxidation of

bdd carbon felt 1 introduction organochlorine pesticides ocps represent a major source of emerging water pollutants in recent decades usman et al 2014 khan et al 2017a among the ocps lindane the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch was widely used as a broad spectrum insecticide in agriculture and for public health purposes since the second world war until the 1990s wang et al 2009 chang et al 2011 as a result of its intense use lindane residues a mixture of α β γ δ and ε hch isomers have been detected worldwide ultimately entering into the human body through food chains behrooz et al 2009 the hchs isomers are among the most ubiquitous organochlorine pesticides and are easily found in the environment they can be detected in real samples in a quite broad range from ng l 1 in natural water world health organization 2004 to near its maximum solubility in water 10 mg l 1 when polluted water comes directly from the washing of the solid product hch residues were often stockpiled in open piles or by the dissolution of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl of these compounds these pesticides are also bioaccumulative and can enter the food chain to reach and accumulate in human and animal tissues as a consequence of its high toxicity and long persistence lindane presents potential health risks to humans skin irritation dizziness headaches diarrhea nausea vomiting convulsions and even death and animals heusinkveld et al 2010 it was reported to be neurotoxic a potential carcinogen and teratogen by the environmental protection agency epa and the world health organization who joo and zhao 2008 therefore the concern for these pollutants has grown exponentially in recent years resulting finally in lindane inclusion along with α and β hch in the list of persistent organic pollutants pops in the stockholm convention of 2009 vijgen et al 2011 the use of lindane has been restricted in many european countries as well as in the united states and canada but it is still being used elsewhere khan et al 2017a and many landfills and other sites remain polluted by these compounds dutchak et al 2004 yang et al 2010 chang et al 2011 therefore finding a solution for lindane decontamination has become a priority for the scientific community in recent years several methods including conventional techniques such as incineration peng et al 2015 biological treatments camacho pérez et al 2012 chemical oxidation usman et al 2014 and reduction dominguez et al 2016 have been used for lindane degradation in water or soil among the different processes employed for water

co2 h2o and inorganic ions unfortunately lindane oxidation entails serious difficulties due to the intrinsic characteristics of the molecule it was already reported that lindane is less prone to oxidation than other organochloride compounds due to its non aromatic and saturated structure and the absence of a double bond dionysiou et al 2000 moreover the presence of electron withdrawing chlorine groups in its molecular structure makes lindane even more resistant towards oxidation by oh in this sense and due to the difficulty of the challenge various aops have been tested for lindane

using three of the most common anodes in eaops pt dsa dimensionally stable anode and bdd boron doped diamond brillas et al 2009 sopaj et al 2016 the role of the cathodic material such as carbon felt cf carbon sponge cs and stainless steel ss was also investigated the influence of current density the most determinant parameter in eaops was optimized for efficient lindane degradation finally based on the oxidation reaction intermediates identified during electrolysis a plausible degradation pathway was proposed for lindane electrooxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents synthetic lindane

corresponding to 2 45 mg l 1 working standard solutions of lindane c8h5ko4 nacalai tesque nacl naclo3 and naclo4 sigma aldrich were prepared for gas chromatography mass spectrometry cg ms toc and ionic chromatography ic calibration curves respectively additional standard solutions of chlorinated compounds hydroxylated compounds and carboxylic acids were also prepared in order to identify the

ch3oh and h2so4 sigma aldrich all the solutions were prepared with high purity water obtained from a millipore direct q system with resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c 2 2 electrochemical experiments although the concentration of lindane usually found in real effluents is significantly lower experiments were carried out using lindane solutions at its solubility limit 10 mg l 1 in order to facilitate its measurement determination of toc abatement the release of chloride ions and the intermediate compounds generated during the electrochemical process electrochemical experiments were performed over 6 h in an undivided cylindrical glass cell with a volume capacity of 230 ml at room temperature 25 1 c and at the natural ph of lindane solution ph0 6 5 a 3d 90 cm2 cf 18 0 cm 5 0 cm 0

cathode pt cf pt anode cf cathode dsa cf dsa anode cf cathode bdd cs bdd anode cs cathode and bdd ss bdd anode ss cathode sodium sulfate na2so4 50 mm was added to the cell as the background electrolyte in order to increase solution conductivity lindane solution was continuously agitated by a magnetic stirrer 250 rpm to ensure an adequate mass transfer to from electrodes and the reactor was capped to avoid water evaporation and organics volatilization during the electrolysis period once the electrode materials had been selected a range of constant currents from 100 to 800 ma which correspond to current densities from 2 08 to 16 66 ma cm 2 taking into account the exposed anode surface 48 cm2 was applied to the electrochemical cell the current intensity and the potential difference of the cell were measured and displayed continuously throughout electrolysis by using a dc power supply hameg instruments hm 8040 3 the change of solution ph during electrolysis was monitored using a cyberscan ph1500 device from eutech instruments all the experiments were performed in duplicate and the standard deviation was lower than 5 in all cases 2 3 analytical methods lindane was identified and quantified by means of gc ms analyses prior to analyses lindane and its oxidation intermediates in aqueous phase were extracted by using solid phase cartridges c18 e 55 μm 70 å phenomenex and eluted with the same volume of acetone other solvents such as n hexane dichloromethane and ethyl acetate were also tested for the extraction process an spe varian vacuum manifold 20 port model and a knf vacuum pump were used cartridges were preconditioned with acetone and the aqueous matrix of the sample prior to acetone elution cartridges were vacuum dried 10 mmhg for 10 min to remove any trace of water in order to minimize experimental error in lindane quantification 4 methylcyclohexanone was added to the extracted samples as the internal standard compound istd lindane calibration in the range 0 025 10 mg l 1 was previously performed following the same extraction procedure and compared with known concentrations of lindane directly dissolved in acetone the percentage of lindane recovery after the extraction process was covered between 90 and 100 the thermo fisher scientific trace 1300 isq gc ms used in this work was equipped with a tg 5 ms column helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 2 ml min 1 the gc injection port temperature was set at 250 c extracted samples 3 μl were manually injected the program temperature started at 40 c held for 2 min followed by a temperature ramp of 10 c min 1 to 280 c and then held constant for 4 min analysis was carried out in ei mode 70 ev the decay in toc solution was measured by a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer reproducible toc values with an accuracy of 2 were determined using the non purgeable organic carbon method calibration was achieved with potassium hydrogen phthalate solutions aromatic intermediates were identified by hplc using a merck hitachi lachrom liquid chromatograph equipped with an l 2310 pump fitted with a reverse phase purospher rp 18 5 μm 25 cm 4 6 mm i d column and coupled with an l 2400 uv detector set at λ 238 nm the temperature of the column was maintained constant at 40 c the injection volume was 20 μl and the isocratic eluent 30 70 methanol water was pumped to the system at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 generated carboxylic acids were identified by ion exclusion hplc using a merck hitachi lachrom liquid chromatography system equipped with an l 7100 pump fitted with a supelcogel h 9 μm 25 cm 4 6 mm column at room temperature and coupled with a dad uv l 7455 detector set at λ 220 nm using 1 h2so4 at 0 2 ml min 1 as the mobile phase the dechlorination degree was evaluated in terms of chloride ions released to the solution during electrolysis which were determined by ic 930 compact ic flex metrohm with anionic chemical suppression equipped with a conductivity detector and an autosampler 910 ic autosampler plus an anionic exchanger column metrosep a supp5 250 4 25 cm length 4 mm diameter was used as the stationary phase and 0 7 ml min 1 of an aqueous solution 3 2 mm of na2co3 and 1 mm of nahco3 as the mobile phase other chlorine species such as chlorate and perchlorate ions during electrolysis were also followed by this technique 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of electrode materials on lindane degradation the choice of electrode material determines the efficiency of electrooxidation process as well as the potential formation of toxic by products radjenovic and sedlak 2015 3 1 1 anode materials the time course of lindane concentration and solution toc with different anode materials tested under selected operating conditions is shown in fig 1 a and b respectively in these experiments the same cathode cf was used for the sake of comparison a control experiment without current intensity was also performed obtaining negligible changes both in pollutant concentration and toc value at 6 h data not shown keeping the solution volume constant which was also checked during electrochemical experiments therefore water evaporation and or lindane adsorption on the electrodes during the treatment time were insignificant it was observed that lindane degradation was relatively fast in the worst case 30 min was enough to completely degrade the pollutant with a current density of 8 33 ma cm 2 however different oxidation rates were obtained depending on the anode used bdd being the most efficient anode during the electrooxidation process organic compounds are mainly oxidized by indirect oxidation via oxidants generated on the anode surface such as heterogeneous oh m oh the second most powerful oxidant after fluorine panizza and cerisola 2009 as shown in fig 1 oxidative degradation of lindane and mineralization of its solution was quicker with a bdd anode than with pt and dsa anodes this more efficient oxidation power of the bdd anode could be related to its greater o2 evolution overvoltage compared to the active anodes pt and dsa panizza and cerisola 2005 brillas et al 2009 barhoumi et al 2015 thus the bdd anode produced a higher amount of reactive bdd oh from the electrochemical oxidation of water eq 1 and minimized the production of competitive reactions eq 3 that consume the radical species leading to oxygen production garcia segura et al 2018 3 2m oh 2 m o2 2 h 2 e additionally the bdd oh is weakly adsorbed physisorption on the anode surface thus being easily available for oxidation of organics present in the vicinity of the anode in contrast pt and dsa anodes present relatively weak o2 evolution overpotential with chemisorbed m oh which is less mobile to efficiently oxidize organic pollutants oturan et al 2013 moreover the active anodes are capable of oxidizing organics into more biodegradable molecules but they cannot achieve their complete transformation into carbon dioxide garcia segura et al 2018 the dsa anode led to a slightly higher lindane oxidation rate than the pt anode fig 1a probably due to the formation of hypochlorite on the anode surface from the oxidation of chloride ions these coming from lindane degradation according to its mineralization reaction eq 4 4 c6h6cl6 12 h2o 6 co2 6 cl 30 h 24 e the oxidation of chloride anions on the anode surface by direct electrooxidation and or by the indirect action of reactive oxygen species m oh the dsa and to a greater extent the bdd anodes leads to the formation of active chlorine species eqs 5 to 7 which are powerful oxidants that can play an important role in the oxidation of organics via mediated oxidation deng and englehardt 2007 canizares et al 2009 panizza and cerisola 2009 randazzo et al 2011 brillas and martínez huitle 2015 these chlorine species are the main indirect oxidation agents employed in wastewater treatment moreira et al 2017 firstly chloride is oxidized on the anode surface releasing chlorine eq 5 when the electrogenerated chlorine diffuses away from the anode it is quickly hydrolyzed yielding hypochlorous acid hclo and chloride by disproportionation eq 6 hclo is in equilibrium with the hypochlorite ion clo with pka 7 55 eq 7 the predominance of these species is a function of solution ph clo ph above 7 hclo from ph 7 to 3 and cl2 ph below 3 respectively moreira et al 2017 it should be noted that the starting ph of the lindane solution 6 5 rapidly decreased in all cases to values of about ph 3 3 5 after 30 min of electrolysis see sub section 3 2 thus hypochlorous acid predominates during the whole process otherwise the standard reduction potential of cl2 aq e 1 36 v she and hclo e 1 49 v she is considerably higher than clo e 0 89 v she indicating that oxidation of organics mediated by chlorine active species is favored under acidic ph conditions moreira et al 2017 garcia segura et al 2018 5 2 cl cl2 aq 2 e 6 cl2 aq h2o hclo cl h 7 hclo h clo less active chlorine species chlorite chlorate and perchlorate anions e 1 v she in all cases can be simultaneously generated by the action of m oh according to the following equations eqs 8 11 hubler et al 2014 this phenomenon is especially important in the case of non active anodes garcia segura et al 2018 such as bdd when using bdd anodes chloride completely transformed to form perchlorate in long term discontinuous experiments and or if large current charges were passed through the cell bergmann et al 2009 2011 8 cl m oh clo 2 h 9 clo m oh clo2 2 h 10 clo2 m oh clo3 2 h 11 clo3 m oh clo4 2 h the latter generated chlorine species clo3 and clo4 are unwanted by products since they are hydroxyl radical consuming and are not able to oxidize organics in solution garcia segura et al 2015 moreover these species considered noxious especially perchlorate are of great concern as inorganic pollutants in water sources van wijk et al 1998 ting and steinmaus 2013 garcia segura et al 2018 water effluents containing greater amounts of chloride ions favor the generation of high concentrations of these species limiting their electrochemical treatment the amount of chlorinated organic by products may be minimized by applying a short electrolysis time while targeting a suitable degree of removal of contaminants if these compounds chlorate perchlorate are formed in concentrations higher than those allowed they could be removed by adsorption on activated carbon ion exchange membrane filtration and microbial chemical or electrochemical reduction radjenovic and sedlak 2015 on the other hand it should be noted that clo4 poses no problem when it is generated in low or moderate concentrations the maximum concentration of chlorine in this study was that from the lindane molecule 7 43 mg l 1 moreover its salts are even used as an electrolyte in eaops diagne et al 2007 hubler et al 2014 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 on the other hand a study concerning the toxicity of chlorate on selected species of algae bacteria and fungi confirmed that chlorate is toxic only to brown algae and not to species of other ecologically important taxa van wijk et al 1998 the change of cl and clo3 ion concentrations the most important chlorine species identified in terms of concentration during lindane electrooxidation with the different electrodes tested was monitored by ic and results are shown in fig 2 with regard to the other chlorine species clo could not be measured clo2 appeared only in trace amounts below the detection limit and clo4 was only detected when the bdd anode was used radjenovic and sedlak 2015 a possible explanation to justify the detection of clo2 in such low concentrations is the direct electrochemical conversion of hypochlorous acid to chlorate ion according to eq 12 moreira et al 2017 12 6 hclo 3 h2o 2 clo3 4 cl 12 h 1 5 o2 6 e pt despite being an active anode seems to be the only one unable to oxidize chlorides eqs 5 and 8 the concentration of cl in the pt cf cell increased until reaching a maximum value of around 7 mg l 1 after 2 h electrolysis time from this point the concentration of chlorides in the reaction medium remained constant this value represents almost 95 of the theoretical amount of chlorine initially present in lindane 7 43 mg l 1 according to eq 4 suggesting its complete dechlorination the slight mismatch 5 may be due to the analytical errors or presence of some organochlorines that remain in the solution since the mineralization achieved was not total regarding the dsa anode the formation of cl followed the same trend as with the pt anode until 2 h electrolysis from this time the chloride concentration slightly decreased as a consequence of its oxidation to active chlorine species on the anode surface this fact was corroborated by the formation of clo3 almost from the beginning of the reaction which implies the previous generation of clo and clo2 and therefore the oxidation of cl the release of chloride was faster in the bdd cf cell as a result of the faster lindane oxidation in the presence of the bdd anode fig 1a the maximum value of cl 5 mg l 1 was reached at 30 min electrolysis once generated chlorides are rapidly oxidized into the other chlorine species by the indirect action of m oh eqs in this case the chlorate anion and hence clo and clo2 appeared practically from the beginning of the reaction this anion achieved its maximum concentration value at 2 h of electrolysis afterwards its concentration decreased progressively giving rise to the formation of clo4 perchlorate was detected from 60 min of electrolysis 0 87 mg l 1 and its concentration was always increasing until reaching 3 83 mg l 1 at the end of the treatment the effect of oxidation mediated by active chlorine species clo hclo and cl2 did not bring a positive effect on the mineralization efficiency when using the dsa anode in this case toc removal was lower than that obtained with the pt cf system the influence of chloride concentration on the electrooxidation of leachates has been studied concluding that indirect oxidation using chloride hypochlorite requires a high chloride concentration typically larger than 3000 mg l 1 deng and englehardt 2007 chen 2004 therefore although the active chlorine species formed in the presence of dsa clo hclo and cl2 showed little effect on lindane oxidation rate first min of reaction they were not strong enough to oxidize lindane intermediates and carboxylic acids possibly formed in the subsequent steps of the treatment the oxidation power of all these species is significantly lower than that of m oh from their standard reduction potentials moreover the oxidation of chloride by m oh to give the oxygenated chlorine anions clo clo2 clo3 and clo4 negatively affects the mineralization efficiency of the process consuming current density unproductively this fact is also applicable to the bdd cf system for large industrial applications the treatment cost of the process is a very important parameter labiadh et al 2015 in order to evaluate the economic factors the specific energy consumption per unit toc mass removed ectoc in kwh gtoc 1 for each trial was determined by means of the following expression brillas et al 2009 13 e c t o c e c e l l i t v δ t o c where e cell is the average cell voltage v i is the applied current a t is the electrolysis time h v is the solution volume l and δtoc is the experimental toc decay mg l 1 reached at time t as can be seen in fig 3 in general ectoc increased with the toc removal degree as a consequence of the generation of less oxidizable compounds such as carboxylic acids with the progression of the mineralization process panizza and cerisola 2009 sirés and brillas 2012 sirés et al 2014 the results of this figure indicate that the mineralization of lindane solution during electrooxidation using the pt and dsa anodes consumed two and four times more energy respectively than the bdd anode moreover these anodes also gave lower toc removal performance under the same operating conditions 60 and 40 respectively vs 80 for bdd at 6 h in summary the bdd anode exhibited the best performance both in oxidation power and mineralization degree and energy consumption therefore it was selected as the most suitable anode for following studies 3 1 2 influence of the cathode materials on electrooxidation of lindane the role of the different cathodes is shown in fig 1c and d all of them with the bdd anode no differences were found either in lindane degradation or mineralization when cf and cs cathodes were used however the ss cathode led to lower lindane oxidation and mineralization degrees this fact could be related to the generation of hydrogen peroxide on the cathode surface from the two electron reduction of oxygen when cf and cs are used eq 14 the efficiency of h2o2 electrogeneration depends on the contact between cathode oxygen and water for this reason three dimensional electrodes of high specific surface area such as porous carbonaceous materials are preferred this process is also named ao h2o2 anodic oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 moreira et al 2017 14 o2 2 h 2 e h2o2 an additional experiment was carried out by adding an excess of h2o2 100 mg l 1 to a lindane solution 10 mg l 1 without current density and negligible pollutant and toc conversion during 6 h electrolysis time were obtained fig 1 supplementary material therefore it can be deduced that h2o2 by itself was not active enough at 25 c to oxidize lindane h2o2 itself e 1 77 v she is able to attack reduced sulfur compounds cyanides and some organics such as aldehydes formic acid and some nitroorganic and sulfoorganic compounds moreira et al 2017 however h2o2 generated on the cathode surface can be oxidized on the anode surface giving rise the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals ooh eq 15 oturan et al 2013 moreira et al 2017 e 1 70 v she which can also contribute to the oxidation of lindane and its primary intermediates 15 h2o2 h ooh e regarding the active chlorine species formed with different cathodes small differences were obtained as can be seen in fig 2c in all cases a maximum value of cl was obtained at 60 min electrolysis time indicating that this species is further oxidized on the anode by direct electron transfer or by m oh the higher concentration of clo3 determined in the presence of cs can be related to its very low oxidation to the clo4 ion thus the higher oxidation rate of clo3 to clo4 in the case of cf and cs cathodes could be explained by the probable contribution of h2o2 formed in the presence of these cathodes regarding the energy consumption per unit toc mass removed the ss cathode exhibited high ectoc values compared with the cf and cs cathodes these results could be explained by the longer electrolysis time required for the removal of an equivalent toc value and also by the higher cell voltage developed in this case cells with cf and cs led to almost identical results in terms of ectoc values however it is worth noting that cf is more stable mechanically more resistant and easier to handle thus this cathode was selected as the most suitable for further lindane oxidation mineralization experiments 3 2 change of solution ph the change of ph was monitored over the course of electrooxidation of lindane for all the trials above cited the results showed that ph decreased during electrolysis especially more quickly during the first 30 min until reaching a value of between 3 and 3 5 at the end of the experiments fig sm 2 the ph drop is due to i the release of h to the reaction medium during the mineralization process according to eq 4 nienow et al 2008 ii the formation of short chain carboxylic acids that provide a ph value close to 3 to the solution these acids constitute the residual toc remaining at the end of treatment and iii the progressive oxidation of chloride ions according to the reactions 9 12 generating h once bdd and cf were selected as the most suitable electrodes the influence of the initial ph was evaluated for this purpose an experiment at initial ph 3 h2so4 1 m was performed at 400 ma with the bdd cf cell and the results were compared with those of the experiment carried out at a natural solution ph of 6 5 the other operating conditions were maintained constant the results are shown in fig sm 3 and demonstrated very slight differences in lindane electrooxidation and mineralization therefore natural ph was selected for further experiments 3 3 effect of current density on electrooxidation of lindane the applied current and therefore current density is the main key factor governing the effectiveness of the electrooxidation processes because it regulates the amount of m oh that oxidizes organic matter present in the solution up to mineralization brillas et al 2009 sirés et al 2014 to check the influence of this parameter on lindane oxidation and mineralization current densities ranging from 2 08 to 16 67 ma cm 2 were applied to the bdd cf cell maintaining the other parameters constant the potential difference of the cell increased with the current density fig sm 4 and remained constant during electrolysis indicating the absence of formation of non conductive layers on the surface of the electrodes and corrosion of the electrodes materials during electrooxidation experiments canizares et al 2007 2009 3 3 1 oxidative degradation of lindane lindane concentration underwent a gradual decay during electrolysis as a function of current density as it can be seen in fig 4 a an increase in current density led to an increase in lindane oxidation rate due to the higher production of m oh thereafter lindane conversions of 35 52 70 and 80 at 2 08 4 17 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 respectively were achieved at 6 min of electrolysis lindane electrooxidation follows a pseudo first order reaction which is fairly common in other aops for lindane degradation such as photocatalysis khaydarov et al 2013 the fenton process begum et al 2014 the photo fenton process nitoi et al 2013 ozonation begum and gautam 2012 and activated persulfate khan et al 2016 the corresponding kinetic data are plotted in fig 4b and the relationship between the apparent rate constant k app calculated from the slope of the resulting straight lines following pseudo first order kinetic analysis and the current density is represented in the inset of fig 4b k app values increased almost linearly with current density up to 8 33 ma cm 2 above this value there were no significant improvements while higher energy consumptions were required therefore regarding lindane degradation a current density of 8 33 ma cm 2 can be considered the optimum value for lindane degradation in the bdd cf cell 3 3 2 mineralization of lindane solution change of solution toc during electrooxidation at different current densities is depicted in fig 5 as expected the higher the current density the higher the mineralization rate when working at 16 67 ma cm 2 a toc conversion of 70 was achieved at 2 h electrolysis time while at 2 08 ma cm 2 only 40 of toc depletion was obtained the mineralization current efficiency mce was calculated for each experiment following eq 16 brillas et al 2009 borràs et al 2010 16 m c e n f v δ t o c 4 32 10 7 m i t 100 where n is the number of electrons consumed per lindane molecule 24 considering its complete mineralization eq 4 f is the faraday constant 96487 c mol 1 m is the number of carbon atoms of lindane 6 and 4 32 10 7 is the conversion factor to homogenize the units 3600 s h 1 12000 mg c mol 1 fig 6 a and b collect the effect of current density on mce and ec per percentage of toc removed mce decreased progressively with electrolysis time as result of the generation of more recalcitrant compounds such as carboxylic acids and the consequent loss of organic matter brillas et al 2009 sirés et al 2014 on the other hand this parameter increased as the current density decreased thus mce was 5 times higher at 2 08 ma cm 2 than at 16 67 ma cm 2 this decay is typical in eaops barhoumi et al 2015 and can be explained by the increase of rate of parasitic reactions due to the excess of hydroxyl radicals such as dimerization of m oh and the loss of energy consumed in side reactions such as h2 production on the cathode it should be noted that mce values in all cases were quite low 1 2 as a consequence of the low initial toc concentration 2 45 mg l 1 regarding the change of ectoc it slightly increased with low toc removal values while becoming exponential for higher toc removals 70 making the process much more expensive mainly at 16 67 ma cm 2 this behavior can be also explained by i the formation of more refractory products such as short chain carboxylic acids which are difficult to oxidize intermediates and by ii a decrease in the organic carbon content of the solution which promotes the enhancement of parasitic reactions barhoumi et al 2015 labiadh et al 2015 the lowest energy consumption was achieved at 2 08 ma cm 2 as expected by the lower cell potential fig sm 4 this current density leading also to the highest mce value fig 6a in contrast the energy consumption increased significantly reaching much higher values for the experiment carried out at 16 67 ma cm 2 in this trial the ectoc for 80 toc removal reached 60 kwh g toc 1 being more than two times higher 25 kwh gtoc 1 than that consumed at 8 33 ma cm 2 for the same toc removal rate according to these results 8 33 ma cm 2 was the best current density value that could be used in the electrooxidation of lindane for an effective mineralization finally no differences in terms of ph were found at the end of the experiments these values being between 3 1 and 3 45 for the different current densities tested 3 3 3 dechlorination of lindane during electrooxidation chloride appeared from the beginning of the treatment the release of this anion to the solution was proportional to the extent of the lindane oxidation process therefore the concentration of cl in the reaction media increased with current density in the early stages of reaction and reached the maximum value at about 15 min for the high current density values of 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 fig 7 a on the other hand once generated cl was oxidized at the bdd anode surface by direct electron transfer or by bdd oh to cl2 and further to other active chlorine species eqs therefore its concentration decreased after 15 min electrolysis this decrease was greater at higher current densities for instance the maximum concentration of cl 3 7 mg l 1 attained after 15 min of electrolysis decreased until reaching 0 4 and 0 2 mg l 1 for 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 respectively at the end of treatment the concentration of clo3 eqs 10 and 12 the second most abundant chlorine species fig 7b increased with electrolysis time and current density to reach a maximum at 2 and 1 h of electrolysis in the experiments carried out at 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 respectively while clo2 appeared only in trace amounts from this moment clo3 decreased as a consequence of its oxidation to clo4 the concentration of which increased to the end of the experiment when working with current densities of 2 08 and 4 17 ma cm 2 the change of clo3 with electrolysis time always increased since these current density values were not enough for its oxidation to clo4 summing up the measured chlorine ions cl clo3 and clo4 it is possible to quantify up to 80 of total chlorine from lindane the remaining percentage is attributed to the formation of other unmeasured chlorinated ions such as clo and to a lesser extent to the formation of chlorinated carboxylic acids such as chloroacetic acid at a concentration below the detection limit 3 4 product identification and oxidation pathway as previously commented lindane oxidation was much faster than its mineralization see figs 4 and 5 indicating the formation of intermediate products prior to its conversion to co2 moreover there was also a delay between lindane oxidation and the release of chlorides to the reaction medium see figs 4 and 7 which suggests the formation of chlorinated intermediates in the early stages of the process to understand the reaction mechanism of lindane electrooxidation and establish the oxidation reaction pathway an attempt to identify the different oxidation intermediates was made in order to facilitate intermediate identification electrolysis experiments were carried out at the lowest current density of 2 08 ma cm 2 at this current density the lindane oxidation rate is slow and the accumulation of intermediates is favored because of their low degradation rates identification of intermediates was performed by gc ms after liquid solid phase extraction reversed phase hplc and ion exclusion hplc analyses the identification of lindane intermediates by gc ms was assessed with the aid of the nist database library and by hplc from comparison of their retention times and uv vis spectrum with those of standard compounds seven chlorobenzenes chlorobenzene 1 2 and 1 4 dichlorobenzene 1 3 5 and 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 3 5 and 1 2 4 5 tetrachlorobenzene two chlorocyclohexenes tetrachlorocyclohexene and pentachlorocyclohexene two chlorophenols 2 4 dichlorophenol 1 2 4 trichlorophenol and hydroxyquinol were identified in trace amounts from the beginning of the reaction from 5 to 60 min at 100 ma the formation of a great variety of intermediates prior to mineralization suggests a complex mechanism of degradation in which several processes i e chlorination dechlorination hydrogenation dehydrogenation hydroxylation etc take place at about the same time in parallel and serial reactions in the first place chlorine and hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the cl c h groups constituting the lindane molecule forming penta and tetrachlorocyclohexene wacławek et al 2016 the predominant intermediate compounds in terms of peak area chlorobenzenes could be formed through progressive reductive dechlorination of these by products resulting in less substituted chlorobenzenes zinovyev et al 2004 simultaneously these compounds could be attacked by oh leading to the formation of hydroxylated compounds such as 2 4 dichlorophenol 1 2 4 trichlorophenol and hydroxyquinol all these compounds are more susceptible to attack by oh than lindane oturan and aaron 2014 as the addition of oh is more favored on the aromatic ring than the abstraction of the hydrogen atom from lindane non aromatic structure and the absence of a double bond accordingly these cyclic compounds disappeared from relatively short electrolysis times between 15 and 60 min after which time some carboxylic acids succinic oxalic acetic and formic acids were detected as a result of ring cleavage reactions carboxylic acids are finally transformed into co2 and water brillas et al 2009 among low molecular weight organic compounds formic acid was the most abundant with a maximum concentration of 1 1 mg l 1 at 60 min decreasing subsequently to 0 15 mg l 1 at the end of the electrochemical treatment it was the only organic compound identified at the final electrolysis time of 6 h it has to be noted that chlorine atoms were released in subsequent stages as chloride ions on the basis of the above results a simplified and plausible reaction pathway for lindane electrooxidation with the bdd cf system has been established fig 8 the identified compounds have been grouped attending to their nature into cyclic chlorinated by products cyclic hydroxylated by products and carboxylic acids the main reactions involved in lindane electrooxidation are dechlorination and hydroxylation of the pollutant and its by products followed by c c bond cleavage the attack by bdd oh on the chlorine positions of lindane results in replacement of these atoms with hydroxyl groups on the six carbon ring further attack leads to the rupture of the c c bonds and therefore ring opening followed by oxidation to short chain carboxylic acids oturan et al 2008 almeida et al 2011 el ghenymy et al 2014 data obtained from different analyses are consistent with the final products of the proposed pathway 4 conclusions this study reports for the first time the effective degradation of lindane by an electrochemical advanced oxidation process which was shown to be a highly efficient technology for the oxidation of lindane and the mineralization of its aqueous solution the best results taking into account lindane oxidation mineralization of its aqueous solution and cost effectiveness were obtained by using the bdd anode compared to the other anodes tested i e pt and dsa regarding the cathodic material cf was the most convenient cathode due to the lowest specific energy consumption per unit toc mass removed in addition to its high stability and greater ease of handling compared to the ss and cs cathode materials a current density of 8 33 ma cm 2 was found to be the best value for complete lindane oxidation at about 10 min resulting in a high mineralization degree 80 at 4 h and a relatively low energy consumption 15 kwh gtoc 1 the oxidative lindane degradation by in situ generated hydroxyl radicals followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics a plausible reaction pathway for lindane oxidation by m oh has been proposed based on the identified chlorinated and hydroxylated intermediates and the resulting short chain carboxylic acids chlorine atoms were mineralized to chloride ions in a first stage and then progressively oxidized to active chlorine species during the electrolysis acknowledgments the authors acknowledge financial support from the comunidad autonoma

dimensionally stable anode dsa and boron doped diamond bdd and cathodic carbon sponge cs carbon felt cf and stainless steel ss materials on lindane electrooxidation and mineralization were

bdd carbon felt 1 introduction organochlorine pesticides ocps represent a major source of emerging water pollutants in recent decades usman et al 2014 khan et al 2017a among the ocps lindane the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch was widely used as a broad spectrum insecticide in agriculture and for public health purposes since the second world war until the 1990s wang et al 2009 chang et al 2011 as a result of its intense use lindane residues a mixture of α β γ δ and ε hch isomers have been detected worldwide ultimately entering into the human body through food chains behrooz et al 2009 the hchs isomers are among the most ubiquitous organochlorine pesticides and are easily found in the environment they can be detected in real samples in a quite broad range from ng l 1 in natural water world health organization 2004 to near its maximum solubility in water 10 mg l 1 when polluted water comes directly from the washing of the solid product hch residues were often stockpiled in open piles or by the dissolution of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl of these compounds these pesticides are also bioaccumulative and can enter the food chain to reach and accumulate in human and animal tissues as a consequence of its high toxicity and long persistence lindane presents potential health risks to humans skin irritation dizziness headaches diarrhea nausea vomiting convulsions and even death and animals heusinkveld et al 2010 it was reported to be neurotoxic a potential carcinogen and teratogen by the environmental protection agency epa and the world health organization who joo and zhao 2008 therefore the concern for these pollutants has grown exponentially in recent years resulting finally in lindane inclusion along with α and β hch in the list of persistent organic pollutants pops in the stockholm convention of 2009 vijgen et al 2011 the use of lindane has been restricted in many european countries as well as in the united states and canada but it is still being used elsewhere khan et al 2017a and many landfills and other sites remain polluted by these compounds dutchak et al 2004 yang et al 2010 chang et al 2011 therefore finding a solution for lindane decontamination has become a priority for the scientific community in recent years several methods including conventional techniques such as incineration peng et al 2015 biological treatments camacho pérez et al 2012 chemical oxidation usman et al 2014 and reduction dominguez et al 2016 have been used for lindane degradation in water or soil among the different processes employed for water treatment advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as promising technologies involving the in situ production of strong oxidants mainly hydroxyl radicals oh at ambient pressure and temperature conditions andreozzi et al 1999 oturan and aaron 2014 this strong oxidant has a high standard reduction potential e 2 80 v she reacting with organic compounds and giving unselective mineralization to co2 h2o and inorganic ions unfortunately lindane oxidation entails serious difficulties due to the intrinsic characteristics of the molecule it was already reported that lindane is less prone to oxidation than other organochloride compounds due to its non aromatic and saturated structure and the absence of a double bond dionysiou et al 2000 moreover the presence of electron withdrawing chlorine groups in its molecular structure makes lindane even more resistant towards oxidation by oh in this sense and due to the difficulty of the challenge various aops have been tested for lindane degradation ozonation begum and gautam 2012 activated oxone wacławek et al 2016 activated persulfate peng et al 2015 the fenton process usman et al 2014 photolysis grannas et al 2012 and mainly

surprisingly electrochemical advanced processes eaops have been scarcely used for lindane removal from water eaops are environmentally friendly emerging methods for the decontamination of wastewaters

interesting results however the electrooxidation also called anodic oxidation ao process the most common electrochemical method for the treatment of organic pollutants due to its versatility and ease of scalability martínez huitle and brillas 2009 vasudevan and oturan 2014 garcia segura et al 2018 has not yet been tested for the treatment of lindane wastewater ao is a clean process using only electrons as a reagent without the addition of chemicals to generate the oxidant species oh in a wide range of ph conditions rodrigo et al 2001 panizza and cerisola 2009 de araújo et al 2014 in ao

chaplin 2014 1 m h2o m oh h e 2 organic pollutants m oh m co2 h2o inorganic ions where m oh indicates the adsorbed hydroxyl radical at the anode surface eq 2 the kinetics and efficiency of organic pollutant degradation in this process are mainly governed by the electrocatalytic properties of the anode material garcia segura et al 2018 and the applied current that governs the concentration and activity of heterogeneous oh formed on its surface in this paper the oxidative degradation of lindane and the mineralization of its aqueous solution was studied for the first time by the ao process using three of the most common anodes in eaops pt dsa dimensionally stable anode and bdd boron doped diamond brillas et al 2009 sopaj et al 2016 the role of the cathodic material such as carbon felt cf carbon sponge cs and stainless steel ss was also investigated the influence of current density the most determinant parameter in eaops was optimized for efficient lindane degradation finally based on the oxidation reaction intermediates identified during electrolysis a plausible degradation pathway was proposed for lindane electrooxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents synthetic lindane solution was prepared by dissolving lindane fluka in milli q water 10 mg l 1 and shaking until the complete dissolution of the pollutant which was checked by toc total organic carbon measurements corresponding to 2 45 mg l 1 working standard solutions of lindane c8h5ko4 nacalai tesque nacl naclo3 and naclo4 sigma aldrich were prepared for gas chromatography mass spectrometry cg ms toc and ionic chromatography ic calibration curves respectively additional standard solutions of chlorinated compounds hydroxylated compounds and carboxylic acids were also prepared in order to identify the reaction intermediates of lindane electrooxidation other reagents analytical grade used in the present work were c3h6o acetone sigma aldrich na2so4 sigma aldrich na2co3 riedel de häen nahco3 fluka ch3oh and h2so4 sigma aldrich all the solutions were prepared with high purity water obtained from a millipore direct q system with resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c 2 2 electrochemical experiments although the concentration of lindane usually found in real effluents is significantly lower experiments were carried out using lindane solutions at its solubility limit 10 mg l 1 in order to facilitate its measurement determination of toc abatement the release of chloride ions and the intermediate compounds generated during the electrochemical process electrochemical experiments were performed over 6 h in an undivided cylindrical glass cell with a volume capacity of 230 ml at room temperature 25 1 c and at the natural ph of lindane solution ph0 6 5 a 3d 90 cm2 cf 18 0 cm 5 0 cm 0 5 cm from mersen france was used as the cathode in standard experiments it was placed on the inner wall of the cell covering the total internal perimeter the anode commonly used was a 24 cm2 bdd film on a niobium support from condias gmbh germany centered in the electrolytic cell preliminary experiments were performed in order to select the most suitable electrodes for lindane degradation and mineralization pt 24 cm2 from goodfellow france and dsa ti ruo2 iro2 24 cm2 from baoji xinyu guangjidian limited liability company china were also tested as anode materials while 21 cm2 cs 6 cm 3 5 cm

cathode pt cf pt anode cf cathode dsa cf dsa anode cf cathode bdd cs bdd anode cs cathode and bdd ss bdd anode ss cathode sodium sulfate na2so4 50 mm was added to the cell as the background electrolyte in order to increase solution conductivity lindane solution was continuously agitated by a magnetic stirrer 250 rpm to ensure an adequate mass transfer to from electrodes and the reactor was capped to avoid water evaporation and organics volatilization during the electrolysis period once the electrode materials had been selected a range of constant currents from 100 to 800 ma which correspond to current densities from 2 08 to 16 66 ma cm 2 taking into account the exposed anode surface 48 cm2 was applied to the electrochemical cell the current intensity and the potential difference of the cell were measured and displayed continuously throughout electrolysis by using a dc power supply hameg instruments hm 8040 3 the change of solution ph during electrolysis was monitored using a cyberscan ph1500 device from eutech instruments all the experiments were performed in duplicate and the standard deviation was lower than 5 in all cases 2 3 analytical methods lindane was identified and quantified by means of gc ms analyses prior to analyses lindane and its oxidation intermediates in aqueous phase were extracted by using solid phase cartridges c18 e 55 μm 70 å phenomenex and eluted with the same volume of acetone other solvents such as n hexane dichloromethane and ethyl acetate were also tested for the extraction process an spe varian vacuum manifold 20 port model and a knf vacuum pump were used cartridges were preconditioned with acetone and the aqueous matrix of the sample prior to acetone elution cartridges were vacuum dried 10 mmhg for 10 min to remove any trace of water in order to minimize experimental error in lindane quantification 4 methylcyclohexanone was added to the extracted samples as the internal standard compound istd lindane calibration in the range 0 025 10 mg l 1 was previously performed following the same extraction procedure and compared with known concentrations of lindane directly dissolved in acetone the percentage of lindane recovery after the extraction process was covered between 90 and 100 the thermo fisher scientific trace 1300 isq gc ms used in this work was equipped with a tg 5 ms column helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 2 ml min 1 the gc injection port temperature was set at 250 c extracted samples 3 μl were manually injected the program temperature started at 40 c held for 2 min followed by a temperature ramp of 10 c min 1 to 280 c and then held constant for 4 min analysis was carried out in ei mode 70 ev the decay in toc solution was measured by a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer reproducible toc values with an accuracy of 2 were determined using the non purgeable organic carbon method calibration was achieved with potassium hydrogen phthalate solutions aromatic intermediates were identified by hplc using a merck hitachi lachrom liquid chromatograph equipped with an l 2310 pump fitted with a reverse phase purospher rp 18 5 μm 25 cm 4 6 mm i d column and coupled with an l 2400 uv detector set at λ 238 nm the temperature of the column was maintained constant at 40 c the injection volume was 20 μl and the isocratic eluent 30 70 methanol water was pumped to the system at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 generated carboxylic acids were identified by ion exclusion hplc using a merck hitachi lachrom liquid chromatography system equipped with an l 7100 pump fitted with a supelcogel h 9 μm 25 cm 4 6 mm column at room temperature and coupled with a dad uv l 7455 detector set at λ 220 nm using 1 h2so4 at 0 2 ml min 1 as the mobile phase the dechlorination degree was evaluated in terms of chloride ions released to the solution during electrolysis which were determined by ic 930 compact ic flex metrohm with anionic chemical suppression equipped with a conductivity detector and an autosampler 910 ic autosampler plus an anionic exchanger column metrosep a supp5 250 4 25 cm length 4 mm diameter was used as the stationary phase and 0 7 ml min 1 of an aqueous solution 3 2 mm of na2co3 and 1 mm of nahco3 as the mobile phase other chlorine species such as chlorate and perchlorate ions during electrolysis were also followed by this technique 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of electrode materials on lindane degradation the choice of electrode material determines the efficiency of electrooxidation process as well as the potential formation of toxic by products radjenovic and sedlak 2015 3 1 1 anode materials the time course of lindane concentration and solution toc with different anode materials tested under selected operating conditions is shown in fig 1 a and b respectively in these experiments the same cathode cf was used for the sake of comparison a control experiment without current intensity was also performed obtaining negligible changes both in pollutant concentration and toc value at 6 h data not shown keeping the solution volume constant which was also checked during electrochemical experiments therefore water evaporation and or lindane adsorption on the electrodes during the treatment time were insignificant it was observed that lindane degradation was relatively fast in the worst case 30 min was enough to completely degrade the pollutant with a current density of 8 33 ma cm 2 however different oxidation rates were obtained depending on the anode used bdd being the most efficient anode during the electrooxidation process organic compounds are mainly oxidized by indirect oxidation via oxidants generated on the anode surface such as heterogeneous oh m oh the second most powerful oxidant after fluorine panizza and cerisola 2009 as shown in fig 1 oxidative degradation of lindane and mineralization of its solution was quicker with a bdd anode than with pt and dsa anodes this more efficient oxidation power of the bdd anode could be related to its greater o2 evolution overvoltage compared to the active anodes pt and dsa panizza and cerisola 2005 brillas et al 2009 barhoumi et al 2015 thus the bdd anode produced a higher amount of reactive bdd oh from the electrochemical oxidation of water eq 1 and minimized the production of competitive reactions eq 3 that consume the radical species leading to oxygen production garcia segura et al 2018 3 2m oh 2 m o2 2 h 2 e additionally the bdd oh is weakly adsorbed physisorption on the anode surface thus being easily available for oxidation of organics present in the vicinity of the anode in contrast pt and dsa anodes present relatively weak o2 evolution overpotential with chemisorbed m oh which is less mobile to efficiently oxidize organic pollutants oturan et al 2013 moreover the active anodes are capable of oxidizing organics into more biodegradable molecules but they cannot achieve their complete transformation into carbon dioxide garcia segura et al 2018 the dsa anode led to a slightly higher lindane oxidation rate than the pt anode fig 1a probably due to the formation of hypochlorite on the anode surface from the oxidation of chloride ions these coming from lindane degradation according to its mineralization reaction eq 4 4 c6h6cl6 12 h2o 6 co2 6 cl 30 h 24 e the oxidation of chloride anions on the anode surface by direct electrooxidation and or by the indirect action of reactive oxygen species m oh the dsa and to a greater extent the bdd anodes leads to the formation of active chlorine species eqs 5 to 7 which are powerful oxidants that can play an important role in the oxidation of organics via mediated oxidation deng and englehardt 2007 canizares et al 2009 panizza and cerisola 2009 randazzo et al 2011 brillas and martínez huitle 2015 these chlorine species are the main indirect oxidation agents employed in wastewater treatment moreira et al 2017 firstly chloride is oxidized on the anode surface releasing chlorine eq 5 when the electrogenerated chlorine diffuses away from the anode it is quickly hydrolyzed yielding hypochlorous acid hclo and chloride by disproportionation eq 6 hclo is in equilibrium with the hypochlorite ion clo with pka 7 55 eq 7 the predominance of these species is a function of solution ph clo ph above 7 hclo from ph 7 to 3 and cl2 ph below 3 respectively moreira et al 2017 it should be noted that the starting ph of the lindane solution 6 5 rapidly decreased in all cases to values of about ph 3 3 5 after 30 min of electrolysis see sub section 3 2 thus hypochlorous acid predominates during the whole process otherwise the standard reduction potential of cl2 aq e 1 36 v she and hclo e 1 49 v she is considerably higher than clo e 0 89 v she indicating that oxidation of organics mediated by chlorine active species is favored under acidic ph conditions moreira et al 2017 garcia segura et al 2018 5 2 cl cl2 aq 2 e 6 cl2 aq h2o hclo cl h 7 hclo h clo less active chlorine species chlorite chlorate and perchlorate anions e 1 v she in all cases can be simultaneously generated by the action of m oh according to the following equations eqs 8 11 hubler et al 2014 this phenomenon is especially important in the case of non active anodes garcia segura et al 2018 such as bdd when using bdd anodes chloride completely transformed to form perchlorate in long term discontinuous experiments and or if large current charges were passed through the cell bergmann et al 2009 2011 8 cl m oh clo 2 h 9 clo m oh clo2 2 h 10 clo2 m oh clo3 2 h 11 clo3 m oh clo4 2 h the latter generated chlorine species clo3 and clo4 are unwanted by products since they are hydroxyl radical consuming and are not able to oxidize organics in solution garcia segura et al 2015 moreover these species considered noxious especially perchlorate are of great concern as inorganic pollutants in water sources van wijk et al 1998 ting and steinmaus 2013 garcia segura et al 2018 water effluents containing greater amounts of chloride ions favor the generation of high concentrations of these species limiting their electrochemical treatment the amount of chlorinated organic by products may be minimized by applying a short electrolysis time while targeting a suitable degree of removal of contaminants if these compounds chlorate perchlorate are formed in concentrations higher than those allowed they could be removed by adsorption on activated carbon ion exchange membrane filtration and microbial chemical or electrochemical reduction radjenovic and sedlak 2015 on the other hand it should be noted that clo4 poses no problem when it is generated in low or moderate concentrations the maximum concentration of chlorine in this study was that from the lindane molecule 7 43 mg l 1 moreover its salts are even used as an electrolyte in eaops diagne et al 2007 hubler et al 2014 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 on the other hand a study concerning the toxicity of chlorate on selected species of algae bacteria and fungi confirmed that chlorate is toxic only to brown algae and not to species of other ecologically important taxa van wijk et al 1998 the change of cl and clo3 ion concentrations the most important chlorine species identified in terms of concentration during lindane electrooxidation with the different electrodes tested was monitored by ic and results are shown in fig 2 with regard to the other chlorine species clo could not be measured clo2 appeared only in trace amounts below the detection limit and clo4 was only detected when the bdd anode was used radjenovic and sedlak 2015 a possible explanation to justify the detection of clo2 in such low concentrations is the direct electrochemical conversion of hypochlorous acid to chlorate ion according to eq 12 moreira et al 2017 12 6 hclo 3 h2o 2 clo3 4 cl 12 h 1 5 o2 6 e pt despite being an active anode seems to be the only one unable to oxidize chlorides eqs 5 and 8 the concentration of cl in the pt cf cell increased until reaching a maximum value of around 7 mg l 1 after 2 h electrolysis time from this point the concentration of chlorides in the reaction medium remained constant this value represents almost 95 of the theoretical amount of chlorine initially present in lindane 7 43 mg l 1 according to eq 4 suggesting its complete dechlorination the slight mismatch 5 may be due to the analytical errors or presence of some organochlorines that remain in the solution since the mineralization achieved was not total regarding the dsa anode the formation of cl followed the same trend as with the pt anode until 2 h electrolysis from this time the chloride concentration slightly decreased as a consequence of its oxidation to active chlorine species on the anode surface this fact was corroborated by the formation of clo3 almost from the beginning of the reaction which implies the previous generation of clo and clo2 and therefore the oxidation of cl the release of chloride was faster in the bdd cf cell as a result of the faster lindane oxidation in the presence of the bdd anode fig 1a the maximum value of cl 5 mg l 1 was reached at 30 min electrolysis once generated chlorides are rapidly oxidized into the other chlorine species by the indirect action of m oh eqs in this case the chlorate anion and hence clo and clo2 appeared practically from the beginning of the reaction this anion achieved its maximum concentration value at 2 h of electrolysis afterwards its concentration decreased progressively giving rise to the formation of clo4 perchlorate was detected from 60 min of electrolysis 0 87 mg l 1 and its concentration was always increasing until reaching 3 83 mg l 1 at the end of the treatment the effect of oxidation mediated by active chlorine species clo hclo and cl2 did not bring a positive effect on the mineralization efficiency when using the dsa anode in this case toc removal was lower than that obtained with the pt cf system the influence of chloride concentration on the electrooxidation of leachates has been studied concluding that indirect oxidation using chloride hypochlorite requires a high chloride concentration typically larger than 3000 mg l 1 deng and englehardt 2007 chen 2004 therefore although the active chlorine species formed in the presence of dsa clo hclo and cl2 showed little effect on lindane oxidation rate first min of reaction they were not strong enough to oxidize lindane intermediates and carboxylic acids possibly formed in the subsequent steps of the treatment the oxidation power of all these species is significantly lower than that of m oh from their standard reduction potentials moreover the oxidation of chloride by m oh to give the oxygenated chlorine anions clo clo2 clo3 and clo4 negatively affects the mineralization efficiency of the process consuming current density unproductively this fact is also applicable to the bdd cf system for large industrial applications the treatment cost of the process is a very important parameter labiadh et al 2015 in order to evaluate the economic factors the specific energy consumption per unit toc mass removed ectoc in kwh gtoc 1 for each trial was determined by means of the following expression brillas et al 2009 13 e c t o c e c e l l i t v δ t o c where e cell is the average cell voltage v i is the applied current a t is the electrolysis time h v is the solution volume l and δtoc is the experimental toc decay mg l 1 reached at time t as can be seen in fig 3 in general ectoc increased with the toc removal degree as a consequence of the generation of less oxidizable compounds such as carboxylic acids with the progression of the mineralization process panizza and cerisola 2009 sirés and brillas 2012 sirés et al 2014 the results of this figure indicate that the mineralization of lindane solution during electrooxidation using the pt and dsa anodes consumed two and four times more energy respectively than the bdd anode moreover these anodes also gave lower toc removal performance under the same operating conditions 60 and 40 respectively vs 80 for bdd at 6 h in summary the bdd anode exhibited the best performance both in oxidation power and mineralization degree and energy consumption therefore it was selected as the most suitable anode for following studies 3 1 2 influence of the cathode materials on electrooxidation of lindane the role of the different cathodes is shown in fig 1c and d all of them with the bdd anode no differences were found either in lindane degradation or mineralization when cf and cs cathodes were used however the ss cathode led to lower lindane oxidation and mineralization degrees this fact could be related to the generation of hydrogen peroxide on the cathode surface from the two electron reduction of oxygen when cf and cs are used eq 14 the efficiency of h2o2 electrogeneration depends on the contact between cathode oxygen and water for this reason three dimensional electrodes of high specific surface area such as porous carbonaceous materials are preferred this process is also named ao h2o2 anodic oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 moreira et al 2017 14 o2 2 h 2 e h2o2 an additional experiment was carried out by adding an excess of h2o2 100 mg l 1 to a lindane solution 10 mg l 1 without current density and negligible pollutant and toc conversion during 6 h electrolysis time were obtained fig 1 supplementary material therefore it can be deduced that h2o2 by itself was not active enough at 25 c to oxidize lindane h2o2 itself e 1 77 v she is able to attack reduced sulfur compounds cyanides and some organics such as aldehydes formic acid and some nitroorganic and sulfoorganic compounds moreira et al 2017 however h2o2 generated on the cathode surface can be oxidized on the anode surface giving rise the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals ooh eq 15 oturan et al 2013 moreira et al 2017 e 1 70 v she which can also contribute to the oxidation of lindane and its primary intermediates 15 h2o2 h ooh e regarding the active chlorine species formed with different cathodes small differences were obtained as can be seen in fig 2c in all cases a maximum value of cl was obtained at 60 min electrolysis time indicating that this species is further oxidized on the anode by direct electron transfer or by m oh the higher concentration of clo3 determined in the presence of cs can be related to its very low oxidation to the clo4 ion thus the higher oxidation rate of clo3 to clo4 in the case of cf and cs cathodes could be explained by the probable contribution of h2o2 formed in the presence of these cathodes regarding the energy consumption per unit toc mass removed the ss cathode exhibited high ectoc values compared with the cf and cs cathodes these results could be explained by the longer electrolysis time required for the removal of an equivalent toc value and also by the higher cell voltage developed in this case cells with cf and cs led to almost identical results in terms of ectoc values however it is worth noting that cf is more stable mechanically more resistant and easier to handle thus this cathode was selected as the most suitable for further lindane oxidation mineralization experiments 3 2 change of solution ph the change of ph was monitored over the course of electrooxidation of lindane for all the trials above cited the results showed that ph decreased during electrolysis especially more quickly during the first 30 min until reaching a value of between 3 and 3 5 at the end of the experiments fig sm 2 the ph drop is due to i the release of h to the reaction medium during the mineralization process according to eq 4 nienow et al 2008 ii the formation of short chain carboxylic acids that provide a ph value close to 3 to the solution these acids constitute the residual toc remaining at the end of treatment and iii the progressive oxidation of chloride ions according to the reactions 9 12 generating h once bdd and cf were selected as the most suitable electrodes the influence of the initial ph was evaluated for this purpose an experiment at initial ph 3 h2so4 1 m was performed at 400 ma with the bdd cf cell and the results were compared with those of the experiment carried out at a natural solution ph of 6 5 the other operating conditions were maintained constant the results are shown in fig sm 3 and demonstrated very slight differences in lindane electrooxidation and mineralization therefore natural ph was selected for further experiments 3 3 effect of current density on electrooxidation of lindane the applied current and therefore current density is the main key factor governing the effectiveness of the electrooxidation processes because it regulates the amount of m oh that oxidizes organic matter present in the solution up to mineralization brillas et al 2009 sirés et al 2014 to check the influence of this parameter on lindane oxidation and mineralization current densities ranging from 2 08 to 16 67 ma cm 2 were applied to the bdd cf cell maintaining the other parameters constant the potential difference of the cell increased with the current density fig sm 4 and remained constant during electrolysis indicating the absence of formation of non conductive layers on the surface of the electrodes and corrosion of the electrodes materials during electrooxidation experiments canizares et al 2007 2009 3 3 1 oxidative degradation of lindane lindane concentration underwent a gradual decay during electrolysis as a function of current density as it can be seen in fig 4 a an increase in current density led to an increase in lindane oxidation rate due to the higher production of m oh thereafter lindane conversions of 35 52 70 and 80 at 2 08 4 17 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 respectively were achieved at 6 min of electrolysis lindane electrooxidation follows a pseudo first order reaction which is fairly common in other aops for lindane degradation such as photocatalysis khaydarov et al 2013 the fenton process begum et al 2014 the photo fenton process nitoi et al 2013 ozonation begum and gautam 2012 and activated persulfate khan et al 2016 the corresponding kinetic data are plotted in fig 4b and the relationship between the apparent rate constant k app calculated from the slope of the resulting straight lines following pseudo first order kinetic analysis and the current density is represented in the inset of fig 4b k app values increased almost linearly with current density up to 8 33 ma cm 2 above this value there were no significant improvements while higher energy consumptions were required therefore regarding lindane degradation a current density of 8 33 ma cm 2 can be considered the optimum value for lindane degradation in the bdd cf cell 3 3 2 mineralization of lindane solution change of solution toc during electrooxidation at different current densities is depicted in fig 5 as expected the higher the current density the higher the mineralization rate when working at 16 67 ma cm 2 a toc conversion of 70 was achieved at 2 h electrolysis time while at 2 08 ma cm 2 only 40 of toc depletion was obtained the mineralization current efficiency mce was calculated for each experiment following eq 16 brillas et al 2009 borràs et al 2010 16 m c e n f v δ t o c 4 32 10 7 m i t 100 where n is the number of electrons consumed per lindane molecule 24 considering its complete mineralization eq 4 f is the faraday constant 96487 c mol 1 m is the number of carbon atoms of lindane 6 and 4 32 10 7 is the conversion factor to homogenize the units 3600 s h 1 12000 mg c mol 1 fig 6 a and b collect the effect of current density on mce and ec per percentage of toc removed mce decreased progressively with electrolysis time as result of the generation of more recalcitrant compounds such as carboxylic acids and the consequent loss of organic matter brillas et al 2009 sirés et al 2014 on the other hand this parameter increased as the current density decreased thus mce was 5 times higher at 2 08 ma cm 2 than at 16 67 ma cm 2 this decay is typical in eaops barhoumi et al 2015 and can be explained by the increase of rate of parasitic reactions due to the excess of hydroxyl radicals such as dimerization of m oh and the loss of energy consumed in side reactions such as h2 production on the cathode it should be noted that mce values in all cases were quite low 1 2 as a consequence of the low initial toc concentration 2 45 mg l 1 regarding the change of ectoc it slightly increased with low toc removal values while becoming exponential for higher toc removals 70 making the process much more expensive mainly at 16 67 ma cm 2 this behavior can be also explained by i the formation of more refractory products such as short chain carboxylic acids which are difficult to oxidize intermediates and by ii a decrease in the organic carbon content of the solution which promotes the enhancement of parasitic reactions barhoumi et al 2015 labiadh et al 2015 the lowest energy consumption was achieved at 2 08 ma cm 2 as expected by the lower cell potential fig sm 4 this current density leading also to the highest mce value fig 6a in contrast the energy consumption increased significantly reaching much higher values for the experiment carried out at 16 67 ma cm 2 in this trial the ectoc for 80 toc removal reached 60 kwh g toc 1 being more than two times higher 25 kwh gtoc 1 than that consumed at 8 33 ma cm 2 for the same toc removal rate according to these results 8 33 ma cm 2 was the best current density value that could be used in the electrooxidation of lindane for an effective mineralization finally no differences in terms of ph were found at the end of the experiments these values being between 3 1 and 3 45 for the different current densities tested 3 3 3 dechlorination of lindane during electrooxidation chloride appeared from the beginning of the treatment the release of this anion to the solution was proportional to the extent of the lindane oxidation process therefore the concentration of cl in the reaction media increased with current density in the early stages of reaction and reached the maximum value at about 15 min for the high current density values of 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 fig 7 a on the other hand once generated cl was oxidized at the bdd anode surface by direct electron transfer or by bdd oh to cl2 and further to other active chlorine species eqs therefore its concentration decreased after 15 min electrolysis this decrease was greater at higher current densities for instance the maximum concentration of cl 3 7 mg l 1 attained after 15 min of electrolysis decreased until reaching 0 4 and 0 2 mg l 1 for 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 respectively at the end of treatment the concentration of clo3 eqs 10 and 12 the second most abundant chlorine species fig 7b increased with electrolysis time and current density to reach a maximum at 2 and 1 h of electrolysis in the experiments carried out at 8 33 and 16 67 ma cm 2 respectively while clo2 appeared only in trace amounts from this moment clo3 decreased as a consequence of its oxidation to clo4 the concentration of which increased to the end of the experiment when working with current densities of 2 08 and 4 17 ma cm 2 the change of clo3 with electrolysis time always increased since these current density values were not enough for its oxidation to clo4 summing up the measured chlorine ions cl clo3 and clo4 it is possible to quantify up to 80 of total chlorine from lindane the remaining percentage is attributed to the formation of other unmeasured chlorinated ions such as clo and to a lesser extent to the formation of chlorinated carboxylic acids such as chloroacetic acid at a concentration below the detection limit 3 4 product identification and oxidation pathway as previously commented lindane oxidation was much faster than its mineralization see figs 4 and 5 indicating the formation of intermediate products prior to its conversion to co2 moreover there was also a delay between lindane oxidation and the release of chlorides to the reaction medium see figs 4 and 7 which suggests the formation of chlorinated intermediates in the early stages of the process to understand the reaction mechanism of lindane electrooxidation and establish the oxidation reaction pathway an attempt to identify the different oxidation intermediates was made in order to facilitate intermediate identification electrolysis experiments were carried out at the lowest current density of 2 08 ma cm 2 at this current density the lindane oxidation rate is slow and the accumulation of intermediates is favored because of their low degradation rates identification of intermediates was performed by gc ms after liquid solid phase extraction reversed phase hplc and ion exclusion hplc analyses the identification of lindane intermediates by gc ms was assessed with the aid of the nist database library and by hplc from comparison of their retention times and uv vis spectrum with those of standard compounds seven chlorobenzenes chlorobenzene 1 2 and 1 4 dichlorobenzene 1 3 5 and 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 3 5 and 1 2 4 5 tetrachlorobenzene two chlorocyclohexenes tetrachlorocyclohexene and pentachlorocyclohexene two chlorophenols 2 4 dichlorophenol 1 2 4 trichlorophenol and hydroxyquinol were identified in trace amounts from the beginning of the reaction from 5 to 60 min at 100 ma the formation of a great variety of intermediates prior to mineralization suggests a complex mechanism of degradation in which several processes i e chlorination dechlorination hydrogenation dehydrogenation hydroxylation etc take place at about the same time in parallel and serial reactions in the first place chlorine and hydrogen atoms are abstracted from the cl c h groups constituting the lindane molecule forming penta and tetrachlorocyclohexene wacławek et al 2016 the predominant intermediate compounds in terms of peak area chlorobenzenes could be formed through progressive reductive dechlorination of these by products resulting in less substituted chlorobenzenes zinovyev et al 2004 simultaneously these compounds could be attacked by oh leading to the formation of hydroxylated compounds such as 2 4 dichlorophenol 1 2 4 trichlorophenol and hydroxyquinol all these compounds are more susceptible to attack by oh than lindane oturan and aaron 2014 as the addition of oh is more favored on the aromatic ring than the abstraction of the hydrogen atom from lindane non aromatic structure and the absence of a double bond accordingly these cyclic compounds disappeared from relatively short electrolysis times between 15 and 60 min after which time some carboxylic acids succinic oxalic acetic and formic acids were detected as a result of ring cleavage reactions carboxylic acids are finally transformed into co2 and water brillas et al 2009 among low molecular weight organic compounds formic acid was the most abundant with a maximum concentration of 1 1 mg l 1 at 60 min decreasing subsequently to 0 15 mg l 1 at the end of the electrochemical treatment it was the only organic compound identified at the final electrolysis time of 6 h it has to be noted that chlorine atoms were released in subsequent stages as chloride ions on the basis of the above results a simplified and plausible reaction pathway for lindane electrooxidation with the bdd cf system has been established fig 8 the identified compounds have been grouped attending to their nature into cyclic chlorinated by products cyclic hydroxylated by products and carboxylic acids the main reactions involved in lindane electrooxidation are dechlorination and hydroxylation of the pollutant and its by products followed by c c bond cleavage the attack by bdd oh on the chlorine positions of lindane results in replacement of these atoms with hydroxyl groups on the six carbon ring further attack leads to the rupture of the c c bonds and therefore ring opening followed by oxidation to short chain carboxylic acids oturan et al 2008 almeida et al 2011 el ghenymy et al 2014 data obtained from different analyses are consistent with the final products of the proposed pathway 4 conclusions this study reports for the first time the effective degradation of lindane by an electrochemical advanced oxidation process which was shown to be a highly efficient technology for the oxidation of lindane and the mineralization of its aqueous solution the best results taking into account lindane oxidation mineralization of its aqueous solution and cost effectiveness were obtained by using the bdd anode compared to the other anodes tested i e pt and dsa regarding the cathodic material cf was the most convenient cathode due to the lowest specific energy consumption per unit toc mass removed in addition to its high stability and greater ease of handling compared to the ss and cs cathode materials a current density of 8 33 ma cm 2 was found to be the best value for complete lindane oxidation at about 10 min resulting in a high mineralization degree 80 at 4 h and a relatively low energy consumption 15 kwh gtoc 1 the oxidative lindane degradation by in situ generated hydroxyl radicals followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics a plausible reaction pathway for lindane oxidation by m oh has been proposed based on the identified chlorinated and hydroxylated intermediates and the resulting short chain carboxylic acids chlorine atoms were mineralized to chloride ions in a first stage and then progressively oxidized to active chlorine species during the electrolysis acknowledgments the authors acknowledge financial support from the comunidad autonoma
