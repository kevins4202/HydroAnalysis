in the area comprises weathered rock formation whereas the deep water levels are recorded in alluvial formation deeper water level in alluvial area is due to the draining of percolated water into the deep cut nalas this type of phenomena is mostly observed in the area north and north west of tilakwada in general depth to water level is progressively increasing from northeast direction to southwest direction and reaches to maximum depth 35m bgl close to narmada river the dykes and faults in the hard rock area infra trappean and deccan trap are also play important role in controlling the water

unconfined aquifer with a no flow along the north east and south east general head boundary along northern and western side and constant head boundary along narmada river in south west of the study area the united states geological survey modular three dimensional finite difference program modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 1998 2000 was used for simulation of groundwater flow processing modflow for window version 5 3 0 a simulation software consists of graphical pre post processor was used to give input data and process the model output 3 2 model design in the model the study area is replaced by a discretized area consist of an array of nodes and associated finite difference blocks cells the nodal grid forms framework of the numerical model anderson et al 1995 andersen and woessner 1996 in the present model the block centered approach is adopted and flux boundaries are located at the edge of the block the area has been modeled as a single layer system comprising unconfined aquifer bear et al 1992 a finite difference grid superimposed fig 3 a over a 499 sq km area was designed and constructed based on the simplification of a conceptual model representing the physical properties of the groundwater system the grid developed for the present study consists of 78 columns and 53 rows forming 4134 squares grid with a constant spacing of 500m by 500m active node numbering 2082 is used to cover the study area remaining nodes about 2052 are exterior and are not considered for computation imposition of the flow boundaries and grid network on the study area leaves the area to be modeled as 475 sq km 3 3 flow characterization the area represents a single layer of unconfined aquifer basin the boundary conditions are specified for the upper surface sides and bottom of the modeled area franke et al 1987 the hydrogeologic boundaries of the basin include a topographic divides to the southeast which are represented by no groundwater flow conditions as they are believed to be topographic highs that coincide with ground water divides the north eastern boundary which are also represented as a no flow conditions except the places where aswan and men nadi enter to the model area are represented by general head boundary river boundary to the northern and western side of the area represented by a general head boundary head values along the boundary were estimated from interpolation of the depth to water level in the area the conductance term is representing the resistance to flow between the boundary and the aquifer narmada river is a perennial river and retain constant flow throughout the year except in the flood season it is observed river water level around 14 25 m above mean sea level at garudeshwar river gauging station boundary along narmada river falling south west of the area is treated as constant head at the river surface fig 3b recharge to the area occurs mainly in the form of infiltration from precipitation and rivers the sandstone and basalt have relatively low coefficients of storage from recharge at higher elevations where there are basement rocks exposed 3 4 model input parameters the finite difference model was developed by incorporating geologic data measured and inferred hydrologic data for the period of 1986 the surface elevation ranges between 31 29 m and 141 51 m above mean sea level whereas the bottom elevation ranges between 111 42 m above mean sea level and 42 04 m below mean sea level aquifer parameters that included hydraulic conductivity porosity and specific yield were assigned to each cell parameter values mostly obtained from pumping tests carried out at tube wells and open wells during field work in the area and from the previous research romani 1973 ngp 1983 org 1993 jain 1987 2010 gec 2005 different hydraulic conductivity zones are deciphered on the basis of variation in lithology and its thickness the average hydraulic conductivity value for each zone was assigned by finding the geometric mean of all values within each zone the distributions of calibrated hydraulic conductivity in the alluvial and hard rock aquifers ranges between 50 and 778 m day fig 4 a and specific yield ranges from 0 02 to 0 20 fig 4b recharge to groundwater mainly takes place from 1 infiltration from rainfall 2 stream bed percolation 3 sub surface inflow from neighboring basin 4 leakage from local surface body i e from ponds and reservoir 5 percolation of canal water applied in the field area 6 return flow percolation from groundwater applied to the fields groundwater recharges have been estimated corresponding to three agriculture crop seasons viz kharif rabi and summer and applied to the area cgwb 1995 kharif crop start from the month of june to september rabi crop in the month of october to january and summer crop fall in the month between february and may the estimated net recharge value of 31 07 mcm year was applied to alluvium sandstone and basalt hydrologic zone for the year 1986 87 the groundwater of the study area is abstracted for irrigation and domestic purposes agriculture is the main activity of the area the groundwater abstraction for irrigation activities was computed based upon the groundwater structure available in the area multiplied by the unit draft of the structure unit draft of the groundwater structure is estimated in the field groundwater draft for irrigation was computed 12 mcm during kharif 9 mcm during rabi and 2 23 mcm during summer crop seasons for the year 1986 87 apart from these domestic pumping for household needs was computed based upon population an average 70 l head day was considered as household requirement water requirement for the livestock was considered 25 l head day 4 results and discussions 4 1 model calibration and results for the purpose of calibration 1986 was chosen the base year and groundwater heads for june 1986 were used as the starting heads for steady state model calibration the water level data of 46 observation wells distributed over the study area were used first in steady state calibration followed by transient calibration the model was calibrated using initial trial and error adjustments for selected input parameters followed by statistical linear regression analysis performed by the model adjustments were made to 1 recharge 2 conductance values at the general head boundary and 3 the hydraulic conductivity field fifteen hydraulic conductivity zones fig 4a are assigned in all over the area based on the variation in lithological material contained in the aquifers alluvial deposits are assumed to be more permeable than the weathered rock formations hydraulic conductivity varies for obtaining a good match between simulated and observed heads elango 1992 sikdhar chkraborty 2017 ray et al 2020 de caro et al 2020 have also used models for devising effective management for improved sustainability of the groundwater resources the statistical analysis is performed by pmwin modeling software by presenting the scatter diagram to judge the quality of calibration results it involves variance analysis if the variance decreased then the adjustment to the input data was retained in addition to this percentage difference between measured and simulated heads were evaluated variance and root mean square error were minimized through numerous trial runs and at last a fair and good match was obtained fig 5 a transient state simulation was carried for a period of 36 stress periods for 12 years start from 1986 87 to 1997 98 one year comprises of three stress period corresponding to three agriculture crop season i e kharif rabi and summer each stress periods approximately matched with one irrigation season with an approximate duration of 4 months numbers of trial runs were made by varying hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield and recharge to groundwater within allowable limits so that a reasonably good match is obtained between computed and observed water levels the computed heads were then compared with the observed historical heads both in the form of contour map fig 5b and hydrograph of selected observation point fig 6 a b c after having adjusted the hydrogeological parameters the model was validated by running it for 48 stress periods i e 16 years 1986 87 to 2001 02 recharge and draft applied to the model for 48 stress periods model calibration redefined estimates of the hydrologic characteristics until the model behavior matched with the observed and simulated heads for the period 1997 98 to 2001 02 based on the close agreement between measured and computed heads at 42 observation wells distributed through the aquifer the transient models were considered to be satisfactorily for future prediction a study of simulated heads indicates that the highest heads are found in the eastern side and shows a marked correlation with topographic contours of the modeled area during the calibration the mean absolute difference between observed and modeled water level head of observation wells indicate the fair and good agreement in the heads wishart et al 2000 the difference is observed as low as 1 02 m for the observation wells falls in alluvium and basaltic area whereas it is 1 75 m for wells in sandstone area table 1 hydraulic heads from few observation wells failed to calibrate within reasonable differences between simulated and observed heads due to position of wells in the vicinity of hills and valleys for example uchad and soikuva in sandstone formation finally the model was run for 48 stress periods using 4 months time steps from the year 1986 87 to 2001 02 the groundwater budget of the study area gives an accounting of recharge to the basin discharge from the basin and flow between hydrogeologic units in the area modflow zone budget 1996 the continuity equation establishes that inflow equal to out flows groundwater budgeting was done and obtained flow for the last stress period february to may 2002 is illustrated in fig 7 in the budget it is observed that there was recharge of 14967 m3 day from the percolation of surface water and return seepage of irrigation applied and withdrawal from well is estimated at 37535 m3 day groundwater flow across narmada river constant head boundary is 213748 m3 day as base flow to river and get river recharge to aquifer at the rate of 93 m3 day at general head boundary ghb inflow and out flow in model area is observed and found 202487 m3 day and 44455 m3 day respectively similar kind of results have been reported by senthilkumar and elango 2004 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out and further used during model calibration to refine initial estimates of input parameters and after model calibration to determine which input parameters had the largest effect on simulated head values gnanasundar and elango 2000 senthilkumar elango 2004 2011 during a sensitivity analysis calibrated values for hydraulic conductivity specific yield recharge and conductance assigned along general head boundary condition are changed with the increments and decrements of 5 10 and 25 the magnitude of change in heads from the calibrated solution is a measure of the sensitivity of the solution to that particular parameter the results of the sensitivity analysis beckers et al 2000 are presented fig 8 a and b as the effects of the parameter change on the average measure of mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse this analysis clearly indicates that any increase or decrease of value of aquifer parameters and groundwater recharge at least 25 percentage would not drastically alter the groundwater heads the sensitivity of the conductance assigned along the general head boundary on the model was studied by varying this parameter up to 25 it was observed a drastic change in groundwater head in just varying the conductance value by 5 and automatically abrupt change in the root mean square error this clearly indicates that this aquifer system is very sensitive to conductance of the general head boundary sensitivity analysis of these parameters indicates simulated heads are most sensitive to change of conductance and some extent to other aquifer parameters and recharge 5 model forecast model developed was used to forecast the groundwater flow for a future period of 13 years from june 2002 to june 2015 introducing a pumping well will result in the reduction of water stored within the aquifer and in the development of cone of depression the volume of water that is removed from storage through pumping is no longer available as stream discharge ickovic km et al 2004 three categories of pumping scenarios have been simulated in order to reflect a combination of different parameters variables which are likely to influence the behavior of groundwater in future reynolds and spruill 1995 on the inception of canal water irrigation from october 2002 onward would lead to the additional recharge to the aquifer and reduce in the groundwater withdrawal on account of surface water irrigation keeping the canal recharge in mind model forecast has been done to study the behavior of the aquifer under various stress conditions the groundwater head obtained for may 2002 as generated during calibration was used as starting head for generating the pumping scenarios in the western part of the area bounded by the narmada river and its tributaries the sub surface out flow balances the groundwater conditions and water level on long term basis do not show rising trend this sub surface flow to river may be arrested through groundwater development therefore three pumping scenarios have been made to demonstrate the impact of groundwater withdrawal on groundwater regime first model was developed in a view to estimate the base flow to river narmada after applying the existing rainfall recharge rate 66 mcm year and groundwater draft rate 15 56 mcm year table 2 in second scenario envisaged additional withdrawal over the existing groundwater withdrawal through imaging addition tube wells in alluvium area fig 9 this second scenario has been developed in a view to reduce the subsurface flow to river by assuming additional withdrawal of groundwater over the existing level of pumping a number of 98 tube wells are proposed to site in alluvium area in the western part of the area wells are distributed over the area in such a way that each well falls in the centre of each node grid cell as a result about 9 22 mcm and 9 5 mcm additional groundwater withdrawal created during rabi and summer crop respectively in addition to present withdrawal of groundwater in the area hence model run was made by considering withdrawal of 19 mcm per year of groundwater through additional 98 tube wells during rabi and summer crop season it is observed from predicted hydrographs fig 10 a and b in alluvium area the water levels lowered sharply in the beginning of stress period till may 2003 and then water level attains to the flat and stable pattern throughout the whole scenario this model forecast reveals that even a heavy withdrawal from the additional tube wells close to the narmada river does not affect much on the water head of the aquifer system whatever flow drawn from the aquifer will adjust from the flow to the constant head boundary and general head boundary the well statistics of the study area reveal that every year about 7 increase in growth rate in the construction of all types of groundwater abstraction structures to meet the future requirement of water in agriculture and domestic sector the third pumping scenario was developed with incremental rise in pumpage of 0 8 mcm per year on account of 5 growth rate of wells is taken hence model run was made by considering that the net pumpage distribution was increased by an additional 0 8 mcm 5 increase every year does not affect to the aquifer system in the area in future after observing forecasted hydrograph of head of water level fig 10a and b table 3 6 conclusion a groundwater flow model developed for the parts of narmada river basin of gujarat state indicates the aquifer system is stable a comparison between the mass balance of budget of scenarios at the end of stress period may 2015 indicate that groundwater flow to river boundary constant head is reduced on account of increase of pumping in the study area by suggesting additional development of groundwater for irrigation and domestic uses in the end of stress period of scenario 2 a total of 108 mcm of groundwater flow has been arrested in aquifer to river boundary constant head in event of 18 7 mcm year additional groundwater withdrawal envisaged through 98 tube wells in alluvium area despite water withdrawal progressively increasing from year 2002 2015 the depletion in the storage does not reduce much and also does not affect to water level much this behavior may be related to the response of the system to stimuli from 1 increase recharge from northern general head boundary ghb 2 reduction of subsurface groundwater flow to river narmada southern constant head boundary the general head boundary contribution that may be related is the substitution of groundwater abstraction this has caused groundwater level to stabilize or even increase thus the forecasted model indicates that this aquifer system is stable and suffers no adverse effect due to increase in pumping declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

for groundwater movement and dissemination of flow through the sandstone and basalt sub surface geological cross sections a a fig 2b has been drawn just parallel to the course of the narmada river from akoti to uchad in nw to sw direction in southwestern part of the area to decipher the geometry of the aquifers the topography along the section is moderately undulating this section shows two major formations that is alluvium and hard rock formation it shows that the bagh beds forms the basement rock in the area of alluvium formation alluvium formations are shown the well stratified graded bedding fig 2c and are abating to the sandstone formation a fault has also been postulated between bhavpura and uchad granular formations alluvium are under unconfined conditions and are in continuity with the weathered rock formations hard rocks boulder bed in depth yields the tremendous quantity of groundwater southeastern part of the section comprises thick sequences of bagh beds consist of sandstone with thin intercalation of shale and limestone bagh beds ranges in thickness from 67m to 87m depth to water level map fig 2d reveal that shallow water levels less than 15m bgl were recorded in the area comprises weathered rock formation whereas the deep water levels are recorded in alluvial formation deeper water level in alluvial area is due to the draining of percolated water into the deep cut nalas this type of phenomena is mostly observed in the area north and north west of tilakwada in general depth to water level is progressively increasing from northeast direction to southwest direction and reaches to maximum depth 35m bgl close to narmada river the dykes and faults in the hard rock area infra trappean and deccan trap are also play important role in controlling the water levels 2 4 groundwater flow the general slope of the water table confirms by and large to topography of the area the general groundwater flow direction is from ne to sw direction from agar to narmada river the flow turns westward from bujetha to orsang river fig 2a the contours girdle around vajiria hill and hills between agar and naswadi with head values decreasing in all direction indicated that the foot hill regions are areas of recharge and area in the vicinity of river are discharge area as depicted by the formation of groundwater mounds in these areas the area between aswan and men nadi a groundwater flow is converging and finally flowing from ne to sw direction the hydraulic gradient varies from 14m to 23 m km in hilly regions whereas it becomes flatter when approaches to alluvium formation wherein the hydraulic gradient is 3 5m 7 0 m km fig 2a 2 5 groundwater resources the yield of the dug well ranges from 80 to 400 m3 day in alluvial formation 30 100 m3 day and 50 150 m3 day in deccan traps and infratrappeans respectively the tube wells tapping the boulder formation have yields ranging between 1469 and 5636 m3 day with the drawdown of 5 52 9 34 m jain 1987 the permeability of the boulder bed ranges from 151 to 778 m day the groundwater resource potential is estimated as 31 07 mcm during the year 1986 87 base year of model the estimated groundwater recharge through rainfall is 13 26 groundwater recharge from canal irrigation is estimated to be 2 9 mcm year 2002 03 groundwater withdrawal is estimated as 4 27 mcm and 17 07 mcm during the year 1987 and 2002 respectively the total water required for domestic purpose during 1986 was estimated to 8451 m3 day 3 methodology 3 1 regional groundwater flow modeling the study area is conceptualized as a single unconfined aquifer with a no flow along the north east and south east general head boundary along northern and western side and constant head boundary along narmada river in south west of the study area the united states geological survey modular three dimensional finite difference program modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 1998 2000 was used for simulation of groundwater flow processing modflow for window version 5 3 0 a simulation software consists of graphical pre post processor was used to give input data and process the model output 3 2 model design in the model the study area is replaced by a discretized area consist of an array of nodes and associated finite difference blocks cells the nodal grid forms framework of the numerical model anderson et al 1995 andersen and woessner 1996 in the present model the block centered approach is adopted and flux boundaries are located at the edge of the block the area has been modeled as a single layer system comprising unconfined aquifer bear et al 1992 a finite difference grid superimposed fig 3 a over a 499 sq km area was designed and constructed based on the simplification of a conceptual model representing the physical properties of the groundwater system the grid developed for the present study consists of 78 columns and 53 rows forming 4134 squares grid with a constant spacing of 500m by 500m active node numbering 2082 is used to cover the study area remaining nodes about 2052 are exterior and are not considered for computation imposition of the flow boundaries and grid network on the study area leaves the area to be modeled as 475 sq km 3 3 flow characterization the area represents a single layer of unconfined aquifer basin the boundary conditions are specified for the upper surface sides and bottom of the modeled area franke et al 1987 the hydrogeologic boundaries of the basin include a topographic divides to the southeast which are represented by no groundwater flow conditions as they are believed to be topographic highs that coincide with ground water divides the north eastern boundary which are also represented as a no flow conditions except the places where aswan and men nadi enter to the model area are represented by general head boundary river boundary to the northern and western side of the area represented by a general head boundary head values along the boundary were estimated from interpolation of the depth to water level in the area the conductance term is representing the resistance to flow between the boundary and the aquifer narmada river is a perennial river and retain constant flow throughout the year except in the flood season it is observed river water level around 14 25 m above mean sea level at garudeshwar river gauging station boundary along narmada river falling south west of the area is treated as constant head at the river surface fig 3b recharge to the area occurs mainly in the form of infiltration from precipitation and rivers the sandstone and basalt have relatively low coefficients of storage from recharge at higher elevations where there are basement rocks exposed 3 4 model input parameters the finite difference model was developed by incorporating geologic data measured and inferred hydrologic data for the period of 1986 the surface elevation ranges between 31 29 m and 141 51 m above mean sea level whereas the bottom elevation ranges between 111 42 m above mean sea level and 42 04 m below mean sea level aquifer parameters that included hydraulic conductivity porosity and specific yield were assigned to each cell parameter values mostly obtained from pumping tests carried out at tube wells and open wells during field work in the area and from the previous research romani 1973 ngp 1983 org 1993 jain 1987 2010 gec 2005 different hydraulic conductivity zones are deciphered on the basis of variation in lithology and its thickness the average hydraulic conductivity value for each zone was assigned by finding the geometric mean of all values within each zone the distributions of calibrated hydraulic conductivity in the alluvial and hard rock aquifers ranges between 50 and 778 m day fig 4 a and specific yield ranges from 0 02 to 0 20 fig 4b recharge to groundwater mainly takes place from 1 infiltration from rainfall 2 stream bed percolation 3 sub surface inflow from neighboring basin 4 leakage from local surface body i e from ponds and reservoir 5 percolation of canal water applied in the field area 6 return flow percolation from groundwater applied to the fields groundwater recharges have been estimated corresponding to three agriculture crop seasons viz kharif rabi and summer and applied to the area cgwb 1995 kharif crop start from the month of june to september rabi crop in the month of october to january and summer crop fall in the month between february and may the estimated net recharge value of 31 07 mcm year was applied to alluvium sandstone and basalt hydrologic zone for the year 1986 87 the groundwater of the study area is abstracted for irrigation and domestic purposes agriculture is the main activity of the area the groundwater abstraction for irrigation activities was computed based upon the groundwater structure available in the area multiplied by the unit draft of the structure unit draft of the groundwater structure is estimated in the field groundwater draft for irrigation was computed 12 mcm during kharif 9 mcm during rabi and 2 23 mcm during summer crop seasons for the year 1986 87 apart from these domestic pumping for household needs was computed based upon population an average 70 l head day was considered as household requirement water requirement for the livestock was considered 25 l head day 4 results and discussions 4 1 model calibration and results for the purpose of calibration 1986 was chosen the base year and groundwater heads for june 1986 were used as the starting heads for steady state model calibration the water level data of 46 observation wells distributed over the study area were used first in steady state calibration followed by transient calibration the model was calibrated using initial trial and error adjustments for selected input parameters followed by statistical linear regression analysis performed by the model adjustments were made to 1 recharge 2 conductance values at the general head boundary and 3 the hydraulic conductivity field fifteen hydraulic conductivity zones fig 4a are assigned in all over the area based on the variation in lithological material contained in the aquifers alluvial deposits are assumed to be more permeable than the weathered rock formations hydraulic conductivity varies for obtaining a good match between simulated and observed heads elango 1992 sikdhar chkraborty 2017 ray et al 2020 de caro et al 2020 have also used models for devising effective management for improved sustainability of the groundwater resources the statistical analysis is performed by pmwin modeling software by presenting the scatter diagram to judge the quality of calibration results it involves variance analysis if the variance decreased then the adjustment to the input data was retained in addition to this percentage difference between measured and simulated heads were evaluated variance and root mean square error were minimized through numerous trial runs and at last a fair and good match was obtained fig 5 a transient state simulation was carried for a period of 36 stress periods for 12 years start from 1986 87 to 1997 98 one year comprises of three stress period corresponding to three agriculture crop season i e kharif rabi and summer each stress periods approximately matched with one irrigation season with an approximate duration of 4 months numbers of trial runs were made by varying hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield and recharge to groundwater within allowable limits so that a reasonably good match is obtained between computed and observed water levels the computed heads were then compared with the observed historical heads both in the form of contour map fig 5b and hydrograph of selected observation point fig 6 a b c after having adjusted the hydrogeological parameters the model was validated by running it for 48 stress periods i e 16 years 1986 87 to 2001 02 recharge and draft applied to the model for 48 stress periods model calibration redefined estimates of the hydrologic characteristics until the model behavior matched with the observed and simulated heads for the period 1997 98 to 2001 02 based on the close agreement between measured and computed heads at 42 observation wells distributed through the aquifer the transient models were considered to be satisfactorily for future prediction a study of simulated heads indicates that the highest heads are found in the eastern side and shows a marked correlation with topographic contours of the modeled area during the calibration the mean absolute difference between observed and modeled water level head of observation wells indicate the fair and good agreement in the heads wishart et al 2000 the difference is observed as low as 1 02 m for the observation wells falls in alluvium and basaltic area whereas it is 1 75 m for wells in sandstone area table 1 hydraulic heads from few observation wells failed to calibrate within reasonable differences between simulated and observed heads due to position of wells in the vicinity of hills and valleys for example uchad and soikuva in sandstone formation finally the model was run for 48 stress periods using 4 months time steps from the year 1986 87 to 2001 02 the groundwater budget of the study area gives an accounting of recharge to the basin discharge from the basin and flow between hydrogeologic units in the area modflow zone budget 1996 the continuity equation establishes that inflow equal to out flows groundwater budgeting was done and obtained flow for the last stress period february to may 2002 is illustrated in fig 7 in the budget it is observed that there was recharge of 14967 m3 day from the percolation of surface water and return seepage of irrigation applied and withdrawal from well is estimated at 37535 m3 day groundwater flow across narmada river constant head boundary is 213748 m3 day as base flow to river and get river recharge to aquifer at the rate of 93 m3 day at general head boundary ghb inflow and out flow in model area is observed and found 202487 m3 day and 44455 m3 day respectively similar kind of results have been reported by senthilkumar and elango 2004 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out and further used during model calibration to refine initial estimates of input parameters and after model calibration to determine which input parameters had the largest effect on simulated head values gnanasundar and elango 2000 senthilkumar elango 2004 2011 during a sensitivity analysis calibrated values for hydraulic conductivity specific yield recharge and conductance assigned along general head boundary condition are changed with the increments and decrements of 5 10 and 25 the magnitude of change in heads from the calibrated solution is a measure of the sensitivity of the solution to that particular parameter the results of the sensitivity analysis beckers et al 2000 are presented fig 8 a and b as the effects of the parameter change on the average measure of mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse this analysis clearly indicates that any increase or decrease of value of aquifer parameters and groundwater recharge at least 25 percentage would not drastically alter the groundwater heads the sensitivity of the conductance assigned along the general head boundary on the model was studied by varying this parameter up to 25 it was observed a drastic change in groundwater head in just varying the conductance value by 5 and automatically abrupt change in the root mean square error this clearly indicates that this aquifer system is very sensitive to conductance of the general head boundary sensitivity analysis of these parameters indicates simulated heads are most sensitive to change of conductance and some extent to other aquifer parameters and recharge 5 model forecast model developed was used to forecast the groundwater flow for a future period of 13 years from june 2002 to june 2015 introducing a pumping well will result in the reduction of water stored within the aquifer and in the development of cone of depression the volume of water that is removed from storage through pumping is no longer available as stream discharge ickovic km et al 2004 three categories of pumping scenarios have been simulated in order to reflect a combination of different parameters variables which are likely to influence the behavior of groundwater in future reynolds and spruill 1995 on the inception of canal water irrigation from october 2002 onward would lead to the additional recharge to the aquifer and reduce in the groundwater withdrawal on account of surface water irrigation keeping the canal recharge in mind model forecast has been done to study the behavior of the aquifer under various stress conditions the groundwater head obtained for may 2002 as generated during calibration was used as starting head for generating the pumping scenarios in the western part of the area bounded by the narmada river and its tributaries the sub surface out flow balances the groundwater conditions and water level on long term basis do not show rising trend this sub surface flow to river may be arrested through groundwater development therefore three pumping scenarios have been made to demonstrate the impact of groundwater withdrawal on groundwater regime first model was developed in a view to estimate the base flow to river narmada after applying the existing rainfall recharge rate 66 mcm year and groundwater draft rate 15 56 mcm year table 2 in second scenario envisaged additional withdrawal over the existing groundwater withdrawal through imaging addition tube wells in alluvium area fig 9 this second scenario has been developed in a view to reduce the subsurface flow to river by assuming additional withdrawal of groundwater over the existing level of pumping a number of 98 tube wells are proposed to site in alluvium area in the western part of the area wells are distributed over the area in such a way that each well falls in the centre of each node grid cell as a result about 9 22 mcm and 9 5 mcm additional groundwater withdrawal created during rabi and summer crop respectively in addition to present withdrawal of groundwater in the area hence model run was made by considering withdrawal of 19 mcm per year of groundwater through additional 98 tube wells during rabi and summer crop season it is observed from predicted hydrographs fig 10 a and b in alluvium area the water levels lowered sharply in the beginning of stress period till may 2003 and then water level attains to the flat and stable pattern throughout the whole scenario this model forecast reveals that even a heavy withdrawal from the additional tube wells close to the narmada river does not affect much on the water head of the aquifer system whatever flow drawn from the aquifer will adjust from the flow to the constant head boundary and general head boundary the well statistics of the study area reveal that every year about 7 increase in growth rate in the construction of all types of groundwater abstraction structures to meet the future requirement of water in agriculture and domestic sector the third pumping scenario was developed with incremental rise in pumpage of 0 8 mcm per year on account of 5 growth rate of wells is taken hence model run was made by considering that the net pumpage distribution was increased by an additional 0 8 mcm 5 increase every year does not affect to the aquifer system in the area in future after observing forecasted hydrograph of head of water level fig 10a and b table 3 6 conclusion a groundwater flow model developed for the parts of narmada river basin of gujarat state indicates the aquifer system is stable a comparison between the mass balance of budget of scenarios at the end of stress period may 2015 indicate that groundwater flow to river boundary constant head is reduced on account of increase of pumping in the study area by suggesting additional development of groundwater for irrigation and domestic uses in the end of stress period of scenario 2 a total of 108 mcm of groundwater flow has been arrested in aquifer to river boundary constant head in event of 18 7 mcm year additional groundwater withdrawal envisaged through 98 tube wells in alluvium area despite water withdrawal progressively increasing from year 2002 2015 the depletion in the storage does not reduce much and also does not affect to water level much this behavior may be related to the response of the system to stimuli from 1 increase recharge from northern general head boundary ghb 2 reduction of subsurface groundwater flow to river narmada southern constant head boundary the general head boundary contribution that may be related is the substitution of groundwater abstraction this has caused groundwater level to stabilize or even increase thus the forecasted model indicates that this aquifer system is stable and suffers no adverse effect due to increase in pumping declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11991,arsenic as being present in the groundwater of many regions has significant detrimental effects on the health of the local people moreover in current scenario iron ore mining residues have detrimental effects on the environment besides occupying space reject of iron ore slime rios has high adsorption properties irrespective of temperature and ph the simulation study has confirmed that as adsorption by rios follows langmuir isotherm and after 24 h residence time more than 90 as can be removed moreover the effect of variation both as and rios has been understood based on the simulation study a desired rios concentrated slurry was injected into groundwater reservoir for in situ as removal and after 20 days nearly 90 as was entrapped in rios thus the present study ensured that rios may be used as an alternative adsorbent for geotechnical cleaning of as from groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords reject iron ore slime adsorption heavy metal kinetic study arsenic 1 introduction widespread pollution of waterbodies by industrial waste discharge as well as the contamination of water from nearby mines has reciprocated detrimental effects to aquatic living organisms a typical example has been found that approximately around one unit of mercury hg is emitted into the environment for every unit of gold produced world water quality facts and statistics 2010 thus huge amounts of a heavy metal like hg is entering the environment likewise different forms of heavy metal from various types of activities are gradually entering our atmosphere wei et al accessed heavy metals within surface sediments of raohe basin china and arranged those heavy metals in order of the degree of pollution inflicted as cu as pb cd cr zn wei et al 2019 those elements enter the human body by either ingestion or inhalation causing extensive damage to liver kidney and brain hutton 1987 arsenic contamination in groundwater has turned out to be a multi faceted problem faced by people all around the globe and especially by the eastern part of india many regions have arsenic dissolved in the groundwater in varying concentrations potentially risking the inhabitants who are consuming it the groundwater of most of these regions fail to qualify as safe according to the maximum permissible limit of 500 ppb as prescribed by the world health organization who guidelines who 1984 moreover in the ground water as present in two forms arsenite asiii and arsenate asv it has been established that asiii is more toxic and difficult to remove as compared to asv nicomel et al 2015 thus this current situation renders a necessary action to be taken to make these waters free from heavy metals like arsenic a lot of research has been conducted in the last few decades either for removal or reduction of contamination of these dissolved heavy metal ions from water hutton 1987 who 1984 chakraborty et al 2012 in general coagulation flocculation is the common practice for removal of heavy metals although a large quantity of chemicals is required in such processes moreover at the end of the process a huge amount of sludge is generated and disposal of such sludge is very challenging chakraborty et al 2012 membrane separation process may eliminate the limitations of coagulation technique though separation of heavy metal at such low concentration may not be an economically viable option however bioremediation and adsorption are the most acceptable techniques for the removal of heavy metals from water even if it is present at very low concentrations barakat 2011 kanawade and gaikwad 2011 singanan et al 2005 adsorption remains a low cost alternative for heavy metal removal however after a lot of research work hours being spent on adsorbents the requirement for a low cost adsorbent for performing effective adsorption at a sufficiently large scale is still insignificant also some materials as well as mechanisms turn out to be too complicated or too hard to obtain for field application moreover the disposal of adsorbent after adsorption encompasses different issues the present research group used the reject of iron ore slime rios consisting of 35 iron content for the adsorption process rios is basically a left over material after iron ore slime beneficiation and it has no such utilization in the present scenario around 10 million ton of iron ore slime is generated annually in india and after physical beneficiation 4 5 million ton of rios generated which is typically 6 8 of total iron ore such large volume of material occupies more than thousand acres of land this material contains large quantities of alumina and silica besides iron oxides and oxy hydroxides erdem et al 2004 moreover the detailed characterization of rios has been elaborated in subsequent section as these renders the rejected slime unusable with regards to charging into blast furnace as well as value addition thus alternative means of utilization of these reject fines are necessary the mentioned study has confirmed the presence of haematite and goethite as the main iron containing compounds present in it and those iron bearing compounds are very much effective for adsorption of heavy metals the adsorption process was conducted in a packed bed setup in laboratory condition using packed column erdem et al 2004 however this study also has the limitation of adsorbent disposal the present study has been developed based on the results obtained from the aforesaid research work erdem et al 2004 where it has been established that rios has good arsenic adsorption property the novelty of the current research work is the in situ cleaning of ground water using rios rather ground water is passed through a packed column to achieve arsenic free ground water the solution of rios was directly injected underground in arsenic effected area based on a laboratory scale simulation study the present innovation not only resolves the issues regarding as contamination but also removes other contaminants from ground water consequently such initiative can nullify issues associated with disposal of spent adsorbent the developed process is eco friendly and a lot easier in terms of mobility logistics and disposal moreover such development ensures the better utilization of rejected iron ore slime which occupies land causing detrimental effects to water bodies a detailed description of present study has been elaborated in subsequent sections 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and material reject of iron ore slime rios was collected from slime ponds of joda east iron ore mines tata steel ltd india these fines containing 25 30 moisture were heated in an oven 100 c 105 c for 24 h to make it devoid of any moisture then it is further powdered in the ball mill and stored in a moisture free environment for further use all chemicals used during the experiments are analytical grade and procured from merck india ltd and deionized water was used for making different types of solutions 2 2 experimental method the experiment was designed to carry out in two parts the initial part of the work was carried out in the laboratory via mixing method using mechanical stirrer fig 1 a with 500 ml of working solution simulated solution was prepared from 1000 ppm mother solution of arsenic h3aso4 in hno3 0 5 mol l and arsenic solutions of strength was varied from 0 1 ppm to 20 ppm during the experiment concentration of rios was varied in a range of 2 5 20 g l and 50 200 g l when as concentration was varied in between 0 01 to 5 ppm and 10 20 ppm respectively after the adsorption process residual as concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry aas as asiii using the standard protocol as described in available literature shankar and shankershikha 2014 wahed et al 2006 nabh4 with hcl was used to convert all type of as asiii asv in arsine and after that arsenic concertation was measured accurately in aas the residence time for adsorption was varied up to 24 h to understand the effect of residence time in addition to understand the effect of temperature in adsorption kinetics temperature was varied from 10 to 50 c with step change of 10 c keeping all other parameters constant it was observed that there was no such variation in removal percentage of as in addition it was also understood during the experiment the effect ph was insignificant in adsorption of as by rios thus all experiments under simulation study were carried out under ambient condition 30 c and ph 7 moreover it is impossible to change the temperature as well as ph during in situ cleaning of ground water using rios a trial was conducted to ensure that no heavy metal will come out form the rios after adsorption after completion of adsorption process the adsorbate was washed with 500 ml deionized water via stirring for 1 h and filtered three samples were considered for this study the as concentration was measured in all three filtrate samples using aas and found negative the second phase of the present study includes application of rios in real groundwater cleaning by injecting the slime slurry in underground through a tube well the parameter for this study was fixed based on lab scale simulation a schematic has been shown in fig 1 b however additional enhancements in adsorption process such as stirring ph balancing temperature control should not be available in real scenario the quantification of as in ground water sample includes both asiii and asv as analysis has been conducted aas based on described protocol shankar and shankershikha 2014 hence present study is attempting to complete removal of as form ground water 2 3 material characterization rios was characterized with xrd and sem edxa to know the different constituents of it surface of the rios was characterized using bet surface analyser during experimental study arsenic concentration was measured using aas and as removal efficiency re was measured using equation 1 after each adsorption cycle rios was separated using whatman filter paper and as concentration was measured in both filtrate and residue using standard protocol of aas 1 r e c i n c t c i n 100 where cin and ct represents as concentration at initial stage t 0 and any time t t respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of slime the rios fines were subjected to be characterized in xrd initially and plot of xrd has shown in fig 2 xrd revealed that the presence of haematite and maghemite as the only oxides and oxyhydroxides present in rios moreover energy dispersive x ray analysis has shown in fig 3 which revealed the presence of oxygen 55 58 iron 42 45 silicon 1 5 2 aluminium 1 5 2 5 and magnesium in the sample the presence of these elements posits the presence of silica iron oxides and oxyhydroxides in the system amongst other components the bulk analysis from xrd illustrated that major compounds in rios were 75 81 fe2o3 3 4 feo 5 7 al2o3 6 7 sio2 and p2o5 tio2 cao were less than 1 sem fig 4 confirms the porous structure of rios and such type of structure has a potential of adsorption of heavy metals like as the particle size of the adsorbent one major controlling parameter for the adsorption process and lesser particle size ensures better available surface area for adsorption in line with that principle particle size distribution of rios was analysed and it was observed that maximum particles were below 20 30 μm moreover the size of more than 75 material was less than 70 75 nm in addition bet analyser revealed that rios had surface area of 2 2 5 m2 g which was quite appreciable for surface adsorption 3 2 simulation study with synthetic arsenic solution adsorption of arsenic on rios was carried out by different process parameters such as concentration of targeted heavy metal and adsorbent in working solution and residence time for adsorption during the experiment one parameter was varied when others are kept constant and effect of those parameters have been elaborated in subsequent sections 3 2 1 effect of heavy metal and adsorbent concentration heavy metal and adsorbent concentration are to major parameters for adsorption in general adsorption efficiency improves with higher adsorbent concentration and lower concentration of targeted molecules the effect of variation of rios and as concentration has been represented by figs 5 and 3 d surface plot in fig 6 fig 5 a indicates that with increase as concentration the removal efficiency decreases keeping all other parameters constant the number of active sites present in adsorbent is constant at its certain concentration therefore the adsorption capacity is constant hence with increase of as concentration the number of available as molecules per unit surface area of rios increase which results poor adsorption erdem et al 2004 fig 5 b has also revealed that the adsorption efficiency improves with increase of rios concentration up to certain level after that it becomes reverse when all other parameters kept constant the available active sites increase with adsorbent concentration thus better adsorption has been observed however further increment in rois concentration depicts lower dispersion of slime in working solution which is eventually causing reduction in number of active sites for adsorption moreover the point zero charge pzc of rios is around 6 5 erdem et al 2004 thus at neutral ph 7 the dispersion of rios is lesser consequently adsorption efficiency reduces at higher concentration therefore optimized concentration of rios should be maintained for better as adsorption every single experiment was conducted for five times to irradiate experimental error though it was laid in between 1 2 as show in fig 5 fig 6 shows the effect of variation of both rios and as concentration and intricate relationship among those two parameters the 3d plot signifies that higher concentration of rios is not favourable even as presents at higher level as it has already been mentioned that dispersion of rios decreases at higher concentration however it had already been understood that at lower concentration of as lower the rios concentration was favourable whereas the observation was opposite in case of higher as concentration therefore rios concentration should be optimized based on the as concentration in ground water 3 2 2 effect of residence time the contact time between target molecule and adsorbent refers as residence time in adsorption process therefore higher residence time gives better adsorption during simulation study the maximum residence time of 24 h was provided for adsorption and details results have been provided in fig 7 it has been found that after 12 h of residence time maximum amount of as was adsorbed irrespective of any parametric condition during the experiment rios concentration was maintained at 20 g l and neutral ph 7 moreover in case of higher initial concentration of as higher residence time was required for maximum removal of as higher residence time always ensure better contact between as molecule and rios however there was no significant change in as concentration after 24 h of residence time and such observation was used in simulation study with real ground water the data reproducibility checking ensured that there was less than 2 experimental error only as shown in fig 7 3 3 adsorption kinetic the adsorption of heavy metal on rios is entirely a surface phenomenon bulk diffusion surface adsorption and pore diffusion are the three main forms of mass transfers involved in the entire adsorption mechanism the adsorption kinetics can be well explained with different types of isotherms more details on adsorption mechanisms are available in earlier research works by the same research group and it was established earlier that heavy metal adsorption by slime might follow langmuir isotherm erdem et al 2004 the typical langmuir isotherm can be expressed with equation 2 sarkar et al 2017 in such type of isotherm concentration of adsorbate is the main driving force the obtained data from the simulation study was well fitted the present isotherm 2 c i n q e 1 q m k a c i n q m where qe represents the amount of as adsorbed per gram of rios at equilibrium cin represents the initial concentration of as qm represent the maximum as adsorbed per gram of rios at equilibrium ka is as adsorption rate constant g 1 which signifies the extent of interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent the data of cin vs cin qe has plotted in fig 8 it has been observed those data fitted linearly having high co relation coefficient r2 0 9742 the values of adsorption parameters have been calculated from fig 8 and thus measured value of qm and ka are 0 5395 mg of as g of rios and 0 0208 g 1 respectively in the present study the value of ka was quite appreciable which ensured that better interaction between as molecules and rios hence the process exhibited better adsorption 3 4 filed study with rios a large part of eastern india is suffering from cancer skin lesions birth defects and many other health complications due to as contamination in ground water during last three decade stumn and morgan 1996 guha mazumder and dasgupta 2011 as mentioned earlier who has already recommended the permissible limit of as in drinking work as 0 05 ppm around seven indian states located in the plains of ganga brahmaputra are highly affected by as contamination in underground drinking water and sometimes even by a concentration exceeding 800 ppm guha mazumder and dasgupta 2011 several initiatives have been taken for as remediation from drinking water via coagulation flocculation adsorption filtration ion exchange etc however these processes are limited due to the further contamination of surface water which takes place during the disposal of arsenic concentrated sludge residue adsorbent filter media etc guha mazumder et al 1998 thus the present study aims to develop a process based on in situ adsorption of as by rios so that the treated as remains underground in an inactive dormant oxidation sate an abandon well due to as contamination in eastern india was selected for field study and the average contamination of as was 0 3 ppm based on earlier simulation study optimum rios should be around 5 g l to achieve maximum removal the slurry of rios was injected to underground water reservoir for in situ clean up after injection rios is mixed with a huge amount of water which could be considered as infinite dilution via natural dispersion the slurry was prepared using 100 kg of rios with 200 l ground water 500 g l which is 100 times of optimized concentration and slowly pumped back into the selected well the sample was collected after each 5 days for 30 days duration the result obtained during the time period has been plotted in fig 9 and the permissible limit of as was reached within 25 days the time taken to reach the stability was quite higher than lab scale simulation study as there was no mechanical mixing inside the reservoir rather it was natural mixing it has understood that after 25 days there was no change in as concentration and this might be occurred due to either adsorption capacity of rios exhausted or driving force for adsorption was disappeared at lower concentration of as at the end of 30 days of residence time around 10 kl water was pumped out and there was no change in as concentration although after that there was a significant improvement in heavy metal decontamination hence a proper mapping for groundwater is required to estimate the amount of slime required as well as number of injection points for the complete entrapment of heavy metal in a certain as affected area it was verified earlier during the simulation analysis that the adsorbed as molecules never leaked out form the rios therefore present initiative may ensure complete entrapment of as inside water reservoir using rios 4 conclusion in the present scenario people are either suffering from scarcity of affordable water treatment processes for as removal or facing challenges to dispose the residue after the treatment in arsenic affected zones hence the present study has attempted to develop a process which does not require any form of energy or post treatment of the residue can be a viable methodology for in situ geotechnical cleaning of as contaminated portable water the study revealed that arsenic from the groundwater could be removed via adsorption using reject of iron ore slime rios rios fines cannot be directly charged into the blast furnace due its low yield and detrimental effects causing choking and erosion of refractories within the furnace dumped in slime ponds it poses a daunting challenge for steelmakers as these contain light nano sized particles which impacts the air quality in addition to posing a storage challenge having no other means of disposal they are better off to be put to some use iron oxides and oxyhydroxides present in it are proven adsorbents for heavy metals removal the simulation study has already confirmed that heavy metals like as can be removed completely from ground water using rios it was found that as adsorption processes followed the langmuir adsorption isotherms with negligible effect of ph and temperature the removal of as increased with increase of rios concentration up to certain level after that it was reversed due to less dispersion of rios at higher concentration based on the simulation study field trials were conducted and it had been confirmed that rios was very suitable for in situ removal of arsenic inside groundwater reservoirs in affected areas the present study not only help the research fraternity to develop low cost adsorbent for as removal form industrial waste but also this helps iron making industry to utilize mines waste as a catalyst for making sustainable future the major concerns regarding the implementation of present methodology at larger scale are proper mapping arsenic affected area with different layers of groundwater and estimation of bore holes required for rios injection for a particular area based on that enough adsorbent can be injected for maximum removal of arsenic after that a long term field study is required in a certain arsenic affected area to optimize estimated numbers based on mapping as well as to understand the seasonal effects and life time of the adsorbent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11991,arsenic as being present in the groundwater of many regions has significant detrimental effects on the health of the local people moreover in current scenario iron ore mining residues have detrimental effects on the environment besides occupying space reject of iron ore slime rios has high adsorption properties irrespective of temperature and ph the simulation study has confirmed that as adsorption by rios follows langmuir isotherm and after 24 h residence time more than 90 as can be removed moreover the effect of variation both as and rios has been understood based on the simulation study a desired rios concentrated slurry was injected into groundwater reservoir for in situ as removal and after 20 days nearly 90 as was entrapped in rios thus the present study ensured that rios may be used as an alternative adsorbent for geotechnical cleaning of as from groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords reject iron ore slime adsorption heavy metal kinetic study arsenic 1 introduction widespread pollution of waterbodies by industrial waste discharge as well as the contamination of water from nearby mines has reciprocated detrimental effects to aquatic living organisms a typical example has been found that approximately around one unit of mercury hg is emitted into the environment for every unit of gold produced world water quality facts and statistics 2010 thus huge amounts of a heavy metal like hg is entering the environment likewise different forms of heavy metal from various types of activities are gradually entering our atmosphere wei et al accessed heavy metals within surface sediments of raohe basin china and arranged those heavy metals in order of the degree of pollution inflicted as cu as pb cd cr zn wei et al 2019 those elements enter the human body by either ingestion or inhalation causing extensive damage to liver kidney and brain hutton 1987 arsenic contamination in groundwater has turned out to be a multi faceted problem faced by people all around the globe and especially by the eastern part of india many regions have arsenic dissolved in the groundwater in varying concentrations potentially risking the inhabitants who are consuming it the groundwater of most of these regions fail to qualify as safe according to the maximum permissible limit of 500 ppb as prescribed by the world health organization who guidelines who 1984 moreover in the ground water as present in two forms arsenite asiii and arsenate asv it has been established that asiii is more toxic and difficult to remove as compared to asv nicomel et al 2015 thus this current situation renders a necessary action to be taken to make these waters free from heavy metals like arsenic a lot of research has been conducted in the last few decades either for removal or reduction of contamination of these dissolved heavy metal ions from water hutton 1987 who 1984 chakraborty et al 2012 in general coagulation flocculation is the common practice for removal of heavy metals although a large quantity of chemicals is required in such processes moreover at the end of the process a huge amount of sludge is generated and disposal of such sludge is very challenging chakraborty et al 2012 membrane separation process may eliminate the limitations of coagulation technique though separation of heavy metal at such low concentration may not be an economically viable option however bioremediation and adsorption are the most acceptable techniques for the removal of heavy metals from water even if it is present at very low concentrations barakat 2011 kanawade and gaikwad 2011 singanan et al 2005 adsorption remains a low cost alternative for heavy metal removal however after a lot of research work hours being spent on adsorbents the requirement for a low cost adsorbent for performing effective adsorption at a sufficiently large scale is still insignificant also some materials as well as mechanisms turn out to be too complicated or too hard to obtain for field application moreover the disposal of adsorbent after adsorption encompasses different issues the present research group used the reject of iron ore slime rios consisting of 35 iron content for the adsorption process rios is basically a left over material after iron ore slime beneficiation and it has no such utilization in the present scenario around 10 million ton of iron ore slime is generated annually in india and after physical beneficiation 4 5 million ton of rios generated which is typically 6 8 of total iron ore such large volume of material occupies more than thousand acres of land this material contains large quantities of alumina and silica besides iron oxides and oxy hydroxides erdem et al 2004 moreover the detailed characterization of rios has been elaborated in subsequent section as these renders the rejected slime unusable with regards to charging into blast furnace as well as value addition thus alternative means of utilization of these reject fines are necessary the mentioned study has confirmed the presence of haematite and goethite as the main iron containing compounds present in it and those iron bearing compounds are very much effective for adsorption of heavy metals the adsorption process was conducted in a packed bed setup in laboratory condition using packed column erdem et al 2004 however this study also has the limitation of adsorbent disposal the present study has been developed based on the results obtained from the aforesaid research work erdem et al 2004 where it has been established that rios has good arsenic adsorption property the novelty of the current research work is the in situ cleaning of ground water using rios rather ground water is passed through a packed column to achieve arsenic free ground water the solution of rios was directly injected underground in arsenic effected area based on a laboratory scale simulation study the present innovation not only resolves the issues regarding as contamination but also removes other contaminants from ground water consequently such initiative can nullify issues associated with disposal of spent adsorbent the developed process is eco friendly and a lot easier in terms of mobility logistics and disposal moreover such development ensures the better utilization of rejected iron ore slime which occupies land causing detrimental effects to water bodies a detailed description of present study has been elaborated in subsequent sections 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and material reject of iron ore slime rios was collected from slime ponds of joda east iron ore mines tata steel ltd india these fines containing 25 30 moisture were heated in an oven 100 c 105 c for 24 h to make it devoid of any moisture then it is further powdered in the ball mill and stored in a moisture free environment for further use all chemicals used during the experiments are analytical grade and procured from merck india ltd and deionized water was used for making different types of solutions 2 2 experimental method the experiment was designed to carry out in two parts the initial part of the work was carried out in the laboratory via mixing method using mechanical stirrer fig 1 a with 500 ml of working solution simulated solution was prepared from 1000 ppm mother solution of arsenic h3aso4 in hno3 0 5 mol l and arsenic solutions of strength was varied from 0 1 ppm to 20 ppm during the experiment concentration of rios was varied in a range of 2 5 20 g l and 50 200 g l when as concentration was varied in between 0 01 to 5 ppm and 10 20 ppm respectively after the adsorption process residual as concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry aas as asiii using the standard protocol as described in available literature shankar and shankershikha 2014 wahed et al 2006 nabh4 with hcl was used to convert all type of as asiii asv in arsine and after that arsenic concertation was measured accurately in aas the residence time for adsorption was varied up to 24 h to understand the effect of residence time in addition to understand the effect of temperature in adsorption kinetics temperature was varied from 10 to 50 c with step change of 10 c keeping all other parameters constant it was observed that there was no such variation in removal percentage of as in addition it was also understood during the experiment the effect ph was insignificant in adsorption of as by rios thus all experiments under simulation study were carried out under ambient condition 30 c and ph 7 moreover it is impossible to change the temperature as well as ph during in situ cleaning of ground water using rios a trial was conducted to ensure that no heavy metal will come out form the rios after adsorption after completion of adsorption process the adsorbate was washed with 500 ml deionized water via stirring for 1 h and filtered three samples were considered for this study the as concentration was measured in all three filtrate samples using aas and found negative the second phase of the present study includes application of rios in real groundwater cleaning by injecting the slime slurry in underground through a tube well the parameter for this study was fixed based on lab scale simulation a schematic has been shown in fig 1 b however additional enhancements in adsorption process such as stirring ph balancing temperature control should not be available in real scenario the quantification of as in ground water sample includes both asiii and asv as analysis has been conducted aas based on described protocol shankar and shankershikha 2014 hence present study is attempting to complete removal of as form ground water 2 3 material characterization rios was characterized with xrd and sem edxa to know the different constituents of it surface of the rios was characterized using bet surface analyser during experimental study arsenic concentration was measured using aas and as removal efficiency re was measured using equation 1 after each adsorption cycle rios was separated using whatman filter paper and as concentration was measured in both filtrate and residue using standard protocol of aas 1 r e c i n c t c i n 100 where cin and ct represents as concentration at initial stage t 0 and any time t t respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of slime the rios fines were subjected to be characterized in xrd initially and plot of xrd has shown in fig 2 xrd revealed that the presence of haematite and maghemite as the only oxides and oxyhydroxides present in rios moreover energy dispersive x ray analysis has shown in fig 3 which revealed the presence of oxygen 55 58 iron 42 45 silicon 1 5 2 aluminium 1 5 2 5 and magnesium in the sample the presence of these elements posits the presence of silica iron oxides and oxyhydroxides in the system amongst other components the bulk analysis from xrd illustrated that major compounds in rios were 75 81 fe2o3 3 4 feo 5 7 al2o3 6 7 sio2 and p2o5 tio2 cao were less than 1 sem fig 4 confirms the porous structure of rios and such type of structure has a potential of adsorption of heavy metals like as the particle size of the adsorbent one major controlling parameter for the adsorption process and lesser particle size ensures better available surface area for adsorption in line with that principle particle size distribution of rios was analysed and it was observed that maximum particles were below 20 30 μm moreover the size of more than 75 material was less than 70 75 nm in addition bet analyser revealed that rios had surface area of 2 2 5 m2 g which was quite appreciable for surface adsorption 3 2 simulation study with synthetic arsenic solution adsorption of arsenic on rios was carried out by different process parameters such as concentration of targeted heavy metal and adsorbent in working solution and residence time for adsorption during the experiment one parameter was varied when others are kept constant and effect of those parameters have been elaborated in subsequent sections 3 2 1 effect of heavy metal and adsorbent concentration heavy metal and adsorbent concentration are to major parameters for adsorption in general adsorption efficiency improves with higher adsorbent concentration and lower concentration of targeted molecules the effect of variation of rios and as concentration has been represented by figs 5 and 3 d surface plot in fig 6 fig 5 a indicates that with increase as concentration the removal efficiency decreases keeping all other parameters constant the number of active sites present in adsorbent is constant at its certain concentration therefore the adsorption capacity is constant hence with increase of as concentration the number of available as molecules per unit surface area of rios increase which results poor adsorption erdem et al 2004 fig 5 b has also revealed that the adsorption efficiency improves with increase of rios concentration up to certain level after that it becomes reverse when all other parameters kept constant the available active sites increase with adsorbent concentration thus better adsorption has been observed however further increment in rois concentration depicts lower dispersion of slime in working solution which is eventually causing reduction in number of active sites for adsorption moreover the point zero charge pzc of rios is around 6 5 erdem et al 2004 thus at neutral ph 7 the dispersion of rios is lesser consequently adsorption efficiency reduces at higher concentration therefore optimized concentration of rios should be maintained for better as adsorption every single experiment was conducted for five times to irradiate experimental error though it was laid in between 1 2 as show in fig 5 fig 6 shows the effect of variation of both rios and as concentration and intricate relationship among those two parameters the 3d plot signifies that higher concentration of rios is not favourable even as presents at higher level as it has already been mentioned that dispersion of rios decreases at higher concentration however it had already been understood that at lower concentration of as lower the rios concentration was favourable whereas the observation was opposite in case of higher as concentration therefore rios concentration should be optimized based on the as concentration in ground water 3 2 2 effect of residence time the contact time between target molecule and adsorbent refers as residence time in adsorption process therefore higher residence time gives better adsorption during simulation study the maximum residence time of 24 h was provided for adsorption and details results have been provided in fig 7 it has been found that after 12 h of residence time maximum amount of as was adsorbed irrespective of any parametric condition during the experiment rios concentration was maintained at 20 g l and neutral ph 7 moreover in case of higher initial concentration of as higher residence time was required for maximum removal of as higher residence time always ensure better contact between as molecule and rios however there was no significant change in as concentration after 24 h of residence time and such observation was used in simulation study with real ground water the data reproducibility checking ensured that there was less than 2 experimental error only as shown in fig 7 3 3 adsorption kinetic the adsorption of heavy metal on rios is entirely a surface phenomenon bulk diffusion surface adsorption and pore diffusion are the three main forms of mass transfers involved in the entire adsorption mechanism the adsorption kinetics can be well explained with different types of isotherms more details on adsorption mechanisms are available in earlier research works by the same research group and it was established earlier that heavy metal adsorption by slime might follow langmuir isotherm erdem et al 2004 the typical langmuir isotherm can be expressed with equation 2 sarkar et al 2017 in such type of isotherm concentration of adsorbate is the main driving force the obtained data from the simulation study was well fitted the present isotherm 2 c i n q e 1 q m k a c i n q m where qe represents the amount of as adsorbed per gram of rios at equilibrium cin represents the initial concentration of as qm represent the maximum as adsorbed per gram of rios at equilibrium ka is as adsorption rate constant g 1 which signifies the extent of interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent the data of cin vs cin qe has plotted in fig 8 it has been observed those data fitted linearly having high co relation coefficient r2 0 9742 the values of adsorption parameters have been calculated from fig 8 and thus measured value of qm and ka are 0 5395 mg of as g of rios and 0 0208 g 1 respectively in the present study the value of ka was quite appreciable which ensured that better interaction between as molecules and rios hence the process exhibited better adsorption 3 4 filed study with rios a large part of eastern india is suffering from cancer skin lesions birth defects and many other health complications due to as contamination in ground water during last three decade stumn and morgan 1996 guha mazumder and dasgupta 2011 as mentioned earlier who has already

11992,in this article concave type stepped solar still is examined for the climatic conditions of pune india the proposed still was invented with an area of 1 m2 with a concave type stepped basin the performance of the proposed solar still is tested with mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles with 0 1 and 0 2 of volume concentration furthermore still along with 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles investigated with the impact of the film of water cooling arrangement over a condensing surface consequences of the analysis were compared with concave type stepped solar still without utilizing nanofluids and cooling arrangement result inferred highest ascends in the profitability of proposed still by 41 35 and 32 76 using 0 2 and 0 1 concentration of mgo nanofluid respectively similarly al2o3 nanofluid raise productivity is around 28 42 and 22 89 whereas ascends in the profitability of proposed still by 19 10 and 12 93 using tio2 nanofluid in addition to that condensing cover cooling helps to upsurge the temperature distinction among the basin and glass cover consequently the productivity of still enhanced significantly the result shows 51 28 39 24 and 25 37 enhancement in the productivity with water cooling arrangement and 0 2 concentration of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords concave type stepped solar still nanofluid volume concentration water desalination profitability 1 introduction the financial progress of any nation unequivocally relies on the accessibility of energy sources and the amount of freshwater even though the absence of freshwater resources had become a significant challenge just 1 of water around the world is as freshwater assets in comparison the remainder of 97 and 2 exist in seas and arctic zones separately abujazar et al 2018 the significant parameters that cause the reduction in water resources are growth in agronomy sector advancement in industries transport and building industries and a remarkable increase in the populace around the globe therefore it is essential to look for elective sources to supply freshwater particularly in dry areas and inaccessible territory of non water sources solar still is a noteworthy device used for filtering of salty water and then used for consumption purposes kalita et al 2015 there are few conservative methods reverse osmosis electro dialysis membrane distillations etc utilized for distillation purposes pangarkar et al 2011 almadani 2003 but these techniques do not find the significant use in the remote and most arid region due to less accessibility of electric vitality moreover it uses fissile fuels and its exhaust causes ecological contamination which isn t worth for any nation therefore solar desalination seems to be a more robust and promising technique for providing fresh water to remote as well as arid regions sharon and reddy 2015 additionally this process mainly utilizes solar energy which is renewable openly accessible and considered as green and clean vitality as it doesn t make any contamination related issues to the earth kumar et al 2017 the solar desalination process utilizes solar energy of sun radiations these solar radiations used to heat the salted water that results in evaporation the vapors formed owing to evaporation are collected on the condensing surface and condensation of these vapors takes place resulting in droplets of water nevertheless the primary concern associated with solar desalination is its lower yield jamil and akhtar 2019 to overwhelm this issue most of the researchers encouraged to discover a way to upgrade the performance nanoparticles find the vital role in solar desalination technology mahian et al 2013 from the above literature work it is concluded that the solar still has one major disadvantage of less productivity one of the best method to overcome this problem is to use nanoparticle in salt water or brackish water that helps to enhance the thermo physical properties of water which leads increase the heat transfer process inside solar still bozorgan and shafahi 2015 furthermore nano particle possesses better optical absorption capacity subramanian et al 2019 nanofluids can prove as a better choice for absorbing heat from the sun and carry it through various solar thermal systems due to their superior properties nanoparticles have the estimable capacity for engrossing the sun powered radiation in the water as the spectrum of solar radiation matches the optical absorption of nanoparticles with an increment in temperature the thermal conductivity increases subramanian et al 2019 previously nanoparticles have been utilized by various researchers in different types of solar still use of nanofluid cuo and al2o3 in conventional solar still was proposed by kabeel et al 2014a effect of nanofluid on evaporation in solar still was studied by mahian et al 2017 impact of nanofluid on single slope solar still studied by shanmugan and essa 2020 double slope solar still studied by l sahota and tiwari 2016 stepped solar still was proposed by panchal et al 2019b and pyramid solar still with the integration of evacuated tubes was experimentally proposed by sharshir et al 2019 furthermore few researchers worked with nanofluid in association with certain modifications in the solar still gupta et al 2017 utilized nanoparticles with an attachment of water sprinkler omara et al 2015 studied the impact of nanoparticles with the configuration of external reflector and condenser to a wick type solar still parsa et al 2020 studied the effect of nanofluid on passive solar still at high altitude the nanofluid based solar still with the integration of thermoelectric modules was proposed by bahiraei et al 2020 the impact of nanofluid on conventional solar still with the addition of parabolic collector was experimentally studied by subhedar et al 2019 double slope solar still in the configuration of the heat exchanger and nanofluid was proposed by sahota et al 2017 to accomplish the previously mentioned objective as of late nanoparticles were added in feed water to form nano liquid improving the gainfulness of still mahian et al 2013 elango et al 2015 studied the impact of numerous nanofluids with single basins solar still and concluded that 29 95 assented in productivity by using al2o3 when contrasted with still having water kabeel et al 2014b explored the impact of al2o3 on still in provision with the exterior condenser utilizing nanofluids improves water efficiency by about 116 kabeel et al 2014a found out the highest increment in the efficiency of the modified still was accomplished by using cu2o water nanofluid which was 133 64 higher than the effectiveness of the traditional still with working the fan sharshir et al 2017 analyzed the impact of graphite on the performance of solar still obtained results show a significant increase in the productivity of still which is about 53 95 when contrasted with conventional still gupta et al 2016 assessed the impact of cuo nanoparticles on conventional solar still at 5 and 10 cm depth of water results reveal the productivity is about 3 44 l m2 day and 3 05 l m2 day at 0 05 and 0 1 m water depth respectively nanofluids have various unique properties that appeared differently with its base liquid like more excellent capability to conduct the heat ghozatloo et al 2014 mehrali et al 2014 and high absorbing ability of solar radiations omara et al 2015 that plays the vital role to enhance the productivity of still despite nanoparticles the significance of water depth tiwari and tiwari 2006 and the cooling of the condensing surface similarly have a colossal impact on the productivity of still omara et al 2017 khalifa and hamood 2009 studied the effect of different brine depth on basin type still and suggested declining tendency of productivity was associated with increasing depth of the brine nafey et al 2000 assessed productivity declines by around 14 by increasing the water depth to 7 cm from 2 cm jathar et al 2020 studied various software s to predict the thermal behavior of solar still muthu manokar et al 2020 concluded that the yield delivered from the proposed still was more at the most reduced water depth of 1 cm above literary work verifies that water depth is conversely relative to productivity moreover productivity improves by declining the temperature of glass cover omara et al 2017 badran 2007 described the impact of water sprinkler on cooling condensing cover which reveals a 22 upsurge in yield arunkumar et al 2012 explored the influence of flowing water over the glass s surface and found out enhancement in efficiency by 42 el samadony and kabeel 2014 assessed the performance stepped still while utilizing the film of water cooling on glass cover besides the thickness of water film and the flow rate also investigated the results uncover upgrade in the day by day yield was around 8 2 in the context of the above literary works it was clear that to enrich the profitability of solar still design factors were vital the utilization of nanoparticles was explored only with conventional stills few researchers inspected the impact of nanofluid on stepped still with flat steps in the present work stepped solar still with concave type steps has been structured to assess the effects of various nanoparticles with varying of concentration and the impact of the film of water cooling arrangement over a condensing surface a few targets are defined to address the general objective of the present investigation 1 to design and fabricate the concave shape stepped solar still to maintain the minimum depth of water and to provide maximum surface area for the evaporation 2 to investigate the impact of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles with 0 1 and 0 2 of volume concentration 3 to examine the impact of the film of water cooling arrangement over a condensing surface with 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of nanofluid at first the nanoparticles were preferred reliant on conductivity and price the nanoparticles elected for this examination are mgo al2o3 and tio2 owing to its low cost and conductivity fig 1 represents scanning electron microscope sem images of different nano particles the sem images show that the particles have a nearly spherical shape and uniformly distributed larger particles may be aggregates of the smaller ones for this investigation purpose the molecule size is kept under 40 nm if the particle size is more than 40 nm it is further reduced to nano size using a ball milling technique to attain the equivalent particle size afterwards these nanoparticles blended in the base liquid at volume focus 0 1 and 0 2 the reason for using a lower concentration of nanofluid was to avoid blocking and an overly high pressure drop in addition to that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids is nearly constant at low particle concentrations srivastava 2012 the prepared fluid is laid in a magnetic stirrer to accomplish a uniform blending of nanoparticles with the base liquid and unsettled at

still is fabricated with 10 numbers of steps the basin of the still is made of 1 m2 area with an aluminium material sheet with a thickness of 2 mm 18 gauges aluminium material is selected to fabricate concave steps owing to its capacity to store more quantity of heat and corrosive resistance properties the outer box is manufactured with an acrylic sheet having a thickness of 4 mm fig 4 depicts a concave type stepped basin the tilted cover of a glass with 3 mm thick is utilized as spreader beside it serves as a condensing area for the vapor formed in the basin table 2 depicts all the dimensions of the still the water tank is situated at a reasonable level from the still unit to permit water to stream consistently from its outlet the seawater from the storage chamber enters the stepped basin the evaporation of the salty water takes place in the basin by absorbing the sun radiations the generated vapors collected on to the condensed surface glass this is due to the resilience force initiated by the declination of density where it gets condensed and vapors converted into droplets of water these droplets slide downward and collected in measuring jar a hole drilled in a

based on the climatic conditions of several days the atmospheric temperature wind speed and solar intensity differ from 28 38 c 0 5 7 m s and 360 1575 w m2 respectively the performance of ctsss is assessed by contemplating various cases initially ctsss is utilized with water only without using any nanofluid and its performance is contrasted with different cases of the experiment several researcher studied the heat conduction mechanism in nanofluid chandrasekar and suresh 2009 kamatchi and venkatachalapathy 2015 lee et al 2010 brownian motion and aggregation of nanoparticles are the two mechanism of heat conduction enrichment in nanofluids arunkumar et al 2018 it is well known that to enhance the productivity of still the water temperature should be at higher level and inner glass temperature of condenser cover at lower level panchal and sadasivuni 2020 nanoparticles plays a vital role to enrich the water temperature by absorbing both visible solar radiation and infrared thermal radiations arunkumar et al 2018 from the above said mechanism it proves that nanoparticles improves the heat transfer process and upgrade the temperature of basin water which consequently helps to enhance the productivity of solar still 4 1 ctsss without nanofluid fig 5 depicts the hourly deviation in atmospheric temperature ta water temperature tw glass temperature tg and intensity of radiation it is observed that temperature upsurges from 8 00 to 14 00 then starts to decline due to fewer expenses of sun powered radiations during the experimentation it is found that the temperature of the water is consistently at the higher side when contrasted with a glass temperature the temperature of water and glass shows an increasing trend towards the intensity of radiation maximum water and glass temperature found to be 49 and 42 c respectively at 13 00 with the highest temperature difference tw tg of 7 c ecological parameters principally provoke this temperature distinction 4 2 ctsss with mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid at 0 1 and 0 2 concentration the water and glass temperatures increase with ascend in the concentration of mgo nanofluid from 0 1 to 0 2 fig 6 depicts the temperature of the water increased up to 6 11 at 0 2 mgo nanoparticle as compared with 0 1 concentration besides the glass temperature shows an increasing trend from 8 00 a m to 13 00 but afterwards it starts to decline this is due to the fast evaporation of fluid and nanoparticles ability to conduct the heat with lower heat capacity elango et al 2015 in the same way the temperature of fluid and glass increases with ascend in the concentration of al2o3 nanofluid from 0 1 to 0 2 fig 7 shows water temperature increased to 5 28 at 0 2 al2o3 nanoparticle compared with 0 1 in this case the highest temperature difference tw tg of 11 7 c fig 8 depicts hourly variations of temperature with tio2 nanoparticles tio2 nanoparticle also shows the same trend with the percentage of concentration as demonstrated by mgo and al2o3 nanofluid it is additionally evident that metrological factors have a significant impact on the condensation and evaporation of water subramanian et al 2019 above comparative analysis depicts the water temperature increased to 21 87 and 22 83 with 0 1 and 0 2 mgo nanofluid respectively on comparing the results of al2o3 however the rise in the water temperature up to 26 97 and 30 20 with 0 1 and 0 2 mgo nanofluid respectively on comparing with the results of tio2 furthermore with mgo nanoparticles the water temperature enriched about 28 4 on comparing the results of ctsss without any nanoparticles 4 3 analysis of evaporative and convective heat transfer coefficient htc evaporative htc is determined by using equation 9 fig 9 reveals hourly variations in evaporative htc with mgo al2o3 and tio2 at 0 1 and 0 2 from the figure it is anticipated that from the morning hours htc increases dynamically and reaches the higher side in afternoon sessions between 12 00 to 14 00 then it starts to decay significantly for all the utilized materials with varying quantity an increasing trend is associated with the rate of evaporation and the percentage concentration of nanofluids therefore at 0 2 and 0 1 of mgo the value of evaporative htc is 30 14 and 28 11 w m2k respectively it shows a 7 22 increase in htc with 0 2 of mgo as compared to 0 1 similarly there is a 19 09 increment in htc with 0 2 of al2o3 as compared to 0 1 besides 0 2 of tio2 provides 11 48 ascend in htc as compared to 0 1 table 4 reveals the deviation of heat transfer coefficient in two different approaches among the water surface and internal glass surface it also shows that the estimated value of evaporative htc is more prominent than convection from the experimental database it was observed that mgo nanofluid at 0 2 of concentration provides the highest distillate output the intensity of radiation and the temperature distinction between the evaporative and condensing surface strongly affects the productivity of ctsss panchal et al 2019a the temperature difference is maximum for the time interim between 12 00 to 14 00 it is nearly up to 8 10 c during which still provides averagely 700 and 730 ml of output at 0 1 and 0 2 of mgo nanofluid from fig 10 it is observed that 0 2 of mgo offers a 6 47 rise in the distillate output on comparing with 0 1 of concentration hourly distillate output with al2o3 nanofluids at 0 1 and 0 2 of concentration is depicted in fig 11 it was observed from the experimental database that al2o3 nanofluid at 2 of concentration provides the highest distillate output fig 10 shows ctsss provide maximum production during the time interim of 12 00 to 14 00 4 5 enhancement of the production by the utilization of 0 2 concentration on contrast with 0 1 hourly distillate output with tio2 nanofluids at 0 1 and 0 2 of concentration is depicted in fig 12 tio2 nanofluid at 2 of concentration provides the highest distillate output fig 12 reveals ctsss provides maximum output through the time interim of 12 00 to 14 00 for this duration still provides averagely 608 and 636 ml of the production at 0 1 and 0 2 of tio2 nanofluid which shows 5 46 enhancement in output by the utilization of 0 2 concentration on contrasting with 0 1 of concentration from the above comparative analysis it is inferred that ctsss with 0 2 of mgo nanoparticles provides 10 6 and 18 68 enhancement in output on comparing with output accomplished from 0 2 of al2o3 and tio2 respectively the reason for enhancing production from mgo nanoparticle is higher heat conductive ability than al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles fig 13 depicts the cumulative output for 0 1 and 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids from this figure it is observed that at the initial stages the cumulative output seems to be nearly equivalent for mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids as the hours of the day progresses the distinction in the cumulative output increases significantly besides it is concluded that i 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of mgo nanoparticles provides the highest cumulative output of 4344 and 4625 ml respectively ii the collective output accomplished by the utilization of 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of al2o3 nanoparticles are 4021 and 4202 ml respectively iii the cumulative output of 3695 and 3897 ml is achieved by the usage of 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of tio2 nanoparticles iv the cumulative output of 3272 ml is accomplished with conventional ctsss without utilizing any sort of nanoparticles fig 14 depicts the percentage improvement in the profitability of solar still with different nanofluids and at 0 1 and 0 2 elango et al 2015 besides it is concluded that i the most noteworthy improvement in profitability is found with mgo nanofluid with 0 2 fig 14 clearly shows that with 0 2 and 0 1 of mgo nanofluid ascend in the profitability is around 41 35 and 32 76 respectively on comparing with conventional solar still ii by the utilization of 0 2 and 0 1 of al2o3 nanofluid rise in productivity around 28 42 and 22 89 respectively on comparing with conventional solar still iii similarly 0 2 and 0 1 of tio2 nanofluid the increase in productivity was around 19 10 and 12 93 respectively compared with conventional solar still from the above comparative analysis it is inferred that the productivity of the fluid is still primarily reliant on the fluid s ability to conduct the heat and amount of percentage concentration in nanofluids srivastava 2012 the preferred conclusion was that the experiment conducted with the utilization of nanofluid increases the thermal conductivity of the water up to 20 assael et al 2004 and the distillation process was also faster as compared to experiment conducted with the normal water 4 4 ctsss with mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid at 0 2 concentration along with condensing cover cooling technique the profitability of solar still is strongly influenced by the temperature distinction among evaporative and condensing surfaces omara et al 2017 sharshir et al 2017 therefore in this section the impact of condensing covers cooling is analyzed with 0 2 concentration of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid the primary goal behind the cooling is to upgrade the condensation rate and to upsurge the temperature distinction among the basin and glass cover the cooling process is accomplished by the stream of water over the glass the continuous stream of water over the glass leads to a decline in its temperature significantly moreover this stream of water helps to keep the glass clean as the presence of dust and dirt particles on the condensing surface reduces the productivity of still muftah et al 2014 sharshir et al 2017 fig 15 depicts the variation in temperature difference by utilizing various nanofluids moreover it shows the change in glass and basin temperature around 18 c is the most elevated temperature distinction accomplished with 0 2 of mgo nanofluid with a film of water cooling during the afternoon in the same way 14 5 and 13 7 c is the most elevated temperature distinction accomplished with 0 2 of al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid with a film of water cooling respectively during the afternoon from the relative investigation it is anticipated that because of the course of action of the film cooling and nanofluid the water glass temperature differentiation of the still is significantly more than the conventional still for the duration of the day mehrali et al 2014 meanwhile the temperature of condensing cover is less than the conventional still due to the arrangement of cooling water over a glass the impact of the cooling mechanism gives 72 53 45 42 and 35 87 of the rise in temperature difference with 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively on contrasting with still without cooling arrangement the impact of increased temperature difference directly affects the productivity of still omara et al 2017 panchal et al 2019a fig 16 depicts the enhancement in productivity with the cooling arrangement it is seen that the distillate yield is at the higher side during the time interval of 12 00 to 14 00 this is due to the topmost temperature difference observed during that period for each nanofluid comparative analysis shows productivity accomplished by that 0 2 of mgo with cooling arrangement higher than al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids by an amount of 8 64 and 20 67 respectively fig 17 depicts 51 28 39 24 and 25 37 enhancement in the productivity with 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively with the cooling arrangement when contrasted with the results of conventional solar still without nanofluid and cooling mechanism table 5 depicts the summary of all the modifications and percentage improvement in productivity compared to conventional solar still the comparison of present experimental work with various previous works utilizing nanofluids is represented in table 6 comparative analysis inferred the profitability of solar still is strongly influenced by volume concentration and specific heat of nanoparticles moreover utilization of film of cooling water over the condensing surface helps to enhance the productivity of proposed still 5 conclusion following points are concluded based on the outcomes presented in this context the productivity of ctsss is enhanced with the addition of nanoparticles thermal conductivity of the water increases the up to 20 with the utilization of nanofluid and the distillation process was also faster as compared to experiment conducted with the normal water the most elevated cumulative output of 4 34 and 4 62 l day is accomplished by the utilization of 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of mgo nanoparticles it is clearly observed that with 0 2 and 0 1 of mgo nanofluid improves the profitability is around 41 35 and 32 76 respectively on comparing with conventional solar still without nanofluid productivity is found to be enhanced by 51 28 39 24 and 25 37 with the cooling arrangement and 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively as compared to results of conventional solar still without nanofluid and cooling arrangement glass cover

productivity with water cooling arrangement and 0 2 concentration of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords concave type stepped solar still nanofluid volume concentration water desalination profitability 1 introduction the financial progress of any nation unequivocally relies on the accessibility of energy sources and the amount of freshwater even though the absence of freshwater resources had become a significant challenge just 1 of water around the world is as freshwater assets in comparison the remainder of 97 and 2 exist in seas and arctic zones separately abujazar et al 2018 the significant parameters that cause the reduction in water resources are growth in agronomy sector advancement in industries transport and building industries and a remarkable increase in the populace around the globe therefore it is essential to look for elective sources to supply freshwater particularly in dry areas and inaccessible territory of non water sources solar still is a noteworthy device used for filtering of salty water and then used for consumption purposes kalita et al 2015 there are few conservative methods reverse osmosis electro dialysis membrane distillations etc utilized for distillation purposes pangarkar et al 2011 almadani 2003 but these techniques do not find the significant use in the remote and most arid region due to less accessibility of electric vitality moreover it uses fissile fuels and its exhaust causes ecological contamination which isn t worth for any nation therefore solar desalination seems to be a more robust and promising technique for providing fresh water to remote as well as arid regions sharon and reddy 2015 additionally this process mainly utilizes solar energy which is renewable openly accessible and considered as green and clean vitality as it doesn t make any contamination related issues to the earth kumar et al 2017 the solar desalination process utilizes solar energy of sun radiations these solar radiations used to heat the salted water that results in evaporation the vapors formed owing to evaporation are collected on the condensing surface and condensation of these vapors takes place resulting in droplets of water nevertheless the primary concern associated with solar desalination is its lower yield jamil and akhtar 2019 to overwhelm this issue most of the researchers encouraged to discover a way to upgrade the performance nanoparticles find the vital role in solar desalination technology mahian et al 2013 from the above literature work it is concluded that the solar still has one major disadvantage of less productivity one of the best method to overcome this problem is to use nanoparticle in salt water or brackish water that helps to enhance the thermo physical properties of water which leads increase the heat transfer process inside solar still bozorgan and shafahi 2015 furthermore nano particle possesses better optical absorption capacity subramanian et al 2019 nanofluids can prove as a better choice for absorbing heat from the sun and carry it through various solar thermal systems due to their superior properties nanoparticles have the estimable capacity for engrossing the sun powered radiation in the water as the spectrum of solar radiation matches the optical absorption of nanoparticles with an increment in temperature the thermal conductivity increases subramanian et al 2019 previously nanoparticles have been utilized by various researchers in different types of solar still use of nanofluid cuo and al2o3 in

about 53 95 when contrasted with conventional still gupta et al 2016 assessed the impact of cuo nanoparticles on conventional solar still at 5 and 10 cm depth of water results reveal the productivity is about 3 44 l m2 day and 3 05 l m2 day at 0 05 and 0 1 m water depth respectively nanofluids have various unique properties that appeared differently with its base liquid like more excellent capability to conduct the heat ghozatloo et al 2014 mehrali et al 2014 and high absorbing ability of solar radiations omara et al 2015 that plays the vital role to enhance the productivity of still despite nanoparticles the significance of water depth tiwari and tiwari 2006 and the cooling of the condensing surface similarly have a colossal impact on the productivity of still omara et al 2017 khalifa and hamood 2009 studied the effect of different brine depth on basin type still and suggested declining tendency of productivity was associated with increasing depth of the brine nafey et al 2000 assessed productivity declines by around 14 by increasing the water depth to 7 cm from 2 cm jathar et al 2020 studied various software s to predict the thermal behavior of solar still muthu manokar et al 2020 concluded that the yield delivered from the proposed still was more at the most reduced water depth of 1 cm above literary work verifies that water depth is conversely relative to productivity moreover productivity improves by declining the temperature of glass cover omara et al 2017 badran 2007 described the impact of water sprinkler on cooling condensing cover which reveals a 22 upsurge in yield arunkumar et al 2012 explored the influence of flowing water over the glass s surface and found out enhancement in efficiency by 42 el samadony and kabeel 2014 assessed the performance stepped still while utilizing the film of water cooling on glass cover besides the thickness of water film and the flow rate also investigated the results uncover upgrade in the day by day yield was around 8 2 in the context of the above literary works it was clear that to enrich the profitability of solar still design factors were vital the utilization of nanoparticles was explored only with conventional stills few researchers inspected the impact of nanofluid on stepped still with flat steps in the present work stepped solar still with concave type steps has been structured to

elected for this examination are mgo al2o3 and tio2 owing to its low cost and conductivity fig 1 represents scanning electron microscope sem images of different nano particles the sem images show that the particles have a nearly spherical shape and uniformly distributed larger particles may be aggregates of the smaller ones for this investigation purpose the molecule size is kept under 40 nm if the particle size is more than 40 nm it is further reduced to nano size using a ball milling technique to attain the equivalent particle size afterwards these nanoparticles blended in the base liquid at volume focus 0 1 and 0 2 the reason for using a lower concentration of nanofluid was to avoid blocking and an overly high pressure drop in addition to that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids is nearly constant at low particle concentrations srivastava 2012 the prepared fluid is laid in a magnetic stirrer to accomplish a uniform blending of nanoparticles with the base liquid and unsettled at

channel and the plastic pipe fixed by utilizing adhesive material for the accumulation of distilled water inlet and outlet pipes were being used at the top and bottom of still to feed saline water and to collect distilled water respectively the edges of the still are fixed with rubber gaskets and silica gel to make the basin airtight and minimize the heat losses 2 3 measuring instruments with error analysis k type thermocouples were used at various points to measure the different temperature values tb tw tg and ta the intensity of radiation measured by a well calibrated htc solar power meter having a resolution of 1 w m2 or 1 btu steel rule was located in solar still to measure the level of water measuring container used to quantify the amount of gathered refined water the accuracy and errors of various measuring instruments are depicted in table 3 the error is calculated for thermocouple solar power meter collecting tank and thermometer the percentage error obtained from the following equation 4 error least count minimum value of output measured 3 theory and calculations 3 1 heat exchange through convection mode in solar still convection heat transfer arises among the innermost surface of condensing cover and water surface which is attributable to temperature deviation the convection heat transfer phenomenon is intensely interrelated with properties of the liquid stream features and heat conduction the rate of heat transmission is determined by the following equation velmurugan et al 2008 rubio et al 2004 tiwari et al 2003 5 q c w gi h c w gi t w t gi where h

kind of heat exchange occurs among the water mass and interior portion of the glass cover due to less pressure of the vapor the rate of evaporative heat transfer conveyed in the following equation

based on the climatic conditions of several days the atmospheric temperature wind speed and solar intensity differ from 28 38 c 0 5 7 m s and 360 1575 w m2 respectively the performance of ctsss is assessed by contemplating various cases initially ctsss is utilized with water only without using any nanofluid and its performance is contrasted with different cases of the experiment several researcher studied the heat conduction mechanism in nanofluid chandrasekar and suresh 2009 kamatchi and venkatachalapathy 2015 lee et al 2010 brownian motion and aggregation of nanoparticles are the two mechanism of heat conduction enrichment in nanofluids arunkumar et al 2018 it is well known that to enhance the productivity of still the water temperature should be at higher level and inner glass temperature of condenser cover at lower level panchal and sadasivuni 2020 nanoparticles plays a vital role to enrich the water temperature by absorbing both visible solar radiation and infrared thermal radiations arunkumar et al 2018 from the above said mechanism it proves that nanoparticles improves the heat transfer process and upgrade the temperature of basin water which consequently helps to enhance the productivity of solar still 4 1 ctsss without nanofluid fig 5 depicts the hourly deviation in atmospheric temperature ta water temperature tw glass temperature tg and intensity of radiation it is observed that temperature upsurges from 8 00 to 14 00 then starts to decline due to fewer expenses of sun powered radiations during the experimentation it is found that the temperature of the water is consistently at the higher side when contrasted with a glass temperature the temperature of water and glass shows an increasing trend towards the intensity of radiation maximum water and glass temperature found to be 49 and 42 c respectively at 13 00 with the highest temperature difference tw tg of 7 c ecological parameters principally provoke this temperature distinction 4 2 ctsss with mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid at 0 1 and 0 2 concentration the water and glass temperatures increase with ascend in the concentration of mgo nanofluid from 0 1 to 0 2 fig 6 depicts the temperature of the water increased up to 6 11 at 0 2 mgo nanoparticle as compared with 0 1 concentration besides the glass temperature shows an increasing trend from 8 00 a m to 13 00 but afterwards it starts to decline this is due to the fast evaporation of fluid and nanoparticles ability to conduct the heat with lower heat capacity elango et al 2015 in the same way the temperature of fluid and glass increases with ascend in the concentration of al2o3 nanofluid from 0 1 to 0 2 fig 7 shows water temperature increased to 5 28 at 0 2 al2o3 nanoparticle compared with 0 1 in this case the highest temperature difference tw tg of 11 7 c fig 8 depicts hourly variations of temperature with tio2 nanoparticles tio2 nanoparticle also shows the same trend with the percentage of concentration as demonstrated by mgo and al2o3 nanofluid it is additionally evident that metrological factors have a significant impact on the condensation and evaporation of water subramanian et al 2019 above comparative analysis depicts the water temperature increased to 21 87 and 22 83 with 0 1 and 0 2 mgo nanofluid respectively on comparing the results of al2o3 however the rise in the water temperature up to 26 97 and 30 20 with 0 1 and 0 2 mgo nanofluid respectively on comparing with the results of tio2 furthermore with mgo nanoparticles the water temperature enriched about 28 4 on comparing the results of ctsss without any nanoparticles 4 3 analysis of evaporative and convective heat transfer coefficient htc evaporative htc is determined by using equation 9 fig 9 reveals hourly variations in evaporative htc with mgo al2o3 and tio2 at 0 1 and 0 2 from the figure it is anticipated that from the morning hours htc increases dynamically and reaches the higher side in afternoon sessions between 12 00 to 14 00 then it starts to decay significantly for all the utilized materials with varying quantity an increasing trend is associated with the rate of evaporation and the percentage concentration of nanofluids therefore at 0 2 and 0 1 of mgo the value of evaporative htc is 30 14 and 28 11 w m2k respectively it shows a 7 22 increase in htc with 0 2 of mgo as compared to 0 1 similarly there is a 19 09 increment in htc with 0 2 of al2o3 as compared to 0 1 besides 0 2 of tio2 provides 11 48 ascend in htc as compared to 0 1 table 4 reveals the deviation of heat transfer coefficient in two different approaches among the water surface and internal glass surface it also shows that the estimated value of evaporative htc is more prominent than convection from the experimental database it was observed that mgo nanofluid at 0 2 of concentration provides the highest distillate output the intensity of radiation and the temperature distinction between the evaporative and condensing surface strongly affects the productivity of ctsss panchal et al 2019a the temperature difference is maximum for the time interim between 12 00 to 14 00 it is nearly up to 8 10 c during which still provides averagely 700 and 730 ml of output at 0 1 and 0 2 of mgo nanofluid from fig 10 it is observed that 0 2 of mgo offers a 6 47 rise in the distillate output on comparing with 0 1 of concentration hourly distillate output with al2o3 nanofluids at 0 1 and 0 2 of concentration is depicted in fig 11 it was observed from the experimental database that al2o3 nanofluid at 2 of concentration provides the highest distillate output fig 10 shows ctsss provide maximum production during the time interim of 12 00 to 14 00 4 5 enhancement of the production by the utilization of 0 2 concentration on contrast with 0 1 hourly distillate output with tio2 nanofluids at 0 1 and 0 2 of concentration is depicted in fig 12 tio2 nanofluid at 2 of concentration provides the highest distillate output fig 12 reveals ctsss provides maximum output through the time interim of 12 00 to 14 00 for this duration still provides averagely 608 and 636 ml of the production at 0 1 and 0 2 of tio2 nanofluid which shows 5 46 enhancement in output by the utilization of 0 2 concentration on contrasting with 0 1 of concentration from the above comparative analysis it is inferred that ctsss with 0 2 of mgo nanoparticles provides 10 6 and 18 68 enhancement in output on comparing with output accomplished from 0 2 of al2o3 and tio2 respectively the reason for enhancing production from mgo nanoparticle is higher heat conductive ability than al2o3 and tio2 nanoparticles fig 13 depicts the cumulative output for 0 1 and 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids from this figure it is observed that at the initial stages the cumulative output seems to be nearly equivalent for mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids as the hours of the day progresses the distinction in the cumulative output increases significantly besides it is concluded that i 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of mgo nanoparticles provides the highest cumulative output of 4344 and 4625 ml respectively ii the collective output accomplished by the utilization of 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of al2o3 nanoparticles are 4021 and 4202 ml respectively iii the cumulative output of 3695 and 3897 ml is achieved by the usage of 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of tio2 nanoparticles iv the cumulative output of 3272 ml is accomplished with conventional ctsss without utilizing any sort of nanoparticles fig 14 depicts the percentage improvement in the profitability of solar still with different nanofluids and at 0 1 and 0 2 elango et al 2015 besides it is concluded that i the most noteworthy improvement in profitability is found with mgo nanofluid with 0 2 fig 14 clearly shows that with 0 2 and 0 1 of mgo nanofluid ascend in the profitability is around 41 35 and 32 76 respectively on comparing with conventional solar still ii by the utilization of 0 2 and 0 1 of al2o3 nanofluid rise in productivity around 28 42 and 22 89 respectively on comparing with conventional solar still iii similarly 0 2 and 0 1 of tio2 nanofluid the increase in productivity was around 19 10 and 12 93 respectively compared with conventional solar still from the above comparative analysis it is inferred that the productivity of the fluid is still primarily reliant on the fluid s ability to conduct the heat and amount of percentage concentration in nanofluids srivastava 2012 the preferred conclusion was that the experiment conducted with the utilization of nanofluid increases the thermal conductivity of the water up to 20 assael et al 2004 and the distillation process was also faster as compared to experiment conducted with the normal water 4 4 ctsss with mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid at 0 2 concentration along with condensing cover cooling technique the profitability of solar still is strongly influenced by the temperature distinction among evaporative and condensing surfaces omara et al 2017 sharshir et al 2017 therefore in this section the impact of condensing covers cooling is analyzed with 0 2 concentration of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid the primary goal behind the cooling is to upgrade the condensation rate and to upsurge the temperature distinction among the basin and glass cover the cooling process is accomplished by the stream of water over the glass the continuous stream of water over the glass leads to a decline in its temperature significantly moreover this stream of water helps to keep the glass clean as the presence of dust and dirt particles on the condensing surface reduces the productivity of still muftah et al 2014 sharshir et al 2017 fig 15 depicts the variation in temperature difference by utilizing various nanofluids moreover it shows the change in glass and basin temperature around 18 c is the most elevated temperature distinction accomplished with 0 2 of mgo nanofluid with a film of water cooling during the afternoon in the same way 14 5 and 13 7 c is the most elevated temperature distinction accomplished with 0 2 of al2o3 and tio2 nanofluid with a film of water cooling respectively during the afternoon from the relative investigation it is anticipated that because of the course of action of the film cooling and nanofluid the water glass temperature differentiation of the still is significantly more than the conventional still for the duration of the day mehrali et al 2014 meanwhile the temperature of condensing cover is less than the conventional still due to the arrangement of cooling water over a glass the impact of the cooling mechanism gives 72 53 45 42 and 35 87 of the rise in temperature difference with 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively on contrasting with still without cooling arrangement the impact of increased temperature difference directly affects the productivity of still omara et al 2017 panchal et al 2019a fig 16 depicts the enhancement in productivity with the cooling arrangement it is seen that the distillate yield is at the higher side during the time interval of 12 00 to 14 00 this is due to the topmost temperature difference observed during that period for each nanofluid comparative analysis shows productivity accomplished by that 0 2 of mgo with cooling arrangement higher than al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids by an amount of 8 64 and 20 67 respectively fig 17 depicts 51 28 39 24 and 25 37 enhancement in the productivity with 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively with the cooling arrangement when contrasted with the results of conventional solar still without nanofluid and cooling mechanism table 5 depicts the summary of all the modifications and percentage improvement in productivity compared to conventional solar still the comparison of present experimental work with various previous works utilizing nanofluids is represented in table 6 comparative analysis inferred the profitability of solar still is strongly influenced by volume concentration and specific heat of nanoparticles moreover utilization of film of cooling water over the condensing surface helps to enhance the productivity of proposed still 5 conclusion following points are concluded based on the outcomes presented in this context the productivity of ctsss is enhanced with the addition of nanoparticles thermal conductivity of the water increases the up to 20 with the utilization of nanofluid and the distillation process was also faster as compared to experiment conducted with the normal water the most elevated cumulative output of 4 34 and 4 62 l day is accomplished by the utilization of 0 1 and 0 2 concentration of mgo nanoparticles it is clearly observed that with 0 2 and 0 1 of mgo nanofluid improves the profitability is around 41 35 and 32 76 respectively on comparing with conventional solar still without nanofluid productivity is found to be enhanced by 51 28 39 24 and 25 37 with the cooling arrangement and 0 2 of mgo al2o3 and tio2 nanofluids respectively as compared to results of conventional solar still without nanofluid and cooling arrangement glass cover

11993,this study aims to assess the effect of climate change on water resources in semi arid environments taking the essaouira region in morocco as an example analysis of climate data shows a decrease in precipitation of 12 16 and an increase in air temperature of 2 3 c over the past three decades a continuous drop in the piezometric level of more than 12 m for the cenomanian turonian aquifer 17 m for the plio quaternary aquifer around 8 m for the barremian aptian aquifer and 5 m for the hauterivian hydrogeochemical analysis together show that i the groundwater mineralization is controlled by the dissolution of evaporitic and carbonates minerals by the reverse ions exchange phenomenon and by sea water intrusion especially at plio quaternary aquifer and ii the groundwater quality in the study area deteriorates gradually over time and space the isotopic data shows that i the groundwater recharge in the study area is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without significant evaporation and that ii climate change has no remarkable effect on the isotopic content of the groundwater of the study area however the results of this article reflect that the essaouira basin is very vulnerable to climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords semi arid zone global warming groundwater isotopy hydrogeochemistry 1 introduction climate change is a global issue involving the long term complex interactions between environmental factors and economic social technological and political conditions which cause significant effects at regional level alpert et al 2008 misra 2014 including the maghreb northwest africa region that includes the study area almazroui et al 2020 bahir et al 2016 2020a el kharraz et al 2012 nagraj et al 2020 ouhamdouch et al 2018 2020 ragab and prudhomme 2002 in arid and semi arid regions rainfall is one of the determining factors for climatic characterization the study of recent climatic evolution is an essential tool to arrive at optimal general solutions to the problems resulting from the relationship between water requirement and their availability and therefore better management of water resource bahir et al 2018 2019 carreira et al 2018 ragab and prudhomme 2002 studies on climate change show that global warming in the maghreb region is more significant than the global average while on a global scale the temperature increase is estimated at 0 74 c in the 20th century is has oscillated between 1 and 2 c on the scale mediterranean and the north africa ebtehal et al 2020 giec 2007 ouhamdouch et al 2018 as for precipitation it has decreased in the mediterranean region in the sahel in southern africa and in certain parts of south asia at different temporal and spatial scales ajayi and ilori 2020 boudiaf et al 2020 alpert et al 2008 ipcc 2013 morocco like the mediterranean countries vicente serrano 2006 has suffered from several periods of drought bahir et al 2002 driouech 2010 babqiqi 2014 its water resources are limited and are estimated to be 20 billion cubic meters with an average per capita annual consumption of 700 m3 which corresponds to fairly high water stress the number of years with rainfall deficit is greater than the number of wet years driouech 2010 stour and agoumi 2008 especially the cycles of 1980 1985 1990 1995 and 2007 2010 according to babqiqi 2014 the comparison of the average annual temperatures over the two periods 1971 1980 and 1998 2007 shows an increasing trend from 0 3 to 2 5 c depending on the region this decrease in precipitation and the increase in temperatures linked to the climate change are likely to have a negative impact on water resources especially in arid and semi arid areas in these regions few studies have been done to assess the climate change impact on water resources but they are generally focused on surface water abutaleb et al 2018 hallouz et al 2019 xu et al 2004 some other studies have evaluated the global warming effect on groundwater by limiting them to the piezometric and or hydrochemical approach lyazidi et al 2020 al maktoumi et al 2018 bahir et al 2020b berhail 2019 lachaal et al 2018 for this study we assessed the impact of climate change on the water resource of the essaouira basin morocco by combining several approaches such as hydroclimatology piezometry hydrochemistry and isotopy the presence of a database of more than 30 years on piezometry hydrochemistry and stable isotopes as well as the importance of essaouira basin on a moroccan scale are the reasons why we chose this basin since the essaouira basin is characterized by the total absence of industrial activity and the agricultural activity practiced is of the subsistence type this basin is a typical basin to assess the climate change impact on the water resource this is another reason for the choice of this basin 2 study area the study area essaouira syncline basin covers an area of 6000 km2 it is part of the atlantic atlas which is the westernmost part of the southwestern moroccan basin duffaud 1960 this basin is bounded to the north by hadid anticline to the south by tidzi wadi wadi is arabic word for valley to the east by the bouabout region and to the west by the atlantic ocean it is subdivided into two parts the first one known as the bouabout unit upstream part and the second one the coastal zone downstream part fig 1a from a morphological point of view the study area is made up of a set of synclinal basins filled with formations ranging from the triassic to the quaternary fig 1b in their age the elevation varies between 400 and 1600 m for the upstream part and is less than 400 m for the downstream part hydrographically the study area is characterized by a less developed network this is mainly represented by ouazzi wadi in the north and igouzoullene wadi in the south passing through ksob wadi resulting from the confluence of igrounzar and zelten wadi and through tidzi wadi all of these wadis valleys flow into the atlantic ocean fig 1b geologically the upstream part of the study area is marked by the outcrop of formations of middle and upper cretaceous age in particular albian vraconian cenomanian and turonian duffaud 1960 amghar 1989 formations supplement1 these formations are composed of limestone and dolomitic benches interspersed with marl and sandstone the albian vraconian formations contain sandstone and dolomitic limestones alternating with sandstone banks and sandy clays the cenomanian about 200 m thickness is represented by alternating marls with anhydrite lumachellic and dolomitic limestones as for the turonian formation it is composed of limestones with an abundance of silica these synclines contain important water reservoirs notably the cenomanian turonian aquifer which remains the most important in the region according to jalal et al 2001 this aquifer has transmissivities varying between 2 2 10 4 and 2 7 10 1 m2 s the downstream part contains 2 important aquifers i the plio quaternary and the ii turonian in the northern part between ksob wadi and tidzi wadi iii the barremian aptian located between tidzi wadi and amssittene anticline and iv the hauterivian which marks the southern limit of the study area is interposed between the amssittene anticline and igouzoullene wadi fig 1b the plio quaternary aquifer is characterized by a matrix of calcareous sandstone it contains an important water table the wall of which is formed in the synclinal structure by the marls of senonian supplement 1 according to mennani 2001 this water table has transmissivities varying between 6 1 10 2 and 4 5 10 5 m2 s as for the turonian represented by limestones it contains a captive aquifer under the senonian marls in the synclinal structure and is probably in direct contact with the plio quaternary at the confines of this structure supplement 1 it has a transmissivity ranging between 0 8 10 4 and 2 7 10 2 m2 s mennani 2001 the barremo aptian aquifer contains rocks of the barremian formation about 70 m thickness represented by an alternation of gray marl with traces of gypsum fractured fossiliferous limestones and sandstone and aptian formation rocks about 100 m thickness composed of red clays and sandstone with intercalations of dolomitic sandstones or bioclastic limestones duffaud 1960 duffaud et al 1966 supplement 1 the transmissivity is of the order of 1 5 10 3 m2 s mennani 2001 the hauterivian aquifer whose thickness is about 200 m is composed of marly clays and fractured siliceous limestones marly and dolomitic limestones more or less fractured fig 3 duffaud 1960 duffaud et al 1966 according to mennani 2001 this aquifer has transmissivities varying between 1 6 10 5 and 6 7 10 5 m2 s 3 materials and methods in this investigation field and laboratory analysis data of nine campaigns 1990 1995 1997 2009 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were used to assess the quality of groundwater in the essaouira region in the context of climate change electrical conductivities conductivity temperature ph and nitrate concentration were measured in situ with a portable multiparametric instrument hanna hi9829 while the depth of the water level in the wells was measured using a 200 m piezometric probe the chemical analyses of water samples collected during different field campaigns from 1990 to 2009 were carried out in the hydrogeology laboratory of the faculty of sciences semlalia at the cadi ayyad university marrakech morocco as for the water samples collected during the field campaigns from 2015 to 2019 the analyses were carried out in the laboratory of geosciences and environment at the ecole normale superieure ens of marrakech morocco the so4 2 anion contents were determined by the nephelometric method rodier et al 2009 concentrations of ca2 and mg2 cations were measured by the complexometry method edta and those of cl by the mohr method rodier et al 2009 the na and k contents were determined by flame photometry rodier et al 2009 as for hco3 concentrations they were determined by titration using a sulfuric acid solution all the samples display an ion balance with an error of less than 10 which allowed us to validate the obtained results the obtained results are presented in appendix 1 a total of 46 samples collected in april 2016 22 samples and in may 2018 24 samples were analyzed for stable oxygen 18 and deuterium and radioactive tritium isotopes the 22 water samples collected in 2016 represent the cenomanian turonian aquifer the upstream part of the study area and 24 water samples collected in 2018 represent the plio quaternary aquifer 18 samples the turonian aquifer 4 samples and surface water 2 samples the analyses for stable isotopic elements δ2h and δ18o were carried out at the nuclear technology institute in lisbon portugal and the laboratory of radio analysis and environment lrae at the national school of engineers of sfax tunisia by using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method icp ms the tritium 3h content was determined by the electrolytic enrichment technique followed by the liquid scintillation counting method lucas and unterweger 2000 at nuclear technology institute in lisbon portugal geographic information system gis was used in mapping of the spatial distribution of the electrical conductivity and the physicochemical elements the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 was used to calculate the saturation indices si using the following formula si log k iap k sp where kiap is the product of the ionic activity of ions and ksp is the mineral solubility product the saturation index corresponds to the deviation from the equilibrium of the water from the mineral phase if si 0 the water is in equilibrium if si is negative the water is undersaturated with respect to the mineral and if si is positive the water is supersaturated with respect to this mineral 4 results and discussion 4 1 climatic parameters precipitations and temperatures the climate parameter data used in this study were obtained from the tensift hydraulic basin agency abht analysis of precipitation data for an observation period of 38 years 1978 2015 for the study area reveals significant variability on an annual scale fig 2 indeed this rainfall is subject to fluctuations from one year to another with wet and other dry periods of two to five consecutive years the height of the precipitated sheet of water varies between a minimum of 135 mm measured in 2008 and a maximum of 707 mm measured in 1996 with an average of 304 mm the application of the pettitt test pettitt 1979 table 1 with a 90 confidence level shows the presence of a break in the pluviometric series in 1999 this test made it possible to split the rainfall series into two sub series the average of annual rainfall before and after this break is a1 313 8 first sub series and a2 263 4 second sub series mm respectively this makes it possible to estimate a rainfall deficit of 16 the results of the mann kendall trend test table 1 displays a negative multivariable standard normal umk umk 1 09 this reflects a downward trend in precipitation and confirms the results of the pettitt test the evolution study of annual atmospheric temperatures was carried out over for 28 years 1987 2015 maximum temperatures range between 29 3 and 37 2 c with an average of 34 2 c as for the minimum temperatures they range between 2 4 and 9 3 c with an average of 7 4 c while the average temperatures vary between 17 7 and 22 4 c with an average of 20 c fig 3a the application of the pettitt test with a significance level equal to 5 shows the existence of a significant break in the series of maximum average and minimum annual temperatures respectively in 1999 2000 and 1994 fig 3b the maximum average annual temperatures values before and after this break are 32 75 and 35 53 c with an increase of 2 8 c the average means annual temperatures values before and after this break are 18 85 and 21 13 c respectively with a warming of 2 3 c the average minimum annual temperatures before and after the break are 5 66 and 8 14 c respectively with an increase of 2 5 c the rupture date of the maximum and the mean temperature series are approximately the same and this could be explained by the fact that these two parameters exhibit the same evolution during the study period as for the series of minimum temperature values it presents an early break 1994 this could be explained by the very cold temperatures experienced in the study area in 1988 1989 and 1990 start of the series this upward trend is corroborated by the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 with a positive multivariable standard normal umk for annual maximum temperatures umk 5 24 for annual mean temperatures umk 5 65 and annual minimum temperatures umk 4 65 the gaussen diagram gaussen 1954 corresponds to the intersection of the monthly average precipitation curve and the monthly average temperature curve for the same station when the precipitation curve is above the temperatures curve we talk about a wet period while the dry period takes place when the precipitation curve is below that of temperatures this diagram distinguishes a dry period from a wet period hannachi and fenni 2013 for this study and during the period 1987 2000 fig 3c shows a dry period from april to september and a wet period from october to march however the groundwater recharge rate could be more important during the wet period than the dry period by comparing the length of the dry period during the two periods 1987 2000 and 2001 2014 we can see that it experienced an extension of about one month during the latest period this will undoubtedly influence the groundwater recharge 4 2 piezometry the evolution of the groundwater piezometric surface is closely related to the variation of precipitation bahir et al 2016 ouhamdouch et al 2016 the degree of exploitation and the contributions from surface water the piezometric maps drawn up from the data of september 1990 june 1995 march 1997 october 2007 june 2015 april 2016 april 2017 may 2018 and march 2019 campaigns for the aquifers of the essaouira basin show that for the upstream part of the basin the groundwater has a general flow direction from se to nw for the southern part and from ne sw for the northern part fig 4a this flow is conditioned by the substratum of the reservoir studied over a 24 year observation period 1995 2019 the groundwater maintains the same direction of flow with a decline in the piezometric level this drawdown is manifested for example by the offset of the piezometric curves 450 and 600 m more and more upstream and this on the two piezometric maps fig 4a monitoring the evolution of the piezometric level of the wells whose water level was measured during october 2007 april 2016 april 2017 may 2018 and march 2019 is shown in fig 5 this shows that all of the wells have suffered a decline in their piezometric levels it reached 9 3 m at well o30 and 12 6 m at well 75 52 between 2007 and 2019 for the downstream part the general direction of groundwater flow of the plio quaternary aquifer and that of the barremian aptian is generally from south east to north west fig 4b and c the groundwater flow within the plio quaternary aquifer is imposed by the inclination of its substratum while for the barremian aptian the flow is imposed by the north flank of the amssittene anticline and the uplift of the substratum of the lower cretaceous formations concerning the hauterivian aquifer the general direction of flow is from the northeast to the southwest and this follow the southern flank of the amssittene anticline the same remark observed for the downstream part the groundwater keeps the same direction of the flow with a decline in the piezometric level over a 29 year observation period 1990 2019 fig 4b the groundwater of the plio quaternary aquifer maintains the same direction of flow with a decent piezometric level this situation is materialized for example by the shift of the isopiezes 40 and 180 m more and more upstream and this on the two piezometric maps the evolution of the piezometric level of the wells capturing this aquifer and having experienced measurements of their water body during 1990 1995 2000 2004 2009 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 table 2 shows a reduction in the plan of water at these wells it reached 17 m at well 261 51 and 6 6 m at well 140 51 between 1990 and 2019 the drought of 1995 the driest year in morocco during the 20th century led to a general decline in the water level babqiqi 2014 bahir et al 2002 over a 43 year observation period 1976 2019 fig 4c the groundwater of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifer maintains the same direction of flow with a decent piezometric level with a total of nine wells in which six wells tap the barremian aptian aquifer and three taps the hauterivian aquifer measurement of the groundwater level of the aforementioned aquifers 1976 1997 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 shows a decrease in piezometric levels table 3 for the barremian aptien aquifer it reached 9 1 m at well 176 51 and 8 8 m at well 173 51 between 1976 and 2019 i e an average annual decrease of 0 2 m as for the hauterivian aquifer this reduction reached 4 8 m at the level of well p6 and 3 m at the level of well 193 51 i e an average annual decrease of 0 11 and 0 07 m respectively concerning the land use the sector of study is characterized by the dominance of forest of argan tree argan tree is an endemic plant and the absence of the soil outcropping of the geological formations in the open air ouhamdouch et al 2015 except at the banks of the wadis this imposes on the population to practice a food producing type of agricultural activity and to move towards grazing in parallel to this agricultural activity as another source of subsistence however the exploitation of groundwater in this basin is generally dedicated to the supply of drinking water and the watering of livestock following the absence of industrial activity in the study area and the food type based agricultural activity practiced by the population ouhamdouch et al 2019 the decrease in the piezometric level could only be explained by the decrease in precipitation under the effect of climate change 4 3 hydrogeochemistry groundwater chemistry is largely influenced by the characteristics of the host rock the hydrodynamics of the aquifers and also by the climatic and exploitation conditions which makes hydrogeochemistry a valuable tool in the characterization of groundwater 4 3 1 chemical facies to specify the groundwater chemical facies in the study area the major element composition has been plotted on the piper diagram piper 1944 for the cenomanian turonian aquifer representing the upstream part of the basin studied the projection of the analyzed samples on the piper diagram fig 6a shows that the waters have a mixed facies between cl na cl ca mg so4 ca mg and hco3 ca mg in 1995 the majority of the samples presented a cl ca mg facies for the samples of the 2007 campaign the chemical facies of the waters are of cl ca mg so4 ca mg and hco3 ca mg type with the dominance of the cl ca mg type as for the samples analyzed in 2016 they have a facies of cl na type and of the cl ca mg and so4 ca mg type for the 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns we note that the analyzed waters present three types of facies cl na cl ca mg so4 ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the cl ca mg type a comparison of the results of the 1995 campaign and those of 2019 fig 6b shows that the groundwater facies of the cenomanian turonian aquifer have not experienced any remarkable change for groundwater of the downstream part the analysis of the piper diagrams for the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers fig 7 a and b shows that they are classified under a mixed facies between cl na and cl ca mg the regrouping of the points of the plio quaternary aquifer near the turonian aquifer suggests an interconnection between these two aquifers the comparison between the results of 1990 and 2019 is presented in fig 7c this shows that there is a slight evolution in the chemical facies of the plio quaternary groundwater indeed on the cations triangle concerning the 1990 campaign the majority of the points have a percentage higher than 50 in na with a tendency towards the na pole however in 2019 the majority of the points do not exceed 50 in na with a tendency towards the center of the sorting no dominant cations for the anion triangle a clear dominance of cl is noted whether in 1990 or in 2019 the position of certain samples relative to the sample representing seawater on the piper diagram suggests that the plio quaternary aquifer is probably affected by the marine intrusion the groundwater of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers generally presents three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the second facies fig 8 a and b the dominance of cl over hco3 could be explained by the influence of triassic saliferous formations the comparison between the water points sampled in 1997 and 2019 fig 8c shows a remarkable evolution in the groundwater chemistry of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers from the mixed facies cl na and cl ca mg to the facets cl ca mg 4 3 2 groundwater mineralization to determine the origin and the main processes responsible for the groundwater mineralization of the study area the correlations between the main major elements have been studied chloride is a conservative ion that is always found in natural waters at very variable contents fetter 1993 justin et al 2018 and sodium is generally associated with chlorides chlorides concentrations in groundwater of the upstream part vary widely from 113 to 1818 mg l with an average of 574 mg l as for those of sodium they vary between 12 and 541 mg l with an average of 167 mg l according to the piper diagram fig 6 it can be seen that the cl ions are the most dominant in the waters for the downstream part the cl contents vary between 120 and 4800 mg l with an average of 620 mg l and the na concentrations vary between 28 and 1950 mg l with an average of 261 mg l the highest na and cl contents are observed at the plio quaternary aquifer the na vs cl correlation diagram fig 9a shows a significant positive correlation between these two ions this reflects that these two elements probably have the same origin some points are scattered around the halite dissolution line line 1 1 reflecting the contribution of this mineral in the groundwater mineralization of the study area this hypothesis is confirmed by negative values of the saturation indices with respect to this mineral fig 10 the rest of the samples are located below the line 1 1 and parallel to it reflecting a na deficit this suggests the contribution of a phenomenon other than the halite dissolution in the groundwater mineralization the na deficit compared to cl could be linked to the basic exchange reactions as shown in fig 9f with the aquifer matrix where the na ions are released from the complex and are replaced by ca2 ions according to equation 1 capaccioni et al 2005 1 na 1 2 ca x 2 na x 1 2 ca 2 with x being the natural exchanger also an excess of na could be explained by the second type of cations exchange where the ca2 and or mg2 ions will be released in water and the na ions will be fixed by the matrix according to equation 2 2 1 2 ca 2 na x 1 2 ca x 2 na the ca2 contents of the groundwater from the upstream part vary between 82 and 770 mg l with an average of 214 mg l as for those of so4 2 they vary between 13 and 1942 mg l with an average of 339 mg l as for the downstream part the ca2 concentrations oscillate between 64 and 850 mg l with an average of 158 mg l and those of so4 2 vary between 30 and 830 with an average of 147 mg l fig 9b shows the existence of a significant correlation between the ca2 and so4 2 ions indeed the points whose ca2 so4 2 molar ratio is close to or equal to 1 reflect the same origin of these two ions which could be the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite this is confirmed by negative values of the indices of saturation with respect to gypsum and or anhydrite fig 10 however the excess of ca2 compared to so4 2 observed for the majority of the points could be linked to the phenomenon of reverse bases exchange also the saturation indices calculated for these points with respect to carbonate minerals are close to or greater than zero corroborating that the enrichment of ca2 is mainly due to the bases exchange fig 9f the ca2 vs mg2 diagram fig 9c shows a positive correlation between these two ions this reflects that these two elements come from the same origin the majority of the points are scattered around the dolomite dissolution line line 1 1 thus suggesting the contribution of the dissolution of this mineral to the groundwater mineralization other points are located above the line 1 1 confirming the contribution of the bases exchange process in the groundwater mineralization of the aquifers studied the ca2 vs hco3 correlation fig 9d shows that these two elements do not have a significant correlation and that the majority of the analyzed samples show a ca2 hco3 molar ratio greater than 1 this excess of ca2 compared to hco3 ions translates the existence of other sources of calcium which could be the phenomenon of ion exchange and that of dedolomitization incongruent dissolution of dolomite accompanied by simultaneous precipitation of calcite 4 3 3 evolution of groundwater salinity the groundwater salinization is a very marked phenomenon in areas of water scarcity especially the saharan arid and semi arid zones the scarcity or even the absence of surface water and the increasing demand for water as well as the decrease in precipitation have created enormous pressures on groundwater which have thus resulted in the degradation of their quality the spatial temporal distribution of salinity was studied to assess the impact of climate change on the groundwater quality by using the results of the campaigns of 1995 2007 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 for the upstream part the 1995 campaign shows the salinity values vary between 0 2 and 1 9 g l with an average of 0 7 g l in 2007 the salinity values fluctuated between 0 5 and 2 4 g l with an average of 1 1 g l as for the 2016 campaign its values vary between 0 3 and 4 6 g l with an average of 1 37 g l for the 2017 campaign the salinity fluctuates between 0 3 and 4 g l with an average of 1 29 g l in 2018 the salinity values vary between 0 4 and 4 3 g l with an average of 1 4 g l and between 0 35 and 4 4 g l with an average of 1 4 for samples from the 2019 campaign fig 11 fig 11 shows that the salinity values become more important from 1995 to 2019 and from the east to the west taking for example the region of sebt kourimat recharge area of the cenomanian turonian aquifer the salinity values fluctuate around 0 46 g l in 1995 to reach 2 9 g l in 2019 however the general spatial temporal evolution of salinity shows an increasing trend for the downstream part the groundwater from the plio quaternary aquifer has salinity values varying between 0 6 and 3 4 g l with an average of 1 7 g l in 1990 between 0 9 and 3 g l with an average of 1 6 g l in 1995 from 0 4 to 4 1 g l with an average of 1 3 g l in 2004 between 0 9 and 2 2 g l with an average of 1 4 g l in 2009 from 0 3 to 4 7 with an average of 1 5 g l in 2015 between 0 4 and 4 8 g l with an average of 1 53 g l in 2017 between 0 5 and 6 5 g l with an average of 1 6 g l in 2018 and between 0 46 and 8 4 g l with an average of 1 7 g l in 2019 fig 12 from the maps of fig 12 the highest values are observed in the southern and western part and this further to the remoteness to the recharge zones to the residence time to the influence of the triassic terrains and to the influence from the sea marine intrusion well 11 51 while the low values of salinity are recorded in the north along the ksob wadi and in the east of the plio quaternary aquifer which represent the recharge zones these low values are due to the fact that these places represent the recharge zones of this aquifer the temporal evolution of groundwater salinity of the plio quaternary aquifer shows an upward trend going from year to year and consequently deterioration in the groundwater quality as for the turonian aquifer the minimum values of salinity are around 0 8 g l and the maximum values are around 1 3 g l with an average of 1 1 g l and this for 2004 2009 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns fig 12 the temporal evolution of the groundwater salinity of this aquifer does not show a significant trend this could be explained by its significant depth and its captive nature concerning the barremian aptian aquifer the salinity values vary between 0 2 and 3 2 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the points representing the 1997 campaign from 0 3 to 2 1 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the samples collected in 2015 and 2017 between 0 4 and 2 8 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the points of 2018 campaign waters and between 0 7 and 2 4 g l with an average of 1 2 g l for 2019 campaign fig 13 the spatial temporal distribution of the groundwater salinity of the barremian aptian aquifer fig 13 shows a slight upward trend in the minimum values of the salinity while the maximum values have experienced slight stability for the hauterivian aquifer the salinity values vary between 0 6 and 2 6 g l with an average for waters representing the 1997 campaign between 0 5 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2015 samples between 0 6 and 1 2 g l with an average of 0 9 g l for the points of the 2017 campaign between 0 4 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2018 campaign and between 0 4 and 1 3 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2019 samples the spatial temporal distribution of the salinity of the hauterivian aquifer shows a slight dilution of the waters analyzed in 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 compared to those representing the 1997 campaign this could be explained by the installation of the igouzoullene dam in 2004 in upstream favoring the recharge of this aquifer however the increase in the groundwater mineralization is due to the combined effect of the contamination of groundwater by seawater natural effect particularly along the coast line and the poor protection of catchments effect anthropogenic consequently these two effects lead to an increase in the groundwater salinity in the study area as the study area is under a semi arid climate with a tendency towards an arid climate in recent years accompanied by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in the temperature which frequently causes intense periods of drought resulting in evaporation that affects surface and groundwater especially the shallow waters the degradation of the groundwater quality is mainly due to this situation decrease in precipitation and an increase in the temperature and the decrease in the piezometric level caused by climate change 4 4 isotopy the isotopic approach is of crucial importance in studies of aquifer systems they make it possible to determine the groundwater origin and their residence times to identify and quantify the rate of mixing between two types of water and to locate the recharge areas fontes 1976 for the upstream part cenomanian turonian aquifer the oxygen 18 contents vary between a minimum of 6 vs smow and a maximum of 3 3 vs smow with an average of 4 9 vs smow for deuterium the maximum value is 20 2 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 34 5 vs smow with an average of 28 4 vs smow appendix 2 as for the downstream part the contents of oxygen 18 vary between a minimum of 5 vs smow and a maximum of 1 8 vs smow with an average of 3 9 vs smow for the plio quaternary aquifer and between a minimum of 5 vs smow and a maximum of 4 4 vs smow with an average of 4 7 vs smow for the turonian aquifer for deuterium contents the maximum value is 8 9 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 29 7 vs smow with an average value of 22 6 vs smow for the plio quaternary layer as for the turonian the maximum value is 27 3 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 28 5 vs smow with an average value of 27 9 vs smow appendix 2 the comparison of the stable isotope contents of the upstream part and the downstream part of the essaouira basin shows a slight depletion of the waters of the upstream part compared to those of the downstream part in these isotopes this is due to the remoteness from the coast in the absence of a local meteorological line characterizing the isotopic composition of the rainwater in the study area the meteoric line with equation δ2h 7 95δ18o 11 3 was considered by mennani et al 2001 as an input function for the aquifer systems of the essaouira basin fig 14 representing the variation of δ2h vs δ18o of the groundwater representing the cenomanian turonian aquifer shows that some samples are located above the global meteoric water line gmwl and around the local meteoric water line lmwl this reflects that the aquifer recharge is ensured by the infiltration of precipitation of oceanic origin without significant evaporation while some points are located below gmwl suggesting that these points have evaporated before being infiltrated to the aquifer the sample of precipitation is an annual average of samples collected in 2004 2006 2016 and 2018 as for the seawater sample we refer to values obtained by carreira et al 2014 the distribution of representative samples of the groundwater representing the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers downstream part on the correlation diagram δ2h vs δ18o fig 14 shows that the majority of the points are scattered around the gmwl and lmwl reflecting a recharge by infiltration of oceanic rainwater group1 this supply of the shallow aquifer by rainwater which is at the origin of the reduction in the salinity of the waters in these wells is in perfect agreement with the hydrogeochemical data in particular well 27 51 which has low salinity this well is the closest to the freshwater pole other local recharge points for rainwater have been identified in the bowl of the essaouira basin example o6 15 51 this recharge is probably favored by the lithological nature and the small thickness of the unsaturated zone this group contains both the majority of the samples representing the shallow plio quaternary aquifer and all the water points representing the deep turonian aquifer this suggests the existence of a connection between these two aquifer systems other water points are distinguished by their position below the gmwl group 2 they line up along a line with a slope less than 8 characteristics of evaporation phenomenon this last process mainly concerns surface waters o98 and o99 and wells 105 51 and 327 51 located respectively in the northeast and south part of the aquifer fig 14 evaporation can probably take place before water infiltration in the unsaturated zone in the same diagram well 11 51 is aligned on the freshwater seawater mixture line this confirms that the increase in mineralization in this well is caused by the phenomenon of marine intrusion following the availability of tritium data only the cenomanian turonian aquifer was the subject of the groundwater dating in the study area however the tritium contents vary between 0 and 2 1tu the highest values were recorded in the et tleta hanchane region and the kourimat region this confirms that the recharge of the aquifer through rainwater is low and limited to a few regions fig 15 according to mazor 1991 a tritium content greater than 1 tu indicates a post nuclear recharge and content less than 1 tu represents a pre nuclear recharge or a mixture between recent and old waters the high tritium levels have been observed in the kourimat and et tleta hanchane region recharge zone and they can be attributed to the recent infiltration of precipitation the projection of the samples from the two 2016 and 2007 campaigns fig 15 shows that certain points are located above the line 1 tu reflecting a recent recharge of the cenomanian turonian aquifer while the other points are located above below this line confirming a pre nuclear recharge a comparison of the 3h content of the same water point sampled in 2007 and 2016 shows a decrease in the 3h content this decrease could be explained by the low recharge rate caused by the decrease in the precipitation rate which the study sector has experienced in recent decades under the effect of climate change to get an idea on the evolution of 18o contents of groundwater in the context of climate change we have based on the two plio quaternary and turonian aquifers where we have monitoring of the isotopic signature the results are grouped in fig 16 the correlation diagram 18o 2h for each point during the 23 year 1995 2018 shows that the recharge of the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without notable evaporation only two points are located below the gmwl it is point 272 51 in 2004 and point 11 51 in 2018 this situation could be explained by the fact that point 272 51 underwent evaporation before infiltration while point 11 51 underwent marine contamination as shown in fig 17 where the electrical conductivity is around 10 ms cm according to fig 17 we see that the increase in electrical conductivity salinity is accompanied by a very small increase in the 18 oxygen contents this slight enrichment in 18o 1 1 5 may be due to the effect of evaporation caused by the increase in air temperature under the effect of climate change this suggests that the isotopic content of the study area is impacted by climatic variations and therefore it can be concluded that global warming has an effect on the isotopic signature of groundwater within the essaouira basin 5 conclusions the water resource within the essaouira basin is limited and unevenly distributed in space and time this problem could limit water supply which will be aggravated by the depletion of this resource due to the climate change impact which has become an ambiguous reality and whose effects on the environment are already visible the combination of hydroclimatic piezometric hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches in the study of the groundwater resource within the essaouira basin led to the following conclusions the analysis results of the annual precipitation time series using the statistical tests in particular that of pettitt and that of mann kendall made it possible to detect a decrease in precipitation in the whole basin of 12 16 this decrease in precipitation is accompanied by an increase in temperatures with a significant extent of warming of 2 3 c based on the gaussen diagram the comparison of the duration of the dry period for the two periods 1987 2000 and 2001 2014 shows an extension of one month this will no doubt have a negative effect on the groundwater recharge the piezometric approach has shown that the cenomanian turonian plio quaternary barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers have retained the general direction of flow of their groundwater during the study period monitoring the piezometry over a period of 24 years 1995 2019 for the cenomanian turonian aquifer 29 years 1990 2019 for the plio quaternary aquifer and 43 years 1976 2019 for the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers shows a continuous drop in the piezometric level which exceeds 12 m for the cenomanian turonian aquifer 17 m for the plio quaternary aquifer around 8 m for the barremian aptian aquifer and 5 m for the hauterivian aquifer the general decline in the piezometric level could be explained by the decrease in precipitation following the harmful effect of climate change this drawdown would probably cause a qualitative degradation of groundwater the hydrogeochemical study showed that the groundwater of the cenomanian turonian aquifer presents the cl ca mg cl ca cl na and hco3 ca mix facies with the dominance of the cl ca mg mix facies and cl ca the study of the temporal evolution of these facies shows that there has been no remarkable change the groundwater of the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers are of mixed type between cl na and cl ca mg the chemical facies experienced a slight evolution from the cl na facies to the cl na and cl ca mg facies for the plio quaternary aquifer and from the cl na facies to the cl ca mg facies for the turonian aquifer as for the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers they generally have three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the cl ca mg facies for the study period a remarkable evolution of the facies was observed from the cl na facies to the cl ca mg facies examination of the correlations established between the concentrations of major elements has shown that the mineralization of groundwater is controlled by the phenomenon of the dissolution of the evaporitic minerals halite gypsum and or anhydrites and carbonates dolomite by the reverse ion exchange phenomenon and by the marine intrusion especially at the plio quaternary aquifer the study of the spatio temporal evolution of the groundwater quality in the study area shows a gradual deterioration in time and space the tracing of the groundwater in the essaouira basin by stable isotopes has shown that the groundwater recharge in the upstream part of the basin studied is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin without significant evaporation the same method of recharging is marked at the downstream part with this time the presence of contamination by seawater tritium tracing based on the same wells sampled in 2007 and 2016 shows a significant decrease that reaches 2 tu in certain wells this trend could be explained by the low recharge rate following the decrease in the precipitation rate experienced by the study area in recent years the temporal evolution of the 18o contents generally shows slight enrichment of 1 1 5 this may be due to the effect of evaporation caused by the increase in air temperature under the effect of climate change however the essaouira basin is more

11993,this study aims to assess the effect of climate change on water resources in semi arid environments taking the essaouira region in morocco as an example analysis of climate data shows a decrease in precipitation of 12 16 and an increase in air temperature of 2 3 c over the past three decades a continuous drop in the piezometric level of more than 12 m for the cenomanian turonian aquifer 17 m for the plio quaternary aquifer around 8 m for the barremian aptian aquifer and 5 m for the hauterivian hydrogeochemical analysis together show that i the groundwater mineralization is controlled by the dissolution of evaporitic and carbonates minerals by the reverse ions exchange phenomenon and by sea water intrusion especially at plio quaternary aquifer and ii the groundwater quality in the study area deteriorates gradually over time and space the isotopic data shows that i the groundwater recharge in the study area is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without significant evaporation and that ii climate change has no remarkable effect on the isotopic content of the groundwater of the study area however the results of this article reflect that the essaouira basin is very vulnerable to climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords semi arid zone global warming groundwater isotopy hydrogeochemistry 1 introduction climate change is a global issue involving the

characterized by the total absence of industrial activity and the agricultural activity practiced is of the subsistence type this basin is a typical basin to assess the climate change impact on the water resource this is another reason for the choice of this basin 2 study area the study area essaouira syncline basin covers an area of 6000 km2 it is part of the atlantic atlas which is the westernmost part of the southwestern moroccan basin duffaud 1960 this basin is bounded to the north by hadid anticline to the south by tidzi wadi wadi is arabic word for valley to the east by the bouabout region and to the west by the atlantic ocean it is subdivided into two parts the first one known as the bouabout unit upstream part and the second one the coastal zone downstream part fig 1a from a morphological point of view the study area is made up of a set of synclinal basins filled with formations ranging from the triassic to the quaternary fig 1b in their age the elevation varies between 400 and 1600 m for the upstream part and is less than 400 m for the downstream part hydrographically the study area is characterized by a less developed network this is mainly represented by ouazzi wadi in the north and igouzoullene wadi in the south passing through ksob wadi resulting from the confluence of igrounzar and zelten wadi and through tidzi wadi all of these wadis valleys flow into the atlantic ocean fig 1b geologically the upstream part of the study area is marked by the outcrop of formations of middle and upper cretaceous age in particular albian vraconian cenomanian and turonian duffaud 1960 amghar 1989 formations supplement1 these formations are composed of limestone and dolomitic benches interspersed with marl and sandstone the albian vraconian formations contain sandstone and dolomitic limestones alternating with sandstone banks and sandy clays the cenomanian about 200 m thickness is represented by alternating marls with anhydrite lumachellic and dolomitic limestones as for the turonian formation it is composed of limestones with an abundance of silica these synclines contain important water reservoirs notably the cenomanian turonian aquifer which remains the most important in the region according to jalal et al 2001 this aquifer has transmissivities varying between 2 2 10 4 and 2 7 10 1 m2 s the downstream part contains 2 important aquifers i the plio quaternary and the ii turonian in the northern part between ksob wadi and tidzi wadi iii the barremian aptian located between tidzi wadi and amssittene anticline and iv the hauterivian which marks the southern limit of the study area is interposed between the amssittene anticline and igouzoullene wadi fig 1b the plio quaternary aquifer is characterized by a matrix of calcareous sandstone it contains an important water table the wall of which is formed in the synclinal structure by the marls of senonian supplement 1 according to mennani 2001 this water table has transmissivities varying between 6 1 10 2 and 4 5 10 5 m2 s as for the turonian represented by limestones it contains a captive aquifer under the senonian marls in the synclinal structure and is probably in direct contact with the plio quaternary at the confines of this structure supplement 1 it has a transmissivity ranging between 0 8 10 4 and 2 7 10 2 m2 s mennani 2001 the barremo aptian aquifer contains rocks of the barremian formation about 70 m thickness represented by an alternation of gray marl with traces of gypsum fractured fossiliferous limestones and sandstone and aptian formation rocks about 100 m thickness composed of red clays and sandstone with intercalations of dolomitic sandstones or bioclastic limestones duffaud 1960 duffaud et al 1966 supplement 1 the transmissivity is of the order of 1 5 10 3 m2 s mennani 2001 the hauterivian aquifer whose thickness is about 200 m is composed of marly clays and fractured siliceous limestones marly and dolomitic limestones more or less fractured fig 3 duffaud 1960 duffaud et al 1966 according to mennani 2001 this aquifer has transmissivities varying between 1 6 10 5 and 6 7 10 5 m2 s 3 materials and methods in this investigation field and laboratory analysis data of nine campaigns 1990 1995 1997 2009 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were used to assess the quality of groundwater in the essaouira region in the context of climate change electrical conductivities conductivity temperature ph and nitrate concentration were measured in situ with a portable multiparametric instrument hanna hi9829 while the depth of the water level in the wells was measured using a 200 m piezometric probe the chemical analyses of water samples collected during different field campaigns from 1990 to 2009 were carried out in the hydrogeology laboratory of the faculty of sciences semlalia at the cadi ayyad university marrakech morocco as for the water samples collected during the field campaigns from 2015 to 2019 the analyses were carried out in the laboratory of geosciences and environment at the ecole normale superieure ens of marrakech morocco the so4 2 anion contents were determined by the nephelometric method rodier et al 2009 concentrations of ca2 and mg2 cations were measured by the complexometry method edta and those of cl by the mohr method rodier et al 2009 the na and k contents were determined by flame photometry rodier et al 2009 as for hco3 concentrations they were determined by titration using a sulfuric acid solution all the samples display an ion balance with an error of less than 10 which allowed us to validate the obtained results the obtained results are presented in appendix 1 a total of 46 samples collected in april 2016 22 samples and in may 2018 24 samples were analyzed for stable oxygen 18 and deuterium and radioactive tritium isotopes the 22 water samples collected in 2016 represent the cenomanian turonian aquifer the upstream part of the study area and 24 water samples collected in 2018 represent the plio quaternary aquifer 18 samples the turonian aquifer 4 samples and surface water 2 samples the analyses for stable isotopic elements δ2h and δ18o were carried out at the nuclear technology institute in lisbon portugal and the laboratory of radio analysis and environment lrae at the national school of engineers of sfax tunisia by using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method icp ms the tritium 3h content was determined by the electrolytic enrichment technique followed by the liquid scintillation counting method lucas and unterweger 2000 at nuclear technology institute in lisbon portugal geographic information system gis was used in mapping of the spatial distribution of the electrical conductivity and the physicochemical elements the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 was used to calculate the saturation indices si using the following formula si log k iap k sp where kiap is the product of the ionic activity of ions and ksp is the mineral solubility product the saturation index corresponds to the deviation from the equilibrium of the water from the mineral phase if si 0 the water is in equilibrium if si is negative the water is undersaturated with respect to the mineral and if si is positive the water is supersaturated with respect to this mineral 4 results and discussion 4 1 climatic parameters precipitations and temperatures the climate parameter data used in this study were obtained from the tensift hydraulic basin agency abht analysis of precipitation data for an observation period of 38 years 1978 2015 for the study area reveals significant variability on an annual scale fig 2 indeed this rainfall is subject to fluctuations from one year to another with wet and other dry periods of two to five consecutive years the height of the precipitated sheet of water varies between a minimum of 135 mm measured in 2008 and a maximum of 707 mm measured in 1996 with an average of 304 mm the application of the pettitt test pettitt 1979 table 1 with a 90 confidence level shows the presence of a break in the pluviometric series in 1999 this test made it possible to split the rainfall series into two sub series the average of annual rainfall before and after this break is a1 313 8 first sub series and a2 263 4 second sub series mm respectively this makes it possible to estimate a rainfall deficit of 16 the results of the mann kendall trend test table 1 displays a negative multivariable standard normal umk umk 1 09 this reflects a downward trend in precipitation and confirms the results of the pettitt test the evolution study of annual atmospheric temperatures was carried out over for 28 years 1987 2015 maximum temperatures range between 29 3 and 37 2 c with an average of 34 2 c as for the minimum temperatures they range between 2 4 and 9 3 c with an average of 7 4 c while the average temperatures vary between 17 7 and 22 4 c with an average of 20 c fig 3a the application of the pettitt test with a significance level equal to 5 shows the existence of a significant break in the series of maximum average and minimum annual temperatures respectively in 1999 2000 and 1994 fig 3b the maximum average annual temperatures values before and after this break are 32 75 and 35 53 c with an increase of 2 8 c the average means annual temperatures values before and after this break are 18 85 and 21 13 c respectively with a warming of 2 3 c the average minimum annual temperatures before and after the break are 5 66 and 8 14 c respectively with an increase of 2 5 c the rupture date of the maximum and the mean temperature series are approximately the same and this could be explained by the fact that these two parameters exhibit the same evolution during the study period as for the series of minimum temperature values it presents an early break 1994 this could be explained by the very cold temperatures experienced in the study area in 1988 1989 and 1990 start of the series this upward trend is corroborated by the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 with a positive multivariable standard normal umk for annual maximum temperatures umk 5 24 for annual mean temperatures umk 5 65 and annual minimum temperatures umk 4 65 the gaussen diagram gaussen 1954 corresponds to the intersection of the monthly average precipitation curve and the monthly average temperature curve for the same station when the precipitation curve is above the temperatures curve we talk about a wet period while the dry period takes place when the precipitation curve is below that of temperatures this diagram distinguishes a dry period from a wet period hannachi and fenni 2013 for this study and during the period 1987 2000 fig 3c shows a dry period from april to september and a wet period from october to march however the groundwater recharge rate could be more important during the wet period than the dry period by comparing the length of the dry period during the two periods 1987 2000 and 2001 2014 we can see that it experienced an extension of about one month during the latest period this will undoubtedly influence the groundwater recharge 4 2 piezometry the evolution of the groundwater piezometric surface is closely related to the variation of precipitation bahir et al 2016 ouhamdouch et al 2016 the degree of exploitation and the contributions from surface water the piezometric maps drawn up from the data of september 1990 june 1995 march 1997 october 2007 june 2015 april 2016 april 2017 may 2018 and march 2019 campaigns for the aquifers of the essaouira basin show that for the upstream part of the basin the groundwater has a general flow direction from se to nw for the southern part and from ne sw for the northern part fig 4a this flow is conditioned by the substratum of the reservoir studied over a 24 year observation period 1995 2019 the groundwater maintains the same direction of flow with a decline in the piezometric level this drawdown is manifested for example by the offset of the piezometric curves 450 and 600 m more and more upstream and this on the two piezometric maps fig 4a monitoring the evolution of the piezometric level of the wells whose water level was measured during october 2007 april 2016 april 2017 may 2018 and march 2019 is shown in fig 5 this shows that all of the wells have suffered a decline in their piezometric levels it reached 9 3 m at well o30 and 12 6 m at well 75 52 between 2007 and 2019 for the downstream part the general direction of groundwater flow of the plio quaternary aquifer and that of the barremian aptian is generally from south east to north west fig 4b and c the groundwater flow within the plio quaternary aquifer is imposed by the inclination of its substratum while for the barremian aptian the flow is imposed by the north flank of the amssittene anticline and the uplift of the substratum of the lower cretaceous formations concerning the hauterivian aquifer the general direction of flow is from the northeast to the southwest and this follow the southern flank of the amssittene anticline the same remark observed for the downstream part the groundwater keeps the same direction of the flow with a decline in the piezometric level over a 29 year observation period 1990 2019 fig 4b the groundwater of the plio quaternary aquifer maintains the same direction of flow with a decent piezometric level this situation is materialized for example by the shift of the isopiezes 40 and 180 m more and more upstream and this on the two piezometric maps the evolution of the piezometric level of the wells capturing this aquifer and having experienced measurements of their water body during 1990 1995 2000 2004 2009 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 table 2 shows a reduction in the plan of water at these wells it reached 17 m at well 261 51 and 6 6 m at well 140 51 between 1990 and 2019 the drought of 1995 the driest year in morocco during the 20th century led to a general decline in the water level babqiqi 2014 bahir et al 2002 over a 43 year observation period 1976 2019 fig 4c the groundwater of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifer maintains the same direction of flow with a decent piezometric level with a total of nine wells in which six wells tap the barremian aptian aquifer and three taps the hauterivian aquifer measurement of the groundwater level of the aforementioned aquifers 1976 1997 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 shows a decrease in piezometric levels table 3 for the barremian aptien aquifer it reached 9 1 m at well 176 51 and 8 8 m at well 173 51 between 1976 and 2019 i e an average annual decrease of 0 2 m as for the hauterivian aquifer this reduction reached 4 8 m at the level of well p6 and 3 m at the level of well 193 51 i e an average annual decrease of 0 11 and 0 07 m respectively concerning the land use the sector of study is characterized by the dominance of forest of argan tree argan tree is an endemic plant and the absence of the soil outcropping of the geological formations in the open air ouhamdouch et al 2015 except at the banks of the wadis this imposes on the population to practice a food producing type of agricultural activity and to move towards grazing in parallel to this agricultural activity as another source of subsistence however the exploitation of groundwater in this basin is generally dedicated to the supply of drinking water and the watering of livestock following the absence of industrial activity in the study area and the food type based agricultural activity practiced by the population ouhamdouch et al 2019 the decrease in the piezometric level could only be explained by the decrease in precipitation under the effect of climate change 4 3 hydrogeochemistry groundwater chemistry is largely influenced by the characteristics of the host rock the hydrodynamics of the aquifers and also by the climatic and exploitation conditions which makes hydrogeochemistry a valuable tool in the characterization of groundwater 4 3 1 chemical facies to specify the groundwater chemical facies in the study area the major element composition has been plotted on the piper diagram piper 1944 for the cenomanian turonian aquifer representing the upstream part of the basin studied the projection of the analyzed samples on the piper diagram fig 6a shows that the waters have a mixed facies between cl na cl ca mg so4 ca mg and hco3 ca mg in 1995 the majority of the samples presented a cl ca mg facies for the samples of the 2007 campaign the chemical facies of the waters are of cl ca mg so4 ca mg and hco3 ca mg type with the dominance of the cl ca mg type as for the samples analyzed in 2016 they have a facies of cl na type and of the cl ca mg and so4 ca mg type for the 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns we note that the analyzed waters present three types of facies cl na cl ca mg so4 ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the cl ca mg type a comparison of the results of the 1995 campaign and those of 2019 fig 6b shows that the groundwater facies of the cenomanian turonian aquifer have not experienced any remarkable change for groundwater of the downstream part the analysis of the piper diagrams for the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers fig 7 a and b shows that they are classified under a mixed facies between cl na and cl ca mg the regrouping of the points of the plio quaternary aquifer near the turonian aquifer suggests an interconnection between these two aquifers the comparison between the results of 1990 and 2019 is presented in fig 7c this shows that there is a slight evolution in the chemical facies of the plio quaternary groundwater indeed on the cations triangle concerning the 1990 campaign the majority of the points have a percentage higher than 50 in na with a tendency towards the na pole however in 2019 the majority of the points do not exceed 50 in na with a tendency towards the center of the sorting no dominant cations for the anion triangle a clear dominance of cl is noted whether in 1990 or in 2019 the position of certain samples relative to the sample representing seawater on the piper diagram suggests that the plio quaternary aquifer is probably affected by the marine intrusion the groundwater of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers generally presents three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the second facies fig 8 a and b the dominance of cl over hco3 could be explained by the influence of triassic saliferous formations the comparison between the water points sampled in 1997 and 2019 fig 8c shows a remarkable evolution in the groundwater chemistry of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers from the mixed facies cl na and cl ca mg to the facets cl ca mg 4 3 2 groundwater mineralization to determine the origin and the main processes responsible for the groundwater mineralization of the study area the correlations between the main major elements have been studied chloride is a conservative ion that is always found in natural waters at very variable contents fetter 1993 justin et al 2018 and sodium is generally associated with chlorides chlorides concentrations in groundwater of the upstream part vary widely from 113 to 1818 mg l with an average of 574 mg l as for those of sodium they vary between 12 and 541 mg l with an average of 167 mg l according to the piper diagram fig 6 it can be seen that the cl ions are the most dominant in the waters for the downstream part the cl contents vary between 120 and 4800 mg l with an average of 620 mg l and the na concentrations vary between 28 and 1950 mg l with an average of 261 mg l the highest na and cl contents are observed at the plio quaternary aquifer the na vs cl correlation diagram fig 9a shows a significant positive correlation between these two ions this reflects that these two elements probably have the same origin some points are scattered around the halite dissolution line line 1 1 reflecting the contribution of this mineral in the groundwater mineralization of the study area this hypothesis is confirmed by negative values of the saturation indices with respect to this mineral fig 10 the rest of the samples are located below the line 1 1 and parallel to it reflecting a na deficit this suggests the contribution of a phenomenon other than the halite dissolution in the groundwater mineralization the na deficit compared to cl could be linked to the basic exchange reactions as shown in fig 9f with the aquifer matrix where the na ions are released from the complex and are replaced by ca2 ions according to equation 1 capaccioni et al 2005 1 na 1 2 ca x 2 na x 1 2 ca 2 with x being the natural exchanger also an excess of na could be explained by the second type of cations exchange where the ca2 and or mg2 ions will be released in water and the na ions will be fixed by the matrix according to equation 2 2 1 2 ca 2 na x 1 2 ca x 2 na the ca2 contents of the groundwater from the upstream part vary between 82 and 770 mg l with an average of 214 mg l as for those of so4 2 they vary between 13 and 1942 mg l with an average of 339 mg l as for the downstream part the ca2 concentrations oscillate between 64 and 850 mg l with an average of 158 mg l and those of so4 2 vary between 30 and 830 with an average of 147 mg l fig 9b shows the existence of a significant correlation between the ca2 and so4 2 ions indeed the points whose ca2 so4 2 molar ratio is close to or equal to 1 reflect the same origin of these two ions which could be the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite this is confirmed by negative values of the indices of saturation with respect to gypsum and or anhydrite fig 10 however the excess of ca2 compared to so4 2 observed for the majority of the points could be linked to the phenomenon of reverse bases exchange also the saturation indices calculated for these points with respect to carbonate minerals are close to or greater than zero corroborating that the enrichment of ca2 is mainly due to the bases exchange fig 9f the ca2 vs mg2 diagram fig 9c shows a positive correlation between these two ions this reflects that these two elements come from the same origin the majority of the points are scattered around the dolomite dissolution line line 1 1 thus suggesting the contribution of the dissolution of this mineral to the groundwater mineralization other points are located above the line 1 1 confirming the contribution of the bases exchange process in the groundwater mineralization of the aquifers studied the ca2 vs hco3 correlation fig 9d shows that these two elements do not have a significant correlation and that the majority of the analyzed samples show a ca2 hco3 molar ratio greater than 1 this excess of ca2 compared to hco3 ions translates the existence of other sources of calcium which could be the phenomenon of ion exchange and that of dedolomitization incongruent dissolution of dolomite accompanied by simultaneous precipitation of calcite 4 3 3 evolution of groundwater salinity the groundwater salinization is a very marked phenomenon in areas of water scarcity especially the saharan arid and semi arid zones the scarcity or even the absence of surface water and the increasing demand for water as well as the decrease in precipitation have created enormous pressures on groundwater which have thus resulted in the degradation of their quality the spatial temporal distribution of salinity was studied to assess the impact of climate change on the groundwater quality by using the results of the campaigns of 1995 2007 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 for the upstream part the 1995 campaign shows the salinity values vary between 0 2 and 1 9 g l with an average of 0 7 g l in 2007 the salinity values fluctuated between 0 5 and 2 4 g l with an average of 1 1 g l as for the 2016 campaign its values vary between 0 3 and 4 6 g l with an average of 1 37 g l for the 2017 campaign the salinity fluctuates between 0 3 and 4 g l with an average of 1 29 g l in 2018 the salinity values vary between 0 4 and 4 3 g l with an average of 1 4 g l and between 0 35 and 4 4 g l with an average of 1 4 for samples from the 2019 campaign fig 11 fig 11 shows that the salinity values become more important from 1995 to 2019 and from the east to the west taking for example the region of sebt kourimat recharge area of the cenomanian turonian aquifer the salinity values fluctuate around 0 46 g l in 1995 to reach 2 9 g l in 2019 however the general spatial temporal evolution of salinity shows an increasing trend for the downstream part the groundwater from the plio quaternary aquifer has salinity values varying between 0 6 and 3 4 g l with an average of 1 7 g l in 1990 between 0 9 and 3 g l with an average of 1 6 g l in 1995 from 0 4 to 4 1 g l with an average of 1 3 g l in 2004 between 0 9 and 2 2 g l with an average of 1 4 g l in 2009 from 0 3 to 4 7 with an average of 1 5 g l in 2015 between 0 4 and 4 8 g l with an average of 1 53 g l in 2017 between 0 5 and 6 5 g l with an average of 1 6 g l in 2018 and between 0 46 and 8 4 g l with an average of 1 7 g l in 2019 fig 12 from the maps of fig 12 the highest values are observed in the southern and western part and this further to the remoteness to the recharge zones to the residence time to the influence of the triassic terrains and to the influence from the sea marine intrusion well 11 51 while the low values of salinity are recorded in the north along the ksob wadi and in the east of the plio quaternary aquifer which represent the recharge zones these low values are due to the fact that these places represent the recharge zones of this aquifer the temporal evolution of groundwater salinity of the plio quaternary aquifer shows an upward trend going from year to year and consequently deterioration in the groundwater quality as for the turonian aquifer the minimum values of salinity are around 0 8 g l and the maximum values are around 1 3 g l with an average of 1 1 g l and this for 2004 2009 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns fig 12 the temporal evolution of the groundwater salinity of this aquifer does not show a significant trend this could be explained by its significant depth and its captive nature concerning the barremian aptian aquifer the salinity values vary between 0 2 and 3 2 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the points representing the 1997 campaign from 0 3 to 2 1 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the samples collected in 2015 and 2017 between 0 4 and 2 8 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the points of 2018 campaign waters and between 0 7 and 2 4 g l with an average of 1 2 g l for 2019 campaign fig 13 the spatial temporal distribution of the groundwater salinity of the barremian aptian aquifer fig 13 shows a slight upward trend in the minimum values of the salinity while the maximum values have experienced slight stability for the hauterivian aquifer the salinity values vary between 0 6 and 2 6 g l with an average for waters representing the 1997 campaign between 0 5 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2015 samples between 0 6 and 1 2 g l with an average of 0 9 g l for the points of the 2017 campaign between 0 4 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2018 campaign and between 0 4 and 1 3 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2019 samples the spatial temporal distribution of the salinity of the hauterivian aquifer shows a slight dilution of the waters analyzed in 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 compared to those representing the 1997 campaign this could be explained by the installation of the igouzoullene dam in 2004 in upstream favoring the recharge of this aquifer however the increase in the groundwater mineralization is due to the combined effect of the contamination of groundwater by seawater natural effect particularly along the coast line and the poor protection of catchments effect anthropogenic consequently these two effects lead to an increase in the groundwater salinity in the study area as the study area is under a semi arid climate with a tendency towards an arid climate in recent years accompanied by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in the temperature which frequently causes intense periods of drought resulting in evaporation that affects surface and groundwater especially the shallow waters the degradation of the groundwater quality is mainly due to this situation decrease in precipitation and an increase in the temperature and the decrease in the piezometric level caused by climate change 4 4 isotopy the isotopic approach is of crucial importance in studies of aquifer systems they make it possible to determine the groundwater origin and their residence times to identify and quantify the rate of mixing between two types of water and to locate the recharge areas fontes 1976 for the upstream part cenomanian turonian aquifer the oxygen 18 contents vary between a minimum of 6 vs smow and a maximum of 3 3 vs smow with an average of 4 9 vs smow for deuterium the maximum value is 20 2 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 34 5 vs smow with an average of 28 4 vs smow appendix 2 as for the downstream part the contents of oxygen 18 vary between a minimum of 5 vs smow and a maximum of 1 8 vs smow with an average of 3 9 vs smow for the plio quaternary aquifer and between a minimum of 5 vs smow and a maximum of 4 4 vs smow with an average of 4 7 vs smow for the turonian aquifer for deuterium contents the maximum value is 8 9 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 29 7 vs smow with an average value of 22 6 vs smow for the plio quaternary layer as for the turonian the maximum value is 27 3 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 28 5 vs smow with an average value of 27 9 vs smow appendix 2 the comparison of the stable isotope contents of the upstream part and the downstream part of the essaouira basin shows a slight depletion of the waters of the upstream part compared to those of the downstream part in these isotopes this is due to the remoteness from the coast in the absence of a local meteorological line characterizing the isotopic composition of the rainwater in the study area the meteoric line with equation δ2h 7 95δ18o 11 3 was considered by mennani et al 2001 as an input function for the aquifer systems of the essaouira basin fig 14 representing the variation of δ2h vs δ18o of the groundwater representing the cenomanian turonian aquifer shows that some samples are located above the global meteoric water line gmwl and around the local meteoric water line lmwl this reflects that the aquifer recharge is ensured by the infiltration of precipitation of oceanic origin without significant evaporation while some points are located below gmwl suggesting that these points have evaporated before being infiltrated to the aquifer the sample of precipitation is an annual average of samples collected in 2004 2006 2016 and 2018 as for the seawater sample we refer to values obtained by carreira et al 2014 the distribution of representative samples of the groundwater representing the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers downstream part on the correlation diagram δ2h vs δ18o fig 14 shows that the majority of the points are scattered around the gmwl and lmwl reflecting a recharge by infiltration of oceanic rainwater group1 this supply of the shallow aquifer by rainwater which is at the origin of the reduction in the salinity of the waters in these wells is in perfect agreement with the hydrogeochemical data in particular well 27 51 which has low salinity this well is the closest to the freshwater pole other local recharge points for rainwater have been identified in the bowl of the essaouira basin example o6 15 51 this recharge is probably favored by the lithological nature and the small thickness of the unsaturated zone this group contains both the majority of the samples representing the shallow plio quaternary aquifer and all the water points representing the deep turonian aquifer this suggests the existence of a connection between these two aquifer systems other water points are distinguished by their position below the gmwl group 2 they line up along a line with a slope less than 8 characteristics of evaporation phenomenon this last process mainly concerns surface waters o98 and o99 and wells 105 51 and 327 51 located respectively in the northeast and south part of the aquifer fig 14 evaporation can probably take place before water infiltration in the unsaturated zone in the same diagram well 11 51 is aligned on the freshwater seawater mixture line this confirms that the increase in mineralization in this well is caused by the phenomenon of marine intrusion following the availability of tritium data only the cenomanian turonian aquifer was the subject of the groundwater dating in the study area however the tritium contents vary between 0 and 2 1tu the highest values were recorded in the et tleta hanchane region and the kourimat region this confirms that the recharge of the aquifer through rainwater is low and limited to a few regions fig 15 according to mazor 1991 a tritium content greater than 1 tu indicates a post nuclear recharge and content less than 1 tu represents a pre nuclear recharge or a mixture between recent and old waters the high tritium levels have been observed in the kourimat and et tleta hanchane region recharge zone and they can be attributed to the recent infiltration of precipitation the projection of the samples from the two 2016 and 2007 campaigns fig 15 shows that certain points are located above the line 1 tu reflecting a recent recharge of the cenomanian turonian aquifer while the other points are located above below this line confirming a pre nuclear recharge a comparison of the 3h content of the same water point sampled in 2007 and 2016 shows a decrease in the 3h content this decrease could be explained by the low recharge rate caused by the decrease in the precipitation rate which the study sector has experienced in recent decades under the effect of climate change to get an idea on the evolution of 18o contents of groundwater in the context of climate change we have based on the two plio quaternary and turonian aquifers where we have monitoring of the isotopic signature the results are grouped in fig 16 the correlation diagram 18o 2h for each point during the 23 year 1995 2018 shows that the recharge of the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without notable evaporation only two points are located below the gmwl it is point 272 51 in 2004 and point 11 51 in 2018 this situation could be explained by the fact that point 272 51 underwent evaporation before infiltration while point 11 51 underwent marine contamination as shown in fig 17 where the electrical conductivity is around 10 ms cm according to fig 17 we see that the increase in electrical conductivity salinity is accompanied by a very small increase in the 18 oxygen contents this slight enrichment in 18o 1 1 5 may be due to the effect of evaporation caused by the increase in air temperature under the effect of climate change this suggests that the isotopic content of the study area is impacted by climatic variations and therefore it can be concluded that global warming has an effect on the isotopic signature of groundwater within the essaouira basin 5 conclusions the water resource within the essaouira basin is limited and unevenly distributed in space and time this problem could limit water supply which will be aggravated by the depletion of this resource due to the climate change impact which has become an ambiguous reality and whose effects on the environment are already visible the combination of hydroclimatic piezometric hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches in the study of the groundwater resource within the essaouira basin led to the following conclusions the analysis results of the annual precipitation time series using the statistical tests in particular that of pettitt and that of mann kendall made it possible to detect a decrease in precipitation in the whole basin of 12 16 this decrease in precipitation is accompanied by an increase in temperatures with a significant extent of warming of 2 3 c based on the gaussen diagram the comparison of the duration of the dry period for the two periods 1987 2000 and 2001 2014 shows an extension of one month this will no doubt have a negative effect on the groundwater recharge the piezometric approach has shown that the cenomanian turonian plio quaternary barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers have retained the general direction of flow of their groundwater during the study period monitoring the piezometry over a period of 24 years 1995 2019 for the cenomanian turonian aquifer 29 years 1990 2019 for the plio quaternary aquifer and 43 years 1976 2019 for the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers shows a continuous drop in the piezometric level which exceeds 12 m for the cenomanian turonian aquifer 17 m for the plio quaternary aquifer around 8 m for the barremian aptian aquifer and 5 m for the hauterivian aquifer the general decline in the piezometric level could be explained by the decrease in precipitation following the harmful effect of climate change this drawdown would probably cause a qualitative degradation of groundwater the hydrogeochemical study showed that the groundwater of the cenomanian turonian aquifer presents the cl ca mg cl ca cl na and hco3 ca mix facies with the dominance of the cl ca mg mix facies and cl ca the study of the temporal evolution of these facies shows that there has been no remarkable change the groundwater of the plio quaternary and turonian aquifers are of mixed type between cl na and cl ca mg the chemical facies experienced a slight evolution from the cl na facies to the cl na and cl ca mg facies for the plio quaternary aquifer and from the cl na facies to the cl ca mg facies for the turonian aquifer as for the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers they generally have three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the cl ca mg facies for the study period a remarkable evolution of the facies was observed from the cl na facies to the cl ca mg facies examination of the correlations established between the concentrations of major elements has shown that the mineralization of groundwater is controlled by the phenomenon of the dissolution of the evaporitic minerals halite gypsum and or anhydrites and carbonates dolomite by the reverse ion exchange phenomenon and by the marine intrusion especially at the plio quaternary aquifer the study of the spatio temporal evolution of the groundwater quality in the study area shows a gradual deterioration in time and space the tracing of the groundwater in the essaouira basin by stable isotopes has shown that the groundwater recharge in the upstream part of the basin studied is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin without significant evaporation the same method of recharging is marked at the downstream part with this time the presence of contamination by seawater tritium tracing based on the same wells sampled in 2007 and 2016 shows a significant decrease that reaches 2 tu in certain wells this trend could be explained by the low recharge rate following the decrease in the precipitation rate experienced by the study area in recent years the temporal evolution of the 18o contents generally shows slight enrichment of 1 1 5 this may be due to the effect of evaporation caused by the increase in air temperature under the effect of climate change however the essaouira basin is more vulnerable to climate change because its recharge is entirely dependent on meteoric waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

11994,naturally occurring abundant alumina particles were used as a low cost and eco friendly adsorbent for the removal of eriochrome black t ebt dye from an aqueous environment the surface morphology crystallinity and elemental analysis composition of the alumina before and after the adsorption process were investigated using sem edx ftir and drx techniques the alumina surface charge was examined by the electrokinetic measurement the impact of the physico chemical factors on the adsorption process was studied the adsorption experiments were performed using a batch reactor the fitted models were plotted for adsorption kinetic and isotherm studies based on the experimental results the adsorption data were well described by a pseudo second order kinetic model and the adsorption isotherms agreed well with the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity q max of alumina for the ebt dye was found to be 45 mg g corresponding to a removal percentage of 71 the ebt adsorption phenomena was endothermic and spontaneous the regeneration tests indicated that the alumina reveal an superb recycling capability therefore this result shows that the alumina particles can be applied as a natural encouraging adsorbent for the removal of anionic dye from aqueous solution the ebt dye adsorption mechanism can be controled by electrostatic attractions graphical abstract image 1 keywords alumina pollution organic dyes adsorption regeneration wastewater 1 introduction the surface water and groundwater pollution becomes a major problem in most of the developing countries this problem is the consequence of the presence in the water of polluting substances causing adverse effects directly or indirectly of the environment the origin of these substances is related to industrial agricultural activities as well as urban waste indeed many industries such as carpet cosmetic food plastic and paper etc produce a large amount of wastewater loaded with pollutants zazou et al 2019 for example wastewaters obtained from the textile dyeing are composed of enormous amounts of pollutants such as dyes generally these dyes are structurally complex turabik 2008 have high water solubility high colour and low biodegradability gupta et al 2013 moreover many dyes have toxic and carcinogenic effects on aquatic life and human health wong et al 2009 due to these harmful effects the treatment of wastewater containing the poisonous dye is of great concern before discharging into the water resources and ecosystem several wastewater treatment options including chlorination rajasulochana and preethy 2016 coagulation flocculation edison gilpavas et al 2017 electrochemical techniques electro coagulation zazou et al 2019 advanced oxidation processes du and chen 2017 membrane techniques hosseini et al 2018 biological degradation buthelezi et al 2012 and adsorption on various adsorbent have been successfully applied for dyes removal from wastewaters yagub et al 2014 these various dye treatment technologies have advantages but also disadvantages and handicaps such as low removal efficiency great electrical energy requirement and high cost treatment process bonetto et al 2015 guendy 2010 khandegar and saroha 2013 for example biological wastewater treatment processes do not achieve complete mineralization of the dye molecules and their efficiency is highly influenced by the physico chemical conditions of the effluent oller et al 2011 another principal method is coagulation flocculation process this technique only removes insoluble dyes but not solube dyes khandegar and saroha 2013 furthermore in coagulation flocculation process a large amount of sludge is created which may become a pollutant itself and increase the treatment costs ahn et al 1999 the adsorption technology on activated carbon is most popular process and is efficient however the regeneration of the spent adsorbent is difficult the implementation costs is high and its disposal is not really environment friendly verma et al 2012 according to these inconveniences the treatment of textile wastewater by the traditional methods becomes inadequate therefore the application of adsorption methods on different and low cost adsorbents can be a suitable solution for dye elimination from wastewater in recent decades several natural adsorbents such as clays minerals yap and priyaa 2019 zeolites abukhadra and mohamed 2019a clays activated with organic or inorganic compounds belaroussi et al 2018 diatomite nio composites abukhadraa et al 2019c various agro industrial wastes wakkel et al 2019 solid wastes abukhadra and shaban 2019b inorganic nanomaterials and oxides zheng et al 2019 debnath et al 2016 natural bituminous coal shaban et al 2017 have been employed for the elimination of dyes from wastewater in recent years more attention has been brought to metal oxides because of their physical and chemical properties in fact metal oxides such as iron and or aluminum oxide have a large surface area small size and a surface charge which facilitates the reduction of free metals and organic matter concentrations in natural environments via the adsorption process sharma et al 2008 for these reasons the metal oxides can be considered as alternative adsorbents to activated carbon in the wastewater treatment process dhawale et al 2018 however very few papers have concentrated on the use of aluminium oxide as an natural adsorbent for the elimination of organic dyes from liquid solution in this context we proposed to test the effectiveness of the adsorbent aluminum oxides as competitive with other materials to remove of eriochrome black t dye from water eriochrome black dye is chosen as a model of molecules belonging to the class of azo dyes these dyes are very widely used in textile dyeing and are also bio recalcitrant and resist aerobic degradation well even at low concentrations ahmad and hameed 2009 gercel et al 2008 therefore it is very necessary to remove azo dyes from industrial wastewater earlier its release into surface water and groundwater this research work aims to examine the effect of certain physico chemical parameters such as contact time ph ionic strength temperature nature of coexisting inorganic anions and humic acid concentration on the colorant removal the isotherms kinetics thermodynamics and regeneration investigations of the alumina were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the alumina al2o3 aluminum oxide particles purity greater than 99 used in this study are a commercial product and were purchased from sigma aldrich and was employed without further treatment the commercial dye eriochrome black t ebt cas number 1787 61 7 employed in this experiment was supplied from sigma chemical co and used it as received it is an azo and anionic dye which belongs to the category of water soluble dyes and its chemical structure is shown in fig 1 with a molar mass of 461 38 g mol the spectrophotometric properties have shown that the wavelength λ of the maximum absorbance is in the visible spectra λ max 540 nm in the present work all chemical reactants nacl nano3 na2so4 na2s2o3 used are analytical grade from sigma aldrich for each experiment distilled water was used to prepare the aqueous solutions reactants grade sodium hydroxide naoh purity greater than 98 and hydrochloric acid hcl purity greater than 37 were used for ph adjustments of the solution furthermore the humic acid cas number 1415 93 6 used in the adsorption experiments was supplied from sigma aldrich as sodium humate all the adsorption trials were done in triplicate and averaged 2 2 characterization techniques powder x ray diffraction pxrd fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy disperse x ray analysis sem edx techniques and zeta potential were used to characterize the alumina samples before and after the adsorption of the ebt dye the pxrd data of the samples was collected with a panalytical s x pert pro diffractometer the diffracted beam was detected detector active length 2 122 2θ over a range of 5 70 2θ with a step size of 0 03 2θ and a counting time of 100 s step over a 2θ range of 2 5 70 2θ with a step size of 0 03 2θ during 60 min the surface morphology and microstructure of pure alumina and ebt alumina samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy coupled with sem edx technique philips sem 525 m the sem analyses were conducted under accelerating voltage at 10 kv the infrared analysis was performed with ftla2000 series spectrometer abb bomen inc at resolution of 4 cm 1 with 20 scans in the 4000 to 400 cm 1 wavenumber range electrokinetic measurements were performed to evaluate the point of zero charge pzc of the pure alumina using a zetasizer nanoseries malvern instrument the determination of this point enables to draw conclusions about the ebt dye adsorption mechanisms the absorbance of the supernatant after separation was measured at 540 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3101pc 3 experimental section 3 1 kinetic adsorption experiments the kinetics of the ebt adsorption onto alumina has been studied at different temperatures introducing quantities of 50 mg alumina particles into 50 ml of the 50 mg l dye solutions in a 125 ml flask adjusting the ph to 6 and the ionic strength with 10 2 m nacl the mixtures in the flask were stirred at 150 rpm for a contact time varying from 10 to 450 min in a heated bath stirring and regulated at temperatures at 298 313 and 323 k after each contact time the contents of the flask were filtered using membrane syringe filter to separate the solid phase from the liquid phase and to immediately stop the adsorption process the ebt dye concentration remaining in the filtrate was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer the concentrations of ebt dye were evaluted using the linear regression equation then the amount of ebt dye adsorbed at the equilibrium at time t qt mg g was determined using the following equation eq 1 1 q t c 0 c t v m s where c0 and ct mg l are the initial and any time concentration of dye respectively v and ms are the volume of the liquid phase l and the mass of the adsorbent g respectively 3 2 kinetic adsorption models several kinetic models have been used to understand the mechanisms involved in the adsorption and chemical reaction processes the most cited models are pseudo first order kinetic model lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order kinetic model ho and mckay 1999 the pseudo first order rate expression of lagergren based on solid capacity is given in the following equation eq 2 2 d q t d t k 1 q e q t after integrating and applying the boundary conditions the linear form of expression obtained is eq 3 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qt and qe are respectively the adsorption capacities per unit mass of the adsorbent both in mg g at time t and at equilibrium and k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant of adsorption min 1 the pseudo second order equation is expressed as eq 4 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 after integration the kinetic rate expression becomes as eq 5 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e t q e where k2 is the equilibrium rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption g mg 1 min 1 this model is valid if the rate of the sorption is a second order mechanism then the intraparticle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 has been used to identify the diffusion controlled adsorption process and it was expressed by using the following equation eq 6 6 q t k i t 0 5 c s t e where ki is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 0 5 and cste mg g is a constant in general the adsorption process can be controlled by several steps especially i film or external diffusion ii pore diffusion and iii the adsorption on the pore including the chemisorption physiorption ion exchange or complexation or a combination of more than one step if the constant cste is zero the plots of q vs t0 5 satisfies the linear relationship with the experimental data implying that the sorption process is controlled by intra particle diffusion only however if the curve of q vs t0 5 is formed of several segments then two or more steps influence the sorption process the agreement between the mathematical models and experimental points was evaluated using χ2 r2 rmse and δq see table 1 3 3 activation energy the activation energy ea was estimated from an arrhenius plot the arrhenius equation was expressed as eq 7 7 l n k 2 l n k 0 e a r t where k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant of adsorption g mg 1 h 1 ea is the activation energy kj mol 1 ko is the arrhenius factor g mg 1 h 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the solution temperature k the ea value can be calculated from the slope of lnk2 vs t 1 plots the low values of the activation energy 5 50 kj mol 1 characterize the physisorption type whereas the high values 60 800 kj mol 1 imply a chemisorption type of adsorption nollet et al 2003 3 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption tests for removal of the ebt from aqueous solution were conducted using batch experiments to perform adsorption tests a stock solution 1000 mg l of ebt was prepared by dissolving 1 g of ebt powder in 1 l distilled water this solution is stirred until the total dissolving of the dye thereafter the desired ebt concentrations were obtained by successive dilutions of the stock solution with various volumes of distilled water the influence of certains parameter like the solution ph 4 10 ionic strength adjusted using nacl 10 3 10 1 m initial concentration of ebt dye 10 150 mg l nature of coexisting anions cl no3 so4 2 s2o3 2 and humic acid concentrations 50 and 100 ppm on the adsorption process of the ebt dye onto alumina particles were investigated each series experiment was performed by adding 0 05 g of alumina solid into 0 05 l of aqueous dye solution in a 125 ml flask at desired initial ph dye concentration ionic strength the ph of the mixture was adjusted to a given value with either 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh the contents of the flask were stirred at 150 rpm using a magnetic stirrer for 6 h after this contact time the content of the flask were separated at 4000 rpm for 20 min in a centrifuge the amount of ebt dye adsorbed at equilibrium i e adsorption capacity qe mg g and the removal efficiency of ebt removal were determined using the following equation eq 8 and 9 8 q e c 0 c e v m s 9 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentration of dye respectively v and ms are the volume of liquid phase l and the mass of the adsorbent g respectively 3 5 adsorption isotherm modeling the experimentally acquired adsorption isotherms have been fitted by three models namely langmuir freundlich and tempkin isotherm models 3 6 langmuir model the langmuir adsorption model is based on the assumption langmuir 1918 i the adsorption energy at all adsorption sites is uniform ii the adsorption is done in a monolayer coverage and iii the absence of lateral interactions between the adsorbed molecules the nonlinear equation of the langmuir isotherm is given by the following relation eq 10 10 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e the linear transformation of this model is expressed by the equation eq 11 11 1 q e 1 q m 1 k l c e q m where qe mg g is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium ceq is the equilibrium dye concentration in aqueous phase mg l kl is the langmuir equilibrium constant l mg and qm the maximum adsorption capacity mg g the langmuir isotherm can be classified by the dimensionless constant separation factor rl deniz et al 2011 expressed by the following correlation eq 12 12 r l 1 1 k l c 0 according on the value rl the type of isotherm can be described as irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 ahmadi et al 2016 3 7 freundlich model this model is an empirical model that reflects a variation of the interaction energies with the adsorbed amount of molecules freundlich 1906 the distribution of interaction energies is explained by the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites in contrast to the langmuir model the freundlich model admits the existence of interactions between the adsorbed molecules the freundlich equation is applicable to multilayer coverage and is defined by the following formula eq 13 13 q e k f c e 1 n the linear form of the freundlich model is represented as eq 14 14 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q e represents the amount adsorbed per amount of adsorbent at the equilibrium mg g ceq is the equilibrium dye concentration in aqueous solution mg l kf l mg and 1 n are the freundlich constants the 1 n values characterize the favorability of the adsorption process for values in the range of 0 1 n 1 the adsorption is favorable hameed 2008 3 8 tempkin model the tempkin model is based on the assumption that the heat of surface adsorption decreases linearly with the recovery rate due to the decrease in adsorbent adsorbate interactions tempkin and pyzhev 1940 the tempkin isotherm is represented by the following correlation eq 15 15 q e r t b ln a c e the linear form is given by the following expression eq 16 16 q e r t b ln a r t b ln c e where qe is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of the dye mg l and a is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g b is the tempkin isotherm constant which related to the heat of adsorption process t is the absolute temperature k and r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 to assess the accuracy of the curve models to the experimental data various error functions table 1 were used 3 9 thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic parameters like gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs for the adsorption of the ebt dye onto alumina particles were evaluated using the well established equations eq 17 17 δ g r t l n k d wherein δg is the standard gibbs free energy change j mol r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k and k d is the distribution coefficient expressed by the van t hoff equation eq 18 18 l n k d δ h 0 r 1 t δ s 0 r the values of enthalpy δh and entropy δs can be determinated from the slope and the intercept of the van t hoff curves of ln k d versus t 1 respectively 3 10 regeneration and reusability experiments after the adsorption process the regeneration of the adsorbent for multiple reuse is a very important step in our work the regeneration experiments were performed at ambient temperature in series firstly a fixed amount of the alumina 0 1 g was dispersed in 0 1 l of dye solution of initial concentration 100 mg l at ph 6 and at ionic strength 0 01 m which was agitated for 5 h secondly the mixture was centrifuged and the obtained solid alumina ebt adsorbed was desorbed in 0 1 l of solution containing 0 1 m naoh for 3 h to achieve desorption of the dye molecules from the alumina particles surface thirdly after the regeneration of the saturated adsorbent was achieved the fraction recovered was rinsed with hcl solution and distilled water until the supernant ph became neutral and was dried at 60 c for 24 h finally the regenerated adsorbent was employed in the successive adsorption desorption cycle this regeneration operation was reiterated for four times totally 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of pure alumina 4 1 1 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction pattern of pure alumina before adsorption is presented in fig 2 a showing the characteristic reflections of alumina furthermore the broad peaks in the diffractrogram also show the amorphous structure of the alumina indicating a low crystallinity tanhaei et al 2015 from fig 2a the diffraction peaks at 2θ 31 9 37 3 45 7 and 67 which are corresponding to the reflection planes 220 311 400 and 440 respectively verify the structure of alumina huang et al 2013 4 1 2 ftir analysis the evaluation of the surface functional groups of the adsorbent material was performed by ftir spectrum analysis and the results are presented in fig 2b spectra i in the pure alumina sample the presence of the peaks at 3449 cm 1 and at 1641 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of the oh group from al oh and bending vibration of oh groups respectively another peak at 560 cm 1 was attributed to al o nezam et al 2016 cai et al 2019 4 1 3 sem edx analysis fig 2c show the sem images of pure alumina before adsorption obtained with magnification at 2 00kx and 1 00kx taked at scale 50 μm respectively as can be observed from the sem image the pure alumina demonstrates to agglomerate of particles which have regular surface from the sem micrographs the particles have an average size of 150 μm in addition the edx spectrum obtained during sem analysis is given in fig 2d indicating only the high intensity peaks of al and o and confirming the presence of only alumina particles 4 1 4 point zero charge pzc the electrokinetic behavior of pure alumina particles in aqueous was examinated varing solution ph in the range 3 11 5 fig 3 represents the variation of the zeta potential versus the ph of the alumina particles in nacl 10 2 m as can be seen in this fig 3 the point zero charge of alumina corresponding to ph at which the zeta potential is zero takes place at phs 9 2 phpzc indeed this point suggests that the positively charged surface site density equals that of the negative sites for ph phpzc the zeta potential is positive due to protonation of hydroxyl groups at the interface and it decreases when the ph increases to ph 9 2 beyond ph 9 2 the zeta potential becomes negative due to dissociation of functional groups at the surface this behavior can be related to amphoteric character of the metal oxide surface depending on the ph value of aqueous solution yopps and fuerstenau 1964 other authors reported similar pzc value of alumina particles in aqueous solution janot et al 2013 moreau et al 2013 4 2 adsorption studies 4 2 1 effect of contact times in order to determine the equilibrium time for the maximum adsorption the adsorption experiment of the ebt dye on alumina particles was examined as a function of contact time at a various temperature the results obtained of this effect on ebt dye uptake by alumina adsorbent are presented in fig 4 a for a given temperature this figure clearly shows that the amount of ebt dye adsorbed increased with increasing contact time and reached equilibrium adsorption at 100 min in the first step a large amount of ebt dye was adsorbed rapidly due to a high number of active binding sites on the alumina in sencond step after equilibrium time gradual occupancy of acitve sites prevent the uptake of ebt dye which becomes less efficient the adsorption capacity of ebt molecules onto alumina adsorbent increases with increasing temperature from 298 to 332 k fig 4a suggesting that the adsorption of ebt dye to oxide aluminum is endothermic in nature this may be attributed to the higher of attractive forces between the active sites of alumina adsorbent and ebt molecules 4 2 2 adsorption kinetic model a study of adsorption kinetics is essentially as it gives information about the mechanism of adsorption which is interesting for the uptake during the process the adsorption kinetics data of the ebt dye onto alumina adsorbent obtained at different temperatures were analyzed using three models as a pseudo first order kinetic the pseudo second order kinetic fig 4b and c and the intraparticle diffusion fig 4d the values of respective fitting parameters for the adsorption of ebt onto alumina are given in table 2 from this table for both the pseudo first order and pseudo second order at different temperature the rate constants of adsorption k1 and k2 increases with the rise temperature of aqueous solution the regression coefficients for the pseudo first order model are low and the values of χ2 rmse and δq are high table 2 however the regression coefficients for the pseudosecond order model are very close to unity as are the law values of δq χ2 and rmse more the qe values calculated by the pseudo second order adsorption model are very table 2 reasonably close to the experimental qe values compared to those found by the pseudo first order model for these results it was noted that the pseudo second order is more adapted to the adsorption kinetics model of alumina particles than the pseudo first order adsorption model and that the adsorption process seem to be controlled by the chemical adsorption process implicating the valence forces of the shared or ion exchange between absorbent active site and dye molecules ecboon et al 2010 the results found are consistent with previous works on cationic dye adsorption kinetics using sepiolite and pyrophyllite zhang et al 2015 also our results are in agreement with other authors like yap and priyaa 2019 whereby they reported that pseudo second order kinetic model was best fitted for the adsorption of anionic dye on kaolin recently bentahar et al 2019 have reported similar observations when they studied the uptake of basic dye from aqueous solution by swelling and non swelling of natural clays fig 4d presents intraparticle diffusion plots for the adsorption of ebt dye by alumina adsorbent at different temperatures the intra particle diffusion plots only show two linear segments indicating that the transfer occurs and dominates under two stages the first stage indicates a rapid initial exterior surface ebt dye sorption onto the alumina correlated with the boundary layer diffusion meantime the second stage presents the slower internal binding of the ebt molecules prior to the attainment of saturation by showing intraparticle diffusion as the rate limiting mechanism during this stage wu et al 2009 zubaira et al 2020 titchou et al 2020 the intraparticle diffusion rate constants kd were also calculated and given in table 2 as shows table 2 k d k d k d and k d being the slopes of the first and second segment respectively which suggeste that the adsorption of ebt depended most on the thickness of the boundary layer in addition the rate constant of the first linear segment increase with increasing temperature denoting that the velocity of mobility of the ebt dye from the solution phase to alumina adsorbent is increased with temperature this shows that the ebt adsorption process is faster at higher temperature 4 2 3 activation energy the activation energy is determined from the plot lnk2 versus 1 t using equation eq 7 plot is not shown from the slope of this plot the calculated value of activation energy is equal to15 kj mol 1 for ebt sorption on alumunium oxide adsorbent the sorption phenomenon occurs by two different types physical and chemical adsorption these types are related to the amplitude of the activation energy in fact the physical adsorption type is characterized by lower activation energy values 5 50 kj mol 1 whereas the chemical adsorption type is described by the higher activation energy values 60 800 kj mol 1 nollet et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 the activation ernergy value found is between 5 and 50 kj mol 1 suggesting that the adsorption process is controlled by physical adsorption type which is described by low interactions between ebt dye and alumina solid and weak potential energy barrier in addition the increase in the adsorption rate constant observed in the temperature range is related to the low amplitude of the energy barrier a similar result was reported for adsorption of anionic dye and tartrazine from aqueous solution by saw dust banerjee and chattopadhyaya 2013 the value of the activation energy found in the present study is very similar to that calculated by banerjee and chattopadhyaya 2013 4 2 4 effect ph on adsorption of ebt dye in a natural environment the ph of an aqueous solution is an important factor influencing the adsorption phenomenon of a pollutant onto an adsorbent because it affects the charge of the functional groups both of the adsorbent surface and pollutant and the interaction between the adsorbent surface and polluants the impact of ph on adsorption of ebt dye onto alumina adsorbent was investigated using initial ebt concentration varying from 30 to 150 mg l at ph ranges of 4 10 fig 5 a illustres the ebt adsorption isotherms onto the alumina support at room temperature the plots indicate that the adsorption capacity is strong in acidic medium compared to basic medium the ebt adsorbed amount decreases from 72 3 to 18 4 mg g with increasing ph in the aqueous solution from 4 to 10 furthermore it can be noted that the ebt removal efficiency declined significantly from 71 3 to 18 4 with increasing ph of the aqueous solution fig 5b the explanation of the adsorption mechanism may be based on surface chemistry of the alumina particles like it has been mentioned that the presence of a metal oxide in the aqueous solution leads in the hydroxylation of the metal oxide surface banerjee et al 2013 thereby metal oxide surfaces have amphoteric character undergoing protonation or deprotonation reactions according to ph medium therefore this behavior obtained indicated that the ebt adsorption is related to the charge of the alumina surface which governing by the aqueous phase ph indeed when the ph phzpc 9 3 the alumina surface is charged positively due to protonation of groups on the metal oxide surface which promotes the adsorption of anionic dye under the action of electrostatic attraction forces between the sulfonic so3 groups of the ebt dye and the acid surface of the alumina particles al oh2 then again when the ph is around of zero point charge the adsorption seems to take place due to formation of hydrogen bond between hydroxyl group on alumina surface al oh and no2 and oh functional groups of ebt molecules when ph phzpc the alumina surface carries a negative charge due to deprotonation of hydroxyl group on alumina al o thus the ebt adsorption capacity is severely reduced as a result to electrostatic repulsion our results are similar to works in literature zheng et al 2012 monasha and pugazhenthi 2013 in a recent study cai et al reported that the adsorption of some ionic dyes onto alumina modified surfaces had been controlled by adjusting the ph value cai et al 2019 according to above discussion the ebt adsorption mechanism by aluminium oxide is illustrated in fig 5c as can be seen in the figure three types of interactions controlling ebt removal depending on the ph value of the aqueous phase are electrostatic attractions electrostatic repulsions and hydrogen bonding 4 2 5 effect of the type of the inorganic anions the composition of textile effluents is often rich in inorganic ions which complicates their treatment by the adsorption process for this cause the effect of coexisting anions on the adsorption of ebt dye from aqueous phase onto the alumina adsorbent was examined introducing different salts cl no3 so4 2 s2o3 2 at fixed concentration of 10 2 m in the aqueous solution fig 6 a shows that the dye adsorption capacity is affected by the nature of anions present in solution indeed these results indicate that the adsorption capacity of ebt dye decreases in the order s2o3 2 so4 2 no3 cl this effect can be attributed to forming of outer sphere complexes between anions and the surface of metal oxides kasprzyk hordern 2004 in fact the presence of sulfate and nitrate anions in the solution diminishes the density and accessibility of the site positively charged of the pure alumina causing a decrease of the attraction between the acid dye ebt and the adsorbent surface the values measured with the zeta potential of alumina particles in presence of no3 so4 2 and s2o3 2 anions are illustrated in fig 6b and indicate a decrease in magnitude of the charge density but it remains positive as resulting from the pure alumina surface charge screening by the sulfates and nitrate anions within experimental error we note that the reduction of the zeta potential value is significant in the presence of s2o3 2 and so4 2 than no3 and this may probably be assigned to the anionic charge density similar results were found by banerjee et al on their use of alumina for the removal of orange g from water banerjee et al 2017 however the decrease of adsorbed amount of ebt dye could correlate to the competition adsorption between the counter anions and so3 groups of the ebt dye towards the acid surface site of the alumina particles 4 2 6 effect of organic anions humic acid the impact of humic acid as organic matter on adsorption of ebt dye was studied at ambient temperature using adsorption experiments of dye on bare alumina and alumina in presence of different ha concentrations 50 and 100 ppm fig 7 shows the adsorption isotherms of ebt dye onto alumina particles as can be seen in fig 7 the presence of ha modified to alumina surface revealed a rather marked effect on the adsorption of ebt dye therefore modifying alumina surface with a high amount of humic acid disadvantaged the elimination of ebt from water in fact the adsorption of humic acid onto the surface of alumina particles leads to a change of the surface charge which would become negative this change would cause the repulsion between the anionic dye ebt and the alumina modified with humic acid via electrostatic interaction the modification of alumina by humic acid has been studied by ait akbour et al 2018 they explained that the charge of the modified alumina becomes negative due to the adsorption of humic acid via the carboxylic groups on the alumina surface this behavior is the fundamental for the improvement of the elimination of cationic dye by the modified alumina the results obtained in this work have a tendency opposite to those reported by several authors as the ebt dye studied in this work is an anionic dye compared to the cationic dye used by the researchers zermane et al 2013 4 2 7 effect ionic strength it should be noted that the effect of ionic strength is related to the nature of the adsorbate of the adsorbent and of the salt used for ionic strength control as well as of their concentrations in order to evaluate the impact of ionic strength on ebt dye adsorption increasing amounts of sodium chloride were added to the dispersion containing the alumina particles the amount of ebt adsorbed on pure alumina solid as a function of ionic strength is illustrated in fig 8 from this graph the adsorption capacity decreases upon addition of important dose of salt in fact significant decrease of the ebt removal efficiency from 70 8 to 46 1 resulted as the nacl concentration increased from 10 3 to 10 1 m the reduction of the removal efficiency under these conditions can be related to the aggregation of alumina particles promoted by the action of salt ions which leads to a decrease of the specific surface available for adsorption on the other hand the increase of the inorganic anion concentration cl in the solution competes with the so3 groups of the ebt dye to be adsorbed on alumina surface consequently it is expected that the ebt adsorption capacity should be reduced with an increase of salt concentration ait akbour et al found a similar result for adsorption of methylene blue onto humic acid coating alumina particles ait akbour et al 2018 4 2 8 thermodynamic study temperature effect the impact of temperature on the variation of ebt adsorption on alumina adsorbent vs contact times was investigated over the range from 298 to 333 k see fig 4a the results show that the amount of ebt adsorbed increases from 42 mg g at 298 k to 57 mg g at 333 k suggesting that this adsorption process is endothermic indeed this behavior can be attributed to higher rate diffusion through the boundary layer to the solid surface and large penetration of anionic dye from the bulk solution phase to the alumina surface ren et al 2018 the higher values for the adsorption with increasing temperature is related to rising attraction forces engaged between the functional groups of the support surface and the molecules furthermore high temperature reduces the solution viscosity which leads to a rise of the adsorbate mobility toward the support surface shah et al 2017 in order to elucidate the mechanism involved in the sorption process the thermodynamic parameters of the change free energy δg the enthalpy δh and the entropy δs of the adsorption reaction have been calculated using equation eqs 17 and 18 the values obtained for the thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 3 it is mentionned that δg values found are negative implying that the adsorption of ebt dye onto alumina nanoparticles is spontaneous and feasible in addition the δg values decrease with the temperature increasing suggesting that the ebt adsorption was favored at elevated temperature also the values δg found are between 0 and 10 kj mol 1 implying that the ebt adsorption is attributed to physisorption process kang et al 2018 the value enthalpy change δh for the present system is positive 31 98 kj mol 1 confirming that the adsorption phenomena is of endothermic nature and this result has been in conformity with the ebt adsorbed amounts which rise with increasing of solution temperature it is also noted that δs is positive 116 68 j mol 1 k 1 recommending that the randomness and disorder at the solid liquid interface increased over the adsorption of ebt dye onto the alumina nanoparticles song et al 2016 ghaedi et al 2012 our results agree accordingly with those reported by cai et al 2019 examining the adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes by ctab chitosan al2o3 composite 4 2 9 adsorption modelling in order to discuss the interaction involved in the ebt dye adsorption process onto alumina particles the isotherm study were performed at different experimental conditions and at constant temperature the isotherms obtained were fitted employing langmuir freundlich and tempkin models fig 9 a shows the amounts of ebt dye adsorbed at equilibrium qe versus equilibrium ebt concentration the comparison between the experimental adsorption isotherms and the adsorption isotherm models obtained from the nonlinear regression equation is also illustrated in fig 9a the obtained results including the model constant values the correlation coefficient r2 and various error functions are depicted in table 4 as shown in fig 9a at temperature 298 k the amount of adsorbed quantities increases with a rise in the concentration in the solution and then reaches a plateau after equilibrium this behavior is valid for all the temperatures studied indicating that the ebt isotherm is similar to h type according to giles et al 1960 based on the values of r2 and χ2 see table 5 and fig 9b c and 9d the langmuir model good described the adsorption of ebt dye onto alumine solid depending on the rmse and δq the langmuir model revealed lower errors and be in accordance very with the experimental data compared to other models this demonstrates that the surface of alumina particles is covered by a monolayer of ebt molecules furthemore for three temperature studied the dimensionless equilibrium constant rl values are close to 0 table 5 indicating the favorable adsorption of ebt onto alumina this behavior affirmed by the values of 1 n from the freundlich model which are revealed to be fewer than 1 confirming favorable adsorption process sheng et al 2018 taleb et al 2017 on the other hand the value of the freundlich constant kf increased from 10 633 to 24 532 with increasing of temperature from 298 to 323 k implying the endothermic feature of the adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity qm 57 25 mg g at 298 k of ebt onto alumina was compared with other adsorbents in table 5 for this table excluding of magnetite silica pectin nps attallah et al 2016 the adsorption capacity of alumina was higher than other adsorbents in addition to high adsorption capacity low expense ecologic this support is an excellent and appropriate adsorbent for the elimination of ebt from aqueous solutions 4 2 10 characterization of the materials after adsorption of ebt dye fig 2b spectrum ii represents pure alumina material after the ebt adsorption by comparing with the spectra i of pure alumina before adsorption we can remarked that after the adsorption of the dye there was a slight change in the positions of the peaks characterizing the structure of the pure alumina and also the appearance of other peaks characterizing the functional groups of molecule ebt as shown in spectra ii the peaks were found for secondary amine at 1530 cm 1 and n h bending at 1450 cm 1 khan et al 2018 the c h or ch3 bending was found at 1345 cm 1 whereas the so3 stretching was located at 1237 cm 1 the peacks at 1220 cm 1 and 1507 cm 1 were related to c n and nn groups in ebt molecule respectively this shows that ebt dye most probably interact with al oh and al o groups present on the alumina surface therefore analysis of these spectra confirms the proposed adsorption mechanism of ebt onto alumina as shown in fig 5c the sem picture of the sample after dye adsorption was presented in fig 2e as can be observed in this figure the picture aggrandize at 2 00kx disclose an irregular or rounded shapes and debris remarked in the alumina ebtdye sample the edx spectrum fig 2f reveals the traces of the adsorbed ebt dye onto the alumina from the peaks acquired for carbon sulfur and sodium in the spectra thus it is proved that ebt dye has been successfully fixed onto the surface of the alumine particles 4 2 11 regeneration and reuse tests the efficiency of wastewater treatment by the adsorption process depends mainly on its costs and also on the quantity of solid waste produced the latter could be minimal if the regeneration of the adsorbent used is easy and effective in this present work the regeneration tests of alumina particles was perfomed in basic medium promoting desorption of ebt dye the results obtained after each adsorption desorption cycle are presented in fig 10 as can be observed in fig 10 the adsorbed amount as well as removal of ebt dye decrease after successives four adsorption desorption cycles indeed an 11 drop of the ebt removal was recorded so this results obtained proved that alumina particles can be efficiently reused until four cycles for the eliminated of ebt from aqueous solutions without greatly reduction of adsorption capacity this study examined the adsorption characteristics and the pertinence of alumina as low cost and natural adsorbent for the removal of ebt dye from aqueous solutions and by utilizing batch mode the results demonstrate that the adsorption was dependent on divers parameters like the aqueous phase ph the ionic strength the temperature the humic acid as a natural organic material and the nature of interfering anions thereby the ebt adsorbed amount onto the alumina solid was found to increase by decreasing either the aqueous phase ph or the ionic strength of the adsorption medium the removal of ebt dye increases with rising temperature of the solution suggesting that the adsorption of ebt dye onto alumina adsorbent could be physical adsorption however decreases in the ebt adsorbed amount were observed upon the increase of the interfering anions no3 cl so4 2 and s2o3 2 affinity toward the alumina the coating of the alumina surface with humic acid hinders the adsorption of ebt dye the adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the langumir adsorption model and followed the pseudo second order kinetic model finally the overall data indicated that alumina is a potential adsorbent for the removal of dye accumulations normally present in diverse industrial wastewate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the university of ibn zohr agadir for making all the necessary resources

11994,naturally occurring abundant alumina particles were used as a low cost and eco friendly adsorbent for the removal of eriochrome black t ebt dye from an aqueous environment the surface morphology crystallinity and elemental analysis composition of the alumina before and after the adsorption process were investigated using sem edx ftir and drx techniques the alumina surface charge was examined by the electrokinetic measurement the impact of the physico chemical factors on the adsorption process was studied the adsorption experiments were performed using a batch reactor the fitted models were plotted for adsorption kinetic and isotherm studies based on the experimental results the adsorption data were well described by a pseudo second order kinetic model and the adsorption isotherms agreed well with the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity q max of alumina for the ebt dye was found to be 45 mg g corresponding to a removal percentage of 71 the ebt adsorption phenomena was endothermic and spontaneous the regeneration tests indicated that the alumina reveal an superb recycling capability therefore this result shows that the alumina particles can be applied as a natural encouraging adsorbent for the removal of anionic dye from aqueous solution the ebt dye adsorption mechanism can be controled by electrostatic attractions graphical abstract image 1 keywords alumina pollution organic dyes adsorption regeneration wastewater 1 introduction the surface water and groundwater pollution becomes a major problem in most of the developing countries this problem is the consequence of the presence in the water of polluting substances causing adverse effects directly or indirectly of the environment the origin of these substances is related to industrial agricultural activities as well as urban waste indeed many industries such as carpet cosmetic food plastic and paper etc produce a large amount of wastewater loaded with pollutants zazou et al 2019 for example wastewaters obtained from the textile dyeing are composed of enormous amounts of pollutants such as dyes generally these dyes are structurally complex turabik 2008 have high water solubility high colour and low biodegradability gupta et al 2013 moreover many dyes have toxic and carcinogenic effects on aquatic life and human health wong et al 2009 due to these harmful effects the treatment of wastewater containing the poisonous dye is of great concern before discharging into the water resources and ecosystem several wastewater treatment options including chlorination rajasulochana and preethy 2016 coagulation flocculation edison gilpavas et al 2017 electrochemical techniques electro coagulation zazou et al 2019 advanced oxidation processes du and chen 2017 membrane techniques hosseini et al 2018 biological degradation buthelezi et al 2012 and adsorption on various adsorbent have been successfully applied for dyes removal from wastewaters yagub et al 2014 these various dye treatment technologies have advantages but also disadvantages and handicaps such as low removal efficiency great electrical energy requirement and high cost treatment process bonetto et al 2015 guendy 2010 khandegar and saroha 2013 for example biological wastewater treatment processes do not achieve complete mineralization of the dye molecules and their efficiency is highly influenced by the physico chemical conditions of the effluent oller et al 2011 another principal method is coagulation flocculation process this technique only removes insoluble dyes but not solube dyes khandegar and saroha 2013 furthermore in coagulation flocculation process a large amount of sludge is created which may become a pollutant itself and increase the treatment costs ahn et al 1999 the adsorption technology on activated carbon is most popular process and is efficient however the regeneration of the spent adsorbent is difficult the implementation costs is high and its disposal is not really environment friendly verma et al 2012 according to these inconveniences the treatment of textile wastewater by the traditional methods becomes inadequate therefore the application of adsorption methods on different and low cost adsorbents can be a suitable solution for dye elimination from wastewater in recent decades several natural adsorbents such as clays minerals yap and priyaa 2019 zeolites abukhadra and mohamed 2019a clays activated with organic or inorganic compounds belaroussi et al 2018 diatomite nio composites abukhadraa et al 2019c various agro industrial wastes wakkel et al 2019 solid wastes abukhadra and shaban 2019b inorganic nanomaterials and oxides zheng et al 2019 debnath et al 2016 natural bituminous coal shaban et al 2017 have been employed for the elimination of dyes from wastewater in recent years more attention has been brought to metal oxides because of their physical and chemical properties in fact metal oxides such as iron and or aluminum oxide have a large surface area small size and a surface charge which facilitates the reduction of free metals and organic matter concentrations in natural environments via the adsorption process sharma et al 2008 for these reasons the metal oxides can be considered as alternative adsorbents to activated carbon in the wastewater treatment process dhawale et al 2018 however very few papers have concentrated on the use of aluminium oxide as an natural adsorbent for the elimination of organic dyes from liquid solution in this context we proposed to test the effectiveness of the adsorbent aluminum oxides as competitive with other materials to remove of eriochrome black t dye from water eriochrome black dye is chosen as a model of molecules belonging to the class of azo dyes these dyes are very widely used in textile dyeing and are also bio recalcitrant and resist aerobic degradation well even at low concentrations ahmad and hameed 2009 gercel et al 2008 therefore it is very necessary to remove azo dyes from industrial wastewater earlier its release into surface water and groundwater this research work aims to examine the effect of certain physico chemical parameters such as contact time ph ionic strength temperature nature of coexisting inorganic anions and humic acid concentration on the colorant removal the isotherms kinetics thermodynamics and regeneration investigations of the alumina were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the alumina al2o3 aluminum oxide particles purity greater than 99 used in this study are a commercial product and were purchased from sigma aldrich and was employed without further treatment the commercial dye eriochrome black t ebt cas number 1787 61 7 employed in this experiment was supplied from sigma chemical co and used it as received it is an azo and anionic dye which belongs to the category of water soluble dyes and its chemical structure is shown in fig 1 with a molar mass of 461 38 g mol the spectrophotometric properties have shown that the wavelength λ of the maximum absorbance is in the visible spectra λ max 540 nm in the present work all chemical reactants nacl nano3 na2so4 na2s2o3 used are analytical grade from sigma aldrich for each experiment distilled water was used to prepare the aqueous solutions reactants grade sodium hydroxide naoh purity greater

from sigma aldrich as sodium humate all the adsorption trials were done in triplicate and averaged 2 2 characterization techniques powder x ray diffraction pxrd fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy disperse x ray analysis sem edx techniques and zeta potential were used to characterize the alumina samples before and after the adsorption of the ebt dye the pxrd data of the samples was collected with a panalytical s x pert pro diffractometer the diffracted beam was detected detector active length 2 122 2θ over a range of 5 70 2θ with a step size of 0 03 2θ and a counting time of 100 s step over a 2θ range of 2 5 70 2θ with a step size of 0 03 2θ during 60 min the surface morphology and microstructure of pure alumina and ebt alumina samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy coupled with sem edx technique philips sem 525 m the sem analyses were conducted under accelerating voltage at 10 kv the infrared analysis was performed with ftla2000 series spectrometer abb bomen inc at resolution of 4 cm 1 with 20 scans in the 4000 to 400 cm 1 wavenumber range electrokinetic measurements were performed to evaluate the point of zero charge pzc of the pure alumina using a zetasizer nanoseries malvern instrument the determination of this point enables to draw conclusions about the ebt dye adsorption mechanisms the absorbance of the supernatant after separation was measured at 540 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3101pc 3 experimental section 3 1 kinetic adsorption experiments the kinetics of the ebt adsorption onto alumina has been studied at different temperatures introducing quantities of 50 mg alumina particles into 50 ml of the 50 mg l dye solutions in a 125 ml flask adjusting the ph to 6 and the ionic strength with 10 2 m nacl the mixtures in the flask were stirred at 150 rpm for a contact time varying from 10 to 450 min in a heated bath stirring and regulated at temperatures at 298 313 and 323 k after each contact time the contents of the flask were filtered using membrane syringe filter to separate the solid phase from the liquid phase and to immediately stop the adsorption process the ebt dye concentration remaining in the filtrate was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer the concentrations of ebt dye were evaluted using the linear regression equation then the amount of ebt dye adsorbed at the equilibrium at time t qt mg g was determined using the following equation eq 1 1 q t c 0 c t v m s where c0 and ct mg l are the initial and any time concentration of dye respectively v and ms are the volume of the liquid phase l and the mass of the adsorbent g respectively 3 2 kinetic adsorption models several kinetic models have been used to understand the mechanisms involved in the adsorption and chemical reaction processes the most cited models are pseudo first order kinetic model lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order kinetic model ho and mckay 1999 the pseudo first order rate expression of lagergren based on solid capacity is given in the following equation eq 2 2 d q t d t k 1 q e q t after integrating and applying the boundary conditions the linear form of expression obtained is eq 3 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qt and qe are respectively the adsorption capacities per unit mass of the adsorbent both in mg g at time t and at equilibrium and k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant of adsorption min 1 the pseudo second order equation is expressed as eq 4 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 after integration the kinetic rate expression becomes as eq 5 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e t q e where k2 is the equilibrium rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption g mg 1 min 1 this model is valid if the rate of the sorption is a second order mechanism then the intraparticle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 has been used to identify the diffusion controlled adsorption process and it was expressed by using the following equation eq 6 6 q t k i t 0 5 c s t e where ki is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 0 5 and cste mg g is a constant in general the adsorption process can be controlled by several steps especially i film or external diffusion ii pore diffusion and iii the adsorption on the pore including the chemisorption physiorption ion exchange or complexation or a combination of more than one step if the constant cste is zero the plots of q vs t0 5 satisfies the linear relationship with the experimental data implying that the sorption process is controlled by intra particle diffusion only however if the curve of q vs t0 5 is formed of several segments then two or more steps influence the sorption process the agreement between the mathematical models and experimental points was evaluated using χ2 r2 rmse and δq see table 1 3 3 activation energy the activation energy ea was estimated from an arrhenius plot the arrhenius equation was expressed as eq 7 7 l n k 2 l n k 0 e a r t where k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant of adsorption g mg 1 h 1 ea is the activation energy kj mol 1 ko is the arrhenius factor g mg 1 h 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the solution temperature k the ea value can be calculated from the slope of lnk2 vs t 1 plots the low values of the activation energy 5 50 kj mol 1 characterize the physisorption type whereas the high values 60 800 kj mol 1 imply a chemisorption type of adsorption nollet et al 2003 3 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption tests for removal of the ebt from aqueous solution were conducted using batch experiments to perform adsorption tests a stock solution 1000 mg l of ebt was prepared by dissolving 1 g of ebt powder in 1 l distilled water this solution is stirred until the total dissolving of the dye thereafter the desired ebt concentrations were obtained by successive dilutions of the stock solution with various volumes of distilled water the influence of certains parameter like the solution ph 4 10 ionic strength adjusted using nacl 10 3 10 1 m initial concentration of ebt dye 10 150 mg l nature of coexisting anions cl no3 so4 2 s2o3 2 and humic acid concentrations 50 and 100 ppm on the adsorption process of the ebt dye onto alumina particles were investigated each series experiment was performed by adding 0 05 g of alumina solid into 0 05 l of aqueous dye solution in a 125 ml flask at desired initial ph dye concentration ionic strength the ph of the mixture was adjusted to a given value with either 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh the contents of the flask were stirred at 150 rpm using a magnetic stirrer for 6 h after this contact time the content of the flask were separated at 4000 rpm for 20 min in a centrifuge the amount of ebt dye adsorbed at equilibrium i e adsorption capacity qe mg g and the removal efficiency of ebt removal were determined using the following equation eq 8 and 9 8 q e c 0 c e v m s 9 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentration of dye respectively v and ms are the volume of liquid phase l and the mass of the adsorbent g respectively 3 5 adsorption isotherm modeling the experimentally acquired adsorption isotherms have been fitted by three models namely langmuir freundlich and tempkin isotherm models 3 6 langmuir model the langmuir adsorption model is based on the assumption langmuir 1918 i the adsorption energy at all adsorption sites is uniform ii the adsorption is done in a monolayer coverage and iii the absence of lateral interactions between the adsorbed molecules the nonlinear equation of the langmuir isotherm is given by the following relation eq 10 10 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e the linear transformation of this model is expressed by the equation eq 11 11 1 q e 1 q m 1 k l c e q m where qe mg g is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium ceq is the equilibrium dye concentration in aqueous phase mg l kl is the langmuir equilibrium constant l mg and qm the maximum adsorption capacity mg g the langmuir isotherm can be classified by the dimensionless constant separation factor rl deniz et al 2011 expressed by the following correlation eq 12 12 r l 1 1 k l c 0 according on the value rl the type of isotherm can be described as irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 ahmadi et al 2016 3 7 freundlich model this model is an empirical model that reflects a variation of the interaction energies with the adsorbed amount of molecules freundlich 1906 the distribution of interaction energies is explained by the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites in contrast to the langmuir model the freundlich model admits the existence of interactions between the adsorbed molecules the freundlich equation is applicable to multilayer coverage and is defined by the following formula eq 13 13 q e k f c e 1 n the linear form of the freundlich model is represented as eq 14 14 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q e represents the amount adsorbed per amount of adsorbent at the equilibrium mg g ceq is the equilibrium dye concentration in aqueous solution mg l kf l mg and 1 n are the freundlich constants the 1 n values characterize the favorability of the adsorption process for values in the range of 0 1 n 1 the adsorption is favorable hameed 2008 3 8 tempkin model the tempkin model is based on the assumption that the heat of surface adsorption decreases linearly with the recovery rate due to the decrease in adsorbent adsorbate interactions tempkin and pyzhev 1940 the tempkin isotherm is represented by the following correlation eq 15 15 q e r t b ln a c e the linear form is given by the following expression eq 16 16 q e r t b ln a r t b ln c e where qe is the adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of the dye mg l and a is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g b is the tempkin isotherm constant which related to the heat of adsorption process t is the absolute temperature k and r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 to assess the accuracy of the curve models to the experimental data various error functions table 1 were used 3 9 thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic parameters like gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs for the adsorption of the ebt dye onto alumina particles were evaluated using the well established equations eq 17 17 δ g r t l n k d wherein δg is the standard gibbs free energy change j mol r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k and k d is the distribution coefficient expressed by the van t hoff equation eq 18 18 l n k d δ h 0 r 1 t δ s 0 r the values of enthalpy δh and entropy δs can be determinated from the slope and the intercept of the van t hoff curves of ln k d versus t 1 respectively 3 10 regeneration and reusability experiments after the adsorption process the regeneration of the adsorbent for multiple reuse is a very important step in our work the regeneration experiments were performed at ambient temperature in series firstly a fixed amount of the alumina 0 1 g was dispersed in 0 1 l of dye solution of initial concentration 100 mg l at ph 6 and at ionic strength 0 01 m which was agitated for 5 h secondly the mixture was centrifuged and the obtained solid alumina ebt adsorbed was desorbed in 0 1 l of solution containing 0 1 m naoh for 3 h to achieve desorption of the dye molecules from the alumina particles surface thirdly after the regeneration of the saturated adsorbent was achieved the fraction recovered was rinsed with hcl solution and distilled water until the supernant ph became neutral and was dried at 60 c for 24 h finally the regenerated adsorbent was employed in the successive adsorption desorption cycle this regeneration operation was reiterated for four times totally 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of pure alumina 4 1 1 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction pattern of pure alumina before adsorption is presented in fig 2 a showing the characteristic reflections of alumina furthermore the broad peaks in the diffractrogram also show the amorphous structure of the alumina indicating a low crystallinity tanhaei et al 2015 from fig 2a the diffraction peaks at 2θ 31 9 37 3 45 7 and 67 which are corresponding to the reflection planes 220 311 400 and 440 respectively verify the structure of alumina huang et al 2013 4 1 2 ftir analysis the evaluation of the surface functional groups of the adsorbent material was performed by ftir spectrum analysis and the results are presented in fig 2b spectra i in the pure alumina sample the presence of the peaks at 3449 cm 1 and at 1641 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of the oh group from al oh and bending vibration of oh groups respectively another peak at 560 cm 1 was attributed to al o nezam et al 2016 cai et al 2019 4 1 3 sem edx analysis fig 2c show the sem images of pure alumina before adsorption obtained with magnification at 2 00kx and 1 00kx taked at scale 50 μm respectively as can be observed from the sem image the pure alumina demonstrates to agglomerate of particles which have regular surface from the sem micrographs the particles have an average size of 150 μm in addition the edx spectrum obtained during sem analysis is given in fig 2d indicating only the high intensity peaks of al and o and confirming the presence of only alumina particles 4 1 4 point zero charge pzc the electrokinetic behavior of pure alumina particles in aqueous was examinated varing solution ph in the range 3 11 5 fig 3 represents the variation of the zeta potential versus the ph of the alumina particles in nacl 10 2 m as can be seen in this fig 3 the point zero charge of alumina corresponding to ph at which the zeta potential is zero takes place at phs 9 2 phpzc indeed this point suggests that the positively charged surface site density equals that of the negative sites for ph phpzc the zeta potential is positive due to protonation of hydroxyl groups at the interface and it decreases when the ph increases to ph 9 2 beyond ph 9 2 the zeta potential becomes negative due to dissociation of functional groups at the surface this behavior can be related to amphoteric character of the metal oxide surface depending on the ph value of aqueous solution yopps and fuerstenau 1964 other authors reported similar pzc value of alumina particles in aqueous solution janot et al 2013 moreau et al 2013 4 2 adsorption studies 4 2 1 effect of contact times in order to determine the equilibrium time for the maximum adsorption the adsorption experiment of the ebt dye on alumina particles was examined as a function of contact time at a various temperature the results obtained of this effect on ebt dye uptake by alumina adsorbent are presented in fig 4 a for a given temperature this figure clearly shows that the amount of ebt dye adsorbed increased with increasing contact time and reached equilibrium adsorption at 100 min in the first step a large amount of ebt dye was adsorbed rapidly due to a high number of active binding sites on the alumina in sencond step after equilibrium time gradual occupancy of acitve sites prevent the uptake of ebt dye which becomes less efficient the adsorption capacity of ebt molecules onto alumina adsorbent increases with increasing temperature from 298 to 332 k fig 4a suggesting that the adsorption of ebt dye to oxide aluminum is endothermic in nature this may be attributed to the higher of attractive forces between the active sites of alumina adsorbent and ebt molecules 4 2 2 adsorption kinetic model a study of adsorption kinetics is essentially as it gives information about the mechanism of adsorption which is interesting for the uptake during the process the adsorption kinetics data of the ebt dye onto alumina adsorbent obtained at different temperatures were analyzed using three models as a pseudo first order kinetic the pseudo second order kinetic fig 4b and c and the intraparticle diffusion fig 4d the values of respective fitting parameters for the adsorption of ebt onto alumina are given in table 2 from this table for both the pseudo first order and pseudo second order at different temperature the rate constants of adsorption k1 and k2 increases with the rise temperature of aqueous solution the regression coefficients for the pseudo first order model are low and the values of χ2 rmse and δq are high table 2 however the regression coefficients for the pseudosecond order model are very close to unity as are the law values of δq χ2 and rmse more the qe values calculated by the pseudo second order adsorption model are very table 2 reasonably close to the experimental qe values compared to those found by the pseudo first order model for these results it was noted that the pseudo second order is more adapted to the adsorption kinetics model of alumina particles than the pseudo first order adsorption model and that the adsorption process seem to be controlled by the chemical adsorption process implicating the valence forces of the shared or ion exchange between absorbent active site and dye molecules ecboon et al 2010 the results found are consistent with previous works on cationic dye adsorption kinetics using sepiolite and pyrophyllite zhang et al 2015 also our results are in agreement with other authors like yap and priyaa 2019 whereby they reported that pseudo second order kinetic model was best fitted for the adsorption of anionic dye on kaolin recently bentahar et al 2019 have reported similar observations when they studied the uptake of basic dye from aqueous solution by swelling and non swelling of natural clays fig 4d presents intraparticle diffusion plots for the adsorption of ebt dye by alumina adsorbent at different temperatures the intra particle diffusion plots only show two linear segments indicating that the transfer occurs and dominates under two stages the first stage indicates a rapid initial exterior surface ebt dye sorption onto the alumina correlated with the boundary layer diffusion meantime the second stage presents the slower internal binding of the ebt molecules prior to the attainment of saturation by showing intraparticle diffusion as the rate limiting mechanism during this stage wu et al 2009 zubaira et al 2020 titchou et al 2020 the intraparticle diffusion rate constants kd were also calculated and given in table 2 as shows table 2 k d k d k d and k d being the slopes of the first and second segment respectively which suggeste that the adsorption of ebt depended most on the thickness of the boundary layer in addition the rate constant of the first linear segment increase with increasing temperature denoting that the velocity of mobility of the ebt dye from the solution phase to alumina adsorbent is increased with temperature this shows that the ebt adsorption process is faster at higher temperature 4 2 3 activation energy the activation energy is determined from the plot lnk2 versus 1 t using equation eq 7 plot is not shown from the slope of this plot the calculated value of activation energy is equal to15 kj mol 1 for ebt sorption on alumunium oxide adsorbent the sorption phenomenon occurs by two different types physical and chemical adsorption these types are related to the amplitude of the activation energy in fact the physical adsorption type is characterized by lower activation energy values 5 50 kj mol 1 whereas the chemical adsorption type is described by the higher activation energy values 60 800 kj mol 1 nollet et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 the activation ernergy value found is between 5 and 50 kj mol 1 suggesting that the adsorption process is controlled by physical adsorption type which is described by low interactions between ebt dye and alumina solid and weak potential energy barrier in addition the increase in the adsorption rate constant observed in the temperature range is related to the low amplitude of the energy barrier a similar result was reported for adsorption of anionic dye and tartrazine from aqueous solution by saw dust banerjee and chattopadhyaya 2013 the value of the activation energy found in the present study is very similar to that calculated by banerjee and chattopadhyaya 2013 4 2 4 effect ph on adsorption of ebt dye in a natural environment the ph of an aqueous solution is an important factor influencing the adsorption phenomenon of a pollutant onto an adsorbent because it affects the charge of the functional groups both of the adsorbent surface and pollutant and the interaction between the adsorbent surface and polluants the impact of ph on adsorption of ebt dye onto alumina adsorbent was investigated using initial ebt concentration varying from 30 to 150 mg l at ph ranges of 4 10 fig 5 a illustres the ebt adsorption isotherms onto the alumina support at room temperature the plots indicate that the adsorption capacity is strong in acidic medium compared to basic medium the ebt adsorbed amount decreases from 72 3 to 18 4 mg g with increasing ph in the aqueous solution from 4 to 10 furthermore it can be noted that the ebt removal efficiency declined significantly from 71 3 to 18 4 with increasing ph of the aqueous solution fig 5b the explanation of the adsorption mechanism may be based on surface chemistry of the alumina particles like it has been mentioned that the presence of a metal oxide in the aqueous solution leads in the hydroxylation of the metal oxide surface banerjee et al 2013 thereby metal oxide surfaces have amphoteric character undergoing protonation or deprotonation reactions according to ph medium therefore this behavior obtained indicated that the ebt adsorption is related to the charge of the alumina surface which governing by the aqueous phase ph indeed when the ph phzpc 9 3 the alumina surface is charged positively due to protonation of groups on the metal oxide surface which promotes the adsorption of anionic dye under the action of electrostatic attraction forces between the sulfonic so3 groups of the ebt dye and the acid surface of the alumina particles al oh2 then again when the ph is around of zero point charge the adsorption seems to take place due to formation of hydrogen bond between hydroxyl group on alumina surface al oh and no2 and oh functional groups of ebt molecules when ph phzpc the alumina surface carries a negative charge due to deprotonation of hydroxyl group on alumina al o thus the ebt adsorption capacity is severely reduced as a result to electrostatic repulsion our results are similar to works in literature zheng et al 2012 monasha and pugazhenthi 2013 in a recent study cai et al reported that the adsorption of some ionic dyes onto alumina modified surfaces had been controlled by adjusting the ph value cai et al 2019 according to above discussion the ebt adsorption mechanism by aluminium oxide is illustrated in fig 5c as can be seen in the figure three types of interactions controlling ebt removal depending on the ph value of the aqueous phase are electrostatic attractions electrostatic repulsions and hydrogen bonding 4 2 5 effect of the type of the inorganic anions the composition of textile effluents is often rich in inorganic ions which complicates their treatment by the adsorption process for this cause the effect of coexisting anions on the adsorption of ebt dye from aqueous phase onto the alumina adsorbent was examined introducing different salts cl no3 so4 2 s2o3 2 at fixed concentration of 10 2 m in the aqueous solution fig 6 a shows that the dye adsorption capacity is affected by the nature of anions present in solution indeed these results indicate that the adsorption capacity of ebt dye decreases in the order s2o3 2 so4 2 no3 cl this effect can be attributed to forming of outer sphere complexes between anions and the surface of metal oxides kasprzyk hordern 2004 in fact the presence of sulfate and nitrate anions in the solution diminishes the density and accessibility of the site positively charged of the pure alumina causing a decrease of the attraction between the acid dye ebt and the adsorbent surface the values measured with the zeta potential of alumina particles in presence of no3 so4 2 and s2o3 2 anions are illustrated in fig 6b and indicate a decrease in magnitude of the charge density but it remains positive as resulting from the pure alumina surface charge screening by the sulfates and nitrate anions within experimental error we note that the reduction of the zeta potential value is significant in the presence of s2o3 2 and so4 2 than no3 and this may probably be assigned to the anionic charge density similar results were found by banerjee et al on their use of alumina for the removal of orange g from water banerjee et al 2017 however the decrease of adsorbed amount of ebt dye could correlate to the competition adsorption between the counter anions and so3 groups of the ebt dye towards the acid surface site of the alumina particles 4 2 6 effect of organic anions humic acid the impact of humic acid as organic matter on adsorption of ebt dye was studied at ambient temperature using adsorption experiments of dye on bare alumina and alumina in presence of different ha concentrations 50 and 100 ppm fig 7 shows the adsorption isotherms of ebt dye onto alumina particles as can be seen in fig 7 the presence of ha modified to alumina surface revealed a rather marked effect on the adsorption of ebt dye therefore modifying alumina surface with a high amount of humic acid disadvantaged the elimination of ebt from water in fact the adsorption of humic acid onto the surface of alumina particles leads to a change of the surface charge which would become negative this change would cause the repulsion between the anionic dye ebt and the alumina modified with humic acid via electrostatic interaction the modification of alumina by humic acid has been studied by ait akbour et al 2018 they explained that the charge of the modified alumina becomes negative due to the adsorption of humic acid via the carboxylic groups on the alumina surface this behavior is the fundamental for the improvement of the elimination of cationic dye by the modified alumina the results obtained in this work have a tendency opposite to those reported by several authors as the ebt dye studied in this work is an anionic dye compared to the cationic dye used by the researchers zermane et al 2013 4 2 7 effect ionic strength it should be noted that the effect of ionic strength is related to the nature of the adsorbate of the adsorbent and of the salt used for ionic strength control as well as of their concentrations in order to evaluate the impact of ionic strength on ebt dye adsorption increasing amounts of sodium chloride were added to the dispersion containing the alumina particles the amount of ebt adsorbed on pure alumina solid as a function of ionic strength is illustrated in fig 8 from this graph the adsorption capacity decreases upon addition of important dose of salt in fact significant decrease of the ebt removal efficiency from 70 8 to 46 1 resulted as the nacl concentration increased from 10 3 to 10 1 m the reduction of the removal efficiency under these conditions can be related to the aggregation of alumina particles promoted by the action of salt ions which leads to a decrease of the specific surface available for adsorption on the other hand the increase of the inorganic anion concentration cl in the solution competes with the so3 groups of the ebt dye to be adsorbed on alumina surface consequently it is expected that the ebt adsorption capacity should be reduced with an increase of salt concentration ait akbour et al found a similar result for adsorption of methylene blue onto humic acid coating alumina particles ait akbour et al 2018 4 2 8 thermodynamic study temperature effect the impact of temperature on the variation of ebt adsorption on alumina adsorbent vs contact times was investigated over the range from 298 to 333 k see fig 4a the results show that the amount of ebt adsorbed increases from 42 mg g at 298 k to 57 mg g at 333 k suggesting that this adsorption process is endothermic indeed this behavior can be attributed to higher rate diffusion through the boundary layer to the solid surface and large penetration of anionic dye from the bulk solution phase to the alumina surface ren et al 2018 the higher values for the adsorption with increasing temperature is related to rising attraction forces engaged between the functional groups of the support surface and the molecules furthermore high temperature reduces the solution viscosity which leads to a rise of the adsorbate mobility toward the support surface shah et al 2017 in order to elucidate the mechanism involved in the sorption process the thermodynamic parameters of the change free energy δg the enthalpy δh and the entropy δs of the adsorption reaction have been calculated using equation eqs 17 and 18 the values obtained for the thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 3 it is mentionned that δg values found are negative implying that the adsorption of ebt dye onto alumina nanoparticles is spontaneous and feasible in addition the δg values decrease with the temperature increasing suggesting that the ebt adsorption was favored at elevated temperature also the values δg found are between 0 and 10 kj mol 1 implying that the ebt adsorption is attributed to physisorption process kang et al 2018 the value enthalpy change δh for the present system is positive 31 98 kj mol 1 confirming that the adsorption phenomena is of endothermic nature and this result has been in conformity with the ebt adsorbed amounts which rise with increasing of solution temperature it is also noted that δs is positive 116 68 j mol 1 k 1 recommending that the randomness and disorder at the solid liquid interface increased over the adsorption of ebt dye onto the alumina nanoparticles song et al 2016 ghaedi et al 2012 our results agree accordingly with those reported by cai et al 2019 examining the adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes by ctab chitosan al2o3 composite 4 2 9 adsorption modelling in order to discuss the interaction involved in the ebt dye adsorption process onto alumina particles the isotherm study were performed at different experimental conditions and at constant temperature the isotherms obtained were fitted employing langmuir freundlich and tempkin models fig 9 a shows the amounts of ebt dye adsorbed at equilibrium qe versus equilibrium ebt concentration the comparison between the experimental adsorption isotherms and the adsorption isotherm models obtained from the nonlinear regression equation is also illustrated in fig 9a the obtained results including the model constant values the correlation coefficient r2 and various error functions are depicted in table 4 as shown in fig 9a at temperature 298 k the amount of adsorbed quantities increases with a rise in the concentration in the solution and then reaches a plateau after equilibrium this behavior is valid for all the temperatures studied indicating that the ebt isotherm is similar to h type according to giles et al 1960 based on the values of r2 and χ2 see table 5 and fig 9b c and 9d the langmuir model good described the adsorption of ebt dye onto alumine solid depending on the rmse and δq the langmuir model revealed lower errors and be in accordance very with the experimental data compared to other models this demonstrates that the surface of alumina particles is covered by a monolayer of ebt molecules furthemore for three temperature studied the dimensionless equilibrium constant rl values are close to 0 table 5 indicating the favorable adsorption of ebt onto alumina this behavior affirmed by the values of 1 n from the freundlich model which are revealed to be fewer than 1 confirming favorable adsorption process sheng et al 2018 taleb et al 2017 on the other hand the value of the freundlich constant kf increased from 10 633 to 24 532 with increasing of temperature from 298 to 323 k implying the endothermic feature of the adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity qm 57 25 mg g at 298 k of ebt onto alumina was compared with other adsorbents in table 5 for this table excluding of magnetite silica pectin nps attallah et al 2016 the adsorption capacity of alumina was higher than other adsorbents in addition to high adsorption capacity low expense ecologic this support is an excellent and appropriate adsorbent for the elimination of ebt from aqueous solutions 4 2 10 characterization of the materials after adsorption of ebt dye fig 2b spectrum ii represents pure alumina material after the ebt adsorption by comparing with the spectra i of pure alumina before adsorption we can remarked that after the adsorption of the dye there was a slight change in the positions of the peaks characterizing the structure of the pure alumina and also the appearance of other peaks characterizing the functional groups of molecule ebt as shown in spectra ii the peaks were found for secondary amine at 1530 cm 1 and n h bending at 1450 cm 1 khan et al 2018 the c h or ch3 bending was found at 1345 cm 1 whereas the so3 stretching was located at 1237 cm 1 the peacks at 1220 cm 1 and 1507 cm 1 were related to c n and nn groups in ebt molecule respectively this shows that ebt dye most probably interact with al oh and al o groups present on the alumina surface therefore analysis of these spectra confirms the proposed adsorption mechanism of ebt onto alumina as shown in fig 5c the sem picture of the sample after dye adsorption was presented in fig 2e as can be observed in this figure the picture aggrandize at 2 00kx disclose an irregular or rounded shapes and debris remarked in the alumina ebtdye sample the edx spectrum fig 2f reveals the traces of the adsorbed ebt dye onto the alumina from the peaks acquired for carbon sulfur and sodium in the spectra thus it is proved that ebt dye has been successfully fixed onto the surface of the alumine particles 4 2 11 regeneration and reuse tests the efficiency of wastewater treatment by the adsorption process depends mainly on its costs and also on the quantity of solid waste produced the latter could be minimal if the regeneration of the adsorbent used is easy and effective in this present work the regeneration tests of alumina particles was perfomed in basic medium promoting desorption of ebt dye the results obtained after each adsorption desorption cycle are presented in fig 10 as can be observed in fig 10 the adsorbed amount as well as removal of ebt dye decrease after successives four adsorption desorption cycles indeed an 11 drop of the ebt removal was recorded so this results obtained proved that alumina particles can be efficiently reused until four cycles for the eliminated of ebt from aqueous solutions without greatly reduction of adsorption capacity this study examined the adsorption characteristics and the pertinence of alumina as low cost and natural adsorbent for the removal of ebt dye from aqueous solutions and by utilizing batch mode the results demonstrate that the adsorption was dependent on divers parameters like the aqueous phase ph the ionic strength the temperature the humic acid as a natural organic material and the nature of interfering anions thereby the ebt adsorbed amount onto the alumina solid was found to increase by decreasing either the aqueous phase ph or the ionic strength of the adsorption medium the removal of ebt dye increases with rising temperature of the solution suggesting that the adsorption of ebt dye onto alumina adsorbent could be physical adsorption however decreases in the ebt adsorbed amount were observed upon the increase of the interfering anions no3 cl so4 2 and s2o3 2 affinity toward the alumina the coating of the alumina surface with humic acid hinders the adsorption of ebt dye the adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the langumir adsorption model and followed the pseudo second order kinetic model finally the overall data indicated that alumina is a potential adsorbent for the removal of dye accumulations normally present in diverse industrial wastewate declaration of
