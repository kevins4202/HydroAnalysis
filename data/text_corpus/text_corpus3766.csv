light industry and flows to the southern pacific ocean on the eastern coast of new south wales australia at each site duplicates of 1 5 g dry weight of plastics were deployed within nylon mesh bags

quantitative elemental analysis on the particles after quant optimisation using copper all results are in weight percent using processing option all elements analysed normalised and are relative to the elements detectable by sem eds the adsorption capacity of two different cations was accomplished using 134cs and 85sr radiotracers and the remaining plastic samples which were environmentally conditioned for a total of 142 days 26 february 18 july 2016 the cs and sr radiotracers differ in their relative adsorption strengths freshwater sediment partitioning coefficient geometric means of 1e04 and 1e03 respectively and referred to as relatively strong and weak for the purposes of this paper after the 142 day deployment period the freshwater and estuarine samples were retrieved for radiotracer testing while the marine plastics had been sub sampled at 19 days and used for ftir and xfm testing they had subsequently been removed from the field by persons unknown and were not available for the adsorption experiment approximately 10 kbq of 134cs and 85sr were added to duplicate 50 ml polycarbonate tubes with filtered 0 45 μm host water from each deployment site and known masses of each plastic type as most adsorption of metals on microplastics appears to occur in the approximate first 30 h holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the experimental tubes were gently agitated for 48 h after which the solution was separated from plastics via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm glass fibre subsamples of the filtrate were analysed via gamma spectrometry and the activity

can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 retention of radiotracers on differing types of plastics biofilm the adsorption of 134cs and 85sr radiotracers onto the environmentally conditioned plastics biofilm was measurable for all plastic types our adsorption data for cs and sr alkali and alkaline earth metals k d s of 1 81 ml g 1 are comparable to those for the range of transition metal adsorption on virgin and weathered plastics k d s 1 221 ml g 1 determined previously holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the greatest observed adsorption value was for 134cs on hdpe microspheres in freshwater conditions table 1 and 134cs adsorption in freshwater was significantly greater than for estuarine conditions for all plastic types p value 0 03 mann whitney u test one tailed 134cs adsorption in estuarine marine conditions is known to be inhibited by other cations primarily k competing for adsorption sites evrard et al 2015 similar to our results greater adsorption in freshwater as compared with marine conditions was observed in recent studies with cd co ni and pb which also used tracer adsorption testing methods holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the mean sr k d s ranged from 1 0 to 14 0 mg l 1 in contrast to the higher cs range of 3 6 80 3 mg l 1 while the 85sr adsorption was typically less than that of 134cs it was however measurable for all conditions and plastic types table 1 sr was not markedly different between freshwater and estuarine conditions the least of the observed mean adsorption values was for sr associated with pp 50 μm strips in freshwater conditions 129 bq g 1 k d of 1 0 mg l 1 a single non detect value for one of the pp subsample replicates in freshwater is reported in table 1 minimum for the freshwater pp 85sr combination it indicates the adsorption of 85sr onto microplastics in that particular subsample was small and generally within the same range as the variation that occurred in adsorption to study container walls however the non detect was for only one subsample and the mean of that sample type condition indicated positive adsorption among plastic types mean adsorption on pp strips was less than that of hdpe samples by factors of 2 9 rochman et al 2014 measured adsorption of a range of metals onto environmental pp that was both lower and higher than that of hdpe depending on conditions however no directly comparable previous data for adsorption of radionuclides onto different types of plastic were available as a comparative baseline we estimated adsorption on unweathered non biofilm pp surfaces to be approximately 1 0 1 6 that of the weathered biofilm conditioned plastics using the experimental range of solution activity concentrations and nominal area cm 2 of our pp 50 μm of this study along with a 6e 04 solution cm 2 adsorption rate of 137cs onto clean pp slides at neutral ph reported in eichholz et al 1965 3 2 biofilm coverage and composition on plastic surfaces in several previous studies the authors attributed most adsorption of cationic metals to surface attached matter as well as surface modification by photooxidation ashton et al 2010 holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the microscopy data of this study revealed higher proportions of si al and o co located in heterogeneous patches consistent with the accumulation in biologically facilitated deposits fig 2 these patchy areas were interspersed with mostly bare or sparsely colonised areas that still had adsorbed mineral components but at much lower concentrations e g al reduced from 24 to 12 in freshwater and 21 13 in estuarine conditions for biofilm dominated vs mostly bare areas see supplemental using a sem eds summary long count 12 h on an estuarine conditioned plastic biofilm surface o was most abundant 47 which was in part due to plastic followed by si 21 al 14 fe 9 with 2 of ca cl k mg mn na p s and ti this element abundance profile is consistent generally with that of clays most of which are dominated by sio2 al2o3 with lesser amounts of fe2o3 and often include trace elements such as ti iaea 2013 fe and ti were present in surface deposits of the study samples primarily in discrete concentrations that were typically located within the same deposits containing sialo sem eds and xfm data figs 2 and 3 visual inspection confirmed these patches included agglomerated masses dominated by frangible weakly bound fine grained material consistent with clays along with occasional crystalline structured grains and fibrous organic material some adhered discrete particles had variable elemental makeup that suggests anthropogenic origin the results provide insights into the elemental composition of the biofilms however quantification of the total surface area added by the biofilm among plastic types and deployment conditions has yet to be achieved as it requires a systematic method of measuring biofilm composition along with three dimensional structure at μm scales the development of which will be desirable in future studies it may be possible to develop techniques of analysing the inorganic chemical fingerprint of the biofilm associated with the plastic to infer the presence and type of plastic in a given water body however a great deal of further work conducted initially in the laboratory then translated to the field would need to be undertaken to determine the differences in chemical fingerprint among biofilms with differing organism communities and differing adsorbed inorganic particles that are associated with different plastic types and ages the adsorption patterns of other elements such as cl and br did not align with the discrete patchy sialo deposits but exhibited more continuous spatial coverage generally consistent with that expected from non particulate pervasive reactive water solutes fig 3 with greater cl and br adsorption on marine samples which also had some discrete fe and zn concentrations fig s2 the striation patterns resulted from the sectioning process in which surface material was pulled into the cross section face by the microtome blade the compton scatter image indicates where the incident photon beam encountered electrons within the solid material target and is used here as an indicator of the size and location of the microtomed plastic thin section the presence of s on the surface of the particles suggests organic proteinaceous materials and possibly sulphide oxidising biofilm such as photosynthetic sulphur bacteria pickering et al 2001 but may also be explained by solute adsorption or association with fine non biological deposits overall the microscopy data of individual microplastic particles that were analysed post rinsing in filtered 0 45 μm host water are consistent with the capture and incorporation of clays micro and nano sized as well as a range of discrete mineral grains and other materials in discontinuous biofilm structures on the surfaces of the plastics 3 3 comparison with sediment k d s our measured k d values for hdpe and pp types of plastics biofilm are substantially lower than those reported for sediments from both field and laboratory studies in most cases fig 4 specifically k d for plastics biofilm for 134cs from the current study are 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than reference values for sediments from a large number of studies field and laboratory as summarised by the international atomic energy agency iaea 2004 2010 and other published data børretzen and salbu 2002 carpenter 1997 oughton et al 1997 saengkul et al 2013 similarly for 85sr in freshwater our results suggest that the k d for plastics biofilm are 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than reference values for sediments from other studies while 85sr in estuarine conditions did not appear to be different discussed below the orders of magnitude greater adsorption for sediments in most study cases fig 4 is consistent with their greater relative surface areas adsorption is in part a function of the surface area of the adsorbent which generally reflects available binding sites and the electrochemical characteristics of those sites clays have exchangeable surface areas typically in the 1 105 x106 cm2 g 1 range macht et al 2011 as compared with the nominal 1 104 cm2 g 1 for the plastics used in this study our results here are consistent with other studies ashton et al 2010 turner and holmes 2015 that found biofilm development on plastic surfaces substantially raised their overall adsorption capacity but does not approach that of relatively high surface area sediments iaea 2010 the k d experimental results along with the microscopy data are consistent with a conceptual model that biofilm with captured clays increases the overall adsorption rates onto plastics but at lower rates compared with native sediments as the biofilm was manifest as variable patchy deposits on the otherwise relatively smooth and low reactive surfaces of the plastics however the relative surface area per mass changes with scale typical aqueously dispersed clays range from 0 001 to 0 009 μm in thickness nadeau 1985 in comparison the plastic shapes of this study were relatively large 50 100 μm and at these scales much of the plastic is within not at the surface of the particle and thus limits sites available for biofilm development and adsorption experimental constraints determined the size of the plastics we used in this study in nature plastics may fragment or weather into smaller sizes bond et al 2018 cole et al 2011 dawson et al 2018 demonstrated that antarctic krill fed microplastic pieces 31 5 μm egest fragmented particles 1 μm in diameter likely due to mechanical grinding in the krill s gastric mill when plastics weather to smaller μm scales their overall nominal surface area increases on a per gram basis however the overall availability of binding sites the extent and nature of biofilm community structure and the ecocorona lynch et al 2009 will also depend on the plastic s surface composition topography and the environmental setting and these factors should be further studied to determine their relative influence on adsorbing molecules rummel et al 2017 while the plastics biofilm adsorption was generally much less than that of sediments the exception in this study was the combination of 85sr in estuarine conditions in which the adsorption k d s of microplastics biofilm appear to be comparable with those reported for reference marine sediments iaea 2004 this similarity may be due to the weaker salinity in the estuarine conditions of our study where for many metals adsorption depends on the salinity gradient holmes et al 2014 but may also reflect the limits of the reference data no reference sediment k d data were available for sr in estuarine conditions and although n 62 for reference laboratory k d values in simulated marine conditions the vast majority of these came from a single study takata et al 2014 and therefore sr values for a wide range of field marine sediments are not yet available for comparison the k d parameter is used here mainly as a bulk means of comparing plastic adsorption of cs and sr to that of sediments for both of these media the k d concept has limitations as it is a parameter that combines numerous processes and has an underlying assumption of equilibrium conditions that are rarely if ever found in nature the reference field k d data tend to be higher than laboratory derived data as they are influenced by additional processes e g tidal exchange which often lead to dilution of the water component of the k d equation the presence of biological material in field conditions also likely increases the adsorption onto the solid phase therefore increasing k d s of the field data whether for plastics or sediments the oversimplified parameter k d does not account for dynamic environments found in field conditions such as water exchange reversible adsorption isotherms exchange between suspended vs sedimentary material and especially the dynamic mixing and dilution that occurs to radionuclides in the water column over time and distance following acute releases into aquatic environments periáñez et al 2018 our results suggest cs and sr radionuclide adsorption onto microplastics should be considered in fate and transport assessments as the more buoyant plastics may mobilise released radionuclides along pathways that sediments would not one such release occurred during the period of days to weeks succeeding the march 2011 tsunami that led to the fukushima accident when a large influx of tsunami mobilised plastics entered the open ocean and was transported eastward via the north pacific gyre murray et al 2018 therriault et al 2018 it is not yet understood how much of the 137cs and other particle reactive radionuclides that were released from the fukushima accident have adsorbed to the well documented masses of buoyant plastics in the open waters of the pacific barnes et al 2009 eriksen et al 2014 or to less buoyant plastics bond et al 2018 associated with the freshwater estuarine and coastal sediments of eastern japan that are receiving ongoing radionuclides via surface erosion and runoff buesseler et al 2017 while our results suggest plastics as potential sinks and transport vectors should be considered among the fate pathways of released radionuclides the relatively weak adsorption rates do not suggest plastics as a principle vector for transfer of radionuclides to living organisms such potential transfer should be investigated however recent re evaluation of past studies has suggested that in aquatic systems the overall flux of hocs bioaccumulated from the ingestion of natural diet overwhelms the flux associated with ingested microplastics koelmans et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 even when gut surfactants or the influence of gut ph or temperature were considered for hoc desorption hence leading to bioaccumulation modelling by bakir et al 2016 suggested that ingestion of microplastic does not provide a quantitatively important additional pathway for the transfer of adsorbed hocs from seawater to biota although this study focused on key radionuclides associated with accidents and other releases the x ray fluorescence sem eds and radiotracer methods used here can be applied to a range of metal contaminants of concern e g as cd ce se mn zn associated with micro particles of differing types the gamma irradiation used here was shown to be a useful tool for rapidly simulating some of the surface photooxidation seen on environmentally exposed plastics that may be important for micro organism colonisation and aggregation future studies in this area should focus on assessing the specific role of microorganisms in facilitating the accretion of mineral clay particles which aggregate on the surfaces of environmental plastic and the plastic degradation pathways that lead to microbial colonisation including focus on systematic means of relating biofilm composition physicochemical characteristics and microstructure coverage to overall adsorption rates 4 conclusions our results indicate that hdpe and pp type aquatic microplastics biofilm provide an environmental sink for pervasive reactive radionuclides similar to sediments albeit to a lesser degree microscopy elemental mapping revealed patchy biofilm development that compared with relatively bare plastic surfaces was enriched with si al and o consistent with microbial facilitated capture of clays when subjected to radiotracers the resulting 134cs and 85sr adsorption onto the 50 100 μm size range of microplastics biofilm were generally 2 3 orders of magnitude less than those for sediments although more data for sr in estuarine field conditions are required as the difference between sediments vs microplastics biofilm adsorption appears roughly in line with their respective surface areas our results suggest that smaller microplastics biofilm smaller than studied here may exhibit increased adsorption rates as surface area per mass increases however there may be other mechanisms that drive the adsorption of monovalent and divalent cations onto microplastics biofilm that we have not identified e g biofilm community and ecocorona composition and further work in this area is required overall the results of this study are generally consistent with a conceptual model of plastic surfaces altered by environmental exposure the rapid development of discrete biofilm patches that include accretion of alsio and other elements the adherence of which may be facilitated by microbial colonisation and the resulting adsorption of the cationic alkali and alkaline earth metals cs and sr similar to that observed for transition metals future work should focus on understanding the surface state of the plastic particles in relation to physical and chemical properties e g roughness chemical composition surface charge of the plastics as well as the ph and doc of the host water and biological properties e g microbial community and ecocorona composition under differing

quantitative elemental analysis on the particles after quant optimisation using copper all results are in weight percent using processing option all elements analysed normalised and are relative to the elements detectable by sem eds the adsorption capacity of two different cations was accomplished using 134cs and 85sr radiotracers and the remaining plastic samples which were environmentally conditioned for a total of 142 days 26 february 18 july 2016 the cs and sr radiotracers differ in their relative adsorption strengths freshwater sediment partitioning coefficient geometric means of 1e04 and 1e03 respectively and referred to as relatively strong and weak for the purposes of this paper after the 142 day deployment period the freshwater and estuarine samples were retrieved for radiotracer testing while the marine plastics had been sub sampled at 19 days and used for ftir and xfm testing they had subsequently been removed from the field by persons unknown and were not available for the adsorption experiment approximately 10 kbq of 134cs and 85sr were added to duplicate 50 ml polycarbonate tubes with filtered 0 45 μm host water from each deployment site and known masses of each plastic type as most adsorption of metals on microplastics appears to occur in the approximate first 30 h holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the experimental tubes were gently agitated for 48 h after which the solution was separated from plastics via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm glass fibre subsamples of the filtrate were analysed via gamma spectrometry and the activity concentration for each radionuclide was compared with that from four control treatments that did not contain plastics calculations of the distribution coefficients k d s provided the ratio of the mass activity density of the solid phase to the volumetric activity density of the liquid phase expressed in units of ml g 1 environment agency uk 2005 iaea 2010 additional details on materials and methods can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 retention of radiotracers on differing types of plastics biofilm the adsorption of 134cs and 85sr radiotracers onto the environmentally conditioned plastics biofilm was measurable for all plastic types our adsorption data for cs and sr alkali and alkaline earth metals k d s of 1 81 ml g 1 are comparable to those for the range of transition metal adsorption on virgin and weathered plastics k d s 1 221 ml g 1 determined previously holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the greatest observed adsorption value was for 134cs on hdpe microspheres in freshwater conditions table 1 and 134cs adsorption in freshwater was significantly greater than for estuarine conditions for all plastic types p value 0 03 mann whitney u test one tailed 134cs adsorption in estuarine marine conditions is known to be inhibited by other cations primarily k competing for adsorption sites evrard et al 2015 similar to our results greater adsorption in freshwater as compared with marine conditions was observed in recent studies with cd co ni and pb which also used tracer adsorption testing methods holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the mean sr k d s ranged from 1 0 to 14 0 mg l 1 in contrast to the higher cs range of 3 6 80 3 mg l 1 while the 85sr adsorption was typically less than that of 134cs it was however measurable for all conditions and plastic types table 1 sr was not markedly different between freshwater and estuarine conditions the least of the observed mean adsorption values was for sr associated with pp 50 μm strips in freshwater conditions 129 bq g 1 k d of 1 0 mg l 1 a single non detect value for one of the pp subsample replicates in freshwater is reported in table 1 minimum for the freshwater pp 85sr combination it indicates the adsorption of 85sr onto microplastics in that particular subsample was small and generally within the same range as the variation that occurred in adsorption to study container walls however the non detect was for only one subsample and the mean of that sample type condition indicated positive adsorption among plastic types mean adsorption on pp strips was less than that of hdpe samples by factors of 2 9 rochman et al 2014 measured adsorption of a range of metals onto environmental pp that was both lower and higher than that of hdpe depending on conditions however no directly comparable previous data for adsorption of radionuclides onto different types of plastic were available as a comparative baseline we estimated adsorption on unweathered non biofilm pp surfaces to be approximately 1 0 1 6 that of the weathered biofilm conditioned plastics using the experimental range of solution activity concentrations and nominal area cm 2 of our pp 50 μm of this study along with a 6e 04 solution cm 2 adsorption rate of 137cs onto clean pp slides at neutral ph reported in eichholz et al 1965 3 2 biofilm coverage and composition on plastic surfaces in several previous studies the authors attributed most adsorption of cationic metals to surface attached matter as well as surface modification by photooxidation ashton et al 2010 holmes et al 2012 turner and holmes 2015 the microscopy data of this study revealed higher proportions of si al and o co located in heterogeneous patches consistent with the accumulation in biologically facilitated deposits fig 2 these patchy areas were interspersed with mostly bare or sparsely colonised areas that still had adsorbed mineral components but at much lower concentrations e g al reduced from 24 to 12 in freshwater and 21 13 in estuarine conditions for biofilm dominated vs mostly bare areas see supplemental using a sem eds summary long count 12 h on an estuarine conditioned plastic biofilm surface o was most abundant 47 which was in part due to plastic followed by si 21 al 14 fe 9 with 2 of ca cl k mg mn na p s and ti this element abundance profile is consistent generally with that of clays most of which are dominated by sio2 al2o3 with lesser amounts of fe2o3 and often include trace elements such as ti iaea 2013 fe and ti were present in surface deposits of the study samples primarily in discrete concentrations that were typically located within the same deposits containing sialo sem eds and xfm data figs 2 and 3 visual inspection confirmed these patches included agglomerated masses dominated by frangible weakly bound fine grained material consistent with clays along with occasional crystalline structured grains and fibrous organic material some adhered discrete particles had variable elemental makeup that suggests anthropogenic origin the results provide insights into the elemental composition of the biofilms however quantification of the total surface area added by the biofilm among plastic types and deployment conditions has yet to be achieved as it requires a systematic method of measuring biofilm composition along with three dimensional structure at μm scales the development of which will be desirable in future studies it may be possible to develop techniques of analysing the inorganic chemical fingerprint of the biofilm associated with the plastic to infer the presence and type of plastic in a given water body however a great deal of further work conducted initially in the laboratory then translated to the field would need to be undertaken to determine the differences in chemical fingerprint among biofilms with differing organism communities and differing adsorbed inorganic particles that are associated with different plastic types and ages the adsorption patterns of other elements such as cl and br did not align with the discrete patchy sialo deposits but exhibited more continuous spatial coverage generally consistent with that expected from non particulate pervasive reactive water solutes fig 3 with greater cl and br adsorption on marine samples which also had some discrete fe and zn concentrations fig s2 the striation patterns resulted from the sectioning process in which surface material was pulled into the cross section face by the microtome blade the compton scatter image indicates where the incident photon beam encountered electrons within the solid material target and is used here as an indicator of the size and location of the microtomed plastic thin section the presence of s on the surface of the particles suggests organic proteinaceous materials and possibly sulphide oxidising biofilm such as photosynthetic sulphur bacteria pickering et al 2001 but may also be explained by solute adsorption or association with fine non biological deposits overall the microscopy data of individual microplastic particles that were analysed post rinsing in filtered 0 45 μm host water are consistent with the capture and incorporation of clays micro and nano sized as well as a range of discrete mineral grains and other materials in discontinuous biofilm structures on the surfaces of the plastics 3 3 comparison with sediment k d s our measured k d values for hdpe and pp types of plastics biofilm are substantially lower than those reported for sediments from both field and laboratory studies in most cases fig 4 specifically k d for plastics biofilm for 134cs from the current study are 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than reference values for sediments from a large number of studies field and laboratory as summarised by the international atomic energy agency iaea 2004 2010 and other published data børretzen and salbu 2002 carpenter 1997 oughton et al 1997 saengkul et al 2013 similarly for 85sr in freshwater our results suggest that the k d for plastics biofilm are 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than reference values for sediments from other studies while 85sr in estuarine conditions did not appear to be different discussed below the orders of magnitude greater adsorption for sediments in most study cases fig 4 is consistent with their greater relative surface areas adsorption is in part a function of the surface area of the adsorbent which generally reflects available binding sites and the electrochemical characteristics of those sites clays have exchangeable surface areas typically in the 1 105 x106 cm2 g 1 range macht et al 2011 as compared with the nominal 1 104 cm2 g 1 for the plastics used in this study our results here are consistent with other studies ashton et al 2010 turner and holmes 2015 that found biofilm development on plastic surfaces substantially raised their overall adsorption capacity but does not approach that of relatively high surface area sediments iaea 2010 the k d experimental results along with the microscopy data are consistent with a conceptual model that biofilm with captured clays increases the overall adsorption rates onto plastics but at lower rates compared with native sediments as the biofilm was manifest as variable patchy deposits on the otherwise relatively smooth and low reactive surfaces of the plastics however the relative surface area per mass changes with scale typical aqueously dispersed clays range from 0 001 to 0 009 μm in thickness nadeau 1985 in comparison the plastic shapes of this study were relatively large 50 100 μm and at these scales much of the plastic is within not at the surface of the particle and thus limits sites available for biofilm development and adsorption experimental constraints determined the size of the plastics we used in this study in nature plastics may fragment or weather into smaller sizes bond et al 2018 cole et al 2011 dawson et al 2018 demonstrated that antarctic krill fed microplastic pieces 31 5 μm egest fragmented particles 1 μm in diameter likely due to mechanical grinding in the krill s gastric mill when plastics weather to smaller μm scales their overall nominal surface area increases on a per gram basis however the overall availability of binding sites the extent and nature of biofilm community structure and the ecocorona lynch et al 2009 will also depend on the plastic s surface composition topography and the environmental setting and these factors should be further studied to determine their relative influence on adsorbing molecules rummel et al 2017 while the plastics biofilm adsorption was generally much less than that of sediments the exception in this study was the combination of 85sr in estuarine conditions in which the adsorption k d s of microplastics biofilm appear to be comparable with those reported for reference marine sediments iaea 2004 this similarity may be due to the weaker salinity in the estuarine conditions of our study where for many metals adsorption depends on the salinity gradient holmes et al 2014 but may also reflect the limits of the reference data no reference sediment k d data were available for sr in estuarine conditions and although n 62 for reference laboratory k d values in simulated marine conditions the vast majority of these came from a single study takata et al 2014 and therefore sr values for a wide range of field marine sediments are not yet available for comparison the k d parameter is used here mainly as a bulk means of comparing plastic adsorption of cs and sr to that of sediments for both of these media the k d concept has limitations as it is a parameter that combines numerous processes and has an underlying assumption of equilibrium conditions that are rarely if ever found in nature the reference field k d data tend to be higher than laboratory derived data as they are influenced by additional processes e g tidal exchange which often lead to dilution of the water component of the k d equation the presence of biological material in field conditions also likely increases the adsorption onto the solid phase therefore increasing k d s of the field data whether for plastics or sediments the oversimplified parameter k d does not account for dynamic environments found in field conditions such as water exchange reversible adsorption isotherms exchange between suspended vs sedimentary material and especially the dynamic mixing and dilution that occurs to radionuclides in the water column over time and distance following acute releases into aquatic environments periáñez et al 2018 our results suggest cs and sr radionuclide adsorption onto microplastics should be considered in fate and transport assessments as the more buoyant plastics may mobilise released radionuclides along pathways that sediments would not one such release occurred during the period of days to weeks succeeding the march 2011 tsunami that led to the fukushima accident when a large influx of tsunami mobilised plastics entered the open ocean and was transported eastward via the north pacific gyre murray et al 2018 therriault et al 2018 it is not yet understood how much of the 137cs and other particle reactive radionuclides that were released from the fukushima accident have adsorbed to the well documented masses of buoyant plastics in the open waters of the pacific barnes et al 2009 eriksen et al 2014 or to less buoyant plastics bond et al 2018 associated with the freshwater estuarine and coastal sediments of eastern japan that are receiving ongoing radionuclides via surface erosion and runoff buesseler et al 2017 while our results suggest plastics as potential sinks and transport vectors should be considered among the fate pathways of released radionuclides the relatively weak adsorption rates do not suggest plastics as a principle vector for transfer of radionuclides to living organisms such potential transfer should be investigated however recent re evaluation of past studies has suggested that in aquatic systems the overall flux of hocs bioaccumulated from the ingestion of natural diet overwhelms the flux associated with ingested microplastics koelmans et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 even when gut surfactants or the influence of gut ph or temperature were considered for hoc desorption hence leading to bioaccumulation modelling by bakir et al 2016 suggested that ingestion of microplastic does not provide a quantitatively important additional pathway for the transfer of adsorbed hocs from seawater to biota although this study focused on key radionuclides associated with accidents and other releases the x ray fluorescence sem eds and radiotracer methods used here can be applied to a range of metal contaminants of concern e g as cd ce se mn zn associated with micro particles of differing types the gamma irradiation used here was shown to be a useful tool for rapidly simulating some of the surface photooxidation seen on environmentally exposed plastics that may be important for micro organism colonisation and aggregation future studies in this area should focus on assessing the specific role of microorganisms in facilitating the accretion of mineral clay particles which aggregate on the surfaces of environmental plastic and the plastic degradation pathways that lead to microbial colonisation including focus on systematic means of relating biofilm composition physicochemical characteristics and microstructure coverage to overall adsorption rates 4 conclusions our results indicate that hdpe and pp type aquatic microplastics biofilm provide an environmental sink for pervasive reactive radionuclides similar to sediments albeit to a lesser degree microscopy elemental mapping revealed patchy biofilm development that compared with relatively bare plastic surfaces was enriched with si al and o consistent with microbial facilitated capture of clays when subjected to radiotracers the resulting 134cs and 85sr adsorption onto the 50 100 μm size range of microplastics biofilm were generally 2 3 orders of magnitude less than those for sediments although more data for sr in estuarine field conditions are required as the difference between sediments vs microplastics biofilm adsorption appears roughly in line with their respective surface areas our results suggest that smaller microplastics biofilm smaller than studied here may exhibit increased adsorption rates as surface area per mass increases however there may be other mechanisms that drive the adsorption of monovalent and divalent cations onto microplastics biofilm that we have not identified e g biofilm community and ecocorona composition and further work in this area is required overall the results of this study are generally consistent with a conceptual model of plastic surfaces altered by environmental exposure the rapid development of discrete biofilm patches that include accretion of alsio and other elements the adherence of which may be facilitated by microbial colonisation and the resulting adsorption of the cationic alkali and alkaline earth metals cs and sr similar to that observed for transition metals future work should focus on understanding the surface state of the plastic particles in relation to physical and chemical properties e g

18831,a novel laboratory experiment of three chamber bioelectrochemical surface water sediment groundwater ssg system was established in this study which combined a sediment microbial fuel cell smfc reactor and biofilm electrode reactor ber and was self driven simulated groundwater was firstly used to explore the reaction mechanisms of this system the simulated groundwater conditions were static and the surface water and the groundwater systems were isolated the results showed that the smfc continuously supplied a stable voltage of 622 mv 20 mv driving the ber and the related nitrate removal process compared to the control systems the ssg system had higher nitrate removal with a denitrification rate of 3 87 mg n l h in addition the sediment organic matter in the smfc reactor decreased by 66 2 based on the electrochemical analysis and microbial community analysis the smfc reactor and ber worked synergistically to enhance the performance of both reactors in this system the presence of microorganisms accelerated the electron transfer efficiency throughout the system and the microcurrent helped a more fixed community structure to develop and stimulated the growth of denitrifying bacteria the dominant genera detected in the mature biofilm samples were all microorganisms common in soil and groundwater indicating that this system may be environmentally friendly the nitrate removal efficiency for actual groundwater was higher than that for the simulated groundwater indicating that the elements in the actual groundwater promote the nitrate removal efficiency these results indicate that the ssg system has the potential for in situ nitrate bioremediation with minimal maintenance and health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords self driven system in situ remediation microbial community structure nitrate removal groundwater 1 introduction groundwater nitrate pollution resulting from nitrogenous fertilization and wastewater discharge is a global concern and a particularly important ongoing environmental problem mas pla and menció 2019 taufiq et al 2019 in asia region numbers of studies have reported the ubiquitous nitrate contamination issues in india china and indonesia ahada and suthar 2018 han et al 2016 shukla and saxena 2018 han et al 2016 compiled nitrate data covering 52 of china s groundwater systems and found that nitrate pollution at levels exceeding the us environmental protection agency epa s maximum contaminant level 10 mg l no3 n occurs at the 90th percentile in 25 of 36 shallow aquifers and 10 out of 37 deep or karst aquifers nitrate contamination is associated with health concerns such as methemoglobinemia or stomach cancer and environmental impacts such as fish kills and eutrophication liu et al 2016 maila et al 2004 in situ bioremediation which relies on the ability of indigenous or introduced microorganisms to continuously degrade nitrate has been recognized as one of the most efficient processes for nitrate removal from groundwater ghafari et al 2008 luo et al 2017 tong and he 2013 the biodegradation process is usually very slow due to insufficient electron donors long generation times and low microbial activity li and yu 2015a electrochemical stimulation techniques to enhance biodegradation by microbial fuel cells mfcs and biofilm electrode methods have drawn the attention of many researchers liu et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 however both methods have advantages and limitations for application mfc electrodes can be used directly as electron donors or acceptors and their large specific surface area is beneficial for the adsorption of pollutants and bacteria which enhances the biodegradation efficiency jiang et al 2016 however the environment within groundwater usually cannot simultaneously support the requisite reaction conditions of both the anode and cathode auxiliary measures such as the input of external power the addition of intermediaries and the construction of a salt bridge have been necessary in previous studies cheng et al 2014 morris and jin 2008 additionally the wastewater introduced as the fuel and the activated sludge used to inoculate the system may enter the groundwater and cause secondary pollution li and yu 2015a the biofilm electrode method combines an electrochemical process with the biodegradation process and uses electrochemical products as carbon sources and energy sources for biofilm growth tong and he 2013 biofilm electrode systems can both produce hydrogen and stimulate the metabolism of denitrifying bacteria to increase their growth activity bio denitrification can be carried out in the absence of an organic carbon source and the denitrification rate increases as the applied current increases park et al 2005 improved the nitrate removal efficiency by changing the current applied to a biofilm electrode system and when the applied current reached 200 ma a nitrate removal efficiency of 98 was achieved however the addition of an external current necessitates long term material and energy inputs and maintenance the coupling of mfcs with biofilm electrode systems represents a potential solution to many of the above problems zhang et al 2014 first reported the application of electricity generated from a mfc to a bioelectrical reactor ber to improve the bacterial nitrogen removal efficiency compared with the control group without electrical stimulation the proliferation and activity of denitrifying bacteria and nitrate removal increased in addition the accumulation of intermediates in the electrical stimulation group decreased however the use of sewage as fuel results in a certain degree of risk of groundwater contamination and necessitates frequent maintenance work which limit the practical application of this system to address the aforementioned application limitations a novel three chamber bioelectrochemical surface water sediment groundwater ssg system appropriate for in situ remediation of nitrate contaminated groundwater was proposed in this study the ssg system mainly combines a sediment microbial fuel cell smfc reactor with the ber reactor the smfc was used to generate a constant microcurrent instead of a mfc and brought two advantages to ssg system firstly smfcs use the abundant organic matter in sediments as fuel to generate stable and long lasting electrical energy which avoids the necessity of frequent maintenance donovan et al 2011 li and yu 2015b thomas et al 2013 secondly organic matter in sediment and nitrate pollution in groundwater could be simultaneously remediated in the ssg system furthermore the ber cathode was inoculated with indigenous groundwater microorganisms which can reduce the risk of groundwater contamination the mechanisms by which the smfc interacted with the ber were explored to further improve this system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus 2 1 1 smfc construction the test smfc reactor was a glass bottle with a total volume of 250 ml and the bottle was filled with 100 ml of sediment and 150 ml of water on top of the sediment the sediment was collected from the northern part of the chaobai river in shunyi district beijing china the sediment was composed of 41 5 sand 58 1 powder and 0 4 clay specifically surface sediments top 10 cm were removed and brought back to the laboratory for the experiments debris such as garbage and branches were removed by sieving the samples through 2 mm sieves the overlying water was also collected from the chaobai river the anode electrode consisted of a 4 cm 3 cm piece of carbon felt fixed on a titanium wire the anode electrode was set 2 cm below the mud water interface and the titanium wire extended out of the bottle the cathode had the same structure as the anode and was placed 1 cm below the water surface 2 1 2 ber construction and inoculation the ber was a glass bottle similar to the smfc reactor which is a simulated static groundwater system the cathode was a piece of 15 cm 1 5 cm stainless steel mesh fixed to a piece of 6 cm 1 5 cm carbon felt groundwater samples were collected from a 120 m deep well shunyi district chaobai river basin 116 42 30 40 10 26 we took 2 ml groundwater samples 298 15 mg l of total alkalinity 0 36 μg l of mn 12 06 μg l of fe and 1 54 mg l of po4 3 to create an enrichment culture by incubating them for 24 h with lb medium the cathodes were placed in the culture solution and shaken at 37 c for 24 h then the cathodes were removed and placed in simulated groundwater with a no3 n content of 60 mg l for domestication of denitrifying bacteria the culture solution was changed every 24 h and replaced a total of five times simulated groundwater was used at first to better reaction conditions control and to investigate the reaction mechanism in the ssg system the simulated groundwater consisted of 0 2 ml of methanol 111 mg of calcium chloride 184 5 mg of magnesium sulfate 364 mg of sodium nitrate 137 7 mg of sodium hydrogen carbonate and 71 mg of sodium sulfate these materials were added to deionized water and a total volume of 2 l was used neutral environment is essential for biotic denitrification luo et al 2018 in this study the initial ph of the simulated groundwater was 6 8 to maintain hypoxic conditions nitrogen was blown to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration under 0 5 mg l the carbon felt was fully immersed in the simulated groundwater and the stainless steel mesh extended out of the ber the anode structure was the same as that of the cathode but the anode was not inoculated with the enrichment culture solution the distance between the two electrodes was 1 cm 2 1 3 the ssg system construction as shown in fig 1 the cathode of the ber and the anode of the smfc as well as the anode of the ber and the cathode of the smfc were connected by wires to form a closed loop and the ssg system was constructed ber and smfc are isolated in ssg system additionally the following three control systems were used an open circuit system in which the ber was neither inoculated with microorganisms nor connected to the smfc denoted as c a closed circuit system in which the ber was not inoculated with microorganisms but was connected to the smfc denoted as ce and an open circuit system in which the ber was inoculated with microorganisms but not connected to the smfc denoted as cb b e and c represent the biological reactors electronic reactors and controls respectively two parallel reactors were set up for each system 2 1 4 verification of the ssg system simulated groundwater was used in the ber reactor in the foregoing experiments to study the mechanism of the ssg system the nitrate removal ability of the ssg system was further verified for actual groundwater using the same experimental apparatus and domesticated microorganisms as those used in the forgoing experiments the groundwater was sampled from a 37 7 m deep well daxing district beijing 116 12 15 39 25 57 which was different from the one used for the inoculum to reflect that the inoculum per se is not important the main components of the actual groundwater were 10 01 mg l no3 n 40 μg l of mn 432 μg l of fe and 1 56 mg l of po4 3 sodium nitrate was added in the actual groundwater to final concentrations of 30 and 60 mg l respectively nitrogen was blown into the actual groundwater to get hypoxic conditions with the dissolved oxygen concentration under 0 5 mg l 2 2 measurement methods and data analysis 2 2 1 water quality and sediment indicators water quality indicators including the chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and dissolved oxygen do were detected by standard methods walter 1992 the organic matter in sediments was measured using wet oxidation method grossman and ghosh 2009 the oxidation reduction potential orp was measured by a calibrated hach hq30 d m hach loveland usa 2 2 2 electrochemical analysis cyclic voltammetry cv curves of ber cathode were measured in the simulated groundwater by using a saturated calomel electrode sce as the reference electrode with a scan range of 1 5 1 v as basic indexes of primary cells to evaluate the power generation of smfcs polarization curves and power density curves were tested by the steady discharging method liang et al 2007 2 2 3 illumina miseq sequencing and microbial community analysis a microbial community analysis was performed on the chaobai river groundwater sample c the electrode biofilm samples inoculated with the enrichment culture solution and acclimated for 7 days cb7 and ssg7 and for 30 days cb30 and ssg30 dna samples were extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals llc usa our target was the v3v4 hyper variable region of the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform majorbio biopharm technology co ltd shanghai china using a set of barcode containing primers nobar 341f nobar 805r for 16s rrna gene amplification usearch was used to statistically analyse operational taxonomic units otus at similarity of 97 the silva database was used to classify the otus quast et al 2013 the analysis of diversity alpha diversity in a single sample reflected the abundance and diversity of the overall microbial community mothur was used to analyse the indexes at 97 based on the otus multidimension analysis was carried out to probe the evolutionary relationships among the five samples an error map was used for a more detailed analysis and comparison of the differences between biofilm samples cb30 and ssg30 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal from groundwater and reduced black odour in sediment the denitrification effect of the ber in the four test systems including ssg c ce and cb was examined the results are shown in fig 2 as expected in the absence of inoculated microorganisms the nitrate contents of c and ce did not decrease and showed a slight upward trend which might be caused by the evaporation of water the nitrate concentration of the closed circuit system ce was slightly lower than that of the open circuit system c which indicates that the ability of the current to directly reduce nitrate was weak via purely electrochemical action as shown in fig 2 when the ber was inoculated with microorganisms the nitrate removal efficiency of ssg and cb showed the same trend over a 24 h cycle after the ber was connected to the smfc the nitrate removal efficiency of ssg was much better than that of cb both systems had a linear downward trend within the first 6 h the nitrate concentration of be was reduced quickly to below 10 mg l which is the limit specified by the us epa according to the linear fitting of the data within the first 6 h the denitrification rate of ssg was 3 87 mg n l h and higher than that of cb which was 2 92 mg n l h furthermore the nitrate concentration was undetectable after 24 h in the ssg system these results implied that the nitrate removal was mainly achieved by biodegradation in the ber it is a process in which nitrates accept electrons and is reduced to nitrogen under the action of microorganisms moreover the current produced by the smfc increased the nitrate removal performance biological denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra are the two main pathways of the nitrate related biological nitrogen cycle and no2 n and nh4 n are the main reduction intermediates zhang et al 2014 thus no2 n and nh4 n were measured in aqueous solution in the cb and ssg systems fig 2 both no2 n and nh4 n concentrations showed a tendency to first increase to a peak and then decline which indicated that both denitrification and dnra processes existed in these systems however the peak concentration of no2 n was 4 5 times that of nh4 n which proved that biological denitrification played a major role in the nitrate removal as reported by zhang et al 2014 electrochemical stimulation could enhance biological denitrification by reducing no2 n accumulation as shown in fig 2 the no2 n in the ssg system was basically removed after 18 h while 7 mg l remained in the cb system in the ssg system the concentration of nh4 n also decreased to below 0 2 mg l meeting the grade ⅲ requirements of standards for groundwater quality samr 2017 the nitrate removal performance of the ssg system was compared with that reported in previous studies as shown in table 1 the denitrification rates vary largely under different operating conditions a dc driven reactor can achieve a higher denitrification rate but requires high energy consumption pous et al 2015 tong and he 2013 wan et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 the study by pous et al 2015 further demonstrated that the denitrification rate increased with the increasing input current a submerged microbial desalination denitrification cell smddc does not need a power source but its denitrification rate is only 0 708 mg n l h the denitrification rate of the combined smfc and ber system in this study is lower than that of a combined single chamber mfc and ber system zhang et al 2014 however by using sediment as fuel this system does not require frequent replenishment of the anode reactants and can continuously and permanently operate in addition indigenous groundwater microorganisms were introduced into the ber cathode which avoids the risk of groundwater contamination the denitrification rate might also be improved by series or parallel application of smfcs optimize the reactor configuration and electrode materials at the end of the experiment the colour of the smfc in the closed circuit systems ce and ssg changed from black to light brown and the original odour disappeared the degree of black coloration and odour in the sediment are negatively related to the orp and lower orp values indicate a darker black colour and stronger odour wang et al 2014 2016a b thus orp and organic matter in sediment were measured in the four systems fig 3 in the ssg system the organic matter in the smfc was degraded and generated electrons that entered the ber through the external circuit thus the cathode of the ber directly served as an electron donor to provide electrons for nitrate removal thus the orp increased to approximately 0 mv and the sediment organic matter decreased by 66 2 in ssg system fig 3 as expected the organic matter contents in the sediment were not much different from those in the original sediment in the cb system therefore after establishing a closed loop of the smfc and ber to form the ssg system the removal efficiency for contaminants in both groundwater and sediment improved it should be noted that the system is in static condition and the surface water and groundwater is isolated in this experiment which is different from the actual groundwater systems groundwater saturated aquifer cannot be absolutely isolated system and its occurrence depends on rock types degree of weathering and fracturing and depth to basement therefore it is necessary to further study the efficiency of the ssg system under the conditions of lotic flowing system and the connected systems for example this system might be applicable to gaining rivers e g rivers that are groundwater fed such rivers are likely to situated over a porous alluvial aquifer and the system is not going to isolated as in the experimental case as there will have to be a groundwater gradient moving water towards the river 3 2 electrochemical performance of the ssg system to investigate the effect of the inoculated biofilm on the electrode cv curves of the original raw electrode the immature biofilm electrode without electrical stimulation after 5 days of acclimation in the enrichment culture solution before placement in the ber and the mature biofilm electrode after electrical stimulation were obtained fig 4 the area of the cv curve for the mature biofilm electrode was significantly larger than that of the immature biofilm electrode and both areas were larger than that of the raw electrode this difference demonstrated that the electrochemical activity of the electrode was increased by the biofilm and electrical stimulation the immature biofilm electrode showed a redox peak at approximately 0 v versus sce which might be a nitrite reduction peak and this peak suggested the occurrence of denitrification nitrite formation and possible nitrite accumulation the nitrite reduction peak of the mature biofilm electrode was not clear but the peak current was large which may indicate a high reduction ability for nitrite the electrical performance of the smfcs was evaluated fig 5 when initially establishing the smfcs the open circuit voltage ocv could reach more than 500 mv thus newly built smfcs could be directly used as power sources and can greatly reduce the start up time mfcs generally need tursun et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 at the end of the experiment the maximum ocvs of the smfcs in the open circuit systems c and cb increased to 991 and 969 mv respectively while the output voltages of the smfcs in the closed circuit systems ce and ssg were 713 22 mv and 622 mv 20 mv respectively fig 5 shows the polarization and power density curves of the final smfcs the ocvs of the smfcs in this study were higher than those of most previous mfcs an et al 2013 pandey et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 however the power density can still be further improved through optimizing structure design or employing a power management system donovan et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 the magnitude of the smfc output voltage is related to the resistance of the external circuit therefore the resistance corresponding to the voltage of the smfc in the polarization curve can be considered as the internal resistance of the ber the currents applied to the bers in ce and ssg were approximately 0 16 and 0 27 ma respectively thus the internal resistance of the bers in ce and ssg were 4300 and 2581 ω respectively it should be noted that the current required for the ber in this study is 1 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the current supplied by dc power showing the power saving advantage of this system tong and he 2013 wan et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 after establishing the smfc and ber in a closed loop to form the ssg system the removal efficiency for contaminants in both the sediment and groundwater improved the circulation of electrons increased the energy utilization efficiency in the ssg system the organic matter in the smfc was degraded and electrons were generated which entered the ber through external circuit therefore the cathode of the ber directly served as an electron donor to provide electrons for nitrate removal the biofilms accelerated the electron transfer efficiency and electrons continuously flowed from the smfc anode which also enhanced the degradation efficiency of organic matter in the smfc song et al 2010 furthermore the biofilms adhered to the surface of the electrode thereby reducing the surface potential of the electrode and activating the internal resistance consequently the overall internal resistance of the ber decreased and a larger current was generated in the external circuit 3 3 changes in the microbial community within the ber cathodic biofilms in the ssg system the nitrate removal in the ber primarily relied on biodegradation to further explore the reaction mechanism the bacterial community composition was analysed by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene diversity indexes of the five samples c cb7 cb30 ssg7 and ssg30 are shown in table 2 the high coverage index values indicated that the sequencing results were sufficient to effectively characterize the bacterial communities the shannon index of sample c the original groundwater sample was only 3 11 while the other samples had a shannon index of more than 3 6 the community diversity of the original groundwater sample was low and the domesticated electrode biofilm samples had higher diversity levels than the original water non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and bray curtis tree results showed that the community structures of all four samples were significantly different from that of the original groundwater sample fig 6 it should be noted that the biofilm samples ssg7 and ssg30 had very high community structure similarity and the similarity was higher than that between biofilm samples cb7 and cb30 this difference may signify that stimulation from the current can help the microbial community structure develop in a fixed direction however the microbial community in the biofilms not subjected to the current stimulation was susceptible to other environmental factors and grew in an uncertain manner the heatmap of the five samples at the genus level showed that the dominant populations in the original groundwater consisted of sphingomonas burkholderia phenylobacterium methylophilus methylophaga phreatobacter and acinetobacter fig 7 the abundance of these microorganisms decreased by varying degrees after inoculation of the ber cathode other genera such as hyphomicrobium terrimicrobium tepidisphaera and prosthecobacter which were not abundant in the original groundwater increased in abundance and became the dominant genera the genera that had high abundance levels in ssg7 ssg30 cb7 and cb30 were sphingomonas tepidisphaera and terrimicrobium sphingomonas is a bacterium that can degrade toxic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs verma et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 tepidisphaera and terrimicrobium have been characterized in recent years and can be found in terrestrial hot springs and rice paddy fields respectively kovaleva et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 these genera exist in soil and groundwater indicating the low health risk from inoculating indigenous groundwater microorganisms in our system in addition a small but noteworthy difference was that nitrospira see supplementary materials table s1 was detected in the current free samples but not in the current stimulated samples nitrospira is a chemical inorganic autotrophic type species of nitrifying bacteria that oxidizes nitrite to nitrate under aerobic conditions nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and is a useful genus for nitrite oxidation daims et al 2001 studies have shown that the growth of nitrospira is inhibited under low dissolved oxygen conditions but it can still grow park and noguera 2008 however the results of this study indicate that the current stimulation under low dissolved oxygen conditions may deepen the inhibition and make nitrospira almost extinct which is more conducive to denitrification the specific mechanism of this action needs further study proper microcurrents have been shown to increase enzyme activity stimulate bacterial metabolism promote bacterial growth and reproduction and improve cell membrane permeability hao et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 our analysis showed that the microcurrent generated by the smfc could significantly change the community structure of the ber cathode biofilms an error map representing the differences between cb30 and ssg30 is shown in fig 8 the abundances of hyphomicrobium diaphorobacter sediminibacterium pseudoxanthomonas bacillus and pirellula were significantly higher in ssg30 than in cb30 among these bacterial populations a variety of denitrifying bacteria were included interestingly hyphomicrobium is a common rhizosphere microorganism that can reduce nitrates by using methanol as a carbon source under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ishii et al 2008 at the same time hyphomicrobium is a mn oxidizing bacteria which has the ability to nitrate reduction as well as oxidation of mn du et al 2017 the abundance of hyphomicrobium in ssg30 19 23 was much higher than that in cb30 8 73 the difference in the abundance of hyphomicrobium might be the main reason for the difference in the nitrogen removal efficiency between the two systems diaphorobacter pseudoxanthomonas bacillus and pirellula are also common denitrifying bacteria buckley et al 2006 mohapatra et al 2018 she et al 2006 wang et 2016a b these results may indicate that denitrifying bacteria are better able to withstand current stimulation and that their metabolism and physiological activity can be improved with application of suitable currents in addition the microbial community diversity decreased under current stimulation and the community structure was more likely to develop in a fixed direction in the ssg system the nitrate removal enhancement with current was indirectly achieved by increasing the activity of the denitrifying bacteria 3 4 verification of the nitrate removal of the ssg system the above results indicate that the activity of denitrifying bacteria is very crucial for the nitrate removal of the ssg system specially the parameters in the actual groundwater such as alkalinity dissolved oxygen dissolved mn fe and phosphorous largely affect the microbial activity which implies the important impact of the chemical conditions of groundwater therefore the nitrate removal ability of the ssg system was further verified by using the raw groundwater in the ber actor as shown in fig 9 the general tendencies of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations in actual groundwater were consistent with those in simulated groundwater nitrate concentrations were quickly reduced to below 10 mg l and undetectable after 24 h under all the three initial no3 n concentrations 10 30 and 60 mg l no2 n and nh4 n concentrations showed a tendency to first increase to a peak and then decline which were basically removed after 9 h and 24 h it should be noted that nitrate removal efficiency in actual groundwater was higher than that in simulated groundwater previous studies proved that the dissolved mn fe and phosphorous are essential elements for microbial growth appropriate concentration promotes the growth of microorganisms while high concentration inhibits the growth of microorganisms cao et al 2002 de et al 2012 in different systems the ranges of the promotion inhibition are different of these elements to microorganisms song et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 therefore the nitrate removal efficiency will be promoted in the actual groundwater with concentrations under those of the parameters in this study which are 298 15 mg l of total alkalinity 40 μg l of mn 432 μg l of fe and 1 56 mg l of po4 3 respectively 4 conclusions the ssg system constructed in this study has been preliminarily proven to simultaneously remediate organic matter in sediment and nitrate pollution in groundwater in this system the smfc reactor and ber interact synergistically to enhance the performance of both reactors the microcurrent produced by the smfc can help the community structure develop in a fixed direction in addition increasing the activity of the denitrifying bacteria improved the electrochemical performance of the ber and promoted energy conversion and consumption the nitrate removal efficiency of the ssg system is effective for either simulated or actual groundwater the nitrate removal efficiency in actual groundwater is promoted within the certain concentration ranges of dissolved mn fe and phosphorous in this study in this experiment the simulated groundwater conditions are static and isolated there are many differences between laboratory research and field tests at this stage the study cannot be applied at field conditions to remove nitrate at large scale but lab scale from the perspective of application potential the ssg system has the potential for in site bioremediation in lentic water bodies with relatively isolate groundwater systems for example artificial lakes and confined aquifer of course there should be sediment in the surface water and the flow velocity of the groundwater should be very slow further work must be implemented to improve the ssg system for example the enhancement of the output power of smfc the determination of the concentration boundaries of elements and dissolved oxygen which affect microbial activity in groundwater and the effect on the transformation of nitrate in particular to investigate the comprehensive effects of the actual conditions in field including hydrological conditions coexisting ion effects and electrode settings on the system is essential acknowledgments the authors thank the major science

18831,a novel laboratory experiment of three chamber bioelectrochemical surface water sediment groundwater ssg system was established in this study which combined a sediment microbial fuel cell smfc reactor and biofilm electrode reactor ber and was self driven simulated groundwater was firstly used to explore the reaction mechanisms of this system the simulated groundwater conditions were static and the surface water and the groundwater systems were isolated the results showed that the smfc continuously supplied a stable voltage of 622 mv 20 mv driving the ber and the related nitrate removal process compared to the control systems the ssg system had higher nitrate removal with a denitrification rate of 3 87 mg n l h in addition the sediment organic matter in the smfc reactor decreased by 66 2 based on the electrochemical analysis and microbial community analysis the smfc reactor and ber worked synergistically to enhance the performance of both reactors in this system the presence of microorganisms accelerated the electron transfer efficiency throughout the system and the microcurrent helped a more fixed community structure to develop and stimulated the growth of denitrifying bacteria the dominant genera detected in the mature biofilm samples were all microorganisms common in soil and groundwater indicating that this system may be environmentally friendly the nitrate removal efficiency for actual groundwater was higher than that for the simulated groundwater indicating that the elements in the actual groundwater promote the nitrate removal efficiency these results indicate that the ssg system has the potential for in situ nitrate bioremediation with minimal maintenance and health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords self driven system in situ remediation microbial community structure nitrate removal groundwater 1 introduction groundwater nitrate pollution resulting from nitrogenous fertilization and wastewater discharge is a global concern and a particularly important ongoing environmental problem mas pla and menció 2019 taufiq et al 2019 in asia region numbers of studies have reported the ubiquitous nitrate contamination issues in india china and indonesia ahada and suthar 2018 han et al 2016 shukla and saxena 2018 han et al 2016 compiled nitrate data covering 52 of china s groundwater systems and found that nitrate pollution at levels exceeding the us environmental protection agency epa s maximum contaminant level 10 mg l no3 n occurs at the 90th percentile in 25 of 36 shallow aquifers and 10 out of 37 deep or karst aquifers nitrate contamination is associated with health concerns such as methemoglobinemia or stomach cancer and environmental impacts such as fish kills and eutrophication liu et al 2016 maila et al 2004 in situ bioremediation which relies on the ability of indigenous or introduced microorganisms to continuously degrade nitrate has been recognized as one of the most efficient processes for nitrate removal from groundwater ghafari et al 2008 luo et al 2017 tong and he 2013 the biodegradation process is usually very slow due to insufficient electron donors long generation times and low microbial activity li and yu 2015a electrochemical stimulation techniques to enhance biodegradation by microbial fuel cells mfcs and biofilm electrode methods have drawn the attention of many researchers liu et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 however both methods have advantages and limitations for application mfc electrodes can be used directly as electron donors or acceptors and their large specific surface area is beneficial for the adsorption of pollutants and bacteria which enhances the biodegradation efficiency jiang et al 2016 however the environment within groundwater usually cannot simultaneously support the requisite reaction conditions of both the anode and cathode auxiliary measures such as the input of external power the addition of intermediaries and the construction of a salt bridge have been necessary in previous studies cheng et al 2014 morris and jin 2008 additionally the wastewater introduced as the fuel and the activated sludge used to inoculate the system may enter the groundwater and cause secondary pollution li and yu 2015a the biofilm electrode method combines an electrochemical process with the biodegradation process and uses electrochemical products as carbon sources and energy sources for biofilm growth tong and he 2013 biofilm electrode systems can both produce hydrogen and stimulate the metabolism of denitrifying bacteria to increase their growth activity bio denitrification can be carried out in the absence of an organic carbon source and the denitrification rate increases as the applied current increases park et al 2005 improved the nitrate removal efficiency by changing the current applied to a biofilm electrode system and when the applied current reached 200 ma a nitrate removal efficiency of 98 was achieved however the addition of an external current necessitates long term material and energy inputs and maintenance the coupling of mfcs with biofilm electrode systems represents a potential solution to many of the above problems zhang et al 2014 first reported the application of electricity generated from a mfc to a bioelectrical reactor ber to improve the bacterial nitrogen removal efficiency compared with the control group without electrical stimulation the proliferation and activity of denitrifying bacteria and nitrate removal increased in addition the accumulation of intermediates in the electrical stimulation group decreased however the use of sewage as fuel results in a certain degree of risk of groundwater contamination and necessitates frequent maintenance work which limit the practical application of this system to address the aforementioned application limitations a novel three chamber bioelectrochemical surface water sediment groundwater ssg system appropriate for in situ remediation of nitrate contaminated groundwater was proposed in this study the ssg system mainly combines a sediment microbial fuel cell smfc reactor with the ber reactor the smfc was used to generate a constant microcurrent instead of a mfc and brought two advantages to ssg system firstly smfcs use the abundant organic matter in sediments as fuel to generate stable and long lasting electrical energy which avoids the necessity of frequent maintenance donovan et al 2011 li and yu 2015b thomas et al 2013 secondly organic matter in sediment and nitrate pollution in groundwater could be simultaneously remediated in the ssg system furthermore the ber cathode was inoculated with indigenous groundwater microorganisms which can reduce the risk of groundwater contamination the mechanisms by which the smfc interacted with the ber were explored to further improve this system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus 2 1 1 smfc construction the test smfc reactor was a glass bottle with a total volume of 250 ml and the bottle was filled with 100 ml of sediment and 150 ml of water on top of the sediment the sediment was collected from the northern part of the chaobai river in shunyi district beijing china the sediment was composed of 41 5 sand 58 1 powder and 0 4 clay specifically surface sediments top 10 cm were removed and brought back to the laboratory for the experiments debris such as garbage and branches were removed by sieving the samples through 2 mm sieves the overlying water was also collected from the chaobai river the anode electrode consisted of a 4 cm 3 cm piece of carbon felt fixed on a titanium wire the anode electrode was set 2 cm below the mud water interface and the titanium wire extended out of the bottle the cathode had the same structure as the anode and was placed 1 cm below the water surface 2 1 2 ber construction and inoculation the ber was a glass bottle similar to the smfc reactor which is a simulated static groundwater system the cathode was a piece of 15 cm 1 5 cm stainless steel mesh fixed to a piece of 6 cm 1 5 cm carbon felt groundwater samples were collected from a 120 m deep well shunyi district chaobai river basin 116 42 30 40 10 26 we took 2 ml groundwater samples 298 15 mg l of total alkalinity 0 36 μg l of mn 12 06 μg l of fe and 1 54 mg l of po4 3 to create an enrichment culture by incubating them for 24 h with lb medium the cathodes were placed in the culture solution and shaken at 37 c for 24 h then the cathodes were removed and placed in simulated groundwater with a no3 n content of 60 mg l for domestication of denitrifying bacteria the culture solution was changed every 24 h and replaced a total of five times simulated groundwater was used at first to better reaction conditions control and to investigate the reaction mechanism in the ssg system the simulated groundwater consisted of 0 2 ml of methanol 111 mg of calcium chloride 184 5 mg of magnesium sulfate 364 mg of sodium nitrate 137 7 mg of sodium hydrogen carbonate and 71 mg of sodium sulfate these materials were added to deionized water and a total volume of 2 l was used neutral environment is essential for biotic denitrification luo et al 2018 in this study the initial ph of the simulated groundwater was 6 8 to maintain hypoxic conditions nitrogen was blown to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration under 0 5 mg l the carbon felt was fully immersed in the simulated groundwater and the stainless steel mesh extended out of the ber the anode structure was the same as that of the cathode but the anode was not inoculated with the enrichment culture solution the distance between the two electrodes was 1 cm 2 1 3 the ssg system construction as shown in fig 1 the cathode of the ber and the anode of the smfc as well as the anode of the ber and the cathode of the smfc were connected by wires to form a closed loop and the ssg system was constructed ber and smfc are isolated in ssg system additionally the following three control systems were used an open circuit system in which the ber was neither inoculated with microorganisms nor connected to the smfc denoted as c a closed circuit system in which the ber was not inoculated with microorganisms but was connected to the smfc denoted as ce and an open circuit system in which the ber was inoculated with microorganisms but not connected to the smfc denoted as cb b e and c represent the biological reactors electronic reactors and controls respectively two parallel reactors were set up for each system 2 1 4 verification of the ssg system simulated groundwater was used in the ber reactor in the foregoing experiments to study the mechanism of the ssg system the nitrate removal ability of the ssg system was further verified for actual groundwater using the same experimental apparatus and domesticated microorganisms as those used in the forgoing experiments the groundwater was sampled from a 37 7 m deep well daxing district beijing 116 12 15 39 25 57 which was different from the one used for the inoculum to reflect that the inoculum per se is not important the main components of the actual groundwater were 10 01 mg l no3 n 40 μg l of mn 432 μg l of fe and 1 56 mg l of po4 3 sodium nitrate was added in the actual groundwater to final concentrations of 30 and 60 mg l respectively nitrogen was blown into the actual groundwater to get hypoxic conditions with the dissolved oxygen concentration under 0 5 mg l 2 2 measurement methods and data analysis 2 2 1 water quality and sediment indicators water quality indicators including the chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and dissolved oxygen do were detected by standard methods walter 1992 the organic matter in sediments was measured using wet oxidation method grossman and ghosh 2009 the oxidation reduction potential orp was measured by a calibrated hach hq30 d m hach loveland usa 2 2 2 electrochemical analysis cyclic voltammetry cv curves of ber cathode were measured in the simulated groundwater by using a saturated calomel electrode sce as the reference electrode with a scan range of 1 5 1 v as basic indexes of primary cells to evaluate the power generation of smfcs polarization curves and power density curves were tested by the steady discharging method liang et al 2007 2 2 3 illumina miseq sequencing and microbial community analysis a microbial community analysis was performed on the chaobai river groundwater sample c the electrode biofilm samples inoculated with the enrichment culture solution and acclimated for 7 days cb7 and ssg7 and for 30 days cb30 and ssg30 dna samples were extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals llc usa our target was the v3v4 hyper variable region of the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform majorbio biopharm technology co ltd shanghai china using a set of barcode containing primers nobar 341f nobar 805r for 16s rrna gene amplification usearch was used to statistically analyse operational taxonomic units otus at similarity of 97 the silva database was used to classify the otus quast et al 2013 the analysis of diversity alpha diversity in a single sample reflected the abundance and diversity of the overall microbial community mothur was used to analyse the indexes at 97 based on the otus multidimension analysis was carried out to probe the evolutionary relationships among the five samples an error map was used for a more detailed analysis and comparison of the differences between biofilm samples cb30 and ssg30 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal from groundwater and reduced black odour in sediment the denitrification effect of the ber in the four test systems including ssg c ce and cb was examined the results are shown in fig 2 as expected in the absence of inoculated microorganisms the nitrate contents of c and ce did not decrease and showed a slight upward trend which might be caused by the evaporation of water the nitrate concentration of the closed circuit system ce was slightly lower than that of the open circuit system c which indicates that the ability of the current to directly reduce nitrate was weak via purely electrochemical action as shown in fig 2 when the ber was inoculated with microorganisms the nitrate removal efficiency of ssg and cb showed the same trend over a 24 h cycle after the ber was connected to the smfc the nitrate removal efficiency of ssg was much better than that of cb both systems had a linear downward trend within the first 6 h the nitrate concentration of be was reduced quickly to below 10 mg l which is the limit specified by the us epa according to the linear fitting of the data within the first 6 h the denitrification rate of ssg was 3 87 mg n l h and higher than that of cb which was 2 92 mg n l h furthermore the nitrate concentration was undetectable after 24 h in the ssg system these results implied that the nitrate removal was mainly achieved by biodegradation in the ber it is a process in which nitrates accept electrons and is reduced to nitrogen under the action of microorganisms moreover the current produced by the smfc increased the nitrate removal performance biological denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra are the two main pathways of the nitrate related biological nitrogen cycle and no2 n and nh4 n are the main reduction intermediates zhang et al 2014 thus no2 n and nh4 n were measured in aqueous solution in the cb and ssg systems fig 2 both no2 n and nh4 n concentrations showed a tendency to first increase to a peak and then decline which indicated that both denitrification and dnra processes existed in these systems however the peak concentration of no2 n was 4 5 times that of nh4 n which proved that biological denitrification played a major role in the nitrate removal as reported by zhang et al 2014 electrochemical stimulation could enhance biological denitrification by reducing no2 n accumulation as shown in fig 2 the no2 n in the ssg system was basically removed after 18 h while 7 mg l remained in the cb system in the ssg system the concentration of nh4 n also decreased to below 0 2 mg l meeting the grade ⅲ requirements of standards for groundwater quality samr 2017 the nitrate removal performance of the ssg system was compared with that reported in previous studies as shown in table 1 the denitrification rates vary largely under different operating conditions a dc driven reactor can achieve a higher denitrification rate but requires high energy consumption pous et al 2015 tong and he 2013 wan et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 the study by pous et al 2015 further demonstrated that the denitrification rate increased with the increasing input current a submerged microbial desalination denitrification cell smddc does not need a power source but its denitrification rate is only 0 708 mg n l h the denitrification rate of the combined smfc and ber system in this study is lower than that of a combined single chamber mfc and ber system zhang et al 2014 however by using sediment as fuel this system does not require frequent replenishment of the anode reactants and can continuously and permanently operate in addition indigenous groundwater microorganisms were introduced into the ber cathode which avoids the risk of groundwater contamination the denitrification rate might also be improved by series or parallel application of smfcs optimize the reactor configuration and electrode materials at the end of the experiment the colour of the smfc in the closed circuit systems ce and ssg changed from black to light brown and the original odour disappeared the degree of black coloration and odour in the sediment are negatively related to the orp and lower orp values indicate a darker black colour and stronger odour wang et al 2014 2016a b thus orp and organic matter in sediment were measured in the four systems fig 3 in the ssg system the organic matter in the smfc was degraded and generated electrons that entered the ber through the external circuit thus the cathode of the ber directly served as an electron donor to provide electrons for nitrate removal thus the orp increased to approximately 0 mv and the sediment organic matter decreased by 66 2 in ssg system fig 3 as expected the organic matter contents in the sediment were not much different from those in the original sediment in the cb system therefore after establishing a closed loop of the smfc and ber to form the ssg system the removal efficiency for contaminants in both groundwater and sediment improved it should be noted that the system is in static condition and the surface water and groundwater is isolated in this experiment which is different from the actual groundwater systems groundwater saturated aquifer cannot be absolutely isolated system and its occurrence depends on rock types degree of weathering and fracturing and depth to basement therefore it is necessary to further study the efficiency of the ssg system under the conditions of lotic flowing system and the connected systems for example this system might be applicable to gaining rivers e g rivers that are groundwater fed such rivers are likely to situated over a porous alluvial aquifer and the system is not going to isolated as in the experimental case as there will have to be a groundwater gradient moving water towards the river 3 2 electrochemical performance of the ssg system to investigate the effect of the inoculated biofilm on the electrode cv curves of the original raw electrode the immature biofilm electrode without electrical stimulation after 5 days of acclimation in the enrichment culture solution before placement in the ber and the mature biofilm electrode after electrical stimulation were obtained fig 4 the area of the cv curve for the mature biofilm electrode was significantly larger than that of the immature biofilm electrode and both areas were larger than that of the raw electrode this difference demonstrated that the electrochemical activity of the electrode was increased by the biofilm and electrical stimulation the immature biofilm electrode showed a redox peak at approximately 0 v versus sce which might be a nitrite reduction peak and this peak suggested the occurrence of denitrification nitrite formation and possible nitrite accumulation the nitrite reduction peak of the mature biofilm electrode was not clear but the peak current was large which may indicate a high reduction ability for nitrite the electrical performance of the smfcs was evaluated fig 5 when initially establishing the smfcs the open circuit voltage ocv could reach more than 500 mv thus newly built smfcs could be directly used as power sources and can greatly reduce the start up time mfcs generally need tursun et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 at the end of the experiment the maximum ocvs of the smfcs in the open circuit systems c and cb increased to 991 and 969 mv respectively while the output voltages of the smfcs in the closed circuit systems ce and ssg were 713 22 mv and 622 mv 20 mv respectively fig 5 shows the polarization and power density curves of the final smfcs the ocvs of the smfcs in this study were higher than those of most previous mfcs an et al 2013 pandey et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 however the power density can still be further improved through optimizing structure design or employing a power management system donovan et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 the magnitude of the smfc output voltage is related to the resistance of the external circuit therefore the resistance corresponding to the voltage of the smfc in the polarization curve can be considered as the internal resistance of the ber the currents applied to the bers in ce and ssg were approximately 0 16 and 0 27 ma respectively thus the internal resistance of the bers in ce and ssg were 4300 and 2581 ω respectively it should be noted that the current required for the ber in this study is 1 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the current supplied by dc power showing the power saving advantage of this system tong and he 2013 wan et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 after establishing the smfc and ber in a closed loop to form the ssg system the removal efficiency for contaminants in both the sediment and groundwater improved the circulation of electrons increased the energy utilization efficiency in the ssg system the organic matter in the smfc was degraded and electrons were generated which entered the ber through external circuit therefore the cathode of the ber directly served as an electron donor to provide electrons for nitrate removal the biofilms accelerated the electron transfer efficiency and electrons continuously flowed from the smfc anode which also enhanced the degradation efficiency of organic matter in the smfc song et al 2010 furthermore the biofilms adhered to the surface of the electrode thereby reducing the surface potential of the electrode and activating the internal resistance consequently the overall internal resistance of the ber decreased and a larger current was generated in the external circuit 3 3 changes in the microbial community within the ber cathodic biofilms in the ssg system the nitrate removal in the ber primarily relied on biodegradation to further explore the reaction mechanism the bacterial community composition was analysed by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene diversity indexes of the five samples c cb7 cb30 ssg7 and ssg30 are shown in table 2 the high coverage index values indicated that the sequencing results were sufficient to effectively characterize the bacterial communities the shannon index of sample c the original groundwater sample was only 3 11 while the other samples had a shannon index of more than 3 6 the community diversity of the original groundwater sample was low and the domesticated electrode biofilm samples had higher diversity levels than the original water non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and bray curtis tree results showed that the community structures of all four samples were significantly different from that of the original groundwater sample fig 6 it should be noted that the biofilm samples ssg7 and ssg30 had very high community structure similarity and the similarity was higher than that between biofilm samples cb7 and cb30 this difference may signify that stimulation from the current can help the microbial community structure develop in a fixed direction however the microbial community in the biofilms not subjected to the current stimulation was susceptible to other environmental factors and grew in an uncertain manner the heatmap of the five samples at the genus level showed that the dominant populations in the original groundwater consisted of sphingomonas burkholderia phenylobacterium methylophilus methylophaga phreatobacter and acinetobacter fig 7 the abundance of these microorganisms decreased by varying degrees after inoculation of the ber cathode other genera such as hyphomicrobium terrimicrobium tepidisphaera and prosthecobacter which were not abundant in the original groundwater increased in abundance and became the dominant genera the genera that had high abundance levels in ssg7 ssg30 cb7 and cb30 were sphingomonas tepidisphaera and terrimicrobium sphingomonas is a bacterium that can degrade toxic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs verma et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 tepidisphaera and terrimicrobium have been characterized in recent years and can be found in terrestrial hot springs and rice paddy fields respectively kovaleva et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 these genera exist in soil and groundwater indicating the low health risk from inoculating indigenous groundwater microorganisms in our system in addition a small but noteworthy difference was that nitrospira see supplementary materials table s1 was detected in the current free samples but not in the current stimulated samples nitrospira is a chemical inorganic autotrophic type species of nitrifying bacteria that oxidizes nitrite to nitrate under aerobic conditions nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and is a useful genus for nitrite oxidation daims et al 2001 studies have shown that the growth of nitrospira is inhibited under low dissolved oxygen conditions but it can still grow park and noguera 2008 however the results of this study indicate that the current stimulation under low dissolved oxygen conditions may deepen the inhibition and make nitrospira almost extinct which is more conducive to denitrification the specific mechanism of this action needs further study proper microcurrents have been shown to increase enzyme activity stimulate bacterial metabolism promote bacterial growth and reproduction and improve cell membrane permeability hao et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 our analysis showed that the microcurrent generated by the smfc could significantly change the community structure of the ber cathode biofilms an error map representing the differences between cb30 and ssg30 is shown in fig 8 the abundances of hyphomicrobium diaphorobacter sediminibacterium pseudoxanthomonas bacillus and pirellula were significantly higher in ssg30 than in cb30 among these bacterial populations a variety of denitrifying bacteria were included interestingly hyphomicrobium is a common rhizosphere microorganism that can reduce nitrates by using methanol as a carbon source under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ishii et al 2008 at the same time hyphomicrobium is a mn oxidizing bacteria which has the ability to nitrate reduction as well as oxidation of mn du et al 2017 the abundance of hyphomicrobium in ssg30 19 23 was much higher than that in cb30 8 73 the difference in the abundance of hyphomicrobium might be the main reason for the difference in the nitrogen removal efficiency between the two systems diaphorobacter pseudoxanthomonas bacillus and pirellula are also common denitrifying bacteria buckley et al 2006 mohapatra et al 2018 she et al 2006 wang et 2016a b these results may indicate that denitrifying bacteria are better able to withstand current stimulation and that their metabolism and physiological activity can be improved with application of suitable currents in addition the microbial community diversity decreased under current stimulation and the community structure was more likely to develop in a fixed direction in the ssg system the nitrate removal enhancement with current was indirectly achieved by increasing the activity of the denitrifying bacteria 3 4 verification of the nitrate removal of the ssg system the above results indicate that the activity of denitrifying bacteria is very crucial for the nitrate removal of the ssg system specially the parameters in the actual groundwater such as alkalinity dissolved oxygen dissolved mn fe and phosphorous largely affect the microbial activity which implies the important impact of the chemical conditions of groundwater therefore the nitrate removal ability of the ssg system was further verified by using the raw groundwater in the ber actor as shown in fig 9 the general tendencies of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations in actual groundwater were consistent with those in simulated groundwater nitrate concentrations were quickly reduced to below 10 mg l and undetectable after 24 h under all the three initial no3 n concentrations 10 30 and 60 mg l no2 n and nh4 n concentrations showed a tendency to first increase to a peak and then decline which were basically removed after 9 h and 24 h it should be noted that nitrate removal efficiency in actual groundwater was higher than that in simulated groundwater previous studies proved that the dissolved mn fe and phosphorous are essential elements for microbial growth appropriate concentration promotes the growth of microorganisms while high concentration inhibits the growth of microorganisms cao et al 2002 de et al 2012 in different systems the ranges of the promotion inhibition are different of these elements to microorganisms song et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 therefore the nitrate removal efficiency will be promoted in the actual groundwater with concentrations under those of the parameters in this study which are 298 15 mg l of total alkalinity 40 μg l of mn 432 μg l of fe and 1 56 mg l of po4 3 respectively 4 conclusions the ssg system constructed in this study has been preliminarily proven to simultaneously remediate organic matter in sediment and nitrate pollution in groundwater in this system the smfc reactor and ber interact synergistically to enhance the performance of both reactors the microcurrent produced by the smfc can help the community structure develop in a fixed direction in addition increasing the activity of the denitrifying bacteria improved the electrochemical performance of the ber and promoted energy conversion and consumption the nitrate removal efficiency of the ssg system is effective for either simulated or actual groundwater the nitrate removal efficiency in actual groundwater is promoted within the certain concentration ranges of dissolved mn fe and phosphorous in this study in this experiment the simulated groundwater conditions are static and isolated there are many differences between laboratory research and field tests at this stage the study cannot be applied at field conditions to remove nitrate at large scale but lab scale from the perspective of application potential the ssg system has the potential for in site bioremediation in lentic water bodies with relatively isolate groundwater systems for example artificial lakes and confined aquifer of course there should be sediment in the surface water and the flow velocity of the groundwater should be very slow further work must be implemented to improve the ssg system for example the enhancement of the output power of smfc the determination of the concentration boundaries of elements and dissolved oxygen which affect microbial activity in groundwater and the effect on the transformation of nitrate in particular to investigate the comprehensive effects of the actual conditions in field including hydrological conditions coexisting ion effects and electrode settings on the system is essential acknowledgments the authors thank the major science

18832,the removal of urea by persulfate with uv irradiation in an ultrapure water upw production system was examined using a continuously operated column reactor urea is a substance that is not properly removed by the unit processes in upw production systems based on our monitoring of urea concentration over 1 year of the operation of a upw production facility a relatively high concentration of urea was introduced between february and may in 2016 and the total organic carbon toc concentration of the upw was increased in that period approximately 50 of the urea in the raw water was removed by the upw production process for which double pass reverse osmosis units were instrumental the addition of persulfate to the toc reduction uv unit in the upw production process was examined to improve the efficiency of urea removal as a result supplying over 20 μmol l persulfate to the toc reduction uv reactor improved the efficiency of urea removal from 9 to 90 uv dose was an important factor of urea removal in the ion analysis nitrate and sulfate were detected in the effluent and the ratio of produced nitrate to the removed urea was approximately 2 keywords persulfate oxidation reverse osmosis total organic carbon toc ultraviolet uv urea ultrapure water upw 1 introduction ultrapure water upw is used in the wet cleaning and wet etching steps of the manufacture of semiconductors and displays upw is also called highly refined water and is produced by refining natural water extensively through various processes such as adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration and ultraviolet oxidation the upw production process consists of complex processes for the complete removal of various contaminants thus most of the organic matter in the water is removed during this operation in 1992 however a defective product incident occurred at intel corporation in the us and a survey revealed that the defect was caused by the inefficient removal of organic nitrogen compounds especially urea co nh2 2 in the upw production process rydzewski and carr 2003 godec 2003 urea is nonvolatile difficult to oxidize ozone resistant non ionic and highly soluble in water and has a low molecular weight 60 based on these properties it was felt that urea could not be removed easily from water using the conventional physical and chemical treatment method during upw production the existence of urea and other nitrogen containing carbon compounds in upw production systems has long been documented in 1999 mizuniwa et al 1999 reported that organic nitrogen was found in parts per billion concentrations in upw production systems in japan and suggested that one should expect between 0 13 and 1 66 μg l toc in the polishing loop resulting from the presence of organic nitrogen compounds because urea is commonly used during the winter as a road deicing compound in lieu of sodium chloride for environmental reasons there is a potential risk of urea contamination throughout the upw production system when it washes into rivers and streams that feed watersheds in addition fertilizers in agricultural areas are a potential source of urea in water reservoirs rydzewski and carr 2003 godec 2003 currently the ideal method of removing urea from water is to hydrolyze or decompose it into compounds that can be removed easily using conventional water purification processes japanese researchers have proposed that urea can be oxidized by hypochlorite in a process that is 100 times more reactive than with o3 see eq 1 joko and miwa 1997 also rydzewski and carr 2003 reported that urea can be removed by naobr urea hydrolysis see eq 2 this system incorporates an online urea analyzer into a feedback control system but these technologies required that the concentrations of naocl or naobr be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of urea 1 2 n h 2 2 c o 3 n a o c l 2 n h 3 n 2 2 c o 2 h 2 o 3 n a c l 2 2 n h 2 2 c o 3 n a o b r 2 n h 3 n 2 2 c o 2 h 2 o 3 n a b r recently persulfate anion e 0 2 01 v has been considered as an alternative oxidizing agent in water treatment systems latimer 1952 persulfates are used as initiators in emulsion polymerization

heat transition metals and alkali condition to sulfate radical which has high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v and a longer life time than oh radicals it has been reported that uv activated persulfate radical can effectively oxidize phenol acetic acid antipyrine and microcystin lr devi et al 2016 criquet and leitner 2009 lin et al 2011 especially antonious et al 2010 reported that uv persulfate showed better degradation capacity of microcystin lr than uv h2o2 by one order of magnitude based on reaction rate constant also such radicals can react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals hayon

persulfate has a higher radical quantum yield than hydrogen peroxide under uv 253 nm irradiation mark et al 1990 baxendale and wilson 1957 to the best of our knowledge the degradation of urea using a uv persulfate based process has not been reported thus in this study we monitored the urea concentration in raw water in south korea for 1 year and determined its effects on the quality of the upw that was produced using this water finally the degradation efficiency of urea in relation to the main operating parameters of toc reduction by uv irradiation the na2s2o8 dose and initial urea concentration was measured 2 materials and methods 2 1 upw production system a pilot scale upw production system was operated in this study the unit processes and flow diagram of which are shown in fig 1 the production capacity was 3 m3 h at the point of the ultrafiltration uf effluent the final unit of the upw production system and the facility had been operated continuously for 24 h per day tap water was supplied to the upw production system as raw water and its quality was as follows 1 2 mg ltoc and 150 250 μs cm conductivity the upw that was produced after ultrafiltration was supplied to a clean room the point of use pou as cleaning water for the analysis of ultrapure grade water the average use of upw in the clean room was 50 and the unused water that was produced was returned to the pure water tank as shown in fig 1 the quality of the upw that was produced and the equipment for measuring these parameters in the upw production facility were as follows toc siverse 500 rle ge 0

acid and water were used to separate the urea compound from the remaining organic matrix in the solution the detection limit of the concentration of urea by hplc ms was 10 μg l concentrations of urea that were below 10 μg l were analyzed by sample concentration method in which the volume of the sample was reduced by 10 fold for 12 h by evaporation method through this procedure we confirmed that the loss of urea was less than 5 data not shown 2 3 2 toc measurement the amount of toc in the water was measured using a toc analyzer high concentrations of toc were measured using a sievers 900 laboratory ge analytical instruments co usa in offline grab sampling mode for low concentrations of toc such as those at the pou a sievers 500 rle ge analytical instruments co usa was used in online measurement mode 2 4 urea removal by uv and persulfate a urea degradation experiment using uv 185 nm irradiation was conducted in stainless steel cylindrical photoreactors inner diameter 60 mm as in our previous study choi et al 2016 a synthetic quartz tube and low pressure mercury uv lamp 41 w fns tech korea were placed vertically in the middle of the photoreactor the wavelength of the maximum emission that was induced from each uv lamp was 185 nm the uv intensity ranged from 933 to 11 600 mw sec cm2 and was adjusted by changing the flow rate from 0 2 to 2 5 l min upw was supplied continuously through a magnetic pump and the concentrated urea or persulfate was injected into the feed stream of the uv reactor by a piston pump the concentration of urea and persulfate varied from 0 58 to 1 65 μmol l and 10 25 μmol l respectively by adjusting the flow rate of chemical stock solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in toc concentration at the pou in the upw production system the quality of the raw water that was supplied to the upw production facility and the final produced water that was discharged from it was examined during operation of the upw production facility for 1 year as shown in fig 2 the toc concentration of the feed water ranged from 1 to 2 mg l there was no significant variation by season although the toc concentration in september and november was higher than in other months the urea concentration in the feed water however varied by season ranging from 20 to 50 μg l between february and may which was approximately 3 times higher than in september through january the average toc concentration of the produced upw at the pou was 2 2 μg l and clearly fluctuated by season as shown in fig 1 the trend for the toc in the upw at the pou during the experimental period was analogous to that for the urea concentration in feed water rather than the pattern for toc in feed water the toc concentration in the upw from february through june spring season exceeded 3 μg l whereas the average concentration of toc at the pou was 1 1 μg l during the remaining months july to january this finding indicates that the urea in raw water was not removed efficiently by the upw production facility and remained in the produced water as verified by the measurement of urea concentration in the produced water as shown in the results in fig 1 the change in urea concentration in the produced water was similar to that in the toc concentration the relationship between the urea concentration in the raw water the urea concentration at the pou and the toc concentration at the pou was replotted as shown in fig 3 to determine the concentration of urea that affected the toc in the final produced water as clearly shown in fig 3a the toc concentration in the pou increased linearly as the urea concentration in the raw water increased and its slope was approximately 0 1 ie 1 μg l urea in the raw water increased the toc in the final treated water of the upw production process by 0 1 μg l fig 3a in addition the ratio of urea to the components of the toc at the pou was measured as shown in fig 3b approximately 80 of the toc was caused by residual urea this phenomenon was more pronounced in the low 2 μg l versus high toc range thus we conclude that the final toc concentration in the upw production process depends on the urea concentration in the raw water ie the unit processes that constitute the upw production were not effective in removing urea during the 1 year monitoring period roughly 50 of the urea in raw water was removed primarily from double pass reverse osmosis ro units toc reduction by uv irradiation which generally removes organic matter effectively was unable to eliminate the urea data not shown the cause of the high final toc concentration in a upw production facility at intel corporation in 2001 was also the urea concentration in the raw water between march and april 2001 there was no change in toc concentration in the raw water that was introduced to the upw production facility of a semiconductor manufacturing factory at intel corporation but the toc concentration in the produced upw increased approximately 7 fold from 2 to 15 μg l at the time intel corporation attempted to stabilize the final toc concentration by optimizing the operation of the existing upw facility but was unable to do so the root of the high final toc concentration was later determined to be the urea in the raw water and it was reported that urea is difficult to remove using the toc reduction unit processes in a upw production facility arai et al 2012 3 2 investment in urea removal by toc 3 2 1 urea removal by uv alone next a urea removal experiment was conducted using a continuously operated column it is well established that the efficiency of toc removal by uv irradiation based toc reduction is a function of the uv dosage therefore the effect of uv dosage on urea degradation was initially examined by applying 12 times the uv dosage of normal operational conditions the toc uv dosage was adjusted by varying the flow rate into the reactor because uv lamps with various powers were not available as shown in fig 4 the rate of urea removal of toc uv at the normal dosage was less than 1 increasing proportionally with uv dosage despite the maximum removal efficiency of uv alone being less than 10 in the degradation of urea with uv 185 nm irradiation oh radicals might react initially with the amine groups in urea and remove hydrogen from it terasaki et al 2002 in addition the final oxidation product of ammonia by uv 185 nm is no3 rockafellow et al 2012 hence it could be presumed that the urea decomposed to co2 and no3 by oh radicals that were produced by the dissociation of water molecules in the presence of uv although the urea oxidation pathway was not fully examined in this study eq 5 in the water analysis of the oxidation product of urea we observed an increase of no3 in the produced water see table 1 the observed concentration of no3 was nearly equivalent to the calculated concentration per the following equation 5 c o n h 2 2 16 o h h c o 2 2 n o 3 9 h 2 o 2 h 3 2 2 removal of urea by uv and persulfate in this study we selected persulfate na2s2o8 as an additional oxidant to enhance the removal of urea by uv irradiation persulfate is believed to be an effective oxidant producing sulfate radicals with high redox potential 2 5 v and existing for longer than oh radicals devi et al 2016 in addition the redox potential of so4 is 1 6 1 9 times higher than that of clo 1 64 v and bro 1 59 v anipsitakis and dionysiou 2006 rendering the sulfate radical able to induce stable and rapid oxidation reactions in uv systems to determine the effects of its dosage persulfate was added from 10 to 25 μmol l with a fixed urea concentration and uv intensity of 1 65 μmol l and 11 600 mw sec cm2 respectively as shown in fig 5 the removal of urea improved substantially when persulfate was added in the uv reactor the removal efficiency of urea improved proportionally to amount of persulfate that was added rising 25 fold at 20 μmol l persulfate compared with no persulfate therefore we conclude that urea can be removed continuously by the combination of persulfate and uv irradiation and that persulfate radical has an important function in degrading urea the activation of sulfate radical was presumed to be due primarily to uv irradiation as supported by several groups that have shown that uv irradiation is effective in producing sulfate radicals devi et al 2016 lin et al 2011 criquet et al 2009 conversely because uv 185 nm exposed water is believed to generate oh radials and h2o2 in solution choi et al 2016 han et al 2004a b it is possible that these species activate persulfate to form sulfate radical devi et al 2016 although the function of oh radical in persulfate activation has not been determined notably sulfate radical was more effective in degrading urea than oh radical in this study similar to results on the degradation of acetic acid and microcystin lr criquet et al 2009 antoniou et al 2010 however the degradation rate of tce and phenol by oh radical is much faster than that by sulfate radical olmez hanci et al 2013 liang et al 2007 these contradictory results might be attributed to differences in the oxidation mechanism when oh radicals react with compounds electron transfer and hydrogen subtraction occur simultaneously whereas only the electron transfer reaction takes place during oxidation by sulfate radicals terasaki et al 2002 olmez hanci et al 2013 3 2 3 effect of uv intensity the effect of uv intensity on urea removal by persulfate with uv irradiation was determined uv intensity was varied from 933 to 11 600 mw sec cm2 by changing the flow rate of the feed solution from 0 2 l min 11 600 mw sec cm2 to 2 5 l min 933 mw sec cm2 the initial urea and persulfate concentrations were fixed at 1 7 μmol l and 20 μmol l respectively as shown in fig 6 the urea removal efficiency increased from 8 7 to 90 with rising uv intensity indicating that the production of sulfate radical was induced to a greater extent with higher uv dosage because the degradation of urea was believed to have occurred through sulfate radical rather than oh radical based on the results in figs 4 6 the calculated uv intensity was proportional to the retention time because the uv intensity is the mathematical product of uv power and retention time the uv intensity in the continuously operated system x axis in fig 6 could correspond to the time that has elapsed in a batch reactor thus longer exposure of uv to persulfate resulted in a higher amount of sulfate radical and consequently greater removal of urea this result is consistent with other findings that the activation of persulfate in the formation of sulfate radical depends positively on the strength of the activation source chen et al 2014 reported greater degradation of dinitrotoluenes at higher electropotential in electroactivated persulfate oxidation and wang and liang 2014 observed enhanced trimethylammonium hydroxide degradation at higher uv light intensities 3 2 4 effect of initial urea concentration to determine its effects the initial urea concentration was varied from 0 58 to 1 65 μmol l with a fixed persulfate concentration and uv intensity of 20 μmol l and 1550 mw sec cm2 respectively the efficiency of urea removal at a urea concentration of 0 58 μmol l was 70 declining and reaching a plateau of approximately 60 at higher urea concentrations as shown in fig 7 however the amount of urea that was removed by persulfate with uv increased linearly with rising urea concentrations its slope and coefficient of determination were 0 58 amount of removed urea amount of supplied urea and 0 992 respectively the ions in the effluent of the toc uv reactor were measured to determine the reaction mechanism of urea decomposition the results are presented in table 1 the nitrate concentration in the effluent clearly increased with higher concentrations of removed urea the ratio of nitrate that was produced to the urea that was removed ranged from 1 7 to 2 1 this result supports the urea decomposition equation eq 1 that we have presented in which 2 mol of nitrate are produced by removing 1 mol of urea in addition sulfate was detected in the effluent of the toc uv reactor indicating that persulfate was reduced to sulfate during the oxidation of urea the ratio of the sulfate that increased to the urea that was removed was in the range of 12 31 based on the ion measurements and the results in this study we have proposed a mechanism of urea decomposition as shown in fig 8 in this suggested mechanism persulfate that is injected with urea into the toc uv reactor is activated to form sulfate radical by uv irradiation and the resulting sulfate radical is involved in decomposing urea and oxidizing the amine functional group of urea to nitrate 4 conclusions the urea concentrations in raw water and the produced upw were monitored periodically during the operation of a upw production facility for 1 year the results indicated that there was almost no change in toc concentration in the raw water but that the urea concentration changed seasonally from 5 to 50 μg l peaking between february and may the urea concentration in the raw water had a significant effect on the toc concentration in the final treated water of the upw production facility and approximately 50 of the urea was removed by the unit processes especially the double pass ro units in the upw production facility however the efficiency of urea removal in toc reduction by uv irradiation which is believed to be important in removing organic material in the upw production process was less than 10 at even 10 times the uv dosage of normal conditions the addition of persulfate to the toc reduction process by uv irradiation improved the efficiency of urea decomposition and the concentration of persulfate and uv dosage were important factors of the removal of urea lastly we proposed a mechanism of urea decomposition by persulfate with uv irradiation in which urea is decomposed and the amine group is oxidized to nitrate by sulfate radical that was produced in the reaction between persulfate and uv

improve the efficiency of urea removal as a result supplying over 20 μmol l persulfate to the toc reduction uv reactor improved the efficiency of urea removal from 9 to 90 uv dose was an important

chromatography hplc agilent 1200 series usa and mass spectrometry ms finnigan lxq mass spectrometry usa an rx sil 4 6 100 mm 1 8 μm particle size agilent column and eluent mixture of methanol formic acid and water were used to separate the urea compound from the remaining organic matrix in the solution the detection limit of the concentration of urea by hplc ms was 10 μg l concentrations of urea that were below 10 μg l were analyzed by sample concentration method in which the volume of the sample was reduced by 10 fold for 12 h by evaporation method through this procedure we confirmed that the loss of urea was less than 5 data not shown 2 3 2 toc measurement the amount of toc in the water was measured using a toc analyzer high concentrations of toc were measured using a sievers 900 laboratory ge analytical instruments co usa in offline grab sampling mode for low concentrations of toc such as those at the pou a sievers 500 rle ge analytical instruments co usa was used in online measurement mode 2 4 urea removal by uv and persulfate a urea degradation experiment using uv 185 nm irradiation was conducted in stainless steel cylindrical photoreactors inner diameter 60 mm as in our previous study choi et al 2016 a synthetic quartz tube and low pressure mercury uv lamp 41 w fns tech korea were placed vertically in the middle of the photoreactor the wavelength of the maximum emission that was induced from each uv lamp was 185 nm the uv intensity ranged from 933 to 11 600 mw sec cm2 and was adjusted by changing the flow rate from 0 2 to 2 5 l min upw was supplied continuously through a magnetic pump and the concentrated urea or persulfate was injected into the feed stream of the uv reactor by a piston pump the concentration of urea and persulfate varied from 0 58 to 1 65 μmol l and 10 25 μmol l respectively by adjusting the flow rate of chemical stock solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in toc concentration at the pou in the upw production system the quality of the raw water that was supplied to the upw production facility and the final produced water that was discharged from it was examined during operation of the upw production facility for 1 year as shown in fig 2 the toc concentration of the feed water ranged from 1 to 2 mg l there was no significant variation by season although the toc concentration in september and november was higher than in other months the urea concentration in the feed water however varied by season ranging from 20 to 50 μg l between february and may which was approximately 3 times higher than in september through january the average toc concentration of the produced upw at the pou was 2 2 μg l and clearly fluctuated by season as shown in fig 1 the trend for the toc in the upw at the pou during the experimental period was analogous to that for the urea concentration in feed water rather than the pattern for toc in feed water the toc concentration in the upw from february through june spring season exceeded 3 μg l whereas the average concentration of toc at the pou was 1 1 μg l during the remaining months july to january this finding indicates that the urea in raw water was not removed efficiently by the upw production facility and remained in the produced water as verified by the measurement of urea concentration in the produced water as shown in the results in fig 1 the change in urea concentration in the produced water was similar to that in the toc concentration the relationship between the urea concentration in the raw water the urea concentration at the pou and the toc concentration at the pou was replotted as shown in fig 3 to determine the concentration of urea that affected the toc in the final produced water as clearly shown in fig 3a the toc concentration in the pou increased linearly as the urea concentration in the raw water increased and its slope was approximately 0 1 ie 1 μg l urea in the raw water increased the toc in the final treated water of the upw production process by 0 1 μg l fig 3a in addition the ratio of urea to the components of the toc at the pou was measured as shown in fig 3b approximately 80 of the toc was caused by residual urea this phenomenon was more pronounced in the low 2 μg l versus high toc range thus we conclude that the final toc concentration in the upw production process depends on the urea concentration in the raw water ie the unit processes that constitute the upw production were not effective in removing urea during the 1 year monitoring period roughly 50 of the urea in raw water was removed primarily from double pass reverse osmosis ro units toc reduction by uv irradiation which generally removes organic matter effectively was unable to eliminate the urea data not shown the cause of the high final toc concentration in a upw production facility at intel corporation in 2001 was also the urea concentration in the raw water between march and april 2001 there was no change in toc concentration in the raw water that was introduced to the upw production facility of a semiconductor manufacturing factory at intel corporation but the toc concentration in the produced upw increased approximately 7 fold from 2 to 15 μg l at the time intel corporation attempted to stabilize the final toc concentration by optimizing the operation of the existing upw facility but was unable to do so the root of the high final toc concentration was later determined to be the urea in the raw water and it was reported that urea is difficult to remove using the toc reduction unit processes in a upw production facility arai et al 2012 3 2 investment in urea removal by toc 3 2 1 urea removal by uv alone next a urea removal experiment was conducted using a continuously operated column it is well established that the efficiency of toc removal by uv irradiation based toc reduction is a function of the uv dosage therefore the effect of uv dosage on urea degradation was initially examined by applying 12 times the uv dosage of normal operational conditions the toc uv dosage was adjusted by varying the flow rate into the reactor because uv lamps with various powers were not available as shown in fig 4 the rate of urea removal of toc uv at the normal dosage was less than 1 increasing proportionally with uv dosage despite the maximum removal efficiency of uv alone being less than 10 in the degradation of urea with uv 185 nm irradiation oh radicals might react initially with the amine groups in urea and remove hydrogen from it terasaki et al 2002 in addition the final oxidation product of ammonia by uv 185 nm is no3 rockafellow et al 2012 hence it could be presumed that the urea decomposed to co2 and no3 by oh radicals that were produced by the dissociation of water molecules in the presence of uv although the urea oxidation pathway was not fully examined in this study eq 5 in the water analysis of the oxidation product of urea we observed an increase of no3 in the produced water see table 1 the observed concentration of no3 was nearly equivalent to the calculated concentration per the following equation 5 c o n h 2 2 16 o h h c o 2 2 n o 3 9 h 2 o 2 h 3 2 2 removal of urea by uv and persulfate in this study we selected persulfate na2s2o8 as an additional oxidant to enhance the removal of urea by uv irradiation persulfate is believed to be an effective oxidant producing sulfate radicals with high redox potential 2 5 v and existing for longer than oh radicals devi et al 2016 in addition the redox potential of so4 is 1 6 1 9 times higher than that of clo 1 64 v and bro 1 59 v anipsitakis and dionysiou 2006 rendering the sulfate radical able to induce stable and rapid oxidation reactions in uv systems to determine the effects of its dosage persulfate was added from 10 to 25 μmol l with a fixed urea concentration and uv intensity of 1 65 μmol l and 11 600 mw sec cm2 respectively as shown in fig 5 the removal of urea improved substantially when persulfate was added in the uv reactor the removal efficiency of urea improved proportionally to amount of persulfate that was added rising 25 fold at 20 μmol l persulfate compared with no persulfate therefore we conclude that urea can be removed continuously by the combination of persulfate and uv irradiation and that persulfate radical has an important function in degrading urea the activation of sulfate radical was presumed to be due primarily to uv irradiation as supported by several groups that have shown that uv irradiation is effective in producing sulfate radicals devi et al 2016 lin et al 2011 criquet et al 2009 conversely because uv 185 nm exposed water is believed to generate oh radials and h2o2 in solution choi et al 2016 han et al 2004a b it is possible that these species activate persulfate to form sulfate radical devi et al 2016 although the function of oh radical in persulfate activation has not been determined notably sulfate radical was more effective in degrading urea than oh radical in this study similar to results on the degradation of acetic acid and microcystin lr criquet et al 2009 antoniou et al 2010 however the degradation rate of tce and phenol by oh radical is much faster than that by sulfate radical olmez hanci et al 2013 liang et al 2007 these contradictory results might be attributed to differences in the oxidation mechanism when oh radicals react with compounds electron transfer and hydrogen subtraction occur simultaneously whereas only the electron transfer reaction takes place during oxidation by sulfate radicals terasaki et al 2002 olmez hanci et al 2013 3 2 3 effect of uv intensity the effect of uv intensity on urea removal by persulfate with uv irradiation was determined uv intensity was varied from 933 to 11 600 mw sec cm2 by changing the flow rate of the feed solution from 0 2 l min 11 600 mw sec cm2 to 2 5 l min 933 mw sec cm2 the initial urea and persulfate concentrations were fixed at 1 7 μmol l and 20 μmol l respectively as shown in fig 6 the urea removal efficiency increased from 8 7 to 90 with rising uv intensity indicating that the production of sulfate radical was induced to a greater extent with higher uv dosage because the degradation of urea was believed to have occurred through sulfate radical rather than oh radical based on the results in figs 4 6 the calculated uv intensity was proportional to the retention time because the uv intensity is the mathematical product of uv power and retention time the uv intensity in the continuously operated system x axis in fig 6 could correspond to the time that has elapsed in a batch reactor thus longer exposure of uv to persulfate resulted in a higher amount of sulfate radical and consequently greater removal of urea this result is consistent with other findings that the activation of persulfate in the formation of sulfate radical depends positively on the strength of the activation source chen et al 2014 reported greater degradation of dinitrotoluenes at higher electropotential in electroactivated persulfate oxidation and wang and liang 2014 observed enhanced trimethylammonium hydroxide degradation at higher uv light intensities 3 2 4 effect of initial urea concentration to determine its effects the initial urea concentration was varied from 0 58 to 1 65 μmol l with a fixed persulfate concentration and uv intensity of 20 μmol l and 1550 mw sec cm2 respectively the efficiency of urea removal at a urea concentration of 0 58 μmol l was 70 declining and reaching a plateau of approximately 60 at higher urea concentrations as shown in fig 7 however the amount of urea that was removed by persulfate with uv increased linearly with rising urea concentrations its slope and coefficient of determination were 0 58 amount of removed urea amount of supplied urea and 0 992 respectively the ions in the effluent of the toc uv reactor were measured to determine the reaction mechanism of urea decomposition the results are presented in table 1 the nitrate concentration in the effluent clearly increased with higher concentrations of removed urea the ratio of nitrate that was produced to the urea that was removed ranged from 1 7 to 2 1 this result supports the urea decomposition equation eq 1 that we have presented in which 2 mol of nitrate are produced by removing 1 mol of urea in addition sulfate was detected in the effluent of the toc uv reactor indicating that persulfate was reduced to sulfate during the oxidation of urea the ratio of the sulfate that increased to the urea that was removed was in the range of 12 31 based on the ion measurements and the results in this study we have proposed a mechanism of urea decomposition as shown in fig 8 in this suggested mechanism persulfate that is injected with urea into the toc uv reactor is activated to form sulfate radical by uv irradiation and the resulting sulfate radical is involved in decomposing urea and oxidizing the amine functional group of urea to nitrate 4 conclusions the urea concentrations in raw water and the produced upw were monitored periodically during the operation of a upw production facility for 1 year the results indicated that there was almost no change in toc concentration in the raw water but that the urea concentration changed seasonally from 5 to 50 μg l peaking between february and may the urea concentration in the raw water had a significant effect on the toc concentration in the final treated water of the upw production facility and approximately 50 of the urea was removed by the unit processes especially the double pass ro units in the upw production facility however the efficiency of urea removal in toc reduction by uv irradiation which is believed to be important in removing organic material in the upw production process was less than 10 at even 10 times the uv dosage of normal conditions the addition of persulfate to the toc reduction process by uv irradiation improved the efficiency of urea decomposition and the concentration of persulfate and uv dosage were important factors of the removal of urea lastly we proposed a mechanism of urea decomposition by persulfate with uv irradiation in which urea is decomposed and the amine group is oxidized to nitrate by sulfate radical that was produced in the reaction between persulfate and uv 
18833,this study investigated the vuv uv photodegradation of three iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps namely triiodomethane tim diiodoacetamide diacam and triiodoacetic acid tiaa based on a mini fluidic vuv uv photoreaction system mvps the pseudo first order rate constants k of tim diacam and tiaa under vuv uv irradiation 1769 1301 and 1174 m2 einstein 1 respectively were higher than those under uv irradiation 1003 832 and 766 m2 einstein 1 respectively the enhancement of photodegradation could be attributed to the indirect ho oxidation rather than the direct vuv photolysis as a whole compared with the indirect ho oxidation the direct uv photolysis had a relatively greater contribution to the degradation of the three i dbps especially diacam and tiaa ca 57 and 60 respectively the two electron withdrawing groups in diacam and tiaa i e acylamino and carboxyl decreased the electron density of the c i bonds thus weakening the electrophilic attack of ho the iodine in the three i dbps was released to form i and a small fraction 6 of i was oxidized to io3 indicating that ho preferred to break the c i bonds rather than oxidize i the direct uv photolysis proceeded via h2o catalyzed deiodination reactions while the indirect ho oxidation proceeded via deiodination reactions along with ho addition the vuv uv photodegradation of the three i dbps was more favored at an acidic ph but inhibited by the water matrix components i e nom cl and alkalinity to different extents graphical abstract image 1 keywords vacuum ultraviolet vuv iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps mini fluidic vuv uv photoreaction system mvps drinking water 1 introduction the formation of iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps during the treatment of iodide containing waters has been well reported and predominantly occurs as a result of water disinfection with monochloramine allard et al 2013 tian et al 2014 i dbps are much more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues ye et al 2013 hu et al 2017 iodinated trihalomethanes i thms are the main i dbps in chloramination of iodide containing waters and responsible for the occurrence of bad taste and odor in drinking waters bichsel and von gunten 2000 compared to other four iodinated acids i e bromoiodoacetic acid e 2 iodo 3 methylbutenedioic acid and z and e 3 bromo 3 iodopropenoic acids iodinated acetic acids i haas exhibited a greater genotoxicity in mammalian cell assays plewa et al 2004 i thms and i haas have been detected in effluents of most water treatment plants in the united states and canada the concentrations of chlorobromoiodomethane dichloroiodomethane and bromoiodoacetic acid reached up to 1 4 10 2 and 7 9 μg l 1 respectively richardson et al 2008 iodinated nitrogenous disinfection byproducts which are substantially more cytotoxic and genotoxic than iodinated carbonaceous disinfection byproducts have also been identified in drinking waters plewa et al 2008 chu et al 2012 for example two iodinated acetamides i hacams were quantified in effluents of seven drinking water treatment plants in china with maximum concentrations of 0 21 and 0 15 μg l 1 for chloroiodoacetamide and bromoiodoacetamide respectively chu et al 2012 much attention has been paid to the formation and health risk of i dbps while very few studies focused on the degradation of i dbps it was reported that neither conventional treatment processes e g sand filtration nor advanced technologies e g reverse osmosis could remove i thms effectively cancho et al 2000 farré et al 2012 however xiao et al 2014 reported that i thms underwent a rapid degradation via cleavage of carbon halogen bonds under ultraviolet uv irradiation jo et al 2011 reported that the i dbp analogues brominated trihalomethanes br thms and brominated acetic acids br haas were almost completely degraded by uv h2o2 process therefore it is reasonably expected that uv photolysis or uv based advanced oxidation processes can also effectively degrade i dbps vacuum ultraviolet vuv covers a wavelength range from 100 to 200 nm which can be strongly absorbed by water to form hydroxyl radicals ho zoschke et al 2014 for example 185 nm vuv irradiation of water induces the following reations 1 h 2 o h v 185 ho h 2 h 2 o h v 185 ho h e aq generally a low pressure lp mercury lamp simultaneously emits 185 nm vuv and 254 nm uv i e vuv uv beams the organic pollutants in water under vuv uv irradiation undergo degradation via direct photolysis and indirect ho oxidation li et al 2016 the extra ho oxidation does not need any additional power or chemical input thus the vuv uv process has been applied to the removal of dissolved organic matter and various micropollutants buchanan et al 2005 li et al 2017 for bench scale studies conventional batch vuv uv reactors are limited with the inaccurate determination of photon fluence rate and the uncertain contribution of each wavelength to the degradation of a target pollutant recently a mini fluidic vuv uv photoreaction system mvps has been developed in our laboratory which can emit either combined vuv uv beams or sole uv beams into two separate quartz tubes with a nearly identical uv photon fluence li et al 2016 thus significantly facilitating the tests on vuv uv degradation of micropollutants in aqueous solutions especially for quantification of the vuv contribution the aim of this study was to determine the vuv uv degradation kinetics and mechanism of three types of i dbps i e i thms i haas and i hacams by using the mvps triiodomethane tim chi3 diiodoacetamide diacam chi2conh2 and triiodoacetic acid tiaa ci3cooh were selected as the representative of i thms i haas and i hacams respectively photodegradation kinetics and impact factors were investigated in detail and degradation pathways were also established this study proposes an effective technology to remove i dbps in the secondary water supply facilities or drinking water terminal systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemical reagents all chemicals used in this study were of acs grade or higher the ph of reaction solutions was adjusted by phosphate buffer 1 mm tim

the analysis of tiaa the instrumental conditions were as follows injector temperature of 210 c detector temperature of 300 c and initial oven temperature held at 40 c for 4 min and ramped to 80 c at 2 c min 1 iodide i iodate io3 and formic acid hcooh were quantified by an ion chromatograph dionex ics2000 equipped with an ionpac as19 column 250 mm 4 0 mm 5 0 μm koh solution 20 mm was used as eluent at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 2 3 reaction system photodegradation experiments were carried out by using the mvps text s1 and fig s1 the photon fluence rate at 185 nm e p o vuv and 254 nm e p o uv were determined with values of 4 93 10 5 and 8 88 10 4 einstein m 2 s 1 respectively li et al 2016 the reduction equivalent exposure time t ree s was defined as follow 3 t ree π r 2 h v t where t is the reaction time s v is the volume of reaction solution m3 r and h are the radius and length of the vuv uv or uv tube m respectively the vuv or uv photon fluence f p o vuv or f p o uv einstein m 2 was calculated as follows 4 f p o vuv e p o vuv t ree 5 f p o uv e p o uv t ree the total exposure photon fluence f p o einstein m 2 in the vuv uv tube is equal to the sum of f p o vuv and f p o uv 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of target i dbps under vuv uv irradiation the degradation kinetics of the three i dbps under vuv uv and uv irradiation is shown in fig 1 instead of using energy fluence photon fluence was adopted because photons with two wavelengths were involved in the vuv uv process bolton et al 2015 without vuv uv and uv irradiation no significant hydrolysis of the three i dbps was observed however all the three i dbps were rapidly degraded under vuv uv and uv irradiation which could be fitted well with the pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 99 the pseudo first order rate constants k of the three i dbps under vuv uv irradiation were higher than those under uv irradiation for example the k values of tim under vuv uv and uv irradiation were 1769 and 1003 m2 einstein 1 respectively the majority of vuv photons were absorbed by water 55 6 m in a dilute solution of i dbps 0 4 μm thus it was the indirect ho oxidation rather than the direct vuv photolysis could account for the enhanced degradation of the three i dbps jo et al 2011 reported that br thms and br haas were degraded primarily by the direct uv photolysis of the c br bonds with ho oxidation as a minor pathway in uv h2o2 system the energy of c i bond 209 kj mol 1 is lower than that of c br bond 280 kj mol 1 thus ho is easier to dissociate the c i bonds in i dbps xiao et al 2014 pointed out that in the uv h2o2 process the homolytic cleavage of c i bond was not only the first step but also the rate determining step of the degradation of tim and the considerable ho generation increased the degradation rate remarkably additionally the vuv uv degradation rates of the three i dbps followed the order of tim diacam tiaa for instance the k values of tim diacam and tiaa under vuv uv irradiation were 1769 1301 and 1174 m2 einstein 1 respectively the ho oxidation is an electrophilic reaction and inclines to occur via electron transfer from the electron rich moieties serna galvis et al 2017 the electron withdrawing group in tiaa and diacam i e carboxyl and acylamino decreased the electron density surrounding the c i bonds weakening the electrophilic attack of ho as a result 3 2 contributions of the direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation as mentioned above the degradation of the three i dbps in vuv uv process involved the direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation therefore the pseudo first order kinetic model can be transformed as follows li et al 2017 6 ln i dbp i dbp 0 k i dbp f p o k d i dbp k i i dbp f p o where i dbp 0 and i dbp are the initial and real time concentrations of each i dbp μg l 1 respectively k i dbp is the photon fluence based pseudo first order rate constant m2 einstein 1 k d i dbp and k i i dbp are the photon fluence based direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation rate constants m2 einstein 1 in this study nb was selected as the scavenger of ho on account of its high reactivity with ho with a rate constant of 3 2 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 guan et al 2013 as expected with the addition of nb the k values of the three i dbps under vuv uv irradiation was approximate to those under uv irradiation fig 2 the k i dbp and k d i dbp for tim were 1677 and 844 m2 einstein 1 respectively consequently the k i i dbp for tim was calculated as 833 m2 einstein 1 by subtracting the k d i dbp from the k i dbp for tim it is clearly seen that the direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation contributed to 50 3 and 49 7 of the tim degradation under vuv uv irradiation respectively analogously the corresponding contributions for diacam and tiaa were 56 9 and 43 1 and 60 2 and 39 8 respectively li et al 2017 reported that the direct uv photolysis contributed less than 2 to sulfamethazine degradation in vuv uv process arany et al 2013 demonstrated that the radical i e ho dominated the vuv uv decomposition of naproxen in the absence of dissolved oxygen molecules however in this study the energy of uv photon 471 kj mol 1 is much higher than that of c i bond 209 kj mol 1 thus the cleavage of c i bonds occurred easily via the direct uv photolysis the contribution of indirect ho oxidation for the three i dbps followed the order of tim diacam tiaa the result further demonstrated that the electron withdrawing moieties weakened the ho attack of the c i bonds in tiaa and diacam 3 3 fate of iodine under vuv uv irradiation generally the iodine released from micropollutants was transformed into iodide i hypoiodous acid hoi i2 and iodate io3 during drinking water treatment processes bichsel and von gunten 1999 tian et al 2014 hu et al 2017 the formation of hoi i2 has not been detected throughout the whole photodegradation processes the three i dbps were almost degraded completely with an f p o value of 3 5 einstein m 2 fig s2 while the i concentration still increased as irradiation continued fig 3 it can be attributed to the stepwise deiodination of the three i dbps which is similar to the iopamidol degradation by uv irradiation and ho so4 oxidation tian et al 2014 hu et al 2017 the i concentrations under vuv uv irradiation were higher than those under uv irradiation taking tim for example with an f p o value of 10 5 einstein m 2 the i concentrations were 0 71 and 0 67 μm under vuv uv and uv irradiation respectively the results further demonstrate that the indirect ho oxidation enhanced the dissociation of c i bonds in the three i dbps additionally a slight decrease of i concentration and a correspondingly increase of io3 concentration were observed under vuv uv irradiation indicating that part of the formed i was further oxidized to io3 by the oxidation of ho generated from the vuv photolysis of h2o taking tim for example with an f p o value of 13 9 einstein m 2 the formed concentrations of i and io3 were 0 70 and 0 04 μm respectively the concentration of i was much higher than that of io3 implying that the generated ho preferred to attack c i bonds to produce i rather than oxidize the released i to form io3 3 4 impact factors 3 4 1 ph the influence of ph on the vuv uv and uv degradation of the three i dbps was investigated in the ph range of 5 5 9 5 fig 4 under uv irradiation the three i dbps were degraded more quickly at a higher ph for example the k values of tim under uv irradiation increased from 1042 to 1300 m2 einstein 1 as the solution ph increased from 5 5 to 9 5 by contrast the three i dbps were degraded more effectively at a lower ph by vuv uv process for instance the k values of tim under vuv uv irradiation decreased from 2100 to 1179 m2 einstein 1 as the solution ph increased from 5 5 to 9 5 the results can be ascribed to two opposite aspects on the one side the generated ho by vuv photolysis of h2o could induce the following reactions kruithof et al 2007 ratpukdi et al 2010 ma et al 2011 7 ho h o 8 ho ho h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 10 ho 2 ho h 2 o o 2 as the solution ph increased the generated ho was consumed to produce o and o2 the oxidation potentials of o and o2 were lower than that of ho and the photodegradation of the three i dbps was retarded correspondingly on the other side the increasing ph facilitated the nucleophilic reaction between oh and c i bonds promoting the hydrolysis the three i dbps the net effect resulted in that the vuv uv degradation of the three i dbps slowed down at a higher ph li et al 2016 reported that an acidic ph favored the degradation of methylene blue by vuv uv process 3 4 2 natural organic matter nom nom is ubiquitously present in drinking water sources and cannot be fully removed by conventional water treatment processes nom contains a large number of aromatic and oxygen functional groups with a strong uv absorption capacity thus inhibiting the photodegradation of micropollutants steelink 2002 meanwhile the photosensitizing moieties present in nom can be activated to its singlet or even triplet state 1nom or 3nom via uv absorption the singlet molecular oxygen 1o2 can be formed through energy transfer from 3nom to o2 zepp et al 1985 both 3nom and 1o2 can react rapidly with certain micropollutants to produce intermediate radical cations accelerating the photodegradation of micropollutants wenk et al 2011 de la cruz et al 2012 11 nom h v n 1 om h v n 3 om 12 n 3 om o 2 nom o 1 2 additionally nom in water usually acts as a radical scavenger and may consume a large fraction of ho impeding the oxidation of micropollutants it was observed that an increasing nom concentration significantly inhibited the photodegradation of the three i dbps fig 5 for instance the k values of tim under vuv uv irradiation decreased from 1760 to 480 m2 einstein 1 as the nom concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 the results indicate that the positive effect of nom was overwhelmed by its detrimental effect within the investigated concentration range 3 4 3 inorganic ions halide ions are also widely present in drinking water so nacl was added into the solution with desired concentrations to investigate the effect of chloride ion cl on the photodegradation of the three i dbps no obvious impact of cl on the uv degradation of the three i dbps was observed while the presence of cl apparently inhibited the vuv uv degradation of the three i dbps fig 6 for example the k values of tim under vuv uv irradiation decreased from 1672 to 1208 m2 einstein 1 as the cl concentration increased from 0 to 71 0 mg l 1 the oxidation of cl by ho in aqueous solutions is known to eventually produce cl2 radical cl2 as an intermediate hasegawa and neta 1978 13 ho cl hocl 14 hocl h h 2 o cl 15 cl cl cl 2 cl2 is less reactive and more selective than ho which may partly explain a lower bond energy of c cl than c oh the weaker electrophilic attack of cl2 may also stem from

18833,this study investigated the vuv uv photodegradation of three iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps namely triiodomethane tim diiodoacetamide diacam and triiodoacetic acid tiaa based on a mini fluidic vuv uv photoreaction system mvps the pseudo first order rate constants k of tim diacam and tiaa under vuv uv irradiation 1769 1301 and 1174 m2 einstein 1 respectively were higher than those under uv irradiation 1003 832 and 766 m2 einstein 1 respectively the enhancement of photodegradation could be attributed to the indirect ho oxidation rather than the direct vuv photolysis as a whole compared with the indirect ho oxidation the direct uv photolysis had a relatively greater contribution to the degradation of the three i dbps especially diacam and tiaa ca 57 and 60 respectively the two electron withdrawing groups in diacam and tiaa i e acylamino and carboxyl decreased the electron density of the c i bonds thus weakening the electrophilic attack of ho the iodine in the three i dbps was released to form i and a small fraction 6 of i was oxidized to io3 indicating that ho preferred to break the c i bonds rather than oxidize i the direct uv photolysis proceeded via h2o catalyzed deiodination reactions while the indirect ho oxidation proceeded via deiodination reactions along with ho addition the vuv uv photodegradation of the three i dbps was more favored at an acidic ph but inhibited by the water matrix components i e nom cl and alkalinity to different extents graphical abstract image 1 keywords vacuum ultraviolet vuv iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps mini fluidic vuv uv photoreaction system mvps drinking water 1 introduction the formation of iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps during the treatment of iodide containing waters has been well reported and predominantly occurs as a result of water disinfection with monochloramine allard et al 2013 tian et al 2014 i dbps are much more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues ye et al 2013 hu et al 2017 iodinated trihalomethanes i thms are the main i dbps in chloramination of iodide containing waters and responsible for the occurrence of bad taste and odor in drinking waters bichsel and von gunten 2000 compared to other four iodinated acids i e bromoiodoacetic acid e 2 iodo 3 methylbutenedioic acid and z and e 3 bromo 3 iodopropenoic acids iodinated acetic acids i haas exhibited a greater genotoxicity in mammalian cell assays plewa et al 2004 i thms and i haas have been detected in effluents of most water treatment plants in the united states and canada the concentrations of chlorobromoiodomethane dichloroiodomethane and bromoiodoacetic acid reached up to 1 4 10 2 and 7 9 μg l 1 respectively richardson et al 2008 iodinated nitrogenous disinfection byproducts which are substantially more cytotoxic and genotoxic than iodinated carbonaceous disinfection byproducts have also been identified in drinking waters plewa et al 2008 chu et al 2012 for example two iodinated acetamides i hacams were quantified in effluents of seven drinking water treatment plants in china with maximum concentrations of 0 21 and 0 15 μg l 1 for chloroiodoacetamide and bromoiodoacetamide respectively chu et al 2012 much attention has been paid to the formation and health risk of i dbps while very few studies focused on the degradation of i dbps it was reported that neither conventional treatment processes e g sand filtration nor advanced technologies e g reverse osmosis could remove i thms effectively cancho et al 2000 farré et al 2012 however xiao et al 2014 reported that i thms underwent a rapid degradation via cleavage of carbon halogen bonds under ultraviolet uv irradiation jo et al 2011 reported that the i dbp analogues brominated trihalomethanes br thms and brominated acetic acids br haas were almost completely degraded by uv h2o2 process therefore it is reasonably expected that uv photolysis or uv based advanced oxidation processes can also effectively degrade i dbps vacuum ultraviolet vuv covers a wavelength range from 100 to 200 nm which can be strongly absorbed by water to form hydroxyl radicals ho zoschke et al 2014 for example 185 nm vuv irradiation of water induces the following reations 1 h 2 o h v 185 ho h 2 h 2 o h v 185 ho h e aq generally a low pressure lp mercury lamp simultaneously emits 185 nm vuv and 254 nm uv i e vuv uv beams the organic pollutants in water under vuv uv irradiation undergo degradation via direct photolysis and indirect ho oxidation li et al 2016 the extra ho oxidation does not need any additional power or chemical input thus the vuv uv process has been applied to the removal of dissolved organic matter and various micropollutants buchanan et al 2005 li et al 2017 for bench scale studies conventional batch vuv uv reactors are limited with the inaccurate determination of photon fluence rate and the uncertain contribution of each wavelength to the degradation of a target pollutant recently a mini fluidic vuv uv photoreaction system mvps has been developed in our laboratory which can emit either combined vuv uv beams or sole uv beams into two separate quartz tubes with a nearly identical uv photon fluence li et al 2016 thus significantly facilitating the tests on vuv uv degradation of micropollutants in aqueous solutions especially for quantification of the vuv contribution the aim of this study was to determine the vuv uv degradation kinetics and mechanism of three types of i dbps i e i thms i haas and i hacams by using the mvps triiodomethane tim chi3 diiodoacetamide diacam chi2conh2 and triiodoacetic acid tiaa ci3cooh were selected as the representative of i thms i haas and i hacams respectively photodegradation kinetics and impact factors were investigated in detail and degradation pathways were also established this study proposes an effective technology to remove i dbps in the secondary water supply facilities or drinking water terminal systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemical reagents all chemicals used in this study were of acs grade or higher the ph of reaction solutions was adjusted by phosphate buffer 1 mm tim diacam and tiaa were purchased from cansyn chem corp canada nitrobenzene nb was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china humic acid ha stock solution was prepared by dissolving ha solids sigma aldrich shanghai china into deionized water and then filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters 2 2 analytical methods tim diacam and tiaa were extracted with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe bougeard et al 2010 and then analyzed with a gas chromatograph and an electron capture detector gc ecd agilent 7890a coupled with a db 5ms separation column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the instrumental

300 c and initial oven temperature held at 40 c for 5 min ramped to 45 c at 1 c min 1 and held for 2 min ramped to 115 c at 10 c min 1 and held for 1 min and finally ramped to 220 c at 15 c min 1 for the analysis of tiaa the instrumental conditions were as follows injector temperature of 210 c detector temperature of 300 c and initial oven temperature held at 40 c for 4 min and ramped to 80 c at 2 c min 1 iodide i iodate io3 and formic acid hcooh were quantified by an ion chromatograph dionex ics2000 equipped with an ionpac as19 column 250 mm 4 0 mm 5 0 μm koh solution 20 mm was used as eluent at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 2 3 reaction system photodegradation experiments were carried out by using the mvps text s1 and fig s1 the photon fluence rate at 185 nm e p o vuv and 254 nm e p o uv were determined with values of 4 93 10 5 and 8 88 10 4 einstein m 2 s 1 respectively li et al 2016 the reduction equivalent exposure time t ree s was defined as follow 3 t ree π r 2 h v t where t is the reaction time s v is the volume of reaction solution m3 r and h are the radius and length of the vuv uv or uv tube m respectively the vuv or uv photon fluence f p o vuv or f p o uv einstein m 2 was calculated as follows 4 f p o vuv e p o vuv t ree 5 f p o uv e p o uv t ree the total exposure photon fluence f p o einstein m 2 in the vuv uv tube is equal to the sum of f p o vuv and f p o uv 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of target i dbps under vuv uv irradiation the degradation kinetics of the three i dbps under vuv uv and uv irradiation is shown in fig 1 instead of using energy fluence photon fluence was adopted because photons with two wavelengths were involved in the vuv uv process bolton et al 2015 without vuv uv and uv irradiation no significant hydrolysis of the three i dbps was observed however all the three i dbps were rapidly degraded under vuv uv and uv irradiation which could be fitted well with the pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 99 the pseudo first order rate constants k of the three i dbps under vuv uv irradiation were higher than those under uv irradiation for example the k values of tim under vuv uv and uv irradiation were 1769 and 1003 m2 einstein 1 respectively the majority of vuv photons were absorbed by water 55 6 m in a dilute solution of i dbps 0 4 μm thus it was the indirect ho oxidation rather than the direct vuv photolysis could account for the enhanced degradation of the three i dbps jo et al 2011 reported that br thms and br haas were degraded primarily by the direct uv photolysis of the c br bonds with ho oxidation as a minor pathway in uv h2o2 system the energy of c i bond 209 kj mol 1 is lower than that of c br bond 280 kj mol 1 thus ho is easier to dissociate the c i bonds in i dbps xiao et al 2014 pointed out that in the uv h2o2 process the homolytic cleavage of c i bond was not only the first step but also the rate determining step of the degradation of tim and the considerable ho generation increased the degradation rate remarkably additionally the vuv uv degradation rates of the three i dbps followed the order of tim diacam tiaa for instance the k values of tim diacam and tiaa under vuv uv irradiation were 1769 1301 and 1174 m2 einstein 1 respectively the ho oxidation is an electrophilic reaction and inclines to occur via electron transfer from the electron rich moieties serna galvis et al 2017 the electron withdrawing group in tiaa and diacam i e carboxyl and acylamino decreased the electron density surrounding the c i bonds weakening the electrophilic attack of ho as a result 3 2 contributions of the direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation as mentioned above the degradation of the three i dbps in vuv uv process involved the direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation therefore the pseudo first order kinetic model can be transformed as follows li et al 2017 6 ln i dbp i dbp 0 k i dbp f p o k d i dbp k i i dbp f p o where i dbp 0 and i dbp are the initial and real time concentrations of each i dbp μg l 1 respectively k i dbp is the photon fluence based pseudo first order rate constant m2 einstein 1 k d i dbp and k i i dbp are the photon fluence based direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation rate constants m2 einstein 1 in this study nb was selected as the scavenger of ho on account of its high reactivity with ho with a rate constant of 3 2 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 guan et al 2013 as expected with the addition of nb the k values of the three i dbps under vuv uv irradiation was approximate to those under uv irradiation fig 2 the k i dbp and k d i dbp for tim were 1677 and 844 m2 einstein 1 respectively consequently the k i i dbp for tim was calculated as 833 m2 einstein 1 by subtracting the k d i dbp from the k i dbp for tim it is clearly seen that the direct uv photolysis and indirect ho oxidation contributed to 50 3 and 49 7 of the tim degradation under vuv uv irradiation respectively analogously the corresponding contributions for diacam and tiaa were 56 9 and 43 1 and 60 2 and 39 8 respectively li et al 2017 reported that the direct uv photolysis contributed less than 2 to sulfamethazine degradation in vuv uv process arany et al 2013 demonstrated that the radical i e ho dominated the vuv uv decomposition of naproxen in the absence of dissolved oxygen molecules however in this study the energy of uv photon 471 kj mol 1 is much higher than that of c i bond 209 kj mol 1 thus the cleavage of c i bonds occurred easily via the direct uv photolysis the contribution of indirect ho oxidation for the three i dbps followed the order of tim diacam tiaa the result further demonstrated that the electron withdrawing moieties weakened the ho attack of the c i bonds in tiaa and diacam 3 3 fate of iodine under vuv uv irradiation generally the iodine released from micropollutants was transformed into iodide i hypoiodous acid hoi i2 and iodate io3 during drinking water treatment processes bichsel and von gunten 1999 tian et al 2014 hu et al 2017 the formation of hoi i2 has not been detected throughout the whole photodegradation processes the three i dbps were almost degraded completely with an f p o value of 3 5 einstein m 2 fig s2 while the i concentration still increased as irradiation continued fig 3 it can be attributed to the stepwise deiodination of the three i dbps which is similar to the iopamidol degradation by uv irradiation and ho so4 oxidation tian et al 2014 hu et al 2017 the i concentrations under vuv uv irradiation were higher than those under uv irradiation taking tim for example with an f p o value of 10 5 einstein m 2 the i concentrations were 0 71 and 0 67 μm under vuv uv and uv irradiation respectively the results further demonstrate that the indirect ho oxidation enhanced the dissociation of c i bonds in the three i dbps additionally a slight decrease of i concentration and a correspondingly increase of io3 concentration were observed under vuv uv irradiation indicating that part of the formed i was further oxidized to io3 by the oxidation of ho generated from the vuv photolysis of h2o taking tim for example with an f p o value of 13 9 einstein m 2 the formed concentrations of i and io3 were 0 70 and 0 04 μm respectively the concentration of i was much higher than that of io3 implying that the generated ho preferred to attack c i bonds to produce i rather than oxidize the released i to form io3 3 4 impact factors 3 4 1 ph the influence of ph on the vuv uv and uv degradation of the three i dbps was investigated in the ph range of 5 5 9 5 fig 4 under uv irradiation the three i dbps were degraded more quickly at a higher ph for example the k values of tim under uv irradiation increased from 1042 to 1300 m2 einstein 1 as the solution ph increased from 5 5 to 9 5 by contrast the three i dbps were degraded more effectively at a lower ph by vuv uv process for instance the k values of tim under vuv uv irradiation decreased from 2100 to 1179 m2 einstein 1 as the solution ph increased from 5 5 to 9 5 the results can be ascribed to two opposite aspects on the one side the generated ho by vuv photolysis of h2o could induce the following reactions kruithof et al 2007 ratpukdi et al 2010 ma et al 2011 7 ho h o 8 ho ho h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 10 ho 2 ho h 2 o o 2 as the solution ph increased the generated ho was consumed to produce o and o2 the oxidation potentials of o and o2 were lower than that of ho and the photodegradation of the three i dbps was retarded correspondingly on the other side the increasing ph facilitated the nucleophilic reaction between oh and c i bonds promoting the hydrolysis the three i dbps the net effect resulted in that the vuv uv degradation of the three i dbps slowed down at a higher ph li et al 2016 reported that an acidic ph favored the degradation of methylene blue by vuv uv process 3 4 2 natural organic matter nom nom is ubiquitously present in drinking water sources and cannot be fully removed by conventional water treatment processes nom contains a large number of aromatic and oxygen functional groups with a strong uv absorption capacity thus inhibiting the photodegradation of micropollutants steelink 2002 meanwhile the photosensitizing moieties present in nom can be activated to its singlet or even triplet state 1nom or 3nom via uv absorption the singlet molecular oxygen 1o2 can be formed through energy transfer from 3nom to o2 zepp et al 1985 both 3nom and 1o2 can react rapidly with certain micropollutants to produce intermediate radical cations accelerating the photodegradation of micropollutants wenk et al 2011 de la cruz et al 2012 11 nom h v n 1 om h v n 3 om 12 n 3 om o 2 nom o 1 2 additionally nom in water usually acts as a radical scavenger and may consume a large fraction of ho impeding the oxidation of micropollutants it was observed that an increasing nom concentration significantly inhibited the photodegradation of the three i dbps fig 5 for instance the k values of tim under vuv uv irradiation decreased from 1760 to 480 m2 einstein 1 as the nom concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 the results indicate that the positive effect of nom was overwhelmed by its detrimental effect within the investigated concentration range 3 4 3 inorganic ions halide ions are also widely present in drinking water so nacl was added into the solution with desired concentrations to investigate the effect of chloride ion cl on the photodegradation of the three i dbps no obvious impact of cl on the uv degradation of the three i dbps was observed while the presence of cl apparently inhibited the vuv uv degradation of the three i dbps fig 6 for example the k values of tim under vuv uv irradiation decreased from 1672 to 1208 m2 einstein 1 as the cl concentration increased from 0 to 71 0 mg l 1 the oxidation of cl by ho in aqueous solutions is known to eventually produce cl2 radical cl2 as an intermediate hasegawa and neta 1978 13 ho cl hocl 14 hocl h h 2 o cl 15 cl cl cl 2 cl2 is less reactive and more selective than ho which may partly explain a lower bond energy of c cl than c oh the weaker electrophilic attack of cl2 may also stem from its complex nature that is solvation and negative charge kiwi et al 2000 reported that the reaction rate constants of ho and cl2 radicals with orange ii were 6 0 109 and 3 7 107 m 1 s 1 respectively note that the inhibition impact of cl varied dramatically among different organic compounds grebel et al 2000 reported that destruction of 17β estradiol in seawater containing halide ions declined slightly only 3 during ho oxidation as the cl concentration further increased from 71 0 to 142 0 mg l 1 the vuv uv degradation rate of the three i dbps almost remained unchanged due to the complete transformation of ho to cl2 to evaluate the impact of alkalinity on the photodegradation of the three i dbps bicarbonate hco3 was added into the solution similar to cl no apparent effect of hco3 on the uv degradation of the three i dbps was observed hco3 in water can react with ho to form carbonate radical co3 a less reactive radical 1 6 v von gunten and hoigné 1994 joffe et al 2013 16 hco 3 ho

18834,sewage sludge the major by product during the primary treatment and subsequent biotreatment of wastewater is increasingly generated around the world kmno4 fe ii consists both oxidation properties of kmno4 and flocculation ability by in situ formed fe iii and is widely used in water treatment in this study kmno4 fe ii was used as chemical conditioners to synchronously improve sludge dewatering performance and catalyze the biomass pyrolysis of waste activated sludge for preparing multi functional material to remedy arsenic containing groundwater the results showed that the sludge dewaterability was significantly improved due to the moderate pre oxidation of extracellular polymeric substances by kmno4 and then the sludge particles were re flocculated by fe iii generated from kmno4 fe ii the conditioned sludge cake was then utilized for preparing sludge based carbon fe mn sbc which was systematically characterized the surface area of fe mn sbc was characteristic of high surface area 100 08 m2 g which had a great adsorption capacity on arsenic besides fe mn sbc could effectively oxidize as iii to as v and addition of low dose of h2o2 can further improve total arsenic removal due to catalytic peroxidation of fe mn sbc besides it was found that the presence of humic acid could inhibit the hydroxy iron formation and compete for the active adsorption sites and then resulted in the decrease in arsenic removal and the co existing humic acid could also be removed by adsorption of fe mn sbc this work proposed a novel sludge treatment process by combining enhanced sludge dewatering with catalytic pyrolysis for preparing multi functional materials and they are promising in treatment of water containing combined pollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords combined pollutants extracellular polymeric substances kmno4 fe ii sludge conditioning sludge based carbon 1 introduction a considerable amount of waste activated sludge was is produced in recent decades due to the increasing development of the industrial wastewater treatment technology li et al 2018 there was over 11 2 million tons of dry sludge generated annually in china and 10 million tons in 26 eu member states in 2008 yu et al 2015 feng et al 2015 sun et al 2015 it could cause many serious environmental risks including pathogens or parasites existed in was for threating the environmental and public health due to the possible contact with vectors of infectious diseases to humans dumontet et al 1999 zhang et al 2014 besides other toxic pollutants with the potential risks on environmental water such as heavy metals fe co as and other species which could also endanger human health indirectly therefore the safe disposal of waste activated sludge is currently one of the most important issues in the field of municipal and environmental engineering the regulation requirements on sludge disposal issued by chinese government became more stringent chen et al 2015 traditional management of was includes aerobic and anaerobic digestion landfilling fertilizer usage incineration and land application fytili et al 2008 kuriqi a et al 2016 moreover it was claimed that approximately about 40 of sewage sludge produced in the eu countries which was applied in agriculture purposes kacprzak et al 2017 however several countries had taken into consideration of the environmental risks with the applying sludge to agricultural land and even had banned its application since the toxic pollutants in biosolid could pose a potential threat to ecological environment conversion of municipal sludge into carbon based functional materials through hydrothermal or pyrolysis process is one of the most important method to achieve a friendly and harmless and resource utilization for sludge treatment and it has a great prospect in sludge management yuan et al 2017 however there are some problems in traditional was management which has limited the development in a large scale firstly a large quantity of energy was required during the pyrolysis process because of high moisture content in sludge and then resulted in high operating cost therefore mechanical dewatering is a critical process to improve the sludge energy density and reduce the operating energy consumption besides it should be point out that the extracellular polymeric substances eps was the major components in sludge and it was account for about 60 80 of total sludge mass liu et al 2003 which could significantly influence the sludge physicochemical properties including surface charge floc stability and rheological behavior mikkelsen et al 2002 it was found that the eps composition especially for the proteins which had more significant effects on the dewaterability of sludge higgins et al 1997 it was mainly because that eps can form a stable gel like structure which can bind water molecules through steric hindrance which could cause the sludge to be viscoelastic highly hydrophilic compressible and difficult to dewater therefore the chemical conditioning was an indispensable technology for sludge dewatering enhancement the chemical conditioning process was actually a series of physical and chemical reactions on solid liquid interface caused by conditioner coagulants and flocculants and flocs niu et al 2013 it could regulate the structure of gel like network especially for eps and then the water molecules was separated from sludge however traditional chemical flocculants was ineffective to destroy the eps structure since the eps fractions in sludge were highly hydrated hence the advanced sludge technologies ast were proposed to improve the sludge dewaterability and photo fenton fenton oxidation technology was one of the ast liu et al 2013 moreover chen et al 2016 suggested that the combination of oxidation and flocculation could be more effective to enhance the sludge dewaterability performance traditional sludge based carbons sbc exhibited low specific surface area low porosities functional simplicity and limited water purification capacity chemical activation was always utilized to improve the structure and property of biochar based materials smith et al 2009 yu et al 2006 however these methods are hard to be realized in the practical application and a plenty works are mainly related to improve the structural and properties of biochar based materials but studies on organic matters transformation mechanisms during the pyrolysis process are scare fe ii kmno4 system is an efficient water purification technology which consists both of oxidation and flocculation capacities on organic matters and it was widely used in the high algal water and arsenic containing water treatments li et al 2012 wu et al 2014 therefore it suggested to us that kmno4 fe ii system could also be effective to improve the dewaterability and structure properties of sludge through the combination with oxidation properties of kmno4 and highly flocculation ability of in situ formed fe iii and the existence of kmno4 fe ii in sludge could also catalyze the sludge pyrolysis in anaerobic conditions and improve structural properties of sludge based carbon sbc wu et al 2014 moreover kmno4 fe ii was expected to combine catalytic pyrolysis and sludge dewatering enhancement for preparing multi functional carbon based material oxidation adsorption and catalysis which might provide a novel and promising sludge treatment system arsenic was an ubiquitous trace element in groundwater which was highly concerned due to its high toxicity and carcinogenicity and long term uptake of arsenic contaminated water could lead to cancer of the liver and skin roberts et al 2004 in order to prevent these dangers the world health organization who had set a guideline limit of 10 μg l arsenic in drinking water holm 2002 besides it was reported that as v is the dominant arsenic species in well oxygenated water ferguson et al 1972 whereas as iii was the major arsenic species in groundwater smedley et al 2002 and as iii was much more toxic ferguson et al 1972 soluble and mobile than as v although as iii could be spontaneously converted into as v in oxygenated water but the process was extremely slow edwards 1994 however natural organic matters noms were always ubiquitous in aquatic environment and influence the environmental fate of as iii in different ways noms could be classified into two groups including humic and non humic substances fakour et al 2014 kuriqi a et al 2014 roberts d a et al 2018 and the former fraction such as humic acid ha was reported to represent 50 90 of organic matters in aquatic system which might complex with metals or absorbed onto minerals surfaces ko et al 2007 and the asernic transformation could be significantly affected by noms in groundwater therefore it was essential to propose an appropriate treatment on water containing both arsenic and nom traditional arsenic containing water technologies included precipitation ion exchange and adsorption etc and the adsorption process was regarded as one of the most promising technologies due to its simple operation and cost effective jang et al 2006 however all of these elimination techniques were effective in case of as v or humic substances but not efficient in as iii removal and humic substances could inhibit the spontaneously transformation of as iii to as v in oxygenated water frank et al 1986 jekel et al 1994 driehaus et al 1994 therefore development of adsorbents with dual functions of oxidation and adsorption might be more effective in combined pollutants arsenic and humic substances containing water treatment with the discussions above this work proposed a novel sludge recycle route using kmno4 fe ii conditioning for preparing sludge based carbon in remediation arsenic as containing groundwater the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of kmno4 fe ii conditioning on the sludge dewaterability and unravel the sludge conditioning mechanisms 2 prepare the fe mn sbc materials using kmno4 fe ii conditioned sludge as raw materials through pyrolysis process and comprehensively characterize the physicochemical properties of fe mn sbc 3 evaluate the removal efficiency of fe mn sbc in synthetic groundwater containing as iii and investigate the influence of natural organic matters noms on arsenic removal 4 investigate the mechanism of as iii oxidation adsorption process by fe mn sbc therefore this study did not only propose a strategy for sludge treatment and recycle but developed a novel multi functional material for treatment of combined pollutants in water 2 method and materials 2 1 materials sodium chloride nacl analytical reagent manganese kmno4 analytical reagent feso4 6h2o

properties were given in table s1 supporting information 2 2 was conditioning by kmno4 fe ii for sludge dewaterability improvement the effects of kmno4 fe ii on the dewaterability performance and structural properties of activated sludge were investigated using different mass ratio dosage of kmno4 fe ii in range of 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 and 1 3 kmno4 concentration was fixed by 1000 mg l each batch experiments was performed in 500 ml beaker the above different ratio of kmno4 fe ii were then dosed into 500 ml beaker containing 300 ml of sludge and stirred for 180 min with a six line agitator machine in 300 rpm at 25 c after that took a certain amount of conditioned sludge by kmno4 fe ii for further examinations 2 3 assessment of sludge dewaterability the sludge dewaterability was evaluated using specific resistance to filtration srf measurement and capillary suction time cst measurement chen et al 2015 the detailed method for the srf measurements was provided in section s1 1

lowry method peterson et al 1977 respectively section s1 3 and section s1 4 in supporting information besides the proteins and polysaccharides distributions in sludge were characterized using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm machine zeiss lsm 510 before the observation by clsm samples were treated using fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and con a texas red agent respectively for protein and polysaccharides the proteins in sludge could be dyed with fitc and displayed in green with the scanning range at λex 543 nm λem 550 600 while polysaccharides in sludge could be dyed with con a texas red and displayed in red with the scanning range at λex 488 nm λem 500 550 nm ki et al 2015 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was used to investigate the natural organic matter nom changes in eps since it was reported that the fluorescent intensity in the 3d eem spectra could be applied to quantify the eps concentrations of the cod in water samples sheng and yu 2006 section s1 5 in supporting information the parallel factor parafac analysis was employed to separate the actual fluorescence spectra from the eem fluorescence spectra hall et al 2005 yu et al 2010 since the eps in sludge had a relatively complex compositions and the overlap of their fluorescence spectra could be serious and the eem data was analyzed using the software mat lab 8 6 mathworks inc usa 2 5 preparation of fe mn sbc composite material the preparation of fe mn sbc absorbents from was conditioned at different mass ratio dosages of kmno4 fixed in 1000 mg l and fe ii 2 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 2

particles were washed for three times using ultrapure water in order to remove undesired organics and then the obtained fe mn sbc was dried using a freezer drier and ground into fine particles for further characterization as well as applied in arsenic and humic acid ha containing water treatment besides the methodology of fe mn sbc preparation and its application in the water containing arsenic was shown in fig s1 see in supporting information 2 6 characterization of fe mn sbc composite material the functional groups of fe mn sbc was analyzed using a fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer thermo fisher thermo nicolet nexus 670 usa and the spectrophotometer was recorded in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the crystal structures of fe mn sbc was analyzed using a d8 focus x ray diffractometer xrd bruker axs d8 focus germany with a diffraction angle in a range 10 80 moreover the particle size of the fe mn sbc used in this study was measured using a malvern zetasizer nano zs 900 instrument thermogravimetric analysis of fe mn sbc was performed using a sta 409 pc luxx simultaneous thermal analyzer netzsch gerätebau germany for simultaneous thermogravimetric differential

metals in fe mn sbc 2 7 procedure of adsorption kinetic and oxidation adsorption experiments the arsenic adsorption kinetic of fe mn sbc was performed under arsenic concentration ranged from 100 μg l to 1200 μg l and the arsenic adsorption efficiency at varying initial arsenic concentration were fitted using langmuir and freundlich isotherms equations as follows langmuir equation c e q e c e q 0 1 q 0 b freundlich equation ln q e 1 n l n c e l n k for langmuir equation q e mg g represented the equilibrium absorption capacity c e mg l represented the equilibrium concentration in water and q 0 mg g represented the maximum adsorption capacity per saturated area of absorbent besides for freundlich equation when 1 n 1 adsorption is easy while 1 n 2 the adsorption is difficult moreover the arsenic oxidation adsorption experiments of fe mn sbc were conducted with or without addition of h2o2 specifically the arsenic removal efficiency by fe mn sbc with the addition of h2o2 was regarded as the combined effect of oxidation and adsorption and the arsenic removal efficiency by fe mn sbc without the addition of h2o2 was regarded as adsorption process the effect of humic acid ha on the arsenic removal was performed in synthesized groundwater containing as iii 1000 μg l with and without ha 10 mg l and the total arsenic concentration in water was measured in the adsorption reaction time at 0 5 10 15 20 30 45 60 90 120 min 2 8 water qualities analysis the groundwater samples were synthesized according to the contaminants concentrations of high arsenic groundwater in jianghan plain hubei

like activity evaluation of fe mn sbc the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition by fe mn sbc were investigated in order to study the oxidation capacity of fe mn sbc ai et al 2016 hagelin weaver et al 2004 eisenberg et al 1943 the detailed method was provided in section s1 6 supporting information moreover the electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr measurement was used to analyze the active radicals generated by fe mn sbc catalyzing h2o2 ai et al 2016 and the detailed method was provided in section s1 7 supporting information 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of kmno4 fe ii on sludge dewatering performance the effect of mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii on sludge dewaterability behavior was investigated using capillary suction time cst s l g and specific resistance filtration srf measurements as shown in fig 1 it was obvious that the cstn of sludge initially increased when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was high than 2 1 at fixed kmno4 concentration of 1000 mg l cstn was then decreased by increasing dosage of fe ii when the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii was lower than 2 1 the cstn reached the minimum cst was of 9 81 s l g when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was 1 3 fe ii concentration was 3000 mg l as shown in fig 1 a besides according to the results of srf the srf of sludge decreased with the addition of kmno4 fe ii however the srf decreased not obviously when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was exceed 2 3 and the srf of sludge reached the minimum srf 1 16 1013 m kg when the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii was at 1 3 and 1 2 with the discussions above both the results of the cst and srf indicated that the sludge dewaterability performed best when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was 1 3 or 1 2 which was might to be the optimal chemical conditioner dosage on the sludge conditioning process the phenomenon was likely to be the reason that when the dosage of kmno4 exceed fe ii mass concentration mass ratio of mn fe was of 3 1 1 1 there was no enough fe ii for in situ fe iii formed through kmno4 fe ii system and the eps in sludge was mainly flocculated by the function of in situ generated fe iii from kmno4 fe ii system therefore when the dosage of fe ii was higher than kmno4 it would be favorable for the fe iii formed by the oxidation process of kmno4 the organic matters could be effectively flocculated by the abundant formed fe iii and then resulted in the enhancement of the sludge dewaterability performance 3 2 effects of kmno4 fe ii conditioning on sludge properties 3 2 1 zeta potential and mean size of sludge flocs in order to understand the mechanism of kmno4 fe ii conditioning process effects of different mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii on the zeta potential zp and mean size ms of both unconditioned and conditioned was were investigated and given in fig 2 it was found that the zp of was increased with increasing dosage of fe ii it was mainly due to the effective oxidation reactions between kmno4 and fe ii and resulted in electrostatic neutralization between in situ formed hydroxyl iron with eps in was however when the mass ratio dose of kmno4 and fe ii exceeded 1 2 the zp of sludge was decreased it was likely that the electrostatic neutralization was mainly caused by in situ formed fe iii coagulation before the kmno4 fe ii ratio dose of 1 2 but the excessive fe ii might inhibit the oxidation process of kmno4 and then resulted in the decline of fe iii formation consequently the zp was decreased with the excessive fe ii dose moreover it was found that the mean size of was slightly decreased with the increasing dosage of fe ii kmno4 dosage was fixed at 1000 mg l the phenomenon could be explained as it was reported that kmno4 treatment was effective for sludge oxidation and proteins and polysaccharides could be released into the liquid phase through the kmno4 oxidation effect especially for the proteins wu et al 2014 therefore the sludge flocs showed a decrease in particle size besides the oxidized eps could be further flocculated by in situ formed fe iii from kmno4 fe ii system since the fe iii had a great flocculation ability on eps as reported before li et al 2012 therefore resulted in the decrease of eps concentration in sludge however the excessive of fe ii could inhibit the oxidation process by kmno4 in the present of o2 therefore the mean size of was would be little larger than the optimal mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii the optimal mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii for sludge conditioning was 1 2 thus it was chosen as the optimal conditioning dosage for the further synthesis of fe mn sbc materials 3 2 2 characterization of eps changes in kmno4 fe ii conditioning as can be seen in fig 3 the concentrations of protein polysaccharide in tb eps and lb eps especially protein like substances were decreased with increase of fe ii dosage kmno4 concentration was fixed as 1000 mg l indicating that a more compact floc structure was formed through flocculation by in situ generated fe iii from kmno4 fe ii moreover the eps concentration decreased with the increasing dosage of fe ii before the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was less than 1 3 it was mainly because that the in situ formed fe iii had more reactive surface area than pre formed fe iii and the continuous introduction of fresh fe iii coagulant showed higher efficiency than one off dosage of coagulant to micro cells ma et al 2012 however when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii increased more than 1 3 the excessive fe ii could inhibit the oxidation reaction between kmno4 fe ii resulted in decreasing of in situ formed fe iii and the flocculation process of eps in sludge was weakened moreover the different components in 3d eem spectra was separated using parafac analysis the results showed that three main fluorescence compounds were detected in s eps and l eps including component 1 fulvic acid like fa component 2 humic acid like ha and component 3 tryptophan proteins tpn two main fluorescence compounds were presented in tb eps including component 3 tryptophan proteins tpn and component 1 fa chen et al 2003 as presented in fig 4 and fig s9 supporting information for s eps it was found that the fluorescent intensity of eps was decreased after the kmno4 fe ii conditioning especially for fa compounds which was decreased more obviously than other compounds however in the lb eps and tb eps the compounds tpn decreased more sharply than other compounds after the kmno4 fe ii treatment besides all of the fluorescence response of eps were decreased with the increasing fe ii dosage before the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii was 1 2 and then increased slightly when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was higher than 1 2 it was interesting to note that the changes in fluorescent characteristics of eps were consistent with that of sludge dewatering property it was likely that the excessive fe ii might inhibit the oxidation properties by kmno4 as mentioned before the eps was firstly oxidized into smaller compounds and then be flocculated by the in situ formed fe iii while the concentration of fe ii excessed to the kmno4 the oxidation efficiency of eps was decreased and then resulted in poor oxidation flocculation properties on eps these results demonstrated that the eps was affected by both oxidation of kmno4 and flocculation of fe iii which is in situ formed from kmno4 fe ii they were both responsible for the sludge conditioning 3 2 3 proteins and polysaccharides distributions in sludge proteins and polysaccharides distributions in sludge before and after kmno4 fe ii conditioning were characterized using laser scanning confocal microscope lscm analysis as seen in fig 5 it could be clearly observed that the proteins and polysaccharides in sludge were split into smaller molecules seen in fig 5 a and b with the kmno4 treatment because that the eps in sludge was oxidized by kmno4 and then proteins and polysaccharides in sludge are destructed and released into liquid phase wu et al 2014 however it was found that the proteins and polysaccharides in sludge are re agglomerated and formed a larger aggregates as shown in fig 5 c after treatment by kmno4 fe ii since the fe iii could be in situ formed in kmno4 fe ii treatment and the fe iii could be effective in flocculation for proteins and polysaccharides li et al 2012 besides when the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii for sludge conditioning was 1 2 kmno4 concentration was fixed as 1000 mg l the cake solids content of dewatered sludge was increased from 11 67 to 21 14 see fig s2 in supporting information it could be concluded that the eps was initially oxidized by kmno4 and then flocculated by in situ formed fe iii during the kmno4 fe ii treatment process and then the sludge dewaterability was significantly enhanced 3 3 characterization of fe mn sbc 3 3 1 morphological properties of fe mn sbc the surface area of fe mn sbc was characterized using brunner emmett teller bet measurement as depicted in fig 6 a it was found that an obvious increase in bet surface area of fe mn sbc was observed in the comparison with raw sludge bet surface area of fe mn sbc was 100 08 m2 g while the bet surface area of none conditioned sbc was just 54 99 m2 g table s2 in supporting information besides the particle size of the fe mn sbc used in this study was measured using a malvern zetasizer nano instrument and the mean size of fe mn sbc was 3 429 μm see fig s3 in supporting information these results indicated that the was conditioned with kmno4 fe ii significantly improved the surface area and the porosity of sbc by functioning as pyrolytic catalysts the was and femn was were mainly composed with mesoporous pores as seen in fig s11 a and b and the mesoporous pores of femn was trends to be transferred into micropore pores fe mn sbc in carbonization process as seen in fig s11 c supporting information resulting in the increase of bet surface area of fe mn sbc since the plenty micropore pores had higher superficial area than that of mesoporous pores materials moreover the was and fe mn sbc morphologies under sem analysis was presented in fig 6 b and c it could be clearly observed that the raw sludge had a relatively smooth surface and loose structure as seen in fig 6 b while the fe mn sbc showed more fragmentation features after the pyrolysis treatment as depicted in fig 6 c indicating that the porosities of sbc was enhanced efficiency with the high temperature pyrolysis process 3 3 2 chemical properties of fe mn sbc the functional groups of fe mn sbc was characterized using ft ir measurement as shown in fig 7 a the characteristic transmittance of fe mn sbc at 1655 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 were related to stretching brand of oh cotuguo et al 2006 besides the characteristic transmittance at 2929 cm 1 and 1378 cm 1 could be assigned to ch co stretching motions of organics vibrations mao et al 2008 as depicted in fig 7 a fe mn sbc still exhibited two characteristic stretching bands at 1655 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 as same as was and there is no obvious changes between was and femn was but the sharp transmittance intensity decreased significantly after the pyrolysis treatment it was mainly attributed to the dehydration process in the high temperature pyrolysis which had removed most of h2o molecules since the characteristic transmittance at 3435 cm 1 related to the h2o molecule had almost disappeared additionally it was found that the characteristic transmittance of fe mn sbc at 2929 cm 1 was decreased in the comparison to the was it was likely that some of organics were decomposed and removed after the pyrolysis treatment besides the chemical composition of was and fe mn sbc were searched in the xrd standard card as shown in fig s7 of supporting information the results showed that 4 kinds of phases detected in was were mainly for organics but 2 mineral phases detected in fe mn sbc were composed by fe or mn minerals it was noted that the characteristic peaks of fe and mn oxides were not detected in xrd patterns indicating both of them were presented as amorphous states moreover the effects of kmno4 fe ii on thermostability of was were investigated using a thermo gravimetric analyze tga and the results were shown in fig 7 b it could be clearly observed that the mass content of was and fe mn sbc were decreased with the increasing temperature and most of h2o molecules and organics were almost decomposed when the temperature reached at 800 c moreover it was found that the dry weight of fe mn sbc increased and accounted for 64 55 of original sludge after the sludge conditioned by kmno4 fe ii and the mass weight of kmno4 fe ii was maintained 34 74 of original sludge while was just maintained 28 63 of dry weight of sludge at the temperature of 1100 c these results indicated that the thermostability of was was enhanced due to the generation of amorphous fe and mn oxides after kmno4 fe ii conditioning 3 4 oxidation adsorption performance of fe mn sbc on as iii 3 4 1 as iii removal efficiency by fe mn sbc as mentioned above the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii had a great impact on the sludge dewaterability and its structural properties which could further affect the adsorption behavior of fe mn sbc on as iii therefore the adsorption performance of different fe mn sbc absorbents on as iii were carried out with initial as iii at 1000 μg l as presented in fig 8 a the results indicated that the 1 2 femnsbc performed best on the as iii removal at 0 2 g l dose and the maximum removal efficiency of as iii was 98 22 which was used for further application in the other batch adsorption experiments for both as iii and as v moreover fig 8 b showed when the absorbent dosage was 2 4 g l that the as iii removal could achieve the maximum of 97 02 which was selected for the further application in arsenic containing wastewater treatments 3 4 2 adsorption kinetics and capacity of fe mn sbc for as v and as iii adsorption capacity of fe mn sbc for as v and as iii removal from aqueous solution were evaluated using langmuir and freundlich isotherms respectively as presented in fig 9 which was utilized to describe the adsorption processes a maximum adsorption for as v and as iii were calculated from langmuir equation and given in fig s5 supporting information the adsorption constants obtained from langmuir and freundlich equations at certain experimental conditions were given in table 1 as shown in table 1 high regression coefficients r2 0 92 indicated that both of langmuir and freundlich models were suitable for describing the adsorption process for as v by fe mn sbc absorbent however the regression coefficients presented in table 1 suggested that freundlich models was fitted better for as iii adsorption performance the langmuir models failed in describing the adsorption of as iii was because this equation model was mainly describe the adsorption process which the sorption and desorption were identical process zhang et al 2007 however the as iii adsorption process by fe mn sbc was oxidation adsorption dynamic reaction occurred on the surface of fe mn sbc moreover the calculated maximum adsorption of as v was 249 37 μg l while the maximum adsorption of as iii was 251 26 μg l and the adsorption sites for as v n 1 45 was higher than that of as iii n 1 34 these results indicated that the as v was more easily to be absorbed by fe mn sbc than that of more toxicity as iii however it seems that the adsorption capacity of fe mn sbc for as iii was higher than that of as v with the obtained q m it was because that fresh adsorption sites for arsenic adsorption were generated at the fe mn sbc surface solid surface during as iii oxidation as reported before deschamps et al 2005 resulting in an increase of formed as v from as iii oxidation process removal 3 4 3 oxidation conversion of as iii into as v by fe mn sbc as mentioned above the as iii removal was mainly due to both of oxidation of manganese dioxide and adsorption of iron minerals thus the oxidation adsorption efficiency of as iii by fe mn sbc were evaluated through certainly experiment conditions as presented in fig 10 the initial as iii concentration was fixed at 1000 μg l and a complete depletion of as iii from solution by oxidation adsorption of fe mn sbc occurred within 160 min as seen in fig 10 a it could be found that the reaction between as iii and fe mn sbc was particularly fast during the first 40 min and almost 70 of the as iii was removed without the addition of h2o2 as depicted in fig 10 a however almost 85 of as iii was depleted within 40 min in the presence of h2o2 this was might due to the oxidation process by both of mno2 h2o2 and possible radicals zhang et al 2007 karpov et al 2018 then resulted in a faster conversion of as iii to as v and the maximal oxidation capacities of as iii to as v were calculated as 93 87 and 100 in the absence and presence of h2o2 as seen in fig 10 a and table 2 respectively besides the changes of as v concentration in solution could be explained as follow in the initial reaction period the absorbed as iii by fe mn sbc could be quickly oxidized into the state of as v as the result of the reductive by mno2 or h2o2 in fe mn sbc some of the formed as v would be desorbed from the surface of solid surfaces fe mn sbc nesbitt et al 1998 resulting in a short time of relatively high as v during the first 10 min and then the as v in solution would be quickly absorbed by the feooh formed from fe mn sbc consequently leading to a relatively low as v concentration in solution the effects of fe mn sbc absorbent dosage on the as iii removal was also carried out as shown in fig 10 b it can be seen that as iii in solution was almost completely removed when the fe mn sbc dosage was 1 5 g l in the absence of h2o2 and the as iii in solution was declined from 1000 μg l to 41 3 μg l when the fe mn sbc dose was at 1 0 g l in the presence of h2o2 this was likely that the existing of h2o2 could assist the oxidative transformation process of as iii to as v by mno2 in fe mn sbc since there was active radicals generated by h2o2 which was confirmed with the esr analysis in the following section moreover as v was generated from oxidation of as iii and could not be completely removed by fe mn sbc due to dynamic balance of adsorption and desorption onto feooh and consequently resulted in residual as v with low concentration in aqueous solution 3 4 4 synthesized groundwater containing humic acid and arsenic remediation by fe mn sbc noms were widely distributed in water bodies and generally have effects on water treatment processes in order to evaluate the effects of humic acids ha on the as iii oxidation adsorption removal as iii containing water treatment by fe mn sbc in the absence and presence of ha were comparatively investigated as depicted in fig 11 a it was found that as iii oxidation adsorption removal efficiency was decreased from 90 to 73 in the presence of ha revealing that the existence of ha could inhibit the as iii removal in water the phenomenon was likely caused by two reasons as follow firstly in comparison to as iii as v ha had higher molecular weights tipping et al 2002 and it could block the porous of fe mn sbc and then resulted in reduction of sites for as iii as v adsorption secondly it was reported that the presence of ha could reduce the feooh mineral transformation processes hu et al 2018 and the as v adsorption was positively correlated with the amount of feooh minerals which could be formed from fe iii in situ generated in fe ii mn iv sbc system in the presence of o2 and h2o bolanz et al 2013 ford et al 2002 besides the presence of ha could also reduce the as iii oxidation process by mno2 since there was a competition oxidation process between ha and as iii by fe mn sbc and the total arsenic removal was mainly due to the as v formation from as iii by mno2 since the as v was more easily to be absorbed by feooh minerals as previous study reported jekel m et al 1994 therefore the existence of ha could inhibit the arsenic oxidation adsorption process since there were steric hindrance and a competition oxidation adsorption process between ha and as iii by fe mn sbc moreover the co existing ha concentration was determined using toc measurement to confirm the ha removal during the as iii oxidation adsorption process by fe mn sbc as presented in fig 11 b it was found that the toc was decreased with the increasing dosage of fe mn sbc and the toc removal efficiency was enhanced with the addition of h2o2 the toc was decreased from 10 mg l to 8 07 mg l and 6 447 mg l without and with addition of h2o2 at dosage of 0 337 g l respectively it was mainly because that fe mn sbc showed fenton like activity it can catalyze h2o2 decomposition and produce active oxidants see in fig s4 in supporting information 3 4 5 distribution of arsenic as element in fe mn sbc after adsorption from sem analysis it was observed that the surface of fe mn sbc showed less porosity after the as containing water treatment in the comparison to the none treatment of fe mn sbc as shown in fig 6 d it was mainly because that the arsenic was successfully adsorbed into the surface of fe mn sbc and then resulted in decrease of porosity of fe mn sbc moreover the distribution of arsenic element in fe mn sbc before and after the as iii adsorption by fe mn sbc was shown in fig 12 it was obviously observed that arsenic element distribution was closely corrected with fe and mn distribution during the adsorption as shown in stem mapping scan results when the was without mn fe and arsenic as adsorption as shown in fig 12 a the signals in mapping was sparser but the fe and mn elements signals in mapping are increasingly intensive after the was is conditioned through kmno4 fe ii system as shown in fig 12 b and the edx analysis in table s3 and fig s8 supporting information sh owed that the element contents of fe and mn were increased from 2 72 2 57 to 5 42 9 15 respectively indicating the increasing of fe and mn elements contents in sbc it was likely that the fe and mn elements were complexed with the eps in was and then the fe and mn elements were retained in obtained fe mn sbc after the carbonization process moreover it was found that the arsenic element signal was also increased with the arsenic adsorption process indicating the arsenic existed in water was effectively adsorbed onto and concentrated onto the surface of the fe mn sbc 3 5 mechanism of oxidation adsorption process of fe mn sbc on as iii it was observed from xrd patterns that the characteristic peaks of sio2 phase emerged in fe mn sbc as iii revealing that the as iii oxidation process by mno2 in sbc had effect on the crystal form of sbc in addition x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps was used to understand the oxidation transformation of manganese and iron in fe mn sbc in order to get insights into the as iii adsorption mechanism the results of fe 2p and mn 2p electron binding energy were presented in fig 13 as mentioned before the as iii as v adsorption process was mainly due to the high adsorption capacity of feooh in order to confirm the existence of fe2 fe3 in the fe mn sbc composite material xps measurements were carried out to investigate the oxidation state of fe the overall spectra of the fe mn sbc and fe mn sbc as are shown in fig s10 supporting information it was found that the fe 2p xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc displays two peaks at 712 08 and 726 38 ev which could be attributed to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively glisenti et al 2000 fig 13 b the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 in the xps spectrum of fe mn sbc as was weaker than those of the fe mn sbc and the fe 2p3 2 peak in the xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc as iii can be de convoluted into two peaks at 711 6 and 714 28 ev which was corresponding to fe2 and fe3 respectively while the fe 2p3 2 peak in the xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc just show the peaks at 712 08 ev which was related to fe2 kong et al 2018 moreover the fe 2p1 2 xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc as was higher than that of fe mn sbc 726 38 ev and the fe 2 p1 2 peaks in xps spectrum of fe mn sbc as iii was at 727 29 ev besides of this the mn 2 p3 2 mn 2 p1 2 xps spectra of the fe mn sbc are almost the same and the peak positions of 642 18 ev and 653 38 ev shows the presence of mn4 zhang et al 2007 indicating the presence of mno2 these results suggested that some of fe2 in fe mn sbc was oxidized to fe3 by mno2 after the composite material was applied in as iii containing water treatment and the oxidation adsorption process had no effect on the mno2 properties in fe mn sbc according to the xps results of mn in fe mn sbc which was beneficial for the reuse in water treatment moreover the esr spin trapping technique was utilized to detect the radicals generating during the reaction between h2o2 with fe mn sbc as shown in fig 13 c results indicated that there is significant dmpo oh spin adducts and some unknown signal peaks of compounds detected in the pure h2o of fe mn sbc catalytic system revealing that oh radicals were generated in the oxidation adsorption process by fe mn sbc on as iii in the present of h2o2 besides it was well known that the o2 was unstable in aqueous solution and easily rapidly to be decomposed into oh since the reaction rate of dmpo with oh was much faster than that of o2 radicals yin et al 2009 hence the dmpo o2 peaks were difficult to be detected although it was truly formed in the catalytic reaction process dikalov et al 1999 in order to further investigated whether o2 was formed during the oxidation adsorption process of fe mn sbc on as iii with the existing of h2o2 c4h9oh instead of h2o was used to act as oh radicals quencher and slow down the vanishing rate of o2 radicals the results showed while fe mn sbc with h2o2 were reacted in the c4h9oh system there was no detectable dmpo o2 adducts in the fe mn sbc catalyzed h2o2 system huvaere et al 2010 it was suggested that oh radicals were primarily responsible for the as iii oxidation in the fe mn sbc h2o2 system and it was beneficial to both as iii oxidation and organic contaminants degradation 4 conclusion kmno4 fe ii was used to improve sludge dewatering performance and catalyze biomass pyrolysis for preparing multi functional fe mn sbc and then it was applied in the treatment of groundwater containing combined pollutants arsenic and noms the sludge dewaterability was efficiently enhanced because of the combination of oxidative properties of kmno4 and flocculation capacity of in situ formed fe iii the synthesized fe mn sbc particles from kmno4 fe ii conditioned sludge exhibited a great oxidation adsorption capacities on both of as iii and co existing humic acid ha removal from aqueous solution besides it was found that the addition of h2o2 could assist the as iii conversions during the oxidation process by mno2 while the as iii was depleted faster with the existing of h2o2 in the comparison of the system without h2o2 indicating that formed oh radicals could also contribute to the oxidative conversion of as iii to as v however the presence of ha could inhibit the hydroxy iron formation and compete the active adsorption sites and then resulted in the decreasing of arsenic removal but the co existing ha could also be synchronous removed therefore kmno4 fe ii provides a novel solution for sludge conditioning and fe mn sbc is also promising to treat the water subject to combined pollutants making it to be attractive for both sewage sludge and water treatment

18834,sewage sludge the major by product during the primary treatment and subsequent biotreatment of wastewater is increasingly generated around the world kmno4 fe ii consists both oxidation properties of kmno4 and flocculation ability by in situ formed fe iii and is widely used in water treatment in this study kmno4 fe ii was used as chemical conditioners to synchronously improve sludge dewatering performance and catalyze the biomass pyrolysis of waste activated sludge for preparing multi functional material to remedy arsenic containing groundwater the results showed that the sludge dewaterability was significantly improved due to the moderate pre oxidation of extracellular polymeric substances by kmno4 and then the sludge particles were re flocculated by fe iii generated from kmno4 fe ii the conditioned sludge cake was then utilized for preparing sludge based carbon fe mn sbc which was systematically characterized the surface area of fe mn sbc was characteristic of high surface area 100 08 m2 g which had a great adsorption capacity on arsenic besides fe mn sbc could effectively oxidize as iii to as v and addition of low dose of h2o2 can further improve total arsenic removal due to catalytic peroxidation of fe mn sbc besides it was found that the presence of humic acid could inhibit the hydroxy iron formation and compete for the active adsorption sites and then resulted in the decrease in arsenic removal and the co existing humic acid could also be removed by adsorption of fe mn sbc this work proposed a novel sludge treatment process by combining enhanced sludge dewatering with catalytic pyrolysis for preparing multi functional materials and they are promising in treatment of water containing combined pollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords combined pollutants extracellular polymeric substances kmno4 fe ii sludge conditioning sludge based carbon 1 introduction a considerable amount of waste activated sludge was is produced in recent decades due to the increasing development of the industrial wastewater treatment technology li et al 2018 there was over 11 2 million tons of dry sludge generated annually in china and 10 million tons in 26 eu member states in 2008 yu et al 2015 feng et al 2015 sun et al 2015 it could cause many serious environmental risks including pathogens or parasites existed in was for threating the environmental and public health due to the possible contact with vectors of infectious diseases to humans dumontet et al 1999 zhang et al 2014 besides other toxic pollutants with the potential risks on environmental water such as heavy metals fe co as and other species which could also endanger human health indirectly therefore the safe disposal of waste activated sludge is currently one of the most important issues in the field of municipal and environmental engineering the regulation requirements on sludge disposal issued by chinese government became more stringent chen et al 2015 traditional management of was includes aerobic and anaerobic digestion landfilling fertilizer usage incineration and land application fytili et al 2008 kuriqi a et al 2016 moreover it was claimed that approximately about 40 of sewage sludge produced in the eu countries which was applied in agriculture purposes kacprzak et al 2017 however several countries had taken into consideration of the environmental risks with the applying sludge to agricultural land and even had banned its application since the toxic pollutants in biosolid could pose a potential threat to ecological environment conversion of municipal sludge into carbon based functional materials through hydrothermal or pyrolysis process is one of the most important method to achieve a friendly and harmless and resource utilization for sludge treatment and it has a great prospect in sludge management yuan et al 2017 however there are some problems in traditional was management which has limited the development in a large scale firstly a large quantity of energy was required during the pyrolysis process because of high moisture content in sludge and then resulted in high operating cost therefore mechanical dewatering is a critical process to improve the sludge energy density and reduce the operating energy consumption besides it should be point out that the extracellular polymeric substances eps was the major components in sludge and it was account for about 60 80 of total sludge mass liu et al 2003 which could significantly influence the sludge physicochemical properties including surface charge floc stability and rheological behavior mikkelsen et al 2002 it was found that the eps composition especially for the proteins which had more significant effects on the dewaterability of sludge higgins et al 1997 it was mainly because that eps can form a stable gel like structure which can bind water molecules through steric hindrance which could cause the sludge to be viscoelastic highly hydrophilic compressible and difficult to dewater therefore the chemical conditioning was an indispensable technology for sludge dewatering enhancement the chemical conditioning process was actually a series of physical and chemical reactions on solid liquid interface caused by conditioner coagulants and flocculants and flocs niu et al 2013 it could regulate the structure of gel like network especially for eps and then the water molecules was separated from sludge however traditional chemical flocculants was ineffective to destroy the eps structure since the eps fractions in sludge were highly hydrated hence the advanced sludge technologies ast were proposed to improve the sludge dewaterability and photo fenton fenton oxidation technology was one of the ast liu et al 2013 moreover chen et al 2016 suggested that the combination of oxidation and flocculation could be more effective to enhance the sludge dewaterability performance traditional sludge based carbons sbc exhibited low specific surface area low porosities functional simplicity and limited water purification capacity chemical activation was always utilized to improve the structure and property of biochar based materials smith et al 2009 yu et al 2006 however these methods are hard to be realized in the practical application and a plenty works are mainly related to improve the structural and properties of biochar based materials but studies on organic matters transformation mechanisms during the pyrolysis process are scare fe ii kmno4 system is an efficient water purification technology which consists both of oxidation and flocculation capacities on organic matters and it was widely used in the high algal water and arsenic containing water treatments li et al 2012 wu et al 2014 therefore it suggested to us that kmno4 fe ii system could also be effective to improve the dewaterability and structure properties of sludge through the combination with oxidation properties of kmno4 and highly flocculation ability of in situ formed fe iii and the existence of kmno4 fe ii in sludge could also catalyze the sludge pyrolysis in anaerobic conditions and improve structural properties of sludge based carbon sbc wu et al 2014 moreover kmno4 fe ii was expected to combine catalytic pyrolysis and sludge dewatering enhancement for preparing multi functional carbon based material oxidation adsorption and catalysis which might provide a novel and promising sludge treatment system arsenic was an ubiquitous trace element in groundwater which was highly concerned due to its high toxicity and carcinogenicity and long term uptake of arsenic contaminated water could lead to cancer of the liver and skin roberts et al 2004 in order to prevent these dangers the world health organization who had set a guideline limit of 10 μg l arsenic in drinking water holm 2002 besides it was reported that as v is the dominant arsenic species in well oxygenated water ferguson et al 1972 whereas as iii was the major arsenic species in groundwater smedley et al 2002 and as iii was much more toxic ferguson et al 1972 soluble and mobile than as v although as iii could be spontaneously converted into as v in oxygenated water but the process was extremely slow edwards 1994 however natural organic matters noms were always ubiquitous in aquatic environment and influence the environmental fate of as iii in different ways noms could be classified into two groups including humic and non humic substances fakour et al 2014 kuriqi a et al 2014 roberts d a et al 2018 and the former fraction such as humic acid ha was reported to represent 50 90 of organic matters in aquatic system which might complex with metals or absorbed onto minerals surfaces ko et al 2007 and the asernic transformation could be significantly affected by noms in groundwater therefore it was essential to propose an appropriate treatment on water containing both arsenic and nom traditional arsenic containing water technologies included precipitation ion exchange and adsorption etc and the adsorption process was regarded as one of the most promising technologies due to its simple operation and cost effective jang et al 2006 however all of these elimination techniques were effective in case of as v or humic substances but not efficient in as iii removal and humic substances could inhibit the spontaneously transformation of as iii to as v in oxygenated water frank et al 1986 jekel et al 1994 driehaus et al 1994 therefore development of adsorbents with dual functions of oxidation and adsorption might be more effective in combined pollutants arsenic and humic substances containing water treatment with the discussions above this work proposed a novel sludge recycle route using kmno4 fe ii conditioning for preparing sludge based carbon in remediation arsenic as containing groundwater the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of kmno4 fe ii conditioning on the sludge dewaterability and unravel the sludge conditioning mechanisms 2 prepare the fe mn sbc materials using kmno4 fe ii conditioned sludge as raw materials through pyrolysis process and comprehensively characterize the physicochemical properties of fe mn sbc 3 evaluate the removal efficiency of fe mn sbc in synthetic groundwater containing as iii and investigate the influence of natural organic matters noms on arsenic removal 4 investigate the mechanism of as iii oxidation adsorption process by fe mn sbc therefore this study did not only propose a strategy for sludge treatment and recycle but developed a novel multi functional material for treatment of combined pollutants in water 2 method and materials 2 1 materials sodium chloride nacl analytical reagent manganese kmno4 analytical reagent feso4 6h2o

properties were given in table s1 supporting information 2 2 was conditioning by kmno4 fe ii for sludge dewaterability improvement the effects of kmno4 fe ii on the dewaterability performance and structural properties of activated sludge were investigated using different mass ratio dosage of kmno4 fe ii in range of 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 and 1 3 kmno4 concentration was fixed by 1000 mg l each batch experiments was performed in 500 ml beaker the above different ratio of kmno4 fe ii were then dosed into 500 ml beaker containing 300 ml of sludge and stirred for 180 min with a six line agitator machine in 300 rpm at 25 c after that took a certain amount of conditioned sludge by kmno4 fe ii for further examinations 2 3 assessment of sludge dewaterability the sludge dewaterability was evaluated using specific resistance to filtration srf measurement and capillary suction time cst measurement chen et al 2015 the detailed method for the srf measurements was provided in section s1 1

provided in section s1 2 see in supporting information moreover the polysaccharide and proteins concentrations in eps were determined using 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid dns assays gusakov et al 2011 and lowry method peterson et al 1977 respectively section s1 3 and section s1 4 in supporting information besides the proteins and polysaccharides distributions in sludge were characterized using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm machine zeiss lsm 510 before the observation by clsm samples were treated using fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and con a texas red agent respectively for protein and polysaccharides the proteins in sludge could be dyed with fitc and displayed in green with the scanning range at λex 543 nm λem 550 600 while polysaccharides in sludge could be dyed with con a texas red and displayed in red with the scanning range at λex 488 nm λem 500 550 nm ki et al 2015 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy was used to investigate the natural organic matter nom changes in eps since it was reported that the fluorescent intensity in the 3d eem spectra could be applied to quantify the eps concentrations of the cod in water samples sheng and yu 2006 section s1 5 in supporting information the parallel factor parafac analysis was employed to separate the actual fluorescence spectra from the eem fluorescence spectra hall et al 2005 yu et al 2010 since the eps in sludge had a relatively complex compositions and the overlap of their fluorescence spectra could be serious and the eem data was analyzed using the software mat lab 8 6 mathworks inc usa 2 5 preparation of fe mn sbc composite material the preparation of fe mn sbc absorbents from was conditioned at different mass ratio dosages of kmno4 fixed in 1000 mg l and fe ii 2 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 2

particles were washed for three times using ultrapure water in order to remove undesired organics and then the obtained fe mn sbc was dried using a freezer drier and ground into fine particles for further characterization as well as applied in arsenic and humic acid ha containing water treatment besides the methodology of fe mn sbc preparation and its application in the water containing arsenic was shown in fig s1 see in supporting information 2 6 characterization of fe mn sbc composite material the functional groups of fe mn sbc was analyzed using a fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrophotometer thermo fisher thermo nicolet nexus 670 usa and the spectrophotometer was recorded in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the crystal structures of fe mn sbc was analyzed using a d8 focus x ray diffractometer xrd bruker axs d8 focus germany with a diffraction angle in a range 10 80 moreover the particle size of the fe mn sbc used in this study was measured using a malvern zetasizer nano zs 900 instrument thermogravimetric analysis of fe mn sbc was performed using a sta 409 pc luxx simultaneous thermal analyzer netzsch gerätebau germany for simultaneous thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis tg dta analysis under n2 at 10 c min with temperature programmed in the range 0 800 c the specific porous areas of fe mn sbc were measured by brunner emmet teller measurement using an

with an acceleration voltage of 80 kv and magnification of 1 5 105 the fe mn sbc was ultrasonically treated using absolute ethyl alcohol for 15 min and dried on a copper grid at room temperature before the tem characterization then the fe mn sbc samples were dried and coated with gold and a zeiss sigma hd scanning electron microscope sem zeiss germany was used to observe the surface of the fe mn sbc at an acceleration voltage of 5 0 kv an escalab 250 xi x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo fisher scientific usa was used to investigate the species content and valence states of the metals in fe mn sbc 2 7 procedure of adsorption kinetic and oxidation adsorption experiments the arsenic adsorption kinetic of fe mn sbc was performed under arsenic concentration ranged from 100 μg l to 1200 μg l and the arsenic adsorption efficiency at varying initial arsenic concentration were fitted using langmuir and freundlich isotherms equations as follows langmuir equation c e q e c e q 0 1 q 0 b freundlich equation ln q e 1 n l n c e l n k for langmuir equation q e mg g represented the equilibrium absorption capacity c e mg l represented the equilibrium concentration in water and q 0 mg g represented the maximum adsorption capacity per saturated area of absorbent besides for freundlich equation when 1 n 1 adsorption is easy while 1 n 2 the adsorption is difficult moreover the arsenic oxidation adsorption experiments of fe mn sbc were conducted with or without addition of h2o2 specifically the arsenic removal efficiency by fe mn sbc with the addition of h2o2 was regarded as the combined effect of oxidation and adsorption and the arsenic removal efficiency by fe mn sbc without the addition of h2o2 was regarded as adsorption process the effect of humic acid ha on the arsenic removal was performed in synthesized groundwater containing as iii 1000 μg l with and without ha 10 mg l and the total arsenic concentration in water was measured in the adsorption reaction time at 0 5 10 15 20 30 45 60 90 120 min 2 8 water qualities analysis the groundwater samples were synthesized according to the contaminants concentrations of high arsenic groundwater in jianghan plain hubei province china the water qualities used in this study was synthesized water containing humic acid ha 10 mg l and arsenic 1000 μg l and typical ions in groundwater including cl 7 80 mg l hco3 120 mg l and na 100 mg l before the arsenic concentration analysis the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filter membrane adjusted to ph of less than 2 with 10 hcl or citric acid sodium citrate and further measured using an electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry etaas the detailed analysis procedure was as follow a for total arsenic determination about 1 ml hcl 75 and 1 ml thiourea 150 g

like activity evaluation of fe mn sbc the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition by fe mn sbc were investigated in order to study the oxidation capacity of fe mn sbc ai et al 2016 hagelin weaver et al 2004 eisenberg et al 1943 the detailed method was provided in section s1 6 supporting information moreover the electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr measurement was used to analyze the active radicals generated by fe mn sbc catalyzing h2o2 ai et al 2016 and the detailed method was provided in section s1 7 supporting information 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of kmno4 fe ii on sludge dewatering performance the effect of mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii on sludge dewaterability behavior was investigated using capillary suction time cst s l g and specific resistance filtration srf measurements as shown in fig 1 it was obvious that the cstn of sludge initially increased when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was high than 2 1 at fixed kmno4 concentration of 1000 mg l cstn was then decreased by increasing dosage of fe ii when the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii was lower than 2 1 the cstn reached the minimum cst was of 9 81 s l g when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was 1 3 fe ii concentration was 3000 mg l as shown in fig 1 a besides according to the results of srf the srf of sludge decreased with the addition of kmno4 fe ii however the srf decreased not obviously when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was exceed 2 3 and the srf of sludge reached the minimum srf 1 16 1013 m kg when the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii was at 1 3 and 1 2 with the discussions above both the results of the cst and srf indicated that the sludge dewaterability performed best when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was 1 3 or 1 2 which was might to be the optimal chemical conditioner dosage on the sludge conditioning process the phenomenon was likely to be the reason that when the dosage of kmno4 exceed fe ii mass concentration mass ratio of mn fe was of 3 1 1 1 there was no enough fe ii for in situ fe iii formed through kmno4 fe ii system and the eps in sludge was mainly flocculated by the function of in situ generated fe iii from kmno4 fe ii system therefore when the dosage of fe ii was higher than kmno4 it would be favorable for the fe iii formed by the oxidation process of kmno4 the organic matters could be effectively flocculated by the abundant formed fe iii and then resulted in the enhancement of the sludge dewaterability performance 3 2 effects of kmno4 fe ii conditioning on sludge properties 3 2 1 zeta potential and mean size of sludge flocs in order to understand the mechanism of kmno4 fe ii conditioning process effects of different mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii on the zeta potential zp and mean size ms of both unconditioned and conditioned was were investigated and given in fig 2 it was found that the zp of was increased with increasing dosage of fe ii it was mainly due to the effective oxidation reactions between kmno4 and fe ii and resulted in electrostatic neutralization between in situ formed hydroxyl iron with eps in was however when the mass ratio dose of kmno4 and fe ii exceeded 1 2 the zp of sludge was decreased it was likely that the electrostatic neutralization was mainly caused by in situ formed fe iii coagulation before the kmno4 fe ii ratio dose of 1 2 but the excessive fe ii might inhibit the oxidation process of kmno4 and then resulted in the decline of fe iii formation consequently the zp was decreased with the excessive fe ii dose moreover it was found that the mean size of was slightly decreased with the increasing dosage of fe ii kmno4 dosage was fixed at 1000 mg l the phenomenon could be explained as it was reported that kmno4 treatment was effective for sludge oxidation and proteins and polysaccharides could be released into the liquid phase through the kmno4 oxidation effect especially for the proteins wu et al 2014 therefore the sludge flocs showed a decrease in particle size besides the oxidized eps could be further flocculated by in situ formed fe iii from kmno4 fe ii system since the fe iii had a great flocculation ability on eps as reported before li et al 2012 therefore resulted in the decrease of eps concentration in sludge however the excessive of fe ii could inhibit the oxidation process by kmno4 in the present of o2 therefore the mean size of was would be little larger than the optimal mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii the optimal mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii for sludge conditioning was 1 2 thus it was chosen as the optimal conditioning dosage for the further synthesis of fe mn sbc materials 3 2 2 characterization of eps changes in kmno4 fe ii conditioning as can be seen in fig 3 the concentrations of protein polysaccharide in tb eps and lb eps especially protein like substances were decreased with increase of fe ii dosage kmno4 concentration was fixed as 1000 mg l indicating that a more compact floc structure was formed through flocculation by in situ generated fe iii from kmno4 fe ii moreover the eps concentration decreased with the increasing dosage of fe ii before the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was less than 1 3 it was mainly because that the in situ formed fe iii had more reactive surface area than pre formed fe iii and the continuous introduction of fresh fe iii coagulant showed higher efficiency than one off dosage of coagulant to micro cells ma et al 2012 however when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii increased more than 1 3 the excessive fe ii could inhibit the oxidation reaction between kmno4 fe ii resulted in decreasing of in situ formed fe iii and the flocculation process of eps in sludge was weakened moreover the different components in 3d eem spectra was separated using parafac analysis the results showed that three main fluorescence compounds were detected in s eps and l eps including component 1 fulvic acid like fa component 2 humic acid like ha and component 3 tryptophan proteins tpn two main fluorescence compounds were presented in tb eps including component 3 tryptophan proteins tpn and component 1 fa chen et al 2003 as presented in fig 4 and fig s9 supporting information for s eps it was found that the fluorescent intensity of eps was decreased after the kmno4 fe ii conditioning especially for fa compounds which was decreased more obviously than other compounds however in the lb eps and tb eps the compounds tpn decreased more sharply than other compounds after the kmno4 fe ii treatment besides all of the fluorescence response of eps were decreased with the increasing fe ii dosage before the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii was 1 2 and then increased slightly when the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii was higher than 1 2 it was interesting to note that the changes in fluorescent characteristics of eps were consistent with that of sludge dewatering property it was likely that the excessive fe ii might inhibit the oxidation properties by kmno4 as mentioned before the eps was firstly oxidized into smaller compounds and then be flocculated by the in situ formed fe iii while the concentration of fe ii excessed to the kmno4 the oxidation efficiency of eps was decreased and then resulted in poor oxidation flocculation properties on eps these results demonstrated that the eps was affected by both oxidation of kmno4 and flocculation of fe iii which is in situ formed from kmno4 fe ii they were both responsible for the sludge conditioning 3 2 3 proteins and polysaccharides distributions in sludge proteins and polysaccharides distributions in sludge before and after kmno4 fe ii conditioning were characterized using laser scanning confocal microscope lscm analysis as seen in fig 5 it could be clearly observed that the proteins and polysaccharides in sludge were split into smaller molecules seen in fig 5 a and b with the kmno4 treatment because that the eps in sludge was oxidized by kmno4 and then proteins and polysaccharides in sludge are destructed and released into liquid phase wu et al 2014 however it was found that the proteins and polysaccharides in sludge are re agglomerated and formed a larger aggregates as shown in fig 5 c after treatment by kmno4 fe ii since the fe iii could be in situ formed in kmno4 fe ii treatment and the fe iii could be effective in flocculation for proteins and polysaccharides li et al 2012 besides when the mass ratio of kmno4 and fe ii for sludge conditioning was 1 2 kmno4 concentration was fixed as 1000 mg l the cake solids content of dewatered sludge was increased from 11 67 to 21 14 see fig s2 in supporting information it could be concluded that the eps was initially oxidized by kmno4 and then flocculated by in situ formed fe iii during the kmno4 fe ii treatment process and then the sludge dewaterability was significantly enhanced 3 3 characterization of fe mn sbc 3 3 1 morphological properties of fe mn sbc the surface area of fe mn sbc was characterized using brunner emmett teller bet measurement as depicted in fig 6 a it was found that an obvious increase in bet surface area of fe mn sbc was observed in the comparison with raw sludge bet surface area of fe mn sbc was 100 08 m2 g while the bet surface area of none conditioned sbc was just 54 99 m2 g table s2 in supporting information besides the particle size of the fe mn sbc used in this study was measured using a malvern zetasizer nano instrument and the mean size of fe mn sbc was 3 429 μm see fig s3 in supporting information these results indicated that the was conditioned with kmno4 fe ii significantly improved the surface area and the porosity of sbc by functioning as pyrolytic catalysts the was and femn was were mainly composed with mesoporous pores as seen in fig s11 a and b and the mesoporous pores of femn was trends to be transferred into micropore pores fe mn sbc in carbonization process as seen in fig s11 c supporting information resulting in the increase of bet surface area of fe mn sbc since the plenty micropore pores had higher superficial area than that of mesoporous pores materials moreover the was and fe mn sbc morphologies under sem analysis was presented in fig 6 b and c it could be clearly observed that the raw sludge had a relatively smooth surface and loose structure as seen in fig 6 b while the fe mn sbc showed more fragmentation features after the pyrolysis treatment as depicted in fig 6 c indicating that the porosities of sbc was enhanced efficiency with the high temperature pyrolysis process 3 3 2 chemical properties of fe mn sbc the functional groups of fe mn sbc was characterized using ft ir measurement as shown in fig 7 a the characteristic transmittance of fe mn sbc at 1655 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 were related to stretching brand of oh cotuguo et al 2006 besides the characteristic transmittance at 2929 cm 1 and 1378 cm 1 could be assigned to ch co stretching motions of organics vibrations mao et al 2008 as depicted in fig 7 a fe mn sbc still exhibited two characteristic stretching bands at 1655 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 as same as was and there is no obvious changes between was and femn was but the sharp transmittance intensity decreased significantly after the pyrolysis treatment it was mainly attributed to the dehydration process in the high temperature pyrolysis which had removed most of h2o molecules since the characteristic transmittance at 3435 cm 1 related to the h2o molecule had almost disappeared additionally it was found that the characteristic transmittance of fe mn sbc at 2929 cm 1 was decreased in the comparison to the was it was likely that some of organics were decomposed and removed after the pyrolysis treatment besides the chemical composition of was and fe mn sbc were searched in the xrd standard card as shown in fig s7 of supporting information the results showed that 4 kinds of phases detected in was were mainly for organics but 2 mineral phases detected in fe mn sbc were composed by fe or mn minerals it was noted that the characteristic peaks of fe and mn oxides were not detected in xrd patterns indicating both of them were presented as amorphous states moreover the effects of kmno4 fe ii on thermostability of was were investigated using a thermo gravimetric analyze tga and the results were shown in fig 7 b it could be clearly observed that the mass content of was and fe mn sbc were decreased with the increasing temperature and most of h2o molecules and organics were almost decomposed when the temperature reached at 800 c moreover it was found that the dry weight of fe mn sbc increased and accounted for 64 55 of original sludge after the sludge conditioned by kmno4 fe ii and the mass weight of kmno4 fe ii was maintained 34 74 of original sludge while was just maintained 28 63 of dry weight of sludge at the temperature of 1100 c these results indicated that the thermostability of was was enhanced due to the generation of amorphous fe and mn oxides after kmno4 fe ii conditioning 3 4 oxidation adsorption performance of fe mn sbc on as iii 3 4 1 as iii removal efficiency by fe mn sbc as mentioned above the mass ratio dosage of kmno4 and fe ii had a great impact on the sludge dewaterability and its structural properties which could further affect the adsorption behavior of fe mn sbc on as iii therefore the adsorption performance of different fe mn sbc absorbents on as iii were carried out with initial as iii at 1000 μg l as presented in fig 8 a the results indicated that the 1 2 femnsbc performed best on the as iii removal at 0 2 g l dose and the maximum removal efficiency of as iii was 98 22 which was used for further application in the other batch adsorption experiments for both as iii and as v moreover fig 8 b showed when the absorbent dosage was 2 4 g l that the as iii removal could achieve the maximum of 97 02 which was selected for the further application in arsenic containing wastewater treatments 3 4 2 adsorption kinetics and capacity of fe mn sbc for as v and as iii adsorption capacity of fe mn sbc for as v and as iii removal from aqueous solution were evaluated using langmuir and freundlich isotherms respectively as presented in fig 9 which was utilized to describe the adsorption processes a maximum adsorption for as v and as iii were calculated from langmuir equation and given in fig s5 supporting information the adsorption constants obtained from langmuir and freundlich equations at certain experimental conditions were given in table 1 as shown in table 1 high regression coefficients r2 0 92 indicated that both of langmuir and freundlich models were suitable for describing the adsorption process for as v by fe mn sbc absorbent however the regression coefficients presented in table 1 suggested that freundlich models was fitted better for as iii adsorption performance the langmuir models failed in describing the adsorption of as iii was because this equation model was mainly describe the adsorption process which the sorption and desorption were identical process zhang et al 2007 however the as iii adsorption process by fe mn sbc was oxidation adsorption dynamic reaction occurred on the surface of fe mn sbc moreover the calculated maximum adsorption of as v was 249 37 μg l while the maximum adsorption of as iii was 251 26 μg l and the adsorption sites for as v n 1 45 was higher than that of as iii n 1 34 these results indicated that the as v was more easily to be absorbed by fe mn sbc than that of more toxicity as iii however it seems that the adsorption capacity of fe mn sbc for as iii was higher than that of as v with the obtained q m it was because that fresh adsorption sites for arsenic adsorption were generated at the fe mn sbc surface solid surface during as iii oxidation as reported before deschamps et al 2005 resulting in an increase of formed as v from as iii oxidation process removal 3 4 3 oxidation conversion of as iii into as v by fe mn sbc as mentioned above the as iii removal was mainly due to both of oxidation of manganese dioxide and adsorption of iron minerals thus the oxidation adsorption efficiency of as iii by fe mn sbc were evaluated through certainly experiment conditions as presented in fig 10 the initial as iii concentration was fixed at 1000 μg l and a complete depletion of as iii from solution by oxidation adsorption of fe mn sbc occurred within 160 min as seen in fig 10 a it could be found that the reaction between as iii and fe mn sbc was particularly fast during the first 40 min and almost 70 of the as iii was removed without the addition of h2o2 as depicted in fig 10 a however almost 85 of as iii was depleted within 40 min in the presence of h2o2 this was might due to the oxidation process by both of mno2 h2o2 and possible radicals zhang et al 2007 karpov et al 2018 then resulted in a faster conversion of as iii to as v and the maximal oxidation capacities of as iii to as v were calculated as 93 87 and 100 in the absence and presence of h2o2 as seen in fig 10 a and table 2 respectively besides the changes of as v concentration in solution could be explained as follow in the initial reaction period the absorbed as iii by fe mn sbc could be quickly oxidized into the state of as v as the result of the reductive by mno2 or h2o2 in fe mn sbc some of the formed as v would be desorbed from the surface of solid surfaces fe mn sbc nesbitt et al 1998 resulting in a short time of relatively high as v during the first 10 min and then the as v in solution would be quickly absorbed by the feooh formed from fe mn sbc consequently leading to a relatively low as v concentration in solution the effects of fe mn sbc absorbent dosage on the as iii removal was also carried out as shown in fig 10 b it can be seen that as iii in solution was almost completely removed when the fe mn sbc dosage was 1 5 g l in the absence of h2o2 and the as iii in solution was declined from 1000 μg l to 41 3 μg l when the fe mn sbc dose was at 1 0 g l in the presence of h2o2 this was likely that the existing of h2o2 could assist the oxidative transformation process of as iii to as v by mno2 in fe mn sbc since there was active radicals generated by h2o2 which was confirmed with the esr analysis in the following section moreover as v was generated from oxidation of as iii and could not be completely removed by fe mn sbc due to dynamic balance of adsorption and desorption onto feooh and consequently resulted in residual as v with low concentration in aqueous solution 3 4 4 synthesized groundwater containing humic acid and arsenic remediation by fe mn sbc noms were widely distributed in water bodies and generally have effects on water treatment processes in order to evaluate the effects of humic acids ha on the as iii oxidation adsorption removal as iii containing water treatment by fe mn sbc in the absence and presence of ha were comparatively investigated as depicted in fig 11 a it was found that as iii oxidation adsorption removal efficiency was decreased from 90 to 73 in the presence of ha revealing that the existence of ha could inhibit the as iii removal in water the phenomenon was likely caused by two reasons as follow firstly in comparison to as iii as v ha had higher molecular weights tipping et al 2002 and it could block the porous of fe mn sbc and then resulted in reduction of sites for as iii as v adsorption secondly it was reported that the presence of ha could reduce the feooh mineral transformation processes hu et al 2018 and the as v adsorption was positively correlated with the amount of feooh minerals which could be formed from fe iii in situ generated in fe ii mn iv sbc system in the presence of o2 and h2o bolanz et al 2013 ford et al 2002 besides the presence of ha could also reduce the as iii oxidation process by mno2 since there was a competition oxidation process between ha and as iii by fe mn sbc and the total arsenic removal was mainly due to the as v formation from as iii by mno2 since the as v was more easily to be absorbed by feooh minerals as previous study reported jekel m et al 1994 therefore the existence of ha could inhibit the arsenic oxidation adsorption process since there were steric hindrance and a competition oxidation adsorption process between ha and as iii by fe mn sbc moreover the co existing ha concentration was determined using toc measurement to confirm the ha removal during the as iii oxidation adsorption process by fe mn sbc as presented in fig 11 b it was found that the toc was decreased with the increasing dosage of fe mn sbc and the toc removal efficiency was enhanced with the addition of h2o2 the toc was decreased from 10 mg l to 8 07 mg l and 6 447 mg l without and with addition of h2o2 at dosage of 0 337 g l respectively it was mainly because that fe mn sbc showed fenton like activity it can catalyze h2o2 decomposition and produce active oxidants see in fig s4 in supporting information 3 4 5 distribution of arsenic as element in fe mn sbc after adsorption from sem analysis it was observed that the surface of fe mn sbc showed less porosity after the as containing water treatment in the comparison to the none treatment of fe mn sbc as shown in fig 6 d it was mainly because that the arsenic was successfully adsorbed into the surface of fe mn sbc and then resulted in decrease of porosity of fe mn sbc moreover the distribution of arsenic element in fe mn sbc before and after the as iii adsorption by fe mn sbc was shown in fig 12 it was obviously observed that arsenic element distribution was closely corrected with fe and mn distribution during the adsorption as shown in stem mapping scan results when the was without mn fe and arsenic as adsorption as shown in fig 12 a the signals in mapping was sparser but the fe and mn elements signals in mapping are increasingly intensive after the was is conditioned through kmno4 fe ii system as shown in fig 12 b and the edx analysis in table s3 and fig s8 supporting information sh owed that the element contents of fe and mn were increased from 2 72 2 57 to 5 42 9 15 respectively indicating the increasing of fe and mn elements contents in sbc it was likely that the fe and mn elements were complexed with the eps in was and then the fe and mn elements were retained in obtained fe mn sbc after the carbonization process moreover it was found that the arsenic element signal was also increased with the arsenic adsorption process indicating the arsenic existed in water was effectively adsorbed onto and concentrated onto the surface of the fe mn sbc 3 5 mechanism of oxidation adsorption process of fe mn sbc on as iii it was observed from xrd patterns that the characteristic peaks of sio2 phase emerged in fe mn sbc as iii revealing that the as iii oxidation process by mno2 in sbc had effect on the crystal form of sbc in addition x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps was used to understand the oxidation transformation of manganese and iron in fe mn sbc in order to get insights into the as iii adsorption mechanism the results of fe 2p and mn 2p electron binding energy were presented in fig 13 as mentioned before the as iii as v adsorption process was mainly due to the high adsorption capacity of feooh in order to confirm the existence of fe2 fe3 in the fe mn sbc composite material xps measurements were carried out to investigate the oxidation state of fe the overall spectra of the fe mn sbc and fe mn sbc as are shown in fig s10 supporting information it was found that the fe 2p xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc displays two peaks at 712 08 and 726 38 ev which could be attributed to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively glisenti et al 2000 fig 13 b the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 in the xps spectrum of fe mn sbc as was weaker than those of the fe mn sbc and the fe 2p3 2 peak in the xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc as iii can be de convoluted into two peaks at 711 6 and 714 28 ev which was corresponding to fe2 and fe3 respectively while the fe 2p3 2 peak in the xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc just show the peaks at 712 08 ev which was related to fe2 kong et al 2018 moreover the fe 2p1 2 xps spectrum of the fe mn sbc as was higher than that of fe mn sbc 726 38 ev and the fe 2 p1 2 peaks in xps spectrum of fe mn sbc as iii was at 727 29 ev besides of this the mn 2 p3 2 mn 2 p1 2 xps spectra of the fe mn sbc are almost the same and the peak positions of 642 18 ev and 653 38 ev shows the presence of mn4 zhang et al 2007 indicating the presence of mno2 these results suggested that some of fe2 in fe mn sbc was oxidized to fe3 by mno2 after the composite material was applied in as iii containing water treatment and the oxidation adsorption process had no effect on the mno2 properties in fe mn sbc according to the xps results of mn in fe mn sbc which was beneficial for the reuse in water treatment moreover the esr spin trapping technique was utilized to detect the radicals generating during the reaction between h2o2 with fe mn sbc as shown in fig 13 c results indicated that there is significant dmpo oh spin adducts and some unknown signal peaks of compounds detected in the pure h2o of fe mn sbc catalytic system revealing that oh radicals were generated in the oxidation adsorption process by fe mn sbc on as iii in the present of h2o2 besides it was well known that the o2 was unstable in aqueous solution and easily rapidly to be decomposed into oh since the reaction rate of dmpo with oh was much faster than that of o2 radicals yin et al 2009 hence the dmpo o2 peaks were difficult to be detected although it was truly formed in the catalytic reaction process dikalov et al 1999 in order to further investigated whether o2 was formed during the oxidation adsorption process of fe mn sbc on as iii with the existing of h2o2 c4h9oh instead of h2o was used to act as oh radicals quencher and slow down the vanishing rate of o2 radicals the results showed while fe mn sbc with h2o2 were reacted in the c4h9oh system there was no detectable dmpo o2 adducts in the fe mn sbc catalyzed h2o2 system huvaere et al 2010 it was suggested that oh radicals were primarily responsible for the as iii oxidation in the fe mn sbc h2o2 system and it was beneficial to both as iii oxidation and organic contaminants degradation 4 conclusion kmno4 fe ii was used to improve sludge dewatering performance and catalyze biomass pyrolysis for preparing multi functional fe mn sbc and then it was applied in the treatment of groundwater containing combined pollutants arsenic and noms the sludge dewaterability was efficiently enhanced because of the combination of oxidative properties of kmno4 and flocculation capacity of in situ formed fe iii the synthesized fe mn sbc particles from kmno4 fe ii conditioned sludge exhibited a great oxidation adsorption capacities on both of as iii and co existing humic acid ha removal from aqueous solution besides it was found that the addition of h2o2 could assist the as iii conversions during the oxidation process by mno2 while the as iii was depleted faster with the existing of h2o2 in the comparison of the system without h2o2 indicating that formed oh radicals could also contribute to the oxidative conversion of as iii to as v however the presence of ha could inhibit the hydroxy iron formation and compete the active adsorption sites and then resulted in the decreasing of arsenic removal but the co existing ha could also be synchronous removed therefore kmno4 fe ii provides a novel solution for sludge conditioning and fe mn sbc is also promising to treat the water subject to combined pollutants making it to be attractive for both sewage sludge and water treatment
