importance value sensitivity analysis climate change bootstrapping simulations 1 introduction estimating forest population dynamics is critical to forest management decision making peng 2000 in the past the application of models available to simulate forest dynamics has been constrained by observational data on forest change availability of computing capacity and supporting software mladenoff 2004 liang and picard 2013 risser and iverson 2013 nevertheless in recent years forest dynamics models had great improvements thanks to remarkable advances in multi source observational data modeling approaches and computing capacity shifley et al 2017 these advances made it possible to utilize big data to improve the model s performance matrix models are widely used to investigate forest population dynamics including three main factors tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment buongiorno and michie 1980 caswell 2001 natural disturbances and climate change are two major environmental factors to influence forest population dynamics encountered in matrix models liang et al 2011 liang and picard 2013 ma et al 2016 natural disturbances e g wildfires windstorm and insects and diseases affect the development of forest management practices and forest ecosystem restoration which have been addressed by stochastic elements foster 2000 zhou and buongiorno 2006 additionally climate change has also been explained by using climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation in the matrix models liang et al 2011 ma et al 2016 we also evaluated exiting models for the region such as traditonal climate sensitive matrix csmatrix and landis pro 7 0 against the random forests rf improved matrix model for benchmarking purposes in comparison to traditional multivariate regression models non parametric machine learning models are being increasingly used in modeling forest and other natural resources papale et al 2015 liang et al 2016 périé and de blois 2016 qu et al 2019 as one of the machine learning techniques rf can be applied to model the nonlinear relationship between a large amount of predicted variables and the response variable without statistical assumptions and predetermined mathematical formulas breiman 2001 due to its capability to handle a number of qualitative predictive variables or qualitative predictive variables with many levels and provide accurate and reliable predictions this data driven approach has been increasingly applied in forestry ecology and remote sensing such as individual tree growth models qu et al 2019

zhang et al 2019 and carbon and energy fluxes tramontana et al 2015 papale et al 2015 however the applications of rf in predicting forest population dynamics are still limited especially applying rf to improve the performance of the matrix models the central hardwood region chr consists of 58 million hactare of forests fig 1 chr covers three ecoregions including the historic great valley the blue ridge mountains and the ridges and valleys of the allegheny mountains bailey 2004 chr constitutes the most wide ranging temperate deciduous forest in the globe box and fujiwara 2015 and also one of the most diverse regions worldwide mueller 1996 chr is home to 90 of hardwoods and 33 of the forest growing stocks acorss the united states hicks 1998 known widely for its oak hickory forest resources chr is predicted to undergo a fundamental species shift from oak domination to maple dominaiton with a substantial decrease in basal area due to climate change and a change in fire regimes ma et al 2016 in addition the chr is also ideal for examining climate change impacts on forest composition and structure changes given the abundant forest cover in these areas and the wide range of climatic conditions the goal of this study is to use rf to estimate tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment and consequently predict forest population dynamics under climate change across the chr in the united states the specific objectives are 1 to compare and evaluate the short term performance of the rf improved matrix rfmatrix models agasint two existing models namely csmatrix models

calibration from the forest inventory and analysis database sharon et al 2011 additional 1107 psp s were randomly selected to evaluate model accuracy for validation purposes physical site characteristics recorded for each plot include geographic coordinates elevation slope and aspect characteristics recorded for each tree include species diameter and status recruitment live or dead white oak quercus alba northern red oak quercus rubra black oak quercus velutina pignut hickory carya glabra sugar maple acer saccharum and red maple acer rubrum were the dominant tree species across the chr because of computational constraints all tree species were classified as seven species groups for simplicity quercus quercus qq quercus lobatae ql juglandaceae jd sapindaceae sd gymnosperms gs fagus fg and other angiosperms oa supplemental information table s1 except for the first class and the last class all trees were sorted into seventeen diameter at breast height dbh classes of five cm increments in each species group detailed information about plot and tree characterizations in the chr can be found in ma et al 2016 2 2 climatic soil and anthropogenic data to explain abiotic factors that may affect tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment 31 geospatial covariates were assembled from multiple datasets table 1 these covariates derived from satellite based remote sensing image can be sorted into three categories climatic soil and anthropogenic table 1 all the covariates were preprocessed using arcmap 10 3 esri 2014 and r 2 15 3 r core team 2013 spatially

explain the climate variability liang et al 2011 ma et al 2016 ma and zhou 2017 ma et al 2019a g and r are improved to be functions of climatic variables including temperature t and precipitation p therefore eq 1 is extended to account for climate sensitivity through recognizing the influences of temperature t and precipitation p on tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment as follows 2 y t 1 g t t p y t r t t p ε for the csmatrix models the interval between t and t 1 of eq 2 is one year the detailed structures of matrix models are described in the supplemental information based on the csmatrix models we developed rf integrated matrix models rfmatrix to project the forest population dynamics under changing climate including three main components tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment the rf was applied for regression prediction of tree diameter growth rate tree mortality rate and stand recruitment as regression trees each regression tree of rf was constructed by drawing bootstrap sample of the original calibration and validation datasets with replacement in this study approximately 90 of the original datasets was included in the sample when a bootstrap sample was drawn the rf prediction is estimated from the averaged prediction over all trees that generate an independent model in parallel in addition rf provides variable importance values which represent the mean contribution of a variable to the response variable adam et al 2014 variable importance values were calculated based on how much the accuracy decreased when a variable was excluded and alternatively the decrease of gini impurity when a variable was chosen to split a node louppe et al 2013 the rf modeling was implemented by the package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 in r 2 15 3 r core team 2013 two tuning parameters were required to make choices ntree and mtry freeman et al 2016 in which the ntree represents the number of trees to grow and governs the total number of independent trees the mtry represents the number of predictive variables and controls the correlations between trees rf is insensitive to noise in the data and does not increase generalization error when more trees are added to the model when trees are added to the rf the tendency to overfitting should decrease breiman 2001 accuracy of the simulation models was firstly tested through short term basal area prediction error of the validation plots which was defined as the difference between the predicted and the observed stand basal area at the second inventory stand basal area predicted by the rf matrix models were further compared with the predicted values by the csmatrix model and landis pro 7 0 for each model we computed the coefficient of determination r2 to show the weight of the variance regarding the dependent variable that was contributed by the independent variables in addition we also calculated mean absolute error mae and root mean squared errors rmse which were defined as the difference between the observed and predicted basal area by diameter class and species 3 results based on the short term prediction with randomly selected 1 107 validation plots stand basal area predicted by the rfmatrix model csmatrix model and landis pro 7 0 were compared with observed basal area by species group fig 2 compared with the csmatrix model and landis pro 7 0 rfmatrix model had 5 1 27 9 and 29 4 110 8 higher r2 17 3 36 9 and 46 1 57 2 lower mae respectively for all species groups fig 2 furthermore predicted basal area by the rfmatrix model all located in the 95 confidence interval of the observed basal area in the 119 species size classes fig 3 rfmatrix model would have 39 6 48 9 lower rmse than the csmatrix model and landis pro 7 0 would have the worst short term accuracy with 143 4 462 1 higher rmse than the rfmatrix model for all species groups fig 3 when climate change was considered in the models based on 1 000 bootstrapping simulations the predicted total stand basal area increased over time and may converge to 35 8 39 0 and 42 8 45 9 m2 ha 1 using rfmatrix model and csmatrix model respectively under the four climate scenarios the current average total stand basal area would increase by 23 0 34 0 to 6 7 9 9 m2 ha 1 by 2100 given climate predictions using rfmatrix model in all climate scenarios changing climate would raise the total stand basal area while the influence seems to be limited using the csmatrix model fig 4 nevertheless climate change would substantially reduce the total stand basal area using rfmatrix model compared with predicted stand basal area by the constant climate matrix model fig 4 importance values of all predicted variables for tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment of all species groups determined by the rf were presented in figs 5 7 for each species group the rfmatrix model indicated that the variability in tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment was mainly explained by tree and stand factors followed by climate factors and anthropogenic factors soil factors contributed the least importance values in all models across all species groups among all 41 predicted variables diameter at the breast height d stand basal area b tree size diversity hd tree species diversity hs plot elevation e percent crown cover fc annual mean temperature t and annual average monthly precipitation p were the most frequently shown variables in the six most important predictors for the diameter growth and mortality of all species groups figs 5 6 regarding the recruitment of all species groups the six most important predictors were stand basal area b number of trees n tree size diversity hd tree species diversity hs annual mean temperature t and annual average monthly precipitation p fig 7 among all the predictors six most important variables with the six highest importance values were selected as control variables to make sensitivity analysis of tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment across all species groups using rf figs 8 10 for tree diameter growth of all species groups larger trees grew substantially faster nevertheless higher stand basal area b tree size diversity hd tree species diversity hs elevation e and percent crown cover fc declined tree diameter growth for all species groups in most cases fig 8 temperature and precipitation had mix effects on tree diameter growth for tree mortality of all species groups except for fg tree mortality rate decreased with diameter at the breast height d stand basal area b tree size diversity hd tree species diversity hs annual mean temperature t and annual average monthly precipitation p additionally the recruitment of a species group increased significantly with the density n of the species group larger stand basal area b tree size diversity hd and tree species diversity hs decreased the recruitment of qq and ql the rest variables had mix effects on stand recruitment 4 discussion most prior studies of forest dynamic estimation were based on classical statistical regression approaches e g multiple regression buongiorno and michie 1980 nevertheless the traditional regression methods could not sufficiently explain the relationship between them as there is a complex relationship between forest dynamics and predicted variables one of the machine learning algorithms rf could be applied to devalop a deep non linear relationship between forest dynamics and simulation data which can flexibly combine different data sources to improve the accuracy of the prediction ali et al 2015 in this study we have 41 predicted variables from multiple data sources including forest measurement data and remotly sensed data and found that rf could prevent overfitting and significantly improve the estimation accuracy compared with the traditional csmatrix model and landis pro 7 0 in comparison to the traditional csmatrix model which requires statistical assumptions and predetermined mathematical formulas the rfmatrix model displayed higher accuracy because rf was able to capture the more complex relationship between multiple explanatory variables and response variables in contrast landis pro 7 0 combines size and stand density for species by age group without considering climatic factors in the tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand establishment and therefore overestimated the basal area in the short term predictions as the first matrix model improved by rf rfmatrix model was developed to estimate tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment and consequently project forest population dynamics across the chr additionally the prediction results revealed that rfmatrix model had an excellent performance in stand basal area estimation rf is a remarkable non parametric method with the following advantages higher accuracy variable importance evaluation fewer parameters robustness to reduce overfitting only requiring a relatively small number of samples low computational cost and lower sensitivity breiman 2001 a single decision tree tends to have the problem of overfitting in rf averaging the prediction from different decision trees tends to overcome the problem of overfitting in addition compared with a single decision tree rf has less variance the rfmatrix model showed the importance values of all predictors for tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment across all species and efficiently selected the most important predicted variables not surprisingly stand factors including diameter at the breast height d stand basal area b number of trees n tree size diversity hd tree species diversity hs had higher importance values to influence tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment of all species this result is consistent with prior studies in this region brooks and miller 2011 brooks 2012 ma et al 2016 ma and zhou 2017 except for stand factors climate factors had substantial effects on tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment for most species based on importance values which is consistent with the finding in liang et al 2011 in addition other variables such as elevation e percent crown cover fc human footprint h1 and temperature seasonality c4 also had a certain degree of effects on forest dynamics for this study area based on sensitivity analysis using rf we revealed the relationship between six most important predictors and response variables including tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment which in turn makes it possible to more directly evaluate the negative or positive effects of each predicted variable on three main components of forest dynamics modeling forest dynamics is essential to forest management and development of forest dynamic models has become increasingly critical to aid forest management decision making shifley et al 2017 therefore the rfmatrix models would also be useful to study optimal yields and tradeoffs between different ecological and economic objectives and consequently benefit forest management decisions making in the future additionally the developed rfmatrix model is a type of non parametric machine learning models that could highly increase simulation accuracy and are also no longer necessary to rely on certain functional forms to model tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment and thus could be applied to enhance forest management most recently machine learning models have also been applied to classify tree canopy cover macmichael and si 2017 2018 helping to address current forest management challenges it is of risk to make long term projections based on short term measurement data although this is a widespread implementation of forest dynamics models monserud 2003 in this study the long term simulation was conducted to minimize the risk by the ways of 1 year iteration as long as the tree and stand anthropogenic and soil factors will not differ substantially from the observed data in the future simulation period the prediction errors should be constrained at an appropriate level across all the 1 year iterations similar to all empirical models the rfmatrix model owns its limitation and projection results should be explained in an acceptable context like the csmatrix model our rfmatrix model was developed in the deterministic environment and simulation did not explain natural disturbances such as wildfire windstorm or insect and disease therefore the projected forest population dynamics should be referred to as a baseline of undisturbed forest succession under climate change for this reason further research to account for the influences of natural disturbances would be more feasible to project future central hardwood forests 5 conclusion climate sensitive matrix models improved by rf were developed to predict forest population dynamics of the chr under climate change the rfmatrix models were calibrated from extensive psp s using substantial predicted variables with a broad range of forest and environmental conditions across the chr from the validation results the rfmatrix models were more accurate than the csmatrix models and landis pro 7 0 the short and long term stand basal area subject to climate change were predicted by the rfmatrix model using 41 predicted variables extracting from stand climatic anthropogenic and soil factors variability in tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment was mainly explained by stand factors followed by climatic anthropogenic and soil factors climate change may substantially decrease the total stand basal area compared with predicted total stand basal area by the constant climate matrix model at the year 2100 the simulation results estimated by the deterministic rfmatrix model offered a baseline of predicting forest dynamics subject to changing climate and provided a critical foundation for the development of stochastic

effects on stand recruitment 4 discussion most prior studies of forest dynamic estimation were based on classical statistical regression approaches e g multiple regression buongiorno and michie 1980 nevertheless the traditional regression methods could not sufficiently explain the relationship between them as there is a complex relationship between forest dynamics and predicted variables one of the machine learning algorithms rf could be applied to devalop a deep non linear relationship between forest dynamics and simulation data which can flexibly combine different data sources to improve the accuracy of the prediction ali et al 2015 in this study we have 41 predicted variables from multiple data sources including forest measurement data and remotly sensed data and found that rf could prevent overfitting and significantly improve the estimation accuracy compared with the traditional csmatrix model and landis pro 7 0 in comparison to the traditional csmatrix model which requires statistical assumptions and predetermined mathematical formulas the rfmatrix model displayed higher accuracy because rf was able to capture the more complex relationship between multiple explanatory variables and response variables in contrast landis pro 7 0 combines size and stand density for species by age group without considering climatic factors in the tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand establishment and therefore overestimated the basal area in the short term predictions as the first matrix model improved by rf rfmatrix model was developed to estimate tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment and consequently project forest population dynamics across the chr additionally the prediction results revealed that rfmatrix model had an excellent performance in stand basal area estimation rf is a remarkable non parametric method with the following advantages higher accuracy variable importance evaluation fewer parameters robustness to reduce overfitting only requiring a relatively small number of samples low computational cost and lower sensitivity breiman 2001 a single decision tree tends to have the problem of overfitting in rf averaging the prediction from different decision trees tends to overcome the problem of overfitting in addition compared with a single decision tree rf has less variance the rfmatrix model showed the importance values of all predictors for tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment across all species and efficiently selected the most important predicted variables not surprisingly stand factors including diameter at the breast height d stand basal area b number of trees n tree size diversity hd tree species diversity hs had higher importance values to influence tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment of all species this result is consistent with prior studies in this region brooks and miller 2011 brooks 2012 ma et al 2016 ma and zhou 2017 except for stand factors climate factors had substantial effects on tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment for most species based on importance values which is consistent with the finding in liang et al 2011 in addition other variables such as elevation e percent crown cover fc human footprint h1 and temperature seasonality c4 also had a certain degree of effects on forest dynamics for this study area based on sensitivity analysis using rf we revealed the relationship between six most important predictors and response variables including tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment which in turn makes it possible to more directly evaluate the negative or positive effects of each predicted variable on three main components of forest dynamics modeling forest dynamics is essential to forest management and development of forest dynamic models has become increasingly critical to aid forest management decision making shifley et al 2017 therefore the rfmatrix models would also be useful to study optimal yields and tradeoffs between different ecological and economic objectives and consequently benefit forest management decisions making in the future additionally the developed rfmatrix model is a type of non parametric machine learning models that could highly increase simulation accuracy and are also no longer necessary to rely on certain functional forms to model tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment and thus could be applied to enhance forest management most recently machine learning models have also been applied to classify tree canopy cover macmichael and si 2017 2018 helping to address current forest management challenges it is of risk to make long term projections based on short term measurement data although this is a widespread implementation of forest dynamics models monserud 2003 in this study the long term simulation was conducted to minimize the risk by the ways of 1 year iteration as long as the tree and stand anthropogenic and soil factors will not differ substantially from the observed data in the future simulation period the prediction errors should be constrained at an appropriate level across all the 1 year iterations similar to all empirical models the rfmatrix model owns its limitation and projection results should be explained in an acceptable context like the csmatrix model our rfmatrix model was developed in the deterministic environment and simulation did not explain natural disturbances such as wildfire windstorm or insect and disease therefore the projected forest population dynamics should be referred to as a baseline of undisturbed forest succession under climate change for this reason further research to account for the influences of natural disturbances would be more feasible to project future central hardwood forests 5 conclusion climate sensitive matrix models improved by rf were developed to predict forest population dynamics of the chr under climate change the rfmatrix models were calibrated from extensive psp s using substantial predicted variables with a broad range of forest and environmental conditions across the chr from the validation results the rfmatrix models were more accurate than the csmatrix models and landis pro 7 0 the short and long term stand basal area subject to climate change were predicted by the rfmatrix model using 41 predicted variables extracting from stand climatic anthropogenic and soil factors variability in tree diameter growth tree mortality and stand recruitment was mainly explained by stand factors followed by climatic anthropogenic and soil factors climate change may substantially decrease the total stand basal area compared with predicted total stand basal area by the constant climate matrix model at the year 2100 the simulation results estimated by the deterministic rfmatrix model offered a baseline of predicting forest dynamics subject to changing climate and provided a critical foundation for the development of stochastic

24901,simulating of suitable habitat for the common reed phragmites australis can provide theoretical support for water resources managing of shallow lakes earlier research has focused on statistical models of shallow lakes and process based dynamic models for coastal wetlands however process based dynamic modeling for shallow lakes remains relatively incomplete and the loss of biomass in unsuitable situations is seldom considered this study established an occupied habitat model by coupling a cellular automaton with a modified logistic function the cellular automaton was used to simulate the spatial diffusion of the reed the logistic function was used to simulate the accumulation of biomass over time and modified with the loss of biomass in unsuitable habitats both reed distribution and dynamic variations in reed growth can be simulated by this model water level was considered the most important factor in reed growth in baiyangdian lake china the growing season is from april to october the suitable habitat area sha and aboveground biomass agb of reeds were simulated using data from actual hydrological processes and hypothetical scenarios element contents and water consumption by transpiration were estimated on the basis of the agb data the results are as follows 1 water level changes affected the habitat of the common reed the sha increased slightly from 6 0 m and then decreased with rising water level reaching its maximum value at 6 7 m of the 90 guarantee rate water level sha declined rapidly when the water level was higher than 7 5 m 2 when the water level was maintained at 6 3 7 3 m the water consumption for transpiration per unit agb was lower than that for other water levels 3 to maintain a higher water level for a suitable reed habitat area and to reduce water consumption per unit biomass transpiration a reference value of 6 7 m can be regarded as the lowest ecological water level in baiyangdian lake keywords suitable habitat simulation common reed cellular automaton modified logistic function 1 introduction shallow lake is a typical wetland type and provides important ecosystem functions and services yang et al 2016 the common reed phragmites australis a typical emergent macrophyte in many shallow lakes provides valuable habitat for many wetland animals dai et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 because the common reed is highly fertile and adaptable it often becomes the dominant wetland plant species in shallow lakes therefore the scale of the common reed population has a great impact on the shallow lake wetland ecosystem gusewell and nedic 2000 however human activities commonly surround lakes inducing severe environmental disruption and ecological degradation in recent years loss of suitable habitat for the common reed has become a global ecological problem geist 2011 chambers et al 2008 effective prediction and simulation of suitable habitat for the common reed are first required to protect the ecological functions of shallow lakes austin 2002 researchers and managers of shallow lakes are motivated to find effective models and methods to simulate suitable habitat for the common reed in these ecosystems sasaki et al 2015 current research suggests that simulation of suitable habitat for the common reed should be based on ecological processes and the factors influencing those processes wang et al 1999 wolfer et al 2006 altartouri et al 2015 the common reed is involved in the production accumulation and decomposition of organic matter as the organic matter process is the basis of the other ecological processes the common reed as the primary producer is in a dominant position primary producers generate organic matter which is needed for the formation of biomass reader and wilson 1994 the rate at which the organic matter is decomposed determines the organic matter accumulation process stumpf 1983 in wetlands these ecological processes are influenced by physical and chemical processes wolfer et al 2006 water depth is the most important hydrological factor affecting the growth and development of emergent macrophytes zhang et al 2014 water depth and soil moisture are key drivers for biotic characteristics such as biomass plant height diameter and coverage of common reeds li et al 2015 clevering 1998 found that the relative growth rate rgr of common reeds growing in 12 cm deep water is higher than that of dryland common reeds vretare et al 2001 confirmed that the rgr of common reeds in shallow water 5 20 cm was significantly higher than that of common reeds in deep water 70 75 cm salinity is another major factor affecting the growth and distribution of common reeds especially in coastal wetlands he et al 2007 the population characteristics individual appearance and physiological activities of common reeds will vary with the water content and salinity gradient deng et al 2012 accordingly common reeds can adapt to water and salt stress through different strategies as well as water level changes through biomass allocation and rhizome extension cui et al 2006 they can also control the photosynthesis rate by regulating their stomatal openings to alleviate salt stress liu and zou 2014 therefore water and salinity are two major factors affecting habitat suitability for the common reed and they should be fully considered in simulations of suitable habitat for the common reed and the management of shallow lakes targeted at this species several methods and models have been developed to simulate a suitable common reed habitat ye et al 2013 yi et al 2016 qi 2018 the habitat suitability index is one of the most widely used habitat quality evaluation indices habitat suitability modeling which is based on the habitat suitability index involves an evaluation method for habitat suitability and the selection of key environmental factors yi et al 2016 in the past establishing the relationship between species and environmental factors relied strongly on expert experience and was highly subjective many habitat evaluation methods based on statistics and machine learning have since been developed gieswein et al 2017 son et al 2018 including generalized linear models rijt et al 1996 generalized additive models swartzman et al 1995 fuzzy logic adriaenssens et al 2006 artificial neural networks olden and jackson 2001 and decision trees rejwan et al 1999 the statistical models used in habitat simulations of the common reed simplify the simulation problem by establishing a statistical relationship between specific species and key environmental factors but they do not reflect dynamic biological and environmental processes or provide insight into mechanisms ye et al 2013 the process based dynamic model takes into account the interactions and feedback mechanisms between organisms and the environment the process based dynamic model can include continuous environmental dynamic processes and the temporal and spatial evolution of the common reed a cellular automaton is a process based dynamic system model which can well interpret the spatial effects of population dynamics for example in research on estuarine wetlands cas are widely used in simulations of wetland plant populations and habitat characteristics in one study on estuarine wetlands plant growth characteristics were introduced as parameters into the spatial structures of ca and the spatial distribution patterns and biomass accumulation processes of plants were simulated wortmann et al 1998 in a study on the riparian zone a plant growth model based on an unstructured ca coupled with a hydrodynamic module was developed to simulate the response of three riparian zone plants to water depth and velocity stress after changes in the hydrological regime ye et al 2013 in the yellow river delta wetland cas were applied to simulate the diffusion and distribution of three competing species under the influence of water and salt gradients qi 2018 thus cas have been widely used in simulations of plant growth and diffusion and in simulations of suitable habitat for the common reed there are few reports however of habitat suitability simulations based on ca for the common reed in shallow lakes shallow lakes with common reed growth are usually freshwater lakes li et al 2004 whichexhibit small fluctuations in water level and contain extremely low salt thus in these shallow lakes the effect of salt content on the common reed can be ignored a ca model for coastal wetlands is clearly unsuitable for shallow lakes and the current ca based habitat suitability model does not incorporate loss of biomass in unsuitable habitats the present study used a process based dynamic model to simulate the suitable habitat for common reed in shallow lakes based on a coupled ca and modified logistic function the simulation model was employed to evaluate the effects of water level changes on habitat suitable for the common reed baiyangdian lake hebei province china a shallow lake in the north china plain was taken as our case study the aim of this study was to answer the following questions 1 how do water level fluctuations affect the suitability of common reed habitat in shallow lakes 2 what is the most suitable ecological water level of baiyangdian lake to balance the common reed habitat area and the water area 3 what could shallow lake management agencies do to protect common reed habitat 2 model establishment 2 1 field measurement the common reed is widely distributed in baiyangdian lake hebei china with a growing season from april to october in july 2018 we measured the elevation of each sampling point the relative elevation between the sampling points and the lake surface was measured using a steel ruler the elevation of the lake surface on the sampling day was obtained from the monitoring data of the renqiu water authority water depth was considered to be the gap between the elevation of the water surface and the elevation of the sampling points the zero datum was set with a water depth of 0 m at an elevation of 7 94 m representing the water surface elevation of the lake on the sampling day according to the water surface elevation of baiyangdian lake on the sampling day the sampling point elevation was inversely calculated the suitable water depth range for the common reed was set as 2 to 1 5 m and the maximum common reed biomass at the end of october was approximately 3300 g m2 han 2016 zhao 2012 a negative water depth indicates that the water level is higher than the base surface in july 2018 the growth characteristics of common reeds in different water depths were measured table 1 the largest biomass was found in samples obtained from a water depth of 115 cm followed by samples from a water depth of 70 cm the optimal water depth can be assumed to be between these two depths previous research on the optimal water depth for common reeds in baiyangdian lake also showed that the optimal water depth is 77 3 9 7 cm and the model s optimal water depth was set to 80 cm zhao 2012 we thus conclude that the optimal water depth for common reeds in this lake is 80 cm the lake area was divided into 842 1443 cells in a 30 m 30 m grid spatial elevation data were obtained by inverse distance weighted idw interpolation of the measured data fig 1 the idw interpolation was necessary to calculate the distance between all the discrete data points and the grid points in two dimensional space the distance di from the sample point xi yi to the interpolation point x y is d i x x i 2 y y i 2 the idw interpolation was then applied to determine the distance of all sample points closest to the interpolation points then the estimated value on the interpolation points is z x y i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p where zi is the observed elevation on the sample point z x y is the estimated elevation on the interpolation point n is the number of sample points involved in the calculation taken as 10 in this study di is the distance between the interpolation point and the sample point and p is the coefficient generally taken as 2 a ca approach was then adopted to build a model consisting of a square lattice in which each cell represents a 30 m 30 m common reed patch 2 2 cellular automaton model the germination rate of common reed seeds is extremely low under natural conditions so common reeds mainly propagate clonally through underground stems the underground stems produce three kinds of bud axillary shoot rhizome and apical rhizome of these only axillary shoot buds and apical rhizome buds can produce daughter shoots successfully zhang et al 2014 apical rhizome buds may play the most important role in the spatial spread of the common reed population the number of buds and the emergence ratio of the rhizome are affected by the growth state of the plant and the environmental conditions baiyangdian lake is a freshwater lake and thus we simplified the situation as follows water depth was regarded as the only environmental factor affecting the spatial spread and biomass accumulation of common reeds the number of buds produced and the probability of bud emergence are both related to water depth the moore neighbor type eight neighborhoods eight directions was chosen such that the underground stems can randomly extend in eight directions with equal probability fig 2 thus when a cell is empty the probability of generating new common reed plants in the next time interval if the water depth is appropriate is p i 1 8 n i r 8 where ni is the number of buds produced by the i th neighborhood cell and r is the emergence rate of the central cell according to control experiments in a dry environment field water retention rate the water content of soil maintained after two days of irrigation 50 55 and a shallow flooded environment water depth 3 5 cm the mean numbers of underground buds produced by adult individuals were 2 6 and 3 5 respectively and the mean numbers of emergences were 0 6 and 2 2 respectively zhang and zhang 2015 the results of the soil moisture content survey are provided in table 1 and the range of water depth was 2 0 1 5 m we simplified the number of buds and emergence ratio percentage of seeds emerging in total seeds on the basis of water depth the number of buds produced by an adult under optimal conditions 0 8 0 2 m was 4 and the emergence ratio was 0 63 whereas for the remaining water depth ranges 2 0 0 8 m and 0 2 1 5 m the number of buds produced was 3 and the emergence ratio was 0 23 the water depth affecting the number of buds and emergence ratio of common reeds was calculated as the average water depth in the last non growth season the evolutionary rules for the ca can be summarized as follows 1 if the water depth in a common reed containing cell is suitable in the current time interval the common reed will persist to the next time interval 2 if the water depth in a common reed containing cell is not suitable the common reed will die at the end of the current time interval 3 if the biomass in a cell with common reeds is reduced to zero in one time interval then the plants die at the same time and 4 in a cell that has no common reed plants in the current time interval if the water depth is suitable in the next time interval there is a probability of p that the cell will generate a new plant otherwise the cell remains empty 2 3 modified logistic model the logistic function can be used to simulate plant growth under conditions without external disturbances such as human disturbance and climate change the modified logistic function is loaded into the ca grid after being discretized in time the modified logistic function adds a term for biomass loss caused by the water flooding on the basis of the original function the function matches the process of plant biomass accumulation that is the slope of the curve first increases and then decreases 1 y t k 1 a e b t where y is biomass k is carrying capacity a is a dimensionless variable related to y 0 and k t is time and b is the intrinsic rate of increase the actual growth rate can be derived by taking the derivative of eq 1 2 d d t y t b y t 1 y t k coops et al 2004 conducted field manipulation experiments on emergent plant species especially common reeds to develop a model based on the logistic function to predict common reed development the function is given below 3 d r d t r r 1 r k l d p d p h d p where r is the biomass g dw m2 r is the intrinsic growth rate the unit is related to the time step k is the carrying capacity g dw m2 l is the maximum biomass loss related to the water depth g dw m2 d d is water depth m hd is the semi biomass loss corresponding to the submerged depth m and p is the parameter in the hill equation coops et al 2004 zhao 2012 affecting the shape of the curve described by the equation eq 4 considers the effect of water inundation on the growth of emergent plants which is represented by the hill function if the most suitable water depth for common reed growth is dm which corresponds to zero biomass loss then the equation can be modified and discretized into 4 δ r i r i r i 1 1 r i 1 k δ t l d i d m p d i d m p h d p δ t δ l i δ h i where r is the intrinsic growth rate δt is the calculation period such as one month δri is the aboveground biomass increase of common reeds in the i th month of a growing season g dw m2 ri 1 is the aboveground biomass at the end of the i 1 th month di is the mean water depth in the i th month dm is the optimal water depth and δli and δhi are the biomass increases in the i th month expressed by the original logistic function and the hill function respectively 2 4 model coupling the coupling of the ca and the improved logistic function can simulate the dynamic process of common reed spread and growth it was assumed that the common reed plants complete their spatial propagation at the beginning of the growing season and then only increase biomass during the growing season the biomass growth process was simplified as follows all individuals began to grow at the beginning of the growing season and the biomass altered to the initial value of the next year after the end of the growing season the initial values were related to the water depth of the same year the time step of the common reed habitat simulation was set to one month because that was the time scale at which water level data were available 2 5 model parameter calibration calibration was performed by simulating the spatial distribution and biomass growth of common reeds in 2018 the data preparation included the monthly mean water level and the elevation of baiyangdian lake the parameters in the improved logistic function were obtained from previous studies zhao 2012 han 2016 all parameters were constants except l and p which had the ranges shown in table 2 the initial settings of l and p in the model were 150 and 4 respectively the model predictions were verified using the measured data for july 2018 fig 3 a for which r2 0 905 and the root mean square error rmse 303 g m2 the predicted values were higher at water depths of 200 and 180 cm and lower at the remaining water depths rmse was calculated for different values of l 120 130 140 150 160 and 170 and p 2 4 and 6 the best prediction was that with minimum rmse which was at values of l 130 g m2 month and p 4 fig 3b 2 6 estimation of transpiration water consumption and element contents past studies have addressed the role of common reeds in water consumption and elemental circulation in baiyangdian lake li et al 2015 han 2016 some previous field measurements have begun to play a role in the evapotranspiration rate zhao 2012 and elemental levels han 2016 of the common reed community in baiyangdian lake the simulation results of common reed distribution area and biomass can be further combined with existing measurements such as estimations of the total water consumption for evapotranspiration and element contents of common reeds monthly field measurements showed that the transpiration of common reed populations with coverages of 100 80 60 40 and 20 accounted for 91 7 86 9 77 4 67 5 and 49 4 of the total evapotranspiration during the growing season respectively as the coverage decreased the proportion of transpiration in evapotranspiration decreased the highest transpiration rate accounted for 97 1 of the total evapotranspiration rate transpiration was dominant in evapotranspiration fig 4 a thus soil evaporation was negligible and only transpiration was considered in the estimation of water consumption in addition variations in transpiration under different water depth conditions were not disregarded for element contents the total carbon tc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp contents of individual common reeds varied among different months tc contents were highest at the end of the growing season whereas tn and tp contents peaked in june and may respectively fig 4b 3 results 3 1 effect of water level on common reed habitat 3 1 1 effect within a growing season a stable distribution simulation state was generated by running the ca model with initial 20 random coverage after approximately 10 years the habitat distribution reached a steady state as an initial condition for biomass growth simulation fig 5 as for 2018 suitable habitat distribution became stable in the tenth year which was used as the initial condition for the biomass growth simulation biomass growth simulation yielded the results that average habitat area of the growing season was 1 93 108 m2 and total biomass at the end of the growing season was 42 04 1010 g with the highest density being 3272 g m2 fig 6 total biomass of common reeds at the end of october increased to 7 6 times that at the end of april with the fastest increase occurring in july fig 7 a as the area declined the suitable habitats became more fragmented for transpiration water consumption twc the total water consumption for the growing season calculated for monthly biomass development was 4 96 108 m3 of which the water consumption in july accounted for 34 2 fig 7b for element contents tc increased month by month with the largest monthly increases in july and then june in contrast the accumulations of tn and tp initially increased and then decreased peaking in august fig 7c by the end of the growing season tc tn and tp levels were 21 60 1010 g 5 25 109 g and 1 26 108 g respectively the decrease in tn and tp at the end of the growing season may have been caused by transfer of biomass and nutrients from the aboveground to the underground parts of the common reeds 3 1 2 inter annual effects the monthly water level for 2000 2010 was inputted to predict the habitat distribution and biomass growth of common reed the initial habitat of common reed was simulated with the mean monthly water level 6 80 m and 20 uniform distribution years 2000 2010 as the initial conditions after 15 years the habitat distribution of common reed reached a stable area of 185 959 cells taking this distribution as the initial state the growth and distribution changes of common reed in 2000 2010 were simulated the simulation results showed that the suitable habitat area and total biomass exhibited both inter annual and intra annual variations with changes in water depth the largest habitat area occurred in april 2004 1 93 108 m2 whereas the smallest was in october 2005 1 44 108 m2 the largest mean monthly habitat area occurred in 2003 and the smallest in 2006 fig 8 a the highest total biomass by the end of the growing season occurred in 2003 51 2 1010 g and the lowest in 2005 35 2 1010 g which was 69 of the value for 2004 fig 8b the highest total transpiration water consumption 5 25 108 m3 was in 2002 and the lowest was in 2005 3 46 108 m3 the transpiration water consumption was highest in july accounting for more than 30 of the total transpiration water in the growing season fig 8c the change in tc levels was basically consistent with changes in biomass with total carbon levels accounting for approximately 50 of total biomass at the end of the growing season fig 8d the maximum tn and tp levels occurred in august or september in august 2002 tn and tp levels reached their maximum values of 7 61 109 g and 4 25 108 g respectively fig 8e f the average tc tn and tp levels at the end of each growing season were 2 32 1011 g 5 63 109 g and 1 35 108 g respectively and the average total water consumption was 44 15 107 m³ when the water level reached a maximum value the area and biomass often exhibited a minimum value the trends in biomass and density were consistent in 2005 the area and total biomass were lowest at the end of october the end of growth in that year the water level reached a maximum value 7 53 m and the suitable habitat area of common reeds decreased large increases in water depth also resulted in large biomass losses 3 2 ecological water level in baiyangdian lake the water level of baiyangdian lake has declined rapidly since the 1960s and was especially low after 2000 it is therefore necessary to study the distribution of suitable common reed habitats in the lake under a wide range of water levels the minimum annual average water level was 6 12 m 2002 and the maximum was 9 49 m 1956 thus in the water level range 6 1 9 5 m 18 water level scenarios were set up at 0 2 m intervals to carry out the habitat simulation for common reed the area and biomass of the common reeds were obtained after a stable solution had been reached the results showed that as the water level increased the habitat area and biomass underwent a small increase and then a rapid decrease when the water level was approximately 6 7 m common reed area and biomass reached their maximum values when the water level was between 6 3 and 7 1 m the suitable habitat area and total biomass of the common reed was maintained at more than 95 of the maximum value the area declined fastest in the 8 5 8 7 m range whereas the biomass declined fastest in the 7 5 7 7 m range fig 9 a from the simulation results the transpiration water consumption and element contents of common reed communities were calculated and the changes in and correlations between transpiration water consumption and element enrichment of common reeds at different water levels were obtained linear correlations were present between transpiration water consumption and the tc tn and tp contents and an inflection point divided the fitted lines into two segments the upper segment had a smaller slope with a water depth range of 6 3 7 3 m this indicates that the common reed community consumed less transpiration water with increases in tc tn and tp levels at water levels of 6 3 7 3 m than in other scenarios the water level corresponding to the point on the right side of the inflection point was 6 3 7 3 m in this water level interval common reeds produced more total biomass and displayed higher utilization of transpiration water fig 9b d 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms for water level driven habitat changes the influence of lake water level fluctuations operates over a wide range from small individual plants to large population and community distribution hill et al 1998 but the influence varies from species to species cooke et al 1993 the lake water level fluctuations have two main types of effect 1 direct effects on the growth of aquatic organisms and competition between species tenna and ian 2002 and 2 indirect effects caused by changes in water physical and chemical conditions such as transparency turbidity salinity ph suspended substances and dissolved oxygen these then affect the growth of aquatic organisms and competition between species limno tech inc lti and slivitzky 2002 water level fluctuations affect organisms that feed on aquatic vegetation indirectly reducing or increasing the pressure on aquatic vegetation geraldes and boavida 2005 this changes the spatial and temporal distribution of aquatic vegetation zalocar 2003 carvalho et al 2003 kisand and nõges 2004 the main mechanism is therefore likely to be the influence of water level fluctuations on the suitability of the ecosystem for the plant physiology in our study we simulated the habitat annually and inter annually quantifying the habitat area and biomass different rules for water level fluctuations can significantly affect the habitat area and biomass of common reeds the results of this study show that the coupled model can well reflect the influencing mechanism of water level fluctuations on the growth diffusion and loss of common reeds the water level its fluctuation range frequency occurrence time duration and regularity are the core factors affecting the aquatic vegetation of lakes keddy 1983 1986 toner and keddy 1997 variations in water level have different effects on the habitat of aquatic vegetation habitat at different time scales including short term intra annual and inter annual variations liu et al 2006 short term water level fluctuations exert indirect effects on the physical and chemical properties of lake water and sediment zhang et al 2003 2004 scott and paul 1985 in our study we did not validate and quantify these indirect effects because of the time interval used in the simulations intra annual and inter annual periodic changes in water level are mainly reflected in the following aspects different aquatic plants have different degrees of adaptability to intra annual and inter annual changes in water level so changes in water level can affect the ecological suitability of aquatic vegetation and consequently alter the spatial and temporal distribution of the vegetation van geest et al 2005a b previous research mainly applied qualitative analysis and simple statistical methods whereas our model improves quantitative modeling some previous studies have also pointed out that there has been little progress in the study of water stress of aquatic vegetation andrew and robert 1999 and not enough attention has been paid to important species naiman et al 1993 our study took the dominant species the common reed in baiyangdian lake as the research subject and fully considered the influence of water stress on the habitat extent of the common reed and biomass increases in the coupled model our study therefore has value as a reference for habitat simulation research on key plants in other shallow lakes and management of shallow lakes 4 2 implications for shallow lake common reed habitat management the habitat of the common reed is affected by water level fluctuations irregularities in water level are likely to result in negative consequences particularly if the water level is unusually high or low for a long period of time van geest et al 2005a b in particular artificially controlling water levels to meet human needs such as in power generation from reservoirs and flood control has altered the natural factors controlling water level changes the suitability of common reed habitat will thus be seriously damaged by strong irregular disturbances the influence of irregular water level fluctuations is mainly reflected in changes in the adaptability of common reeds richardson et al 2002 when such water level changes occur they will destroy the capability of the plant to adapt to periodic changes in water level for a long time thus affecting the normal growth reproduction and succession of the species the influence of water level on aquatic vegetation is highly complex and

area and biomass distribution to water level fluctuations for 2000 2010 the prediction results showed that the sha and the agb at the end of the growing season both reached their lowest levels in 2005 when the annual water level was the highest the highest values of sha and agb occurred in 2003 when the annual water level was at its second lowest the tc levels increased monthly with the highest level occurring at the end of the growing season however the maximum tn and tp levels occurred in august or september the slight decrease in the tn and tp levels at the end of the growing season may be caused by transfer of nutrients from the aboveground parts to the underground biomass the simulation results showed that sha increased slightly and then decreased with rising water level and reached its maximum value at 6 7 m of the 90 guarantee rate water level when the water level was maintained at 6 3 7 3 m the water consumption for transpiration per unit agb was lower than that of other water levels and average lake water level 6 7 m is thus recommended as the lowest ecological water level for the lake water level fluctuations can drive changes in common reed habitat in a shallow lake we focused on the effects of water level fluctuations on common reed habitat at different time scales this study provides a perspective on the effects of water level fluctuations on common reed habitat at different time scales this will help freshwater ecologists and shallow lake management agencies understand the theoretical effects of limited control measures declaration of

24901,simulating of suitable habitat for the common reed phragmites australis can provide theoretical support for water resources managing of shallow lakes earlier research has focused on statistical models of shallow lakes and process based dynamic models for coastal wetlands however process based dynamic modeling for shallow lakes remains relatively incomplete and the loss of biomass in unsuitable situations is seldom considered this study established an occupied habitat model by coupling a cellular automaton with a modified logistic function the cellular automaton was used to simulate the spatial diffusion of the reed the logistic function was used to simulate the accumulation of biomass over time and modified with the loss of biomass in unsuitable habitats both reed distribution and dynamic variations in reed growth can be simulated by this model water level was considered the most important factor in reed growth in baiyangdian lake china the growing season is from april to october the suitable habitat area sha and aboveground biomass agb of reeds were simulated using data from actual hydrological processes and hypothetical scenarios element contents and water consumption by transpiration were estimated on the basis of the agb data the results are as follows 1 water level changes affected the habitat of the common reed the sha increased slightly from 6 0 m and then decreased with rising water level reaching its maximum value at 6 7 m of the 90 guarantee rate water level sha declined rapidly when the water level was higher than 7 5 m 2 when the water level was maintained at 6 3 7 3 m the water consumption for transpiration per unit agb was lower than that for other water levels 3 to maintain a higher water level for a suitable reed habitat area and to reduce water consumption per unit biomass transpiration a reference value of 6 7 m can be regarded as the lowest ecological water level in baiyangdian lake keywords suitable habitat simulation common reed cellular automaton modified logistic function 1 introduction shallow lake is a typical wetland type and provides important ecosystem functions and services yang et al 2016 the common reed phragmites australis a typical emergent macrophyte in many shallow lakes provides valuable habitat for many wetland animals dai et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 because the common reed is highly fertile and adaptable it often becomes the dominant wetland plant species in shallow lakes therefore the scale of the common reed population has a great impact on the shallow lake wetland ecosystem gusewell and nedic 2000 however human activities commonly surround lakes inducing severe environmental disruption and ecological degradation in recent years loss of suitable habitat for the common reed has become a global ecological problem geist 2011 chambers et al 2008 effective prediction and simulation of suitable habitat for the common reed are first required to protect the ecological functions of shallow lakes austin 2002 researchers and managers of shallow lakes are motivated to find effective models and methods to simulate suitable habitat for the common reed in these ecosystems sasaki et al 2015 current research suggests that simulation of suitable habitat for the common reed should be based on ecological processes and the factors influencing those processes wang et al 1999 wolfer et al 2006 altartouri et al 2015 the common reed is involved in the production accumulation and decomposition of organic matter as the organic matter process is the basis of the other ecological processes the common reed as the primary producer is in a dominant position primary producers generate organic matter which is needed for the formation of biomass reader and wilson 1994 the rate at which the organic matter is decomposed determines the organic matter accumulation process stumpf 1983 in wetlands these ecological processes are influenced by physical and chemical processes wolfer et al 2006 water depth is the most important hydrological factor affecting the growth and development of emergent macrophytes zhang et al 2014 water depth and soil moisture are key drivers for biotic characteristics such as biomass plant height diameter and coverage of common reeds li et al 2015 clevering 1998 found that the relative growth rate rgr of common reeds growing in 12 cm deep water is higher than that of dryland common reeds vretare et al 2001 confirmed that the rgr of common reeds in shallow water 5 20 cm was significantly higher than that of common reeds in deep water 70 75 cm salinity is another major factor affecting the growth and distribution of common reeds especially in coastal wetlands he et al 2007 the population characteristics individual appearance and physiological activities of common reeds will vary with the water content and salinity gradient deng et al 2012 accordingly common reeds can adapt to water and salt stress through different strategies as well as water level changes through biomass allocation and rhizome extension cui et al 2006 they can also control the photosynthesis rate by regulating their stomatal openings to alleviate salt stress liu and zou 2014 therefore water and salinity are two major factors affecting habitat suitability for the common reed and they should be fully considered in simulations of suitable habitat for the common reed and the management of shallow lakes targeted at this species several methods and models have been developed to simulate a suitable common reed habitat ye et al 2013 yi et al 2016 qi 2018 the habitat suitability index is one of the most widely used habitat quality evaluation indices habitat suitability modeling which is based on the habitat suitability index involves an evaluation method for habitat suitability and the selection of key environmental factors yi et al 2016 in the past establishing the relationship between species and environmental factors relied strongly on expert experience and was highly subjective many habitat evaluation methods based on statistics and machine learning have since been developed gieswein et al 2017 son et al 2018 including generalized linear models rijt et al 1996 generalized additive models swartzman et al 1995 fuzzy logic adriaenssens et al 2006 artificial neural networks olden and jackson 2001 and decision trees rejwan et al 1999 the statistical models used in habitat simulations of the common reed simplify the simulation problem by establishing a statistical relationship between specific species and key environmental factors but they do not reflect dynamic biological and environmental processes or provide insight into mechanisms ye et al 2013 the process based dynamic model takes into account the interactions and feedback mechanisms between organisms and the environment the process based dynamic model can include continuous environmental dynamic processes and the temporal and spatial evolution of the common reed a cellular automaton is a process based dynamic system model which can well interpret the spatial effects of population dynamics for example in research on estuarine wetlands cas are widely used in simulations of wetland plant populations and habitat characteristics in one study on estuarine wetlands plant growth characteristics were introduced as parameters into the spatial structures of ca and the spatial distribution patterns and biomass accumulation processes of plants were simulated wortmann et al 1998 in a study on the riparian zone a plant growth model based on an unstructured ca coupled with a hydrodynamic module was developed to simulate the response of three riparian zone plants to water depth and velocity stress after changes in the hydrological regime ye et al 2013 in the yellow river delta wetland cas were applied to simulate the diffusion and distribution of three competing species under the influence of water and salt gradients qi 2018 thus cas have been widely used in simulations of plant growth and diffusion and in simulations of suitable habitat for the common reed there are few reports however of habitat suitability simulations based on ca for the common reed in shallow lakes shallow lakes with common reed growth are usually freshwater lakes li et al 2004 whichexhibit small fluctuations in water level and contain extremely low salt thus in these shallow lakes the effect of salt content on the common reed can be ignored a ca model for coastal wetlands is clearly unsuitable for shallow lakes and the current ca based habitat suitability model does not incorporate loss of biomass in unsuitable habitats the present study used a process based dynamic model to simulate the suitable habitat for common reed in shallow lakes based on a coupled ca and modified logistic function the simulation model was employed to evaluate the effects of water level changes on habitat suitable for the common reed baiyangdian lake hebei province china a shallow lake in the north china plain was taken as our case study the aim of this study was to answer the following questions 1 how do water level fluctuations affect the suitability of common reed habitat in shallow lakes 2 what is the most suitable ecological water level of baiyangdian lake to balance the common reed habitat area and the water area 3 what could shallow lake management agencies do to protect common reed habitat 2 model establishment 2 1 field measurement the common reed is widely distributed in baiyangdian lake hebei china with a growing season from april to october in july 2018 we measured the elevation of each sampling point the relative elevation between the sampling points and the lake surface was measured using a steel ruler the elevation of the lake surface on the sampling day was obtained from the monitoring data of the renqiu water authority water depth was considered to be the gap between the elevation of the water surface and the elevation of the sampling points the zero datum was set with a water depth of 0 m at an elevation of 7 94 m representing the water surface elevation of the lake on the sampling day according to the water surface elevation of baiyangdian lake on the sampling day the sampling point elevation was inversely calculated the suitable water depth range for the common reed was set as 2 to 1 5 m and the maximum common reed biomass at the end of october was approximately 3300 g m2 han 2016 zhao 2012 a negative water depth indicates that the water level is higher than the base surface in july 2018 the growth characteristics of common reeds in different water depths were measured table 1 the largest biomass was found in samples obtained from a water depth of 115 cm followed by samples from a water depth of 70 cm the optimal water depth can be assumed to be between these two depths previous research on the optimal water depth for common reeds in baiyangdian lake also showed that the optimal water depth is 77 3 9 7 cm and the model s optimal water depth was set to 80 cm zhao 2012 we thus conclude that the optimal water depth for common reeds in this lake is 80 cm the lake area was divided into 842 1443 cells in a 30 m 30 m grid spatial elevation data were obtained by inverse distance weighted idw interpolation of the measured data fig 1 the idw interpolation was necessary to calculate the distance between all the discrete data points and the grid points in two dimensional space the distance di from the sample point xi yi to the interpolation point x y is d i x x i 2 y y i 2 the idw interpolation was then applied to determine the distance of all sample points closest to the interpolation points then the estimated value on the interpolation points is z x y i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p where zi is the observed elevation on the sample point z x y is the estimated elevation on the interpolation point n is the number of sample points involved in the calculation taken as 10 in this study di is the distance between the interpolation point and the sample point and p is the coefficient generally taken as 2 a ca approach was then adopted to build a model consisting of a square lattice in which each cell represents a 30 m 30 m common reed patch 2 2 cellular automaton model the germination rate of common reed seeds is extremely low under natural conditions so common reeds mainly propagate clonally through underground stems the underground stems produce three kinds of bud axillary shoot rhizome and apical rhizome of these only axillary shoot buds and apical rhizome buds can produce daughter shoots successfully zhang et al 2014 apical rhizome buds may play the most important role in the spatial spread of the common reed population the number of buds and the emergence ratio of the rhizome are affected by the growth state of the plant and the environmental conditions baiyangdian lake is a freshwater lake and thus we simplified the situation as follows water depth was regarded as the only environmental factor affecting the spatial spread and biomass accumulation of common reeds the number of buds produced and the probability of bud emergence are both related to water depth the moore neighbor type eight neighborhoods eight directions was chosen such that the underground stems can randomly extend in eight directions with equal probability fig 2 thus when a cell is empty the probability of generating new common reed plants in the next time interval if the water depth is appropriate is p i 1 8 n i r 8 where ni is the number of buds produced by the i th neighborhood cell and r is the emergence rate of the central cell according to control experiments in a dry environment field water retention rate the water content of soil maintained after two days of irrigation 50 55 and a shallow flooded environment water depth 3 5 cm the mean numbers of underground buds produced by adult individuals were 2 6 and 3 5 respectively and the mean numbers of emergences were 0 6 and 2 2 respectively zhang and zhang 2015 the results of the soil moisture content survey are provided in table 1 and the range of water depth was 2 0 1 5 m we simplified the number of buds and emergence ratio percentage of seeds emerging in total seeds on the basis of water depth the number of buds produced by an adult under optimal conditions 0 8 0 2 m was 4 and the emergence ratio was 0 63 whereas for the remaining water depth ranges 2 0 0 8 m and 0 2 1 5 m the number of buds produced was 3 and the emergence ratio was 0 23 the water depth affecting the number of buds and emergence ratio of common reeds was calculated as the average water depth in the last non growth season the evolutionary rules for the ca can be summarized as follows 1 if the water depth in a common reed containing cell is suitable in the current time interval the common reed will persist to the next time interval 2 if the water depth in a common reed containing cell is not suitable the common reed will die at the end of the current time interval 3 if the biomass in a cell with common reeds is reduced to zero in one time interval then the plants die at the same time and 4 in a cell that has no common reed plants in the current time interval if the water depth is suitable in the next time interval there is a probability of p that the cell will generate a new plant otherwise the cell remains empty 2 3 modified logistic model the logistic function can be used to simulate plant growth under conditions without external disturbances such as human disturbance and climate change the modified logistic function is loaded into the ca grid after being discretized in time the modified logistic function adds a term for biomass loss caused by the water flooding on the basis of the original function the function matches the process of plant biomass accumulation that is the slope of the curve first increases and then decreases 1 y t k 1 a e b t where y is biomass k is carrying capacity a is a dimensionless variable related to y 0 and k t is time and b is the intrinsic rate of increase the actual growth rate can be derived by taking the derivative of eq 1 2 d d t y t b y t 1 y t k coops et al 2004 conducted field manipulation experiments on emergent plant species especially common reeds to develop a model based on the logistic function to predict common reed development the function is given below 3 d r d t r r 1 r k l d p d p h d p where r is the biomass g dw m2 r is the intrinsic growth rate the unit is related to the time step k is the carrying capacity g dw m2 l is the maximum biomass loss related to the water depth g dw m2 d d is water depth m hd is the semi biomass loss corresponding to the submerged depth m and p is the parameter in the hill equation coops et al 2004 zhao 2012 affecting the shape of the curve described by the equation eq 4 considers the effect of water inundation on the growth of emergent plants which is represented by the hill function if the most suitable water depth for common reed growth is dm which corresponds to zero biomass loss then the equation can be modified and discretized into 4 δ r i r i r i 1 1 r i 1 k δ t l d i d m p d i d m p h d p δ t δ l i δ h i where r is the intrinsic growth rate δt is the calculation period such as one month δri is the aboveground biomass increase of common reeds in the i th month of a growing season g dw m2 ri 1 is the aboveground biomass at the end of the i 1 th month di is the mean water depth in the i th month dm is the optimal water depth and δli and δhi are the biomass increases in the i th month expressed by the original logistic function and the hill function respectively 2 4 model coupling the coupling of the ca and the improved logistic function can simulate the dynamic process of common reed spread and growth it was assumed that the common reed plants complete their spatial propagation at the beginning of the growing season and then only increase biomass during the growing season the biomass growth process was simplified as follows all individuals began to grow at the beginning of the growing season and the biomass altered to the initial value of the next year after the end of the growing season the initial values were related to the water depth of the same year the time step of the common reed habitat simulation was set to one month because that was the time scale at which water level data were available 2 5 model parameter calibration calibration was performed by simulating the spatial distribution and biomass growth of common reeds in 2018 the data preparation included the monthly mean water level and the elevation of baiyangdian lake the parameters in the improved logistic function were obtained from previous studies zhao 2012 han 2016 all parameters were constants except l and p which had the ranges shown in table 2 the initial settings of l and p in the model were 150 and 4 respectively the model predictions were verified using the measured data for july 2018 fig 3 a for which r2 0 905 and the root mean square error rmse 303 g m2 the predicted values were higher at water depths of 200 and 180 cm and lower at the remaining water depths rmse was calculated for different values of l 120 130 140 150 160 and 170 and p 2 4 and 6 the best prediction was that with minimum rmse which was at values of l 130 g m2 month and p 4 fig 3b 2 6 estimation of transpiration water consumption and element contents past studies have addressed the role of common reeds in water consumption and elemental circulation in baiyangdian lake li et al 2015 han 2016 some previous field measurements have begun to play a role in the evapotranspiration rate zhao 2012 and elemental levels han 2016 of the common reed community in baiyangdian lake the simulation results of common reed distribution area and biomass can be further combined with existing measurements such as estimations of the total water consumption for evapotranspiration and element contents of common reeds monthly field measurements showed that the transpiration of common reed populations with coverages of 100 80 60 40 and 20 accounted for 91 7 86 9 77 4 67 5 and 49 4 of the total evapotranspiration during the growing season respectively as the coverage decreased the proportion of transpiration in evapotranspiration decreased the highest transpiration rate accounted for 97 1 of the total evapotranspiration rate transpiration was dominant in evapotranspiration fig 4 a thus soil evaporation was negligible and only transpiration was considered in the estimation of water consumption in addition variations in transpiration under different water depth conditions were not disregarded for element contents the total carbon tc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp contents of individual common reeds varied among different months tc contents were highest at the end of the growing season whereas tn and tp contents peaked in june and may respectively fig 4b 3 results 3 1 effect of water level on common reed habitat 3 1 1 effect within a growing season a stable distribution simulation state was generated by running the ca model with initial 20 random coverage after approximately 10 years the habitat distribution reached a steady state as an initial condition for biomass growth simulation fig 5 as for 2018 suitable habitat distribution became stable in the tenth year which was used as the initial condition for the biomass growth simulation biomass growth simulation yielded the results that average habitat area of the growing season was 1 93 108 m2 and total biomass at the end of the growing season was 42 04 1010 g with the highest density being 3272 g m2 fig 6 total biomass of common reeds at the end of october increased to 7 6 times that at the end of april with the fastest increase occurring in july fig 7 a as the area declined the suitable habitats became more fragmented for transpiration water consumption twc the total water consumption for the growing season calculated for monthly biomass development was 4 96 108 m3 of which the water consumption in july accounted for 34 2 fig 7b for element contents tc increased month by month with the largest monthly increases in july and then june in contrast the accumulations of tn and tp initially increased and then decreased peaking in august fig 7c by the end of the growing season tc tn and tp levels were 21 60 1010 g 5 25 109 g and 1 26 108 g respectively the decrease in tn and tp at the end of the growing season may have been caused by transfer of biomass and nutrients from the aboveground to the underground parts of the common reeds 3 1 2 inter annual effects the monthly water level for 2000 2010 was inputted to predict the habitat distribution and biomass growth of common reed the initial habitat of common reed was simulated with the mean monthly water level 6 80 m and 20 uniform distribution years 2000 2010 as the initial conditions after 15 years the habitat distribution of common reed reached a stable area of 185 959 cells taking this distribution as the initial state the growth and distribution changes of common reed in 2000 2010 were simulated the simulation results showed that the suitable habitat area and total biomass exhibited both inter annual and intra annual variations with changes in water depth the largest habitat area occurred in april 2004 1 93 108 m2 whereas the smallest was in october 2005 1 44 108 m2 the largest mean monthly habitat area occurred in 2003 and the smallest in 2006 fig 8 a the highest total biomass by the end of the growing season occurred in 2003 51 2 1010 g and the lowest in 2005 35 2 1010 g which was 69 of the value for 2004 fig 8b the highest total transpiration water consumption 5 25 108 m3 was in 2002 and the lowest was in 2005 3 46 108 m3 the transpiration water consumption was highest in july accounting for more than 30 of the total transpiration water in the growing season fig 8c the change in tc levels was basically consistent with changes in biomass with total carbon levels accounting for approximately 50 of total biomass at the end of the growing season fig 8d the maximum tn and tp levels occurred in august or september in august 2002 tn and tp levels reached their maximum values of 7 61 109 g and 4 25 108 g respectively fig 8e f the average tc tn and tp levels at the end of each growing season were 2 32 1011 g 5 63 109 g and 1 35 108 g respectively and the average total water consumption was 44 15 107 m³ when the water level reached a maximum value the area and biomass often exhibited a minimum value the trends in biomass and density were consistent in 2005 the area and total biomass were lowest at the end of october the end of growth in that year the water level reached a maximum value 7 53 m and the suitable habitat area of common reeds decreased large increases in water depth also resulted in large biomass losses 3 2 ecological water level in baiyangdian lake the water level of baiyangdian lake has declined rapidly since the 1960s and was especially low after 2000 it is therefore necessary to study the distribution of suitable common reed habitats in the lake under a wide range of water levels the minimum annual average water level was 6 12 m 2002 and the maximum was 9 49 m 1956 thus in the water level range 6 1 9 5 m 18 water level scenarios were set up at 0 2 m intervals to carry out the habitat simulation for common reed the area and biomass of the common reeds were obtained after a stable solution had been reached the results showed that as the water level increased the habitat area and biomass underwent a small increase and then a rapid decrease when the water level was approximately 6 7 m common reed area and biomass reached their maximum values when the water level was between 6 3 and 7 1 m the suitable habitat area and total biomass of the common reed was maintained at more than 95 of the maximum value the area declined fastest in the 8 5 8 7 m range whereas the biomass declined fastest in the 7 5 7 7 m range fig 9 a from the simulation results the transpiration water consumption and element contents of common reed communities were calculated and the changes in and correlations between transpiration water consumption and element enrichment of common reeds at different water levels were obtained linear correlations were present between transpiration water consumption and the tc tn and tp contents and an inflection point divided the fitted lines into two segments the upper segment had a smaller slope with a water depth range of 6 3 7 3 m this indicates that the common reed community consumed less transpiration water with increases in tc tn and tp levels at water levels of 6 3 7 3 m than in other scenarios the water level corresponding to the point on the right side of the inflection point was 6 3 7 3 m in this water level interval common reeds produced more total biomass and displayed higher utilization of transpiration water fig 9b d 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms for water level driven habitat changes the influence of lake water level fluctuations operates over a wide range from small individual plants to large population and community distribution hill et al 1998 but the influence varies from species to species cooke et al 1993 the lake water level fluctuations have two main types of effect 1 direct effects on the growth of aquatic organisms and competition between species tenna and ian 2002 and 2 indirect effects caused by changes in water physical and chemical conditions such as transparency turbidity salinity ph suspended substances and dissolved oxygen these then affect the growth of aquatic organisms and competition between species limno tech inc lti and slivitzky 2002 water level fluctuations affect organisms that feed on aquatic vegetation indirectly reducing or increasing the pressure on aquatic vegetation geraldes and boavida 2005 this changes the spatial and temporal distribution of aquatic vegetation zalocar 2003 carvalho et al 2003 kisand and nõges 2004 the main mechanism is therefore likely to be the influence of water level fluctuations on the suitability of the ecosystem for the plant physiology in our study we simulated the habitat annually and inter annually quantifying the habitat area and biomass different rules for water level fluctuations can significantly affect the habitat area and biomass of common reeds the results of this study show that the coupled model can well reflect the influencing mechanism of water level fluctuations on the growth diffusion and loss of common reeds the water level its fluctuation range frequency occurrence time duration and regularity are the core factors affecting the aquatic vegetation of lakes keddy 1983 1986 toner and keddy 1997 variations in water level have different effects on the habitat of aquatic vegetation habitat at different time scales including short term intra annual and inter annual variations liu et al 2006 short term water level fluctuations exert indirect effects on the physical and chemical properties of lake water and sediment zhang et al 2003 2004 scott and paul 1985 in our study we did not validate and quantify these indirect effects because of the time interval used in the simulations intra annual and inter annual periodic changes in water level are mainly reflected in the following aspects different aquatic plants have different degrees of adaptability to intra annual and inter annual changes in water level so changes in water level can affect the ecological suitability of aquatic vegetation and consequently alter the spatial and temporal distribution of the vegetation van geest et al 2005a b previous research mainly applied qualitative analysis and simple statistical methods whereas our model improves quantitative modeling some previous studies have also pointed out that there has been little progress in the study of water stress of aquatic vegetation andrew and robert 1999 and not enough attention has been paid to important species naiman et al 1993 our study took the dominant species the common reed in baiyangdian lake as the research subject and fully considered the influence of water stress on the habitat extent of the common reed and biomass increases in the coupled model our study therefore has value as a reference for habitat simulation research on key plants in other shallow lakes and management of shallow lakes 4 2 implications for shallow lake common reed habitat management the habitat of the common reed is affected by water level fluctuations irregularities in water level are likely to result in negative consequences particularly if the water level is unusually high or low for a long period of time van geest et al 2005a b in particular artificially controlling water levels to meet human needs such as in power generation from reservoirs and flood control has altered the natural factors controlling water level changes the suitability of common reed habitat will thus be seriously damaged by strong irregular disturbances the influence of irregular water level fluctuations is mainly reflected in changes in the adaptability of common reeds richardson et al 2002 when such water level changes occur they will destroy the capability of the plant to adapt to periodic changes in water level for a long time thus affecting the normal growth reproduction and succession of the species the influence of water level on aquatic vegetation is highly complex and thus when regulating water level it is necessary to select appropriate evaluation objects and indicators and analyze the main influencing factors on this basis research methods should be put forward to determine the appropriate water level and strategies and technical methods for water level control should be implemented the process based mathematical model in this study can be used as an effective tool for practical regulation with the specific parameter values determined from baiyangdian lake the habitat of common reeds was quantified for both annual and inter annual states based on the simulation results of our model predicting changes in habitat suitability in shallow lakes is effective for protecting the key species affected by artificial disturbances at present our model does not include artificial interventions that cause unnatural fluctuations of water level however our model is fully capable of simulating the ecological consequences of these regulatory behaviors therefore our model has value as a reference for other sites and also has practical relevance for the management of baiyangdian lake and other shallow lakes the basic strategies and technical methods of water level control based on the process model will be the subject of future research there remain some shortcomings in the modeling process for simulation of common reed habitat in shallow lakes which deserve further consideration and research for example short term water level changes which affect the physical and chemical properties of lake water and sediment and thus have indirect impacts on common reed habitat need to be considered as do intraspecific competition of common reeds and interspecific competition between other plants in shallow lakes and common reeds 5 conclusion carrying out research on biota habitat relationships is an important step in understanding the internal linkages and mechanisms of macrophyte dominated shallow lake ecosystems the aim of the present study was to simulate suitable habitat for the common reed a dynamic spatial model incorporating a cellular automaton and modified logistic function was established to quantify the response of suitable habitat area and biomass distribution to water level fluctuations for 2000 2010 the prediction results showed that the sha and the agb at the end of the growing season both reached their lowest levels in 2005 when the annual water level was the highest the highest values of sha and agb occurred in 2003 when the annual water level was at its second lowest the tc levels increased monthly with the highest level occurring at the end of the growing season however the maximum tn and tp levels occurred in august or september the slight decrease in the tn and tp levels at the end of the growing season may be caused by transfer of nutrients from the aboveground parts to the underground biomass the simulation results showed that sha increased slightly and then decreased with rising water level and reached its maximum value at 6 7 m of the 90 guarantee rate water level when the water level was maintained at 6 3 7 3 m the water consumption for transpiration per unit agb was lower than that of other water levels and average lake water level 6 7 m is thus recommended as the lowest ecological water level for the lake water level fluctuations can drive changes in common reed habitat in a shallow lake we focused on the effects of water level fluctuations on common reed habitat at different time scales this study provides a perspective on the effects of water level fluctuations on common reed habitat at different time scales this will help freshwater ecologists and shallow lake management agencies understand the theoretical effects of limited control measures declaration of

24902,the water energy nexus has gained great attention to both academe and practitioners in the past decade in order to help expand the understanding in this field we conduct a comprehensive literature review on water energy nexus by using citation based approach a directional network is established in terms of citation relationships among 1185 related papers published in journals indexed by the web of science database from 2007 to 2019 specifically we first draw the citation chronological graph and main path analysis to show a complete picture of literature development trajectory since 2007 it is found that the current key route focuses on the understanding of coupling relations in macroscopic national systems while the study of microscopic systems such as enterprises families and individuals is lacked in addition considering that the citation based approach may ignore the newest papers 43 latest highly relevant papers are further analyzed in terms of study background data source and modeling methods to be specific the main advantages and major limitations of existing approaches are identified finally future research challenges and prospects are identified including the shifts of research object from macro systems to micro systems the challenge of modeling from analysis to analytics of big data and the deepening of decision support from knowing to doing keywords water energy nexus main path analysis macro and micro systems data analytic 1 introduction in the past decades global demand and consumption for water and energy are increasing rapidly due to many factors such as population increase industrialization urbanization and climate change chen and chen 2016 zhang et al 2018c schmidt and matthews 2018 siciliano et al 2017 it is predicted that the consumption of fresh water and energy in the world will increase by half in the year of 2050 compared with the year of 2015 ferroukhi et al 2015 it will lead a huge pressure on existing water and energy system because the shortage of supply in most regions of the world furthermore it is reported that the environmental crisis due to unsustainable water and energy consumption is becoming the biggest global risk waughray 2011 herein water and energy saving are two of the most important issues of sustainable development around the world feng et al 2012 ramos et al 2010 van vliet et al 2016 kenway et al 2011 taniguchi et al 2018 liu 2016 gu et al 2016 min and shengkui 2002 more importantly water and energy systems are inextricably mutual effect on the one hand in the energy system water is primary for energy production transportation and utilization based on the statistics more than 90 of global electricity generations are depending on water duan and chen 2017b on the other hand the water system is a major consumer of energy for uses such as water extraction cleansing delivering and sea water desalination gleick 2016 due to this mutual relation between water and energy resource increasing energy efficiency can reduce pressure on water resource and improving water efficiency can also reduce the consumption of energy feng and chen 2016 li et al 2018 in general the improvement of a diverse supply of energy will be feasible if the quality and quantity of water are rising inversely enhanced energy capacities accelerate the ability to produce clean water rambo et al 2017 karatayev et al 2017 jeffrey 2017 brouwer et al 2018 as a result the concept of water energy nexus has drawn great concern recent years because of the globally attention for water and energy security babkir 2018 wang et al 2018c endo et al 2017 tan and zhi 2016 duan and chen 2017a the popularity of the concept could be traced back to the world economic forum in 2008 where the global challenges in terms of economic growth were identified from the water energy nexus viewpoint waughray 2011 since then water energy nexus issue has become increasingly important for both the scholar and policy setting communities there is a flood of literature cover a wide range of issues on this subject sun et al 2018 walker et al 2014 nair et al 2014 kenway et al 2011 gude 2015 wang et al 2017a mo et al 2010 ou et al 2014 mohtar and lawford 2016 howells et al 2013 talozi et al 2015 ringler et al 2013 li et al 2016 gu et al 2014 specifically some studies focus on defining the concept of nexus for example the water energy nexus can be expressed as the correlations between water and energy as they are coupled in their production supply disposition transmission and use sanders and webber 2012 gulati et al 2013 lawford et al 2013 for another example the nexus is expressed as an analysis method to denote the relations among the nexus elements such as water energy and food shao and chen 2015 denooyer et al 2016 huang et al 2017 some researchers devote to investigate case studies in different scales of size from urban level urban agglomeration level national level to global level zhou et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 tidwell and pebbles 2015 keskinen et al 2015 some studies focus on introducing and developing models and tools to understand and quantify the coupling relations based on the state of the art modeling approaches life cycle assessment lundie et al 2004 al ghamdi and bilec 2015 berger and finkbeiner 2010 stokes and horvath 2011 zhang and anadon 2013 input output analysis okadera et al 2015 liang and zhang 2013 wang et al 2013 cazcarro et al 2013 computable general equilibrium method zhou et al 2016 fæhn 2015 and the optimization approaches wang et al 2018b goryashko and nemirovski 2014 garg and joshi 2014 calise et al 2015 almansoori and saif 2014 shakib et al 2012 vieira and ramos 2009 ramos et al 2013 are studied in this subject in terms of actual situations rounded analysis of the nexus between water and energy is important to achieve sustainable resource management recently several review papers have been published to analysis water energy nexus problems in terms of concepts methodologies and applications for example by selecting 35 case studies out of the 70 identified papers dai et al make a review focuses on methods and tools for macro evaluation of the water energy nexus dai et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a provide a review focuses on the concepts research questions and methodologies in the area of water energy food nexus through a survey of 161 documents zhang et al 2018a according to 49 published journal papers mannan et al review the inter linkages inherent in the energy water food nexus based on the life cycle assessment method mannan et al 2018 following the structure of hierarchy of knowledge hamiche et al 2016 review the evolution and progress of information methodology and knowledge in the field of water energy nexus on account of 13 major studies vakilifard et al 2018 provide a review emphasizing knowledge gaps in optimization models within the water energy nexus in water supply systems all these surveys replenish the water energy nexus literature and help extend our understanding of the area however the surveys are mainly based on subjective qualitative analyses rather than objective quantitative analysis approaches specially the articles used in those surveys are selected classified and summarized according to artificial process more or less it may ignore many quantitative indexes such as authors publications and citations of the articles in addition existing surveys relate to a narrow stratum of the water energy nexus studies by investigating a small sample of papers to the best of our knowledge the number of 161 articles applied in zhang et al 2018a is the largest sample in existing water energy nexus surveys since more than one thousand papers have been published the comprehensiveness of existing surveys is weak to fill the mentioned gaps our study collects 1185 relevant papers published from 2007 to 2019 and analyzes the research status of water energy nexus studies through a citation network analysis using the citation analysis software histcite we carry out a visual analysis and create a citation chronological graph to identify the main development route and key publications of water energy nexus researches it is found that the most relevant important research is a quantitative method of the nexus among water energy and foods located in the citation chronological graph the with high lcs values bazilian et al 2011 and by using the pajek software a sketch of the main flows of ideas depicting studies of water energy nexus is provided it is found that studies on water energy food nexus are getting more and more attention which clearly dominate three seats of the ends of the routes on the main paths besides since the citation network analysis may ignore the newest papers with relatively low citation an in depth analysis of the newest water energy studies is specially provided to be specific the key issues in the recent research of the nexus between water and energy systems including study background data source and modeling methods moreover we also identify the new directions and prospects for future research in the area of water energy nexus the structure of this paper is organized as follows in the next section the document source and review methods used in this paper are introduced in section 3 the beginning and development of water energy studies are analyzed based on a citation network analysis section 4 summarizes the key problems in recent water energy nexus development including study background data source and modeling approaches by reviewing the newest papers published in the period of 2017 2019 in section 5 future directions and challenges are prospected by deepening investigation of current studies finally section 6 concluded this paper 2 review methods 2 1 document source and collection to make a distinct review we use complete searches and standard summaries of the literature to combine main studies in the area in this study we select the databases within wos including science citation index expanded scie social sciences citation index ssci and conference proceedings index science cpi s first we start with a particularity search in above databases by using keywords such as water energy nexus water for energy and energy for water a sample of 1677 articles is obtained from the databases then we read through these papers abstracts to tell whether they really focus on water energy nexus the papers contain limited contents about water energy nexus are artificially recognized and removed from the sample after the artificial screening the final samples are composed by 1185 articles published from 2007 to 2019 2 2 qualitative and quantitative review methods since the groundbreaking work introduced by garfield 1964 the study of citation to papers has received plenty attentions by scholars the main path analysis proposed by hummon and doreian is a popular approach that traces the mainstream knowledge route in scientific subject by citation information hummon and doreian 1989 in this approach papers are denoted by nodes of a network and the links between nodes are constructed by the citation data in this paper we also apply the main path analysis to investigate the origins and development of the water and energy nexus studies although the citation network analysis can complement to the qualitative review methods by bringing objectivity and quantification factors it may ignore the latest papers which are not on the main path hence we also review some latest and highly relevant papers published in relatively high level journals specifically out of the 1185 papers we select 43 water energy nexus focused papers published in journals with a 2018 jcr journal citation reports journal ranking of 2 or 1 in the period of 2017 2019 to extract the main focuses in the field of water energy nexus the selected papers were read multiple times all these selected papers were then classified in terms of different categories for further review it also should be point out that review papers are excluded in this selected sample 3 a citation network analysis in this section we present our major findings through the citation network analysis the basic statistics for the water energy nexus studies are firstly discussed then the top 50 papers with the highest lcs are identified and their relations in terms of citations are depicted by a citation chronological graph furthermore the development trace of water energy nexus studies is drawn by the main path analysis 3 1 timeline of papers the yearly distribution of papers from 2007 to 2019 is depicted in fig 1 which shows an increasing trend year by year the topic of water and energy nexus studies can be dated back to the year of 2007 when mukherji first defined the concept of energy irrigation nexus and studied its impact on groundwater markets in india mukherji 2007 as shown in fig 1 the number of papers has increased rapidly in the past six years which show it is a hot subject at present 3 2 paper distribution and scholarly community more than half 54 of the papers were published in 20 journals see fig 2 among them 10 of the 20 journals published more than 25 papers which are applied energy journal of cleaner production water science of the total environment environmental research letters sustainability energy policy energy environmental science policy and environmental science technology respectively table 1 presents the top 12 researchers in the area of water energy nexus in terms of the total number of papers and the total local citation scores of their papers on one hand the total number of papers indicates the relative activity of the researcher in a certain area on another hand local citation score lcs based on total citations of paper obtained by local selection which is used to denote relative importance of paper in our study a researcher s total local citation score tlcs is calculated by the sum of lcs of his her all papers which can denote the relative importance of the researcher in specific field to be specific as the standard of both the total number of papers no less than 5 and the total lcs more than 50 12 authors are recorded and listed in table 1 as shown in table 1 chen howells and stillwell are the top three researchers concentrate on the subject of water energy nexus based on the total number of papers and tlcs 3 3 citation chronological graph the citation chronological graph provides all hot papers alone with the progress of a topic and their relations according to citations by applying the histcite software the citation chronological graph of the top 50 papers in the area of water energy nexus is depicted as shown in fig 3 in this figure each box denotes each paper with its code number inside and the bigger the size of box is the more important the paper is in addition the arrow denotes the orientation of citation flowing from a citing paper to a cited paper as shown in the figure the timeline is from the year of 2008 to the year of 2018 the paper related to water energy nexus starts from kahrl f and roland holst d kahrl and roland holst 2008 however the number of citations is relatively small in the previous years since 2011 papers with higher citation value have been published it indicates that the studies which focus on water energy nexus is becoming more and more popular currently the most relative important paper is bazilian et al 2011 which got highest lcs value of 175 their work on the quantitative methods of the nexus among water energy and foods then propose a model which can support the developing country on policy and mechanism design the next is siddiqi and anadon 2011 with the second largest lcs value of 110 which find that the interdependence between energy system and water is not equal the energy system is not strongly dependent on water but the development and production of water resources are more dependent on energy and scott et al 2011 is the third highest cited paper with lcs value of 94 which find that as the transportability of raw coal and natural gas energy is more suited to regionalized global change than water in order to purify the development sequence of water energy nexus study we will provide the main path analysis in the next subsection 3 4 main path analysis by utilizing the pajek software we describe the main trace of the development of water energy studies based on the main path and depict it in fig 4 the nodes are papers and the arrows show the orientation of the knowledge flows each paper in the figure is denoted by the name of first author and the published year for example the paper proposed by kahrl f and roland holst d kahrl and roland holst 2008 is denoted by kahrl f 2008 there are 9 papers on the local main path which form the kernel of the whole area and play an important role in knowledge flow of the subject the 9 papers are also listed in table 2 in detail kahrl and roland holst 2008 found that non agricultural water currently accounts for only a small portion of china s total energy consumptions however as water gradually shifts from agricultural to non agricultural use policymakers need to think more about the implications of energy the second paper on the main path focuses on the electricity water nexus in united states sovacool and sovacool 2009 they focused on water shortages caused by the addition of thermal power plants and tried to predict how severe these shortages would be then siddiqi and anadon 2011 conducted country level quantitative assessment of water energy links in water poor regions such as the middle east and north africa the results show that policymakers should clearly consider the impact of water product imports and water demand restructuring on energy the next paper on the main path is still in the study of the relations between water and energy scott et al 2011 since we have reviewed the article above we will not repeat it here afterwards benson et al 2015 reviewed the implementation of the nexus of water agriculture energy climate concerns in practice with a more mature integrated water management iwrm model the evidence suggests that nexus thinking has not replaced iwrm and that integration between water energy climate and agricultural policy objectives is generally limited the rest four papers on the main path are all in the field of energy food water nexus smajgl et al 2016 argued that the current framework of energy food water nexus is partial because they are focus on water sector they proposed a balanced relationship framework and analyzed and determined the advantages of the dynamic contact method of sectoral balance howarth and monasterolo 2016 pointed that given the multidimensional nature and complexity of such energy food water nexus a cross sectoral approach is needed cairns and krzywoszynska 2016 criticized an integrative imaginary in uk nexus research and point out the importance of criticism in the development of nexus studies wichelns 2017 implemented a water energy food nexus approach would not strengthen the policy process in all cases the main path analysis shows that the current key route focuses on the understanding of national water energy nexus namely how to comprehend the coupling relations between water and energy resources in a specific country and then examine the effects of existing policy related to water and energy along the main path research topics have evolved from water energy nexus to water energy food nexus the research perspective has been extended from individual resource discipline to integrated disciplines such as resource economics environment and sociology although many issues related to water energy nexus have been investigated all of the studies alone the main path focus on the national macro level more micro level objects such as region city and factory seem under studied 4 recent development of water energy nexus although the above analysis draws the core content and evolution of the research by highly cited papers it may ignore the newest researches which do not have high citations however the latest papers are especially important compared with the whole number papers because water energy nexus is becoming a hot topic currently in this section we review the 43 newest articles selected in section 2 2 in terms of study background data source and nexus method 4 1 study background 4 1 1 nexus types in terms of the focuses of nexus the nexus types for all 43 articles are divided by the specific combinations of two or three of the following elements water energy food carbon land and emission to be specific the studies of two element nexus relation is water energy nexus wang et al 2019 fang and chen 2018 gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 li et al 2019c wang et al 2017a fang and chen 2017 chen and chen 2016 tsolas et al 2018 fan et al 2018 chu et al 2019 becken and mclennan 2017 feng et al 2019 cai et al 2019 duan and chen 2017b khalkhali et al 2018 in addition three element nexus relation has also drawn many attentions which is grouped into four types water energy food nexus ju 2019 xiao et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 franz et al 2018 venghaus and hake 2018 stein et al 2018 märker et al 2018 hanes et al 2018 li et al 2019a b sahle et al 2019 momblanch et al 2019 water energy carbon nexus meng et al 2019 water energy land nexus and water energy emission nexus wang et al 2018a as shown in fig 5 the number of water energy nexus studies is the most n 25 then the water energy food nexus studies n 14 the numbers of rest three types of nexus studies are relatively few with water energy carbon nexus water energy land nexus and water energy emission nexus for 1 2 and 1 respectively in this manner the water energy nexus and water energy food nexus have attracted major concerns while other nexus types with more diversified elements such as carbon land emission and ecosystem also call for more attentions 4 1 2 research objectives the water energy nexus contains a wide range of issues and therefore studies on this topic vary highly with respective to specific objective by treating the nexus system as an authority comprised of several subsystems the 43 selected studies are classified into three groups water for energy energy for water both water for energy and energy for water the first group quantifies the water impact of energy production the second group calculates the energy impact of water supplying and wastewater treatment services and the third group quantifies interactive impacts of water and energy in the authority system as shown in fig 6 over 70 percent of studies n 30 focus on both water for energy and energy for water and the rest 30 percent of studies n 13 look at one side of nexus as water for energy or energy for water it indicates that most latest studies have emphasized both of the two sides of the nexus which can be viewed as a progress compared with earlier studies only consider one side of the nexus besides for the one side of nexus studies water for energy accounts for 28 percent n 14 while energy for water only contributes 2 percent n 1 of the selected studies this distinct difference of attention reveals that energy industry is more active than water conservancy industry in nowadays society 4 1 3 geographical scale according to the geographical distribution of application the selected studies classified into four categories respectively are individual urban level urban agglomeration level national level and transnational level as shown in fig 7 the number of individual urban level studies is the highest n 15 occupying 36 percent followed by urban agglomeration level n 13 accounting for 31 percent national level n 10 with 24 percent and transnational level n 4 with 9 percent the features of the four categories are described as follows first urban is the main carrier where matter and energy flows the supplies and demands of water and energy resources in the urban are more complex than that in the countryside with the increase of urbanization process the water energy nexus of urban system has attracted more and more attention over the world recently in individual urban level the selected case studies depict the water and energy flows through the urban economic sectors and link them to environmental changes such as carbon and pollution emissions meng et al 2019 chhipi shrestha et al 2017 second urban agglomerations uas have become increasingly significant alone with the urbanization tabuchi 1998 it has been discovered that such uas play an important role in urban development parvez et al 2018 in the urban agglomeration different kinds of urban resources such as water and energy are shared each other in this manner the study of water energy nexus in the ua level has received growing attention lately fan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 third at the national level the studies focus on policy implications for resource management in centralized environment zhang et al 2018b fourth with the speeding up of the process of economic globalization transnational level scale studies focus on the shared resources and benefits in different countries ju 2019 4 1 4 sector classification in terms of the industrial distribution of application the selected articles are divided by single sector study n 18 and multi sector study n 25 on one hand out of the 18 single sector studies as shown in fig 8 most of them focus on electricity sector n 7 and agriculture sector n 8 while the rest three studies respectively focus on tourist sector n 2 and water conservancy sector n 1 for detail in the electricity sector analyzing the nexus between water treatment and power generation is contribute to the upgrade of existing hydroelectric plants and electrical transmission grids gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 agriculture is a major economic sector for developing countries facing challenges from the water resource shortage for food and biofuels crop production for the purpose of agricultural sustainable development it is important to assess the land water energy nexus of irrigated crop production systems in agriculture sector chu et al 2019 in the water conservancy industry it is crucial to comprehend the coupling between water and energy to improve the efficiency of water treatment transportation and utilization momblanch et al 2019 in addition to the above traditional sectors the water energy nexus is extended to tourist accommodation because the tourism can be both energy and water intensive becken and mclennan 2017 on the other hand the multi sector studies are classified to six groups as shown in fig 9 by employing an ordinal scale the number of water supply electricity sector is the most n 10 followed by agriculture electricity sector n 5 agriculture animal husbandry food sector n 4 manufacturing agriculture service transportation sector n 3 agriculture construction service sector n 2 and agriculture coal food sector n 1 different from the single sector studies multi sector nexus studies investigate the nexus between water and energy in two or more sectors in which distinct strategies on different sectors are proposed in terms of different consumption structures ju 2019 4 2 data source since the existing water energy nexus case studies investigate macro systems such as urban urban agglomeration nation and translation the data primary come from published government reports and official statistics to be specific most of the case studies are located in china in these studies the economic data are primary derived from the existing national input output tables of china and regional input output tables of china the industrial water withdrawal data for each province are collected from the china economic census yearbook and the china water resources bulletin fang and chen 2017 and the data regarding to fossil fuel production electricity generation as well as total fossil fuel reserves could be observed in the china energy statistical yearbook wang et al 2019 2017b and the co2 emission data are collected from china emission accounts and datasets in addition to the case studies in china there are also several water energy nexus researches focus on some other geographic areas such as european brazil iran and thailand hasan and avami 2018 larsen and drews 2019 silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 the data in these studies are derived by available datasets and simulation 4 3 water energy nexus methods quantitative assessment of the water energy nexus is important to provide implications related to the performance of the system although types of methods are developed in this area there is no single method is applicable for all contexts because of the diversities of nexus types research objectives geographical scales application sectors et al according to the state of the art research approaches the four advanced methods i e input output analysis optimization models life cycle assessment and econometric analysis are summarized in terms of nexus types geographical scale sector classification main advantage and major limitation table 3 4 3 1 input output analysis input output analysis proposed by leontief in the late 1930 s is a common method that be widely applied in water energy nexus studies wang et al 2019 it helps in quantifying the links between water and energy by calculating the physical flows and monetary flows through the process of resources consumption from an economic structure perspective there are two widely used io analysis approaches the basic io analysis and the multi regional input output i e mrio analysis li et al 2019c the former approach is adapted to the urban level and the latter is applied to the urban agglomeration level the main shortages of ioa are the use of capital values and the lack of sector discrimination caused by sector aggregation it makes the results sensitive to price variances and homogeneity in different sectors in addition ioa relies on specific data source such as input output tables which is difficult to applied to the analysis of more micro systems such as enterprises families and individual humans 4 3 2 life cycle assessment life cycle assessment is a useful tool for quantifying the environmental impacts of a system through its whole life cycle it has been applied to evaluate the nexus between water and energy resource throughout their production and consumption processes yuan et al 2018 salmoral and yan 2018 however lca suffer from the drawback of high dependency on data which is difficult to apply in scarce data regions besides in terms of geographical scale lca is applied to individual urban level and national level case studies with respect to sector classification it has been used for single sector such as the agriculture industry while has not been applied to multi sector case studies 4 3 3 econometric analysis econometric analysis uses statistical models to analysis the relations between economic variables from quantitative perspective as a mature infer causality method it has been applied to water energy nexus problems for example considering that tourism can be both water and energy intensive by applying kruskal wallis tests becken and mclennan 2017 explore the water and energy utilization conditions of 876 hotels although econometric analysis has been in depth investigated in the field of economic its application in water energy nexus issues still remains at an early stage by using small data samples cross section data and simple linear regression models in macro system in this manner there is large space to analysis large scale panel data in more micro system by using multivariate nonlinear regression and quantile regression approaches it should also be point out that econometric analysis relies on data heavily which is similar to ioa method lca method 4 3 4 optimization models in practical water energy nexus issues there exist various sources of uncertainties such as complex feature of nature processes anthropogenic influence and the errors in modeling parameters as a result such uncertainties have made the traditional quantitative assessment methods become infeasible optimization model is a decision tool to find the best feasible solution of the problem in which the objective function is maximized or minimized via the variable values subjected to some constraints by incorporating the uncertainty factors optimization models have been developed to solve the water energy nexus problems in dynamic and uncertain environment hickman et al 2017 lv et al 2018 to some extent the optimization models reduce or eliminate the uncertainty factors by specific techniques such as fuzzy programming dynamic programming and heuristic algorithm however different treatments of uncertainty may generate different variable values and produce different optimal solutions hence it is difficult to determine which solution is the best one since the robustness of results are not guaranteed related findings and policy implications are lack of reliability in addition existing optimization models are primary applied to small sample of data set which are not suitable for large scale data such as real time household consuming data 5 future directions and prospects the existing studies provide a full view of water energy nexus issue from different perspectives such as the interpretation of nexus types the modeling of coupling systems the empirical analysis of case studies and the implication of policies although the studies of water energy nexus have been widely carried out nowadays the research level is still in the primary stage which needs to deepen and extend by collecting the above analysis together future directions of water energy nexus study are identified from three sides including the shift of research object the challenge of modeling and the deepening of decision support 5 1 the shift of research object from macro system to micro system macro system and micro system are two basic components of social ecological ecosystem scale of the water energy nexus studies also vary widely from micro level to macro level in terms of the water and energy relations in size from individual urban urban agglomeration national to transnational levels however the stratification of the modern social ecosystem is more abundant there is interaction between individual and social ecosystem and individual behavior and environment are related restricted and influenced each other in addition the individual psychological and physiological factors as well as the interaction between psychology and physiology have dominant and recessive reflections on the whole social ecosystem martinez hernandez et al 2017 as such in terms of the water energy system it is also very abundant while the individual behaviors are taken into account for example the residential water usage may be influenced by many factors such as water price family income family members air temperature education level and other unknown factors and for another example compared with pulsator washing machine the drum washing machine is more water saving but waste of electricity and time based on their specific work principles so then the tradeoff between residential water and electricity usage in different families even different members in one family may be distinctive because of different individual preferences to the best of our knowledge the most microscopic water energy study is on the urban level which is identified as macro system rather than micro system so in future study by taking into consideration of individual behaviors it is worth shifting the research object from macro system to micro system such as resident sector and firm level water energy nexus studies 5 2 the challenge of modeling from analysis to analytics of big data with the rise of the internet and the emergence of social media more and more people tend to share some of their personal activities on the internet which also include their preference and behavior on the consumption of water and energy resource for example residents social network activities such as online shopping of water saving device comment on the residential water and electricity pricing policy frequency of browsing on the website related to energy saving and environmental protection can be used to analysis the water and energy consumption behavior of residents compared with the precise data from government reports and published data the imprecise data such as qualitative data and large scale data from the internet more deeply reflect residents consumption behavior rathod and garg 2016 so data mining from the internet as well as large scale and uncertainty data analysis are important for water energy nexus studies in micro systems however existing water energy nexus studies in macro systems are primary based on quantitative models such as input output analysis and optimization models to deal with relatively small scale of data which are not applicable in micro systems with qualitative data and large scale data li 2018 huang et al 2018 sa d et al 2018 for future research it is possible to acquire store and analysis qualitative and large scale of data by applying the emerging technologies such as big data and internet of things zhou et al 2016 in terms of modeling construction for one direction dynamic large scale of data analytic models should be established to analysis long term and real time streaming data from the internet for another direction to deal with the uncertainty and low value density of securable data it is crucial to propose integrated modeling framework to combine the existing water energy nexus analysis models and data analytic tools such as data mining cluster analysis and machine learning ramos et al 2015 5 3 the deepening of decision support from knowing to doing analysis of the external and internal nexuses between water and energy systems can improve understanding on the quantitative and qualitative relations between the two resources and finally to provide decision support and policy making xiang and jia 2019 bieber et al 2018 ding et al 2020 according to the aforementioned review of water energy nexus studies most of them emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the nexus relationships to be specific they just calculate small scale of precise data to know linkages and identify key problems and opportunity areas in water and energy systems and then provide policy suggestions related to water and energy resource management wang et al 2018d to some extent the research findings in existing studies are at the knowing stage which provide limited evidence for decision support in future study with the in depth research of water energy nexus problems in micro system more specific and refining research findings will be investigated for the purpose of policy implement to improve the efficiency of water and energy sectors 6 conclusions water and energy are inevitable interdependence awareness of these dependence relationships is increasing the worldwide due to water crisis energy pressure and climatic degeneration our study conducts a systematic survey on the studies of water energy nexus this survey covers almost all related papers derived from the web of science database which providing a thorough mapping of the subject by considering 1185 papers from 2007 to 2019 by implementing a comprehensive citation network analysis the origin citation networks of papers with high lcs main paths with important papers and top authors in the subject of water energy nexus are identified since the citation network may ignore the newest papers which are not on the main path 43 most recent papers are particularly analyzed in terms of background framework data source and model construction the key conclusions are summarized as follows first a growing number of researchers and journals are putting more efforts into the water energy nexus researches since the year of 2008 water energy nexus is becoming an emerging field accompanied by the global attention on water and energy security after that the numbers of papers about water energy nexus are increasing rapidly year by year which indicate it is a hot topic deserves continuous and deepgoing study what s more the publications present a wide range of research range from specialized water and energy technology journals to general economic and environmental policy journals second the key research question in this field is the quantitative method of nexus which is studied in a large collection of papers including the most important paper with highest lcs values that located in the citation chronological graph in addition the key research objects are becoming nexus studies with multiple elements water energy foods which clearly dominate three seats of the ends of the routes on the main paths third various modeling approaches are developed in the area of water energy nexus e g input output analysis life cycle assessment econometric analysis and optimization models from the geography perspective these water energy nexus case studies primary focus on relatively macro systems vary from urban level urban agglomeration level national level to global level in terms of the industry perspective the studies are applied to electricity industry water conservancy industry agriculture industry and tourist industry although the researches in water energy nexus have made great progress it is important to note that there are still some rooms waist improvements first the existing models are primary applicable for small scale of macroscopic data rather large scale of microscopic data in addition large scale and uncertainty data analysis in micro systems still needs to be strengthened for water energy nexus studies finally to some extent the research findings in existing studies are at the knowing stage which provide limited evidence for decision support therefore in future water energy nexus studies the following research directions will be the focus 1 shifting the research object from macro system to micro system such as resident sector and firm level water energy nexus studies by taking into consideration of individual behaviors 2 studying on the emerging technologies for analyzing qualitative and large scale data e g dynamic large scale of data analytic models and integrated modeling framework and 3 more specific and refining research findings for the purpose of policy implement to improve the efficiency of water and energy sectors all in all more efforts are needed to promote the in depth development of water energy nexus studies in terms of research object modeling approach and policy implication we hope that this review can be a useful and inspirational source

24902,the water energy nexus has gained great attention to both academe and practitioners in the past decade in order to help expand the understanding in this field we conduct a comprehensive literature review on water energy nexus by using citation based approach a directional network is established in terms of citation relationships among 1185 related papers published in journals indexed by the web of science database from 2007 to 2019 specifically we first draw the citation chronological graph and main path analysis to show a complete picture of literature development trajectory since 2007 it is found that the current key route focuses on the understanding of coupling relations in macroscopic national systems while the study of microscopic systems such as enterprises families and individuals is lacked in addition considering that the citation based approach may ignore the newest papers 43 latest highly relevant papers are further analyzed in terms of study background data source and modeling methods to be specific the main advantages and major limitations of existing approaches are identified finally future research challenges and prospects are identified including the shifts of research object from macro systems to micro systems the challenge of modeling from analysis to analytics of big data and the deepening of decision support from knowing to doing keywords water energy nexus main path analysis macro and micro systems data analytic 1 introduction in the past decades global demand and consumption for water and energy are increasing rapidly due to many factors such as population increase industrialization urbanization and climate change chen and chen 2016 zhang et al 2018c schmidt and matthews 2018 siciliano et al 2017 it is predicted that the consumption of fresh water and energy in the world will increase by half in the year of 2050 compared with the year of 2015 ferroukhi et al 2015 it will lead a huge pressure on existing water and energy system because the shortage of supply in most regions of the world furthermore it is reported that the environmental crisis due to unsustainable water and energy consumption is becoming the biggest global risk waughray 2011 herein water and energy saving are two of the most important issues of sustainable development around the world feng et al 2012 ramos et al 2010 van vliet et al 2016 kenway et al 2011 taniguchi et al 2018 liu 2016 gu et al 2016 min and shengkui 2002 more importantly water and energy systems are inextricably mutual effect on the one hand in the energy system water is primary for energy production transportation and utilization based on the statistics more than 90 of global electricity generations are depending on water duan and chen 2017b on the other hand the water system is a major consumer of energy for uses such as water extraction cleansing delivering and sea water desalination gleick 2016 due to this mutual relation between water and energy resource increasing energy efficiency can reduce pressure on water resource and improving water efficiency can also reduce the consumption of energy feng and chen 2016 li et al 2018 in general the improvement of a diverse supply of energy will be feasible if the quality and quantity of water are rising inversely enhanced energy capacities accelerate the ability to produce clean water rambo et al 2017 karatayev et al 2017 jeffrey 2017 brouwer et al 2018 as a result the concept of water energy nexus has drawn great concern recent years because of the globally attention for water and energy security babkir 2018 wang et al 2018c endo et al 2017 tan and zhi 2016 duan and chen 2017a the popularity of the concept could be traced back to the world economic forum in 2008 where the global challenges in terms of economic growth were identified from the water energy nexus viewpoint waughray 2011 since then water energy nexus issue has become increasingly important for both the scholar and policy setting communities there is a flood of literature cover a wide range of issues on this subject sun et al 2018 walker et al 2014 nair et al 2014 kenway et al 2011 gude 2015 wang et al 2017a mo et al 2010 ou et al 2014 mohtar and lawford 2016 howells et al 2013 talozi et al 2015 ringler et al 2013 li et al 2016 gu et al 2014 specifically some studies focus on defining the concept of nexus for example the water energy nexus can be expressed as the correlations between water and energy as they are coupled in their production supply disposition transmission and use sanders and webber 2012 gulati et al 2013 lawford et al 2013 for another example the nexus is expressed as an analysis method to denote the relations among the nexus elements such as water energy and food shao and chen 2015 denooyer et al 2016 huang et al 2017 some researchers devote to investigate case studies in different scales of size from urban level urban agglomeration level national level to global level zhou et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 tidwell and pebbles 2015 keskinen et al 2015 some studies focus on introducing and developing models and tools to understand and quantify the coupling relations based on the state of the art modeling approaches life cycle assessment lundie et al 2004 al ghamdi and bilec 2015 berger and finkbeiner 2010 stokes and horvath 2011 zhang and anadon 2013 input output analysis okadera et al 2015 liang and zhang 2013 wang et al 2013 cazcarro et al 2013 computable general equilibrium method zhou et al 2016 fæhn 2015 and the optimization approaches wang et al 2018b goryashko and nemirovski 2014 garg and joshi 2014 calise et al 2015 almansoori and saif 2014 shakib et al 2012 vieira and ramos 2009 ramos et al 2013 are studied in this subject in terms of actual situations rounded analysis of the nexus between water and energy is important to achieve sustainable resource management recently several review papers have been published to analysis water energy nexus problems in terms of concepts methodologies and applications for example by selecting 35 case studies out of the 70 identified papers dai et al make a review focuses on methods and tools for macro evaluation of the water energy nexus dai et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a provide a review focuses on the concepts research questions and methodologies in the area of water energy food nexus through a survey of 161 documents zhang et al 2018a according to 49 published journal papers mannan et al review the inter linkages inherent in the energy water food nexus based on the life cycle assessment method mannan et al 2018 following the structure of hierarchy of knowledge hamiche et al 2016 review the evolution and progress of information methodology and knowledge in the field of water energy nexus on account of 13 major studies vakilifard et al 2018 provide a review emphasizing knowledge gaps in optimization models within the water energy nexus in water supply systems all these surveys replenish the water energy nexus literature and help extend our understanding of the area however the surveys are mainly based on subjective qualitative analyses rather than objective quantitative analysis approaches specially the articles used in those surveys are selected classified and summarized according to artificial process more or less it may ignore many quantitative indexes such as authors publications and citations of the articles in addition existing surveys relate to a narrow stratum of the water energy nexus studies by investigating a small sample of papers to the best of our knowledge the number of 161 articles applied in zhang et al 2018a is the largest sample in existing water energy nexus surveys since more than one thousand papers have been published the comprehensiveness of existing surveys is weak to fill the mentioned gaps our study collects 1185 relevant papers published from 2007 to 2019 and analyzes the research status of water energy nexus studies through a citation network analysis using the citation analysis software histcite we carry out a visual analysis and create a citation chronological graph to identify the main development route and key publications of water energy nexus researches it is found that the most relevant important research is a quantitative method of the nexus among water energy and foods located in the citation chronological graph the with high lcs values bazilian et al 2011 and by using the pajek software a sketch of the main flows of ideas depicting studies of water energy nexus is provided it is found that studies on water energy food nexus are getting more and more attention which clearly dominate three seats of the ends of the routes on the main paths besides since the citation network analysis may ignore the newest papers with relatively low citation an in depth analysis of the newest water energy studies is specially provided to be specific the key issues in the recent research of the nexus between water and energy systems including study background data source and modeling methods moreover we also identify the new directions and prospects for future research in the area of water energy nexus the structure of this paper is organized as follows in the next section the document source and review methods used in this paper are introduced in section 3 the beginning and development of water energy studies are analyzed based on a citation network analysis section 4 summarizes the key problems in recent water energy nexus development including study background data source and modeling approaches by reviewing the newest papers published in the period of 2017 2019 in section 5 future directions and challenges are prospected by deepening investigation of current studies finally section 6 concluded this paper 2 review methods 2 1 document source and collection to make a distinct review we use complete searches and standard summaries of the literature to combine main studies in the area in this study we select the databases within wos including science citation index expanded scie social sciences citation index ssci and conference proceedings index science cpi s first we start with a particularity search in above databases by using keywords such as water energy nexus water for energy and energy for water a sample of 1677 articles is obtained from the databases then we read through these papers abstracts to tell whether they really focus on water energy nexus the papers contain limited contents about water energy nexus are artificially recognized and removed from the sample after the artificial screening the final samples are composed by 1185 articles published from 2007 to 2019 2 2 qualitative and quantitative review methods since the groundbreaking work introduced by garfield 1964 the study of citation to papers has received plenty attentions by scholars the main path analysis proposed by hummon and doreian is a popular approach that traces the mainstream knowledge route in scientific subject by citation information hummon and doreian 1989 in this approach papers are denoted by nodes of a network and the links between nodes are constructed by the citation data in this paper we also apply the main path analysis to investigate the origins and development of the water and energy nexus studies although the citation network analysis can complement to the qualitative review methods by bringing objectivity and quantification factors it may ignore the latest papers which are not on the main path hence we also review some latest and highly relevant papers published in relatively high level journals specifically out of the 1185 papers we select 43 water energy nexus focused papers published in journals with a 2018 jcr journal citation reports journal ranking of 2 or 1 in the period of 2017 2019 to extract the main focuses in the field of water energy nexus the selected papers were read multiple times all these selected papers were then classified in terms of different categories for further review it also should be point out that review papers are excluded in this selected sample 3 a citation network analysis in this section we present our major findings through the citation network analysis the basic statistics for the water energy nexus studies are firstly discussed then the top 50 papers with the highest lcs are identified and their relations in terms of citations are depicted by a citation chronological graph furthermore the development trace of water energy nexus studies is drawn by the main path analysis 3 1 timeline of papers the yearly distribution of papers from 2007 to 2019 is depicted in fig 1 which shows an increasing trend year by year the topic of water and energy nexus studies can be dated back to the year of 2007 when mukherji first defined the concept of energy irrigation nexus and studied its impact on groundwater markets in india mukherji 2007 as shown in fig 1 the number of papers has increased rapidly in the past six years which show it is a hot subject at present 3 2 paper distribution and scholarly community more than half 54 of the papers were published in 20 journals see fig 2 among them 10 of the 20 journals published more than 25 papers which are applied energy journal of cleaner production water science of the total environment environmental research letters sustainability energy policy energy environmental science policy and environmental science technology respectively table 1 presents the top 12 researchers in the area of water energy nexus in terms of the total number of papers and the total local citation scores of their papers on one hand the total number of papers indicates the relative activity of the researcher in a certain area on another hand local citation score lcs based on total citations of paper obtained by local selection which is used to denote relative importance of paper in our study a researcher s total local citation score tlcs is calculated by the sum of lcs of his her all papers which can denote the relative importance of the researcher in specific field to be specific as the standard of both the total number of papers no less than 5 and the total lcs more than 50 12 authors are recorded and listed in table 1 as shown in table 1 chen howells and stillwell are the top three researchers concentrate on the subject of water energy nexus based on the total number of papers and tlcs 3 3 citation chronological graph the citation chronological graph provides all hot papers alone with the progress of a topic and their relations according to citations by applying the histcite software the citation chronological graph of the top 50 papers in the area of water energy nexus is depicted as shown in fig 3 in this figure each box denotes each paper with its code number inside and the bigger the size of box is the more important the paper is in addition the arrow denotes the orientation of citation flowing from a citing paper to a cited paper as shown in the figure the timeline is from the year of 2008 to the year of 2018 the paper related to water energy nexus starts from kahrl f and roland holst d kahrl and roland holst 2008 however the number of citations is relatively small in the previous years since 2011 papers with higher citation value have been published it indicates that the studies which focus on water energy nexus is becoming more and more popular currently the most relative important paper is bazilian et al 2011 which got highest lcs value of 175 their work on the quantitative methods of the nexus among water energy and foods then propose a model which can support the developing country on policy and mechanism design the next is siddiqi and anadon 2011 with the second largest lcs value of 110 which find that the interdependence between energy system and water is not equal the energy system is not strongly dependent on water but the development and production of water resources are more dependent on energy and scott et al 2011 is the third highest cited paper with lcs value of 94 which find that as the transportability of raw coal and natural gas energy is more suited to regionalized global change than water in order to purify the development sequence of water energy nexus study we will provide the main path analysis in the next subsection 3 4 main path analysis by utilizing the pajek software we describe the main trace of the development of water energy studies based on the main path and depict it in fig 4 the nodes are papers and the arrows show the orientation of the knowledge flows each paper in the figure is denoted by the name of first author and the published year for example the paper proposed by kahrl f and roland holst d kahrl and roland holst 2008 is denoted by kahrl f 2008 there are 9 papers on the local main path which form the kernel of the whole area and play an important role in knowledge flow of the subject the 9 papers are also listed in table 2 in detail kahrl and roland holst 2008 found that non agricultural water currently accounts for only a small portion of china s total energy consumptions however as water gradually shifts from agricultural to non agricultural use policymakers need to think more about the implications of energy the second paper on the main path focuses on the electricity water nexus in united states sovacool and sovacool 2009 they focused on water shortages caused by the addition of thermal power plants and tried to predict how severe these shortages would be then siddiqi and anadon 2011 conducted country level quantitative assessment of water energy links in water poor regions such as the middle east and north africa the results show that policymakers should clearly consider the impact of water product imports and water demand restructuring on energy the next paper on the main path is still in the study of the relations between water and energy scott et al 2011 since we have reviewed the article above we will not repeat it here afterwards benson et al 2015 reviewed the implementation of the nexus of water agriculture energy climate concerns in practice with a more mature integrated water management iwrm model the evidence suggests that nexus thinking has not replaced iwrm and that integration between water energy climate and agricultural policy objectives is generally limited the rest four papers on the main path are all in the field of energy food water nexus smajgl et al 2016 argued that the current framework of energy food water nexus is partial because they are focus on water sector they proposed a balanced relationship framework and analyzed and determined the advantages of the dynamic contact method of sectoral balance howarth and monasterolo 2016 pointed that given the multidimensional nature and complexity of such energy food water nexus a cross sectoral approach is needed cairns and krzywoszynska 2016 criticized an integrative imaginary in uk nexus research and point out the importance of criticism in the development of nexus studies wichelns 2017 implemented a water energy food nexus approach would not strengthen the policy process in all cases the main path analysis shows that the current key route focuses on the understanding of national water energy nexus namely how to comprehend the coupling relations between water and energy resources in a specific country and then examine the effects of existing policy related to water and energy along the main path research topics have evolved from water energy nexus to water energy food nexus the research perspective has been extended from individual resource discipline to integrated disciplines such as resource economics environment and sociology although many issues related to water energy nexus have been investigated all of the studies alone the main path focus on the national macro level more micro level objects such as region city and factory seem under studied 4 recent development of water energy nexus although the above analysis draws the core content and evolution of the research by highly cited papers it may ignore the newest researches which do not have high citations however the latest papers are especially important compared with the whole number papers because water energy nexus is becoming a hot topic currently in this section we review the 43 newest articles selected in section 2 2 in terms of study background data source and nexus method 4 1 study background 4 1 1 nexus types in terms of the focuses of nexus the nexus types for all 43 articles are divided by the specific combinations of two or three of the following elements water energy food carbon land and emission to be specific the studies of two element nexus relation is water energy nexus wang et al 2019 fang and chen 2018 gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 li et al 2019c wang et al 2017a fang and chen 2017 chen and chen 2016 tsolas et al 2018 fan et al 2018 chu et al 2019 becken and mclennan 2017 feng et al 2019 cai et al 2019 duan and chen 2017b khalkhali et al 2018 in addition three element nexus relation has also drawn many attentions which is grouped into four types water energy food nexus ju 2019 xiao et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 franz et al 2018 venghaus and hake 2018 stein et al 2018 märker et al 2018 hanes et al 2018 li et al 2019a b sahle et al 2019 momblanch et al 2019 water energy carbon nexus meng et al 2019 water energy land nexus and water energy emission nexus wang et al 2018a as shown in fig 5 the number of water energy nexus studies is the most n 25 then the water energy food nexus studies n 14 the numbers of rest three types of nexus studies are relatively few with water energy carbon nexus water energy land nexus and water energy emission nexus for 1 2 and 1 respectively in this manner the water energy nexus and water energy food nexus have attracted major concerns while other nexus types with more diversified elements such as carbon land emission and ecosystem also call for more attentions 4 1 2 research objectives the water energy nexus contains a wide range of issues and therefore studies on this topic vary highly with respective to specific objective by treating the nexus system as an authority comprised of several subsystems the 43 selected studies are classified into three groups water for energy energy for water both water for energy and energy for water the first group quantifies the water impact of energy production the second group calculates the energy impact of water supplying and wastewater treatment services and the third group quantifies interactive impacts of water and energy in the authority system as shown in fig 6 over 70 percent of studies n 30 focus on both water for energy and energy for water and the rest 30 percent of studies n 13 look at one side of nexus as water for energy or energy for water it indicates that most latest studies have emphasized both of the two sides of the nexus which can be viewed as a progress compared with earlier studies only consider one side of the nexus besides for the one side of nexus studies water for energy accounts for 28 percent n 14 while energy for water only contributes 2 percent n 1 of the selected studies this distinct difference of attention reveals that energy industry is more active than water conservancy industry in nowadays society 4 1 3 geographical scale according to the geographical distribution of application the selected studies classified into four categories respectively are individual urban level urban agglomeration level national level and transnational level as shown in fig 7 the number of individual urban level studies is the highest n 15 occupying 36 percent followed by urban agglomeration level n 13 accounting for 31 percent national level n 10 with 24 percent and transnational level n 4 with 9 percent the features of the four categories are described as follows first urban is the main carrier where matter and energy flows the supplies and demands of water and energy resources in the urban are more complex than that in the countryside with the increase of urbanization process the water energy nexus of urban system has attracted more and more attention over the world recently in individual urban level the selected case studies depict the water and energy flows through the urban economic sectors and link them to environmental changes such as carbon and pollution emissions meng et al 2019 chhipi shrestha et al 2017 second urban agglomerations uas have become increasingly significant alone with the urbanization tabuchi 1998 it has been discovered that such uas play an important role in urban development parvez et al 2018 in the urban agglomeration different kinds of urban resources such as water and energy are shared each other in this manner the study of water energy nexus in the ua level has received growing attention lately fan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 third at the national level the studies focus on policy implications for resource management in centralized environment zhang et al 2018b fourth with the speeding up of the process of economic globalization transnational level scale studies focus on the shared resources and benefits in different countries ju 2019 4 1 4 sector classification in terms of the industrial distribution of application the selected articles are divided by single sector study n 18 and multi sector study n 25 on one hand out of the 18 single sector studies as shown in fig 8 most of them focus on electricity sector n 7 and agriculture sector n 8 while the rest three studies respectively focus on tourist sector n 2 and water conservancy sector n 1 for detail in the electricity sector analyzing the nexus between water treatment and power generation is contribute to the upgrade of existing hydroelectric plants and electrical transmission grids gjorgiev and sansavini 2018 agriculture is a major economic sector for developing countries facing challenges from the water resource shortage for food and biofuels crop production for the purpose of agricultural sustainable development it is important to assess the land water energy nexus of irrigated crop production systems in agriculture sector chu et al 2019 in the water conservancy industry it is crucial to comprehend the coupling between water and energy to improve the efficiency of water treatment transportation and utilization momblanch et al 2019 in addition to the above traditional sectors the water energy nexus is extended to tourist accommodation because the tourism can be both energy and water intensive becken and mclennan 2017 on the other hand the multi sector studies are classified to six groups as shown in fig 9 by employing an ordinal scale the number of water supply electricity sector is the most n 10 followed by agriculture electricity sector n 5 agriculture animal husbandry food sector n 4 manufacturing agriculture service transportation sector n 3 agriculture construction service sector n 2 and agriculture coal food sector n 1 different from the single sector studies multi sector nexus studies investigate the nexus between water and energy in two or more sectors in which distinct strategies on different sectors are proposed in terms of different consumption structures ju 2019 4 2 data source since the existing water energy nexus case studies investigate macro systems such as urban urban agglomeration nation and translation the data primary come from published government reports and official statistics to be specific most of the case studies are located in china in these studies the economic data are primary derived from the existing national input output tables of china and regional input output tables of china the industrial water withdrawal data for each province are collected from the china economic census yearbook and the china water resources bulletin fang and chen 2017 and the data regarding to fossil fuel production electricity generation as well as total fossil fuel reserves could be observed in the china energy statistical yearbook wang et al 2019 2017b and the co2 emission data are collected from china emission accounts and datasets in addition to the case studies in china there are also several water energy nexus researches focus on some other geographic areas such as european brazil iran and thailand hasan and avami 2018 larsen and drews 2019 silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 the data in these studies are derived by available datasets and simulation 4 3 water energy nexus methods quantitative assessment of the water energy nexus is important to provide implications related to the performance of the system although types of methods are developed in this area there is no single method is applicable for all contexts because of the diversities of nexus types research objectives geographical scales application sectors et al according to the state of the art research approaches the four advanced methods i e input output analysis optimization models life cycle assessment and econometric analysis are summarized in terms of nexus types geographical scale sector classification main advantage and major limitation table 3 4 3 1 input output analysis input output analysis proposed by leontief in the late 1930 s is a common method that be widely applied in water energy nexus studies wang et al 2019 it helps in quantifying the links between water and energy by calculating the physical flows and monetary flows through the process of resources consumption from an economic structure perspective there are two widely used io analysis approaches the basic io analysis and the multi regional input output i e mrio analysis li et al 2019c the former approach is adapted to the urban level and the latter is applied to the urban agglomeration level the main shortages of ioa are the use of capital values and the lack of sector discrimination caused by sector aggregation it makes the results sensitive to price variances and homogeneity in different sectors in addition ioa relies on specific data source such as input output tables which is difficult to applied to the analysis of more micro systems such as enterprises families and individual humans 4 3 2 life cycle assessment life cycle assessment is a useful tool for quantifying the environmental impacts of a system through its whole life cycle it has been applied to evaluate the nexus between water and energy resource throughout their production and consumption processes yuan et al 2018 salmoral and yan 2018 however lca suffer from the drawback of high dependency on data which is difficult to apply in scarce data regions besides in terms of geographical scale lca is applied to individual urban level and national level case studies with respect to sector classification it has been used for single sector such as the agriculture industry while has not been applied to multi sector case studies 4 3 3 econometric analysis econometric analysis uses statistical models to analysis the relations between economic variables from quantitative perspective as a mature infer causality method it has been applied to water energy nexus problems for example considering that tourism can be both water and energy intensive by applying kruskal wallis tests becken and mclennan 2017 explore the water and energy utilization conditions of 876 hotels although econometric analysis has been in depth investigated in the field of economic its application in water energy nexus issues still remains at an early stage by using small data samples cross section data and simple linear regression models in macro system in this manner there is large space to analysis large scale panel data in more micro system by using multivariate nonlinear regression and quantile regression approaches it should also be point out that econometric analysis relies on data heavily which is similar to ioa method lca method 4 3 4 optimization models in practical water energy nexus issues there exist various sources of uncertainties such as complex feature of nature processes anthropogenic influence and the errors in modeling parameters as a result such uncertainties have made the traditional quantitative assessment methods become infeasible optimization model is a decision tool to find the best feasible solution of the problem in which the objective function is maximized or minimized via the variable values subjected to some constraints by incorporating the uncertainty factors optimization models have been developed to solve the water energy nexus problems in dynamic and uncertain environment hickman et al 2017 lv et al 2018 to some extent the optimization models reduce or eliminate the uncertainty factors by specific techniques such as fuzzy programming dynamic programming and heuristic algorithm however different treatments of uncertainty may generate different variable values and produce different optimal solutions hence it is difficult to determine which solution is the best one since the robustness of results are not guaranteed related findings and policy implications are lack of reliability in addition existing optimization models are primary applied to small sample of data set which are not suitable for large scale data such as real time household consuming data 5 future directions and prospects the existing studies provide a full view of water energy nexus issue from different perspectives such as the interpretation of nexus types the modeling of coupling systems the empirical analysis of case studies and the implication of policies although the studies of water energy nexus have been widely carried out nowadays the research level is still in the primary stage which needs to deepen and extend by collecting the above analysis together future directions of water energy nexus study are identified from three sides including the shift of research object the challenge of modeling and the deepening of decision support 5 1 the shift of research object from macro system to micro system macro system and micro system are two basic components of social ecological ecosystem scale of the water energy nexus studies also vary widely from micro level to macro level in terms of the water and energy relations in size from individual urban urban agglomeration national to transnational levels however the stratification of the modern social ecosystem is more abundant there is interaction between individual and social ecosystem and individual behavior and environment are related restricted and influenced each other in addition the individual psychological and physiological factors as well as the interaction between psychology and physiology have dominant and recessive reflections on the whole social ecosystem martinez hernandez et al 2017 as such in terms of the water energy system it is also very abundant while the individual behaviors are taken into account for example the residential water usage may be influenced by many factors such as water price family income family members air temperature education level and other unknown factors and for another example compared with pulsator washing machine the drum washing machine is more water saving but waste of electricity and time based on their specific work principles so then the tradeoff between residential water and electricity usage in different families even different members in one family may be distinctive because of different individual preferences to the best of our knowledge the most microscopic water energy study is on the urban level which is identified as macro system rather than micro system so in future study by taking into consideration of individual behaviors it is worth shifting the research object from macro system to micro system such as resident sector and firm level water energy nexus studies 5 2 the challenge of modeling from analysis to analytics of big data with the rise of the internet and the emergence of social media more and more people tend to share some of their personal activities on the internet which also include their preference and behavior on the consumption of water and energy resource for example residents social network activities such as online shopping of water saving device comment on the residential water and electricity pricing policy frequency of browsing on the website related to energy saving and environmental protection can be used to analysis the water and energy consumption behavior of residents compared with the precise data from government reports and published data the imprecise data such as qualitative data and large scale data from the internet more deeply reflect residents consumption behavior rathod and garg 2016 so data mining from the internet as well as large scale and uncertainty data analysis are important for water energy nexus studies in micro systems however existing water energy nexus studies in macro systems are primary based on quantitative models such as input output analysis and optimization models to deal with relatively small scale of data which are not applicable in micro systems with qualitative data and large scale data li 2018 huang et al 2018 sa d et al 2018 for future research it is possible to acquire store and analysis qualitative and large scale of data by applying the emerging technologies such as big data and internet of things zhou et al 2016 in terms of modeling construction for one direction dynamic large scale of data analytic models should be established to analysis long term and real time streaming data from the internet for another direction to deal with the uncertainty and low value density of securable data it is crucial to propose integrated modeling framework to combine the existing water energy nexus analysis models and data analytic tools such as data mining cluster analysis and machine learning ramos et al 2015 5 3 the deepening of decision support from knowing to doing analysis of the external and internal nexuses between water and energy systems can improve understanding on the quantitative and qualitative relations between the two resources and finally to provide decision support and policy making xiang and jia 2019 bieber et al 2018 ding et al 2020 according to the aforementioned review of water energy nexus studies most of them emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the nexus relationships to be specific they just calculate small scale of precise data to know linkages and identify key problems and opportunity areas in water and energy systems and then provide policy suggestions related to water and energy resource management wang et al 2018d to some extent the research findings in existing studies are at the knowing stage which provide limited evidence for decision support in future study with the in depth research of water energy nexus problems in micro system more specific and refining research findings will be investigated for the purpose of policy implement to improve the efficiency of water and energy sectors 6 conclusions water and energy are inevitable interdependence awareness of these dependence relationships is increasing the worldwide due to water crisis energy pressure and climatic degeneration our study conducts a systematic survey on the studies of water energy nexus this survey covers almost all related papers derived from the web of science database which providing a thorough mapping of the subject by considering 1185 papers from 2007 to 2019 by implementing a comprehensive citation network analysis the origin citation networks of papers with high lcs main paths with important papers and top authors in the subject of water energy nexus are identified since the citation network may ignore the newest papers which are not on the main path 43 most recent papers are particularly analyzed in terms of background framework data source and model construction the key conclusions are summarized as follows first a growing number of researchers and journals are putting more efforts into the water energy nexus researches since the year of 2008 water energy nexus is becoming an emerging field accompanied by the global attention on water and energy security after that the numbers of papers about water energy nexus are increasing rapidly year by year which indicate it is a hot topic deserves continuous and deepgoing study what s more the publications present a wide range of research range from specialized water and energy technology journals to general economic and environmental policy journals second the key research question in this field is the quantitative method of nexus which is studied in a large collection of papers including the most important paper with highest lcs values that located in the citation chronological graph in addition the key research objects are becoming nexus studies with multiple elements water energy foods which clearly dominate three seats of the ends of the routes on the main paths third various modeling approaches are developed in the area of water energy nexus e g input output analysis life cycle assessment econometric analysis and optimization models from the geography perspective these water energy nexus case studies primary focus on relatively macro systems vary from urban level urban agglomeration level national level to global level in terms of the industry perspective the studies are applied to electricity industry water conservancy industry agriculture industry and tourist industry although the researches in water energy nexus have made great progress it is important to note that there are still some rooms waist improvements first the existing models are primary applicable for small scale of macroscopic data rather large scale of microscopic data in addition large scale and uncertainty data analysis in micro systems still needs to be strengthened for water energy nexus studies finally to some extent the research findings in existing studies are at the knowing stage which provide limited evidence for decision support therefore in future water energy nexus studies the following research directions will be the focus 1 shifting the research object from macro system to micro system such as resident sector and firm level water energy nexus studies by taking into consideration of individual behaviors 2 studying on the emerging technologies for analyzing qualitative and large scale data e g dynamic large scale of data analytic models and integrated modeling framework and 3 more specific and refining research findings for the purpose of policy implement to improve the efficiency of water and energy sectors all in all more efforts are needed to promote the in depth development of water energy nexus studies in terms of research object modeling approach and policy implication we hope that this review can be a useful and inspirational source

24903,prevention of ecological risks in land ecosystems is crucial for environmental protection and sustainable land use with increasingly severe land degradation new and effective methods must be developed for the management of ecological risks in this study a conceptual decision making model in ecological risk prevention was developed using the bayesian belief network with a geographic information system gis for the regional scale land ecosystem in the traditional mining city of daye in central china based on the results of a sensitivity analysis the variable of eco resilience reduction was identified as the most sensitive to habitat removal with the highest mutual information at 0 71 the two variables of soil pollution and water quality deterioration were selected for a cross validation analysis and the changes in both the calibration and validation performance were very small the scenarios we considered based on the interests of various stakeholders presented the spatial distribution of the following regulative effects of various management measures on a regional scale 1 the variable of urbanisation showed that the probability of 11 5 of all the grids decreased at a high state over an area of 177 km2 2 the variable of mining showed that the probability of 35 5 of the all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 554 km2 3 the variable of habitat removal showed that the probability of 6 7 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 87 km2 and 4 the variable of health threats showed that the probability of 8 4 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 135 km2 the bayesian network gis based tools can support the decision making process used for ecological risk prevention in land ecosystems keywords regional scale ecological risks prevention decision making tool spatial bayesian network cross validation land ecosystem 1 introduction the functions of a land ecosystem such as supporting vegetative growth producing and maintaining biodiversity providing habitat for humans and other organisms purifying the environment and protecting soil and water and modifying climate are important ferretti and pomarico 2013 turner et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the reduction of the ecological functions of land causes damage to habitats biodiversity air water and soil which limit the regional economic development and human survival li et al 2014a bai et al 2014 bryan et al 2018 thus the ecological risk management of land ecosystems is attracting attention in research and administration globally li et al 2014b liang et al 2017 kang et al 2018 the decision making analysis for ecological risk prevention requires knowledge of the causes and mechanisms of land degradation and exploration of techniques and methods for controlling and restoring degraded land ecosystems ferretti and pomarico 2013 comino et al 2014 turner et al 2016 studies on the prevention of ecological risks in a land ecosystem are generally focused on the environment economy and social culture li et al 2014 turner et al 2016 guo et al 2017 the prevention of environmental degradation involves combating erosion salinization and desertification of soil damage to the natural landscape li et al 2014c ochoa cueva et al 2015 price et al 2015 kosmas et al 2017 soil contamination water quality deterioration and soil depletion guo et al 2014 kibblewhite 2012 pries et al 2008 xu et al 2016 the development of an agricultural economy requires the preservation of arable land reclamation of waste land and maintenance and improvement of land productivity eld initiative 2013 jackson et al 2013 a stable society relies on its land ecosystem for supporting sustainable human well being costanza et al 2013 iniesta arandia et al 2014 however previous studies have primarily been focused on the individual aspects of the land ecosystem with discreet results that did not provide effective guidance for realising the comprehensive protection of a complex ecosystem therefore an integrative approach to research involving multiple factors that function simultaneously and interactively in the entire land ecosystem has been proposed guo et al 2017 integrative research on ecological risk management often depends on the use of appropriate tools or models and it has been increasingly attracting the attention of researchers these researchers in this field have made valuable contributions such as multi agent systems for the decision making processes involved in forest management xu et al 2015 ahlqvist et al 2018 artificial intelligence models for simulating and predicting the risks of a land ecosystem liu et al 2018 tsai et al 2018 multi criteria decision making models for risk zoning and management of large areas li et al 2014b gallego et al 2019 souissi et al 2019 designs for an integrated risk index that can serve as a warning for implementing the appropriate regional development strategies partl et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and environmental risk mapping as guidance for risk minimisation in risk management and decision making ma et al 2013 maldonado et al 2016 petus et al 2016 the aforementioned tools and models however can still be further improved when applied to research on land ecosystems firstly they can be applied primarily in mono factor stud ies as has been mentioned in this paper and they cannot provide motivation for the comprehensive risk prevention for a land ecosystem secondly they represent linear relationships between the factors of the land ecosystem and are unfit for research on nonlinear relationships in a land ecosystem guo et al 2015 w q zhou et al 2019 thirdly they cannot be used to simultaneously process multiple data fourthly they have been established based on single isolated issues and do not encourage researchers to formulate extensive and comprehensive hypotheses finally they have primarily been designed by researchers without involving the related stakeholders and the obtained results cannot be easily understood and accepted by the public to address the above drawbacks in this study we used the bayesian belief network bn model with a geographic information system gis which has been believed to be more scientific and powerful the bn model is a semi quantitative model that combines ecological models with expert knowledge and it has shown its effectiveness in studies on ecological issues marcot et al 2006 2017 chen and pollino 2012 the model reveals the complex ecological mechanisms underlying the results of previous research fienen et al 2013 mcdonald et al 2015 franco et al 2016 and helps researchers to present various valuable hypotheses landuyt et al 2013 chee et al 2016 marcot and penman 2019 that contribute to realising comprehensive and feasible research designs that then provide convincing results for the current work of land protection the emphasis is on the participation of different stakeholders voinov and bousquet 2010 luyet et al 2012 and the bn may provide such convenience various related stakeholders are involved in the research to help in identifying realistic and practical research objectives krueger et al 2012 dick et al 2018 the bn can process multi type data operate in a poor data collection environment uusitalo 2007 chen and pollino 2012 handle uncertainty aguilera et al 2013 be updated using follow up data and be combined with other algorithms for obtaining accurate calculations aitkenhead and aalders 2009 johnson et al 2011 marcot and penman 2019 furthermore with the advantages of its combination with other software programs the application of the bn also presents convenience in testing and validating marcot 2012 fienen et al 2013 for example the technique of cross validation that is successfully used in bn modelling prevents the occurrence of the overfitting resulting from overly complex bns marcot 2012 beuzen and simmons 2019 however the results obtained on using the bn model comprise abstract statistical data that research participants cannot understand the explicit benefits of and based on which they cannot immediately and confidently make decisions therefore it has been recommended that the bn model be used in combination with a gis for visualising the statistical data smith et al 2007 celio et al 2014 gonzalez redin et al 2016 such that researchers can locate the uncertainty and observe the uncertainty level this solution also helps other people related to the research to observed the consequences of ecosystem degradation on a map which then encourages them to accept proposals for ecological risk prevention johnson et al 2011 chee et al 2016 in addition for the bn gis approach further research is required for developing large scale methods for optimising the models used by land ecologists and managers these include transparent modelling processes the application of different types of data and communication platform construction however information regarding the utilisation of the spatial bn model in the study of land degradation is limited in the present study the spatial bn model was used to test a decision making tool for the prevention of ecological risks of the land ecosystem in the mining city of daye china netica norsys software corporation 1998 2010 a bn software package frequently used in ecosystem service modelling research chen and pollino 2012 landuyt et al 2013 forio et al 2015 was used to evaluate the performance of the bn model the scenario simulation was designed to identify prior decision making options for stakeholders in land management and cross validation was performed to confirm the validity of our assessment model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area daye city 114 31 115 20 e 29 40 30 15 n fig 1 is located in the south eastern part of the hubei province in central china this area is rich in mineral deposits and has well developed mining and metallurgy industries the ecosystem in and around the city is comprehensive and it consists of lakes rivers forests mines arable lands gardens and urban and rural residential areas the entire study area is 1566 3 km2 at present the ever increasing industries have been harming the ecosystem in the entire area which has resulted in dysfunctions of the ecosystem services including soil contamination water pollution and loss of arable land 2 2 framework of risk prevention of land ecosystem on a regional scale the ecological risk assessment concept of the united states environmental protection agency usepa with respect to land ecosystem degradation suter 1993 usepa 1998 is introduced in the present study several key factors including sources stressors and endpoints were identified and selected as research variables previous papers have been reviewed to obtain existing knowledge regarding model construction on the basis of the bn model a conceptual model was developed to determine the cause effect relationships among the variables to describe the land degradation in daye city the various types of data obtained were spatialized in the gis the relationships among the variables were quantified by defining the conditional probability table cpt of each node the spatial bn model was combined with the gis for the model operation scenarios were simulated to assist decision makers in identifying prior options for risk prevention in the future a sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the ability of our model and cross validation was performed for validating the model data imperfections and knowledge gaps were identified in the evaluation of the model operation to guide future research these procedures are similar to those of previous studies comprising the use of bn fig 2 2 3 building of bayesian networks 2 3 1 identification of variables for bn on the basis of previous bns cain 2001 marcot et al 2006 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 chen and pollion 2012 we initially identified all the possible components as variables including the problem formulation and candidate stressors and their possible sources we formed a research group before the present study was started the group members performed field investigations and conducted a literature review by reading related papers in web of science the problem formulation is a critical step in the determination of the evaluation range and target of ecological risk prevention in a land ecosystem suter 1993 guo et al 2017 the problems identified in this research reflected the current condition of the land degradation in daye city our problem formulation was based on a comprehensive literature review which aided in conducting related field investigations and surveys mccloskey et al 2011 chen and pollion 2012 franco et al 2016 in addition the problem formulation was supported by subsequent laboratory examinations and by the historical data provided by related local government departments seminars were then conducted to refine the identified problems in order to focus on the major problems in the present study 11 problems were identified as follows 1 soil quality deterioration 2 soil contamination 3 water shortage 4 water quality deterioration 5 threats to public safety and health 6 biodiversity decrease 7 eco resilience reduction eco resilience is the ability of a complex eco system to recover quickly after suffering severe disruptions 8 dysfunction in landscape aesthetics 9 decline in land productivity 10 shortage of usable land and 11 population overload see appendix 1 for the detailed description of these problems the candidate stressors were determined according to the aforementioned problems by a panel of experts i e professors and local officials from different but related fields e g ecology agronomy geology land resources and urban development these stressors have a physical chemical and biological effect on the land ecosystem in our study area fourteen stressors were identified as follows 1 atmospheric deposition 2 alteration of the earth surface runoff 3 alteration of underground runoff 4 destruction of the earth surface 5 desertification 6 removal of habitat 7 space occupation 8 accumulation of heavy metals 9 organic pollutants 10 pathogens 11 soil erosion 12 soil salinization 13 nutrient runoff and 14 eutrophication see appendix 2 candidate risk sources for the land degradation in daye city were identified under the following conditions i familiarity with the local economic development pattern ii concern with major pollutant emitting enterprises iii interview conducted with local residents suffering from past hazardous events and iv potential disturbances identified according to our knowledge usepa 2000 yu et al 2010 teng et al 2014 twenty sources of stressors were determined as follows 1 storms and floods 2 geological disasters 3 extreme weather 4 acid rain 5 urbanisation 6 population growth 7 intensive land reclamation 8 mining 9 transportation 10 water projects 11 lake area reclamation 12 industrial point source pollution 13 solid waste piles 14 application of pesticides 15 application of fertilizers 16 application of mulch plastic films 17 aquaculture 18 irrigation 19 lumbering and 20 grazing see appendix 3 generally in terms of the interactions among the aforementioned problems stressors and sources the sources released stressors and the stressors caused problems these interactions damaged the biotic and abiotic feedback mechanisms of the land ecosystem suter 1993 guo et al 2017 therefore these interactions should be represented by several hypotheses in the form of a conceptual model platt 1994 huelsenbeck et al 2001 jerald and omland 2004 a conceptual model fig 3 was constructed to represent the complex interactions among the sources stressors and endpoints the nodes representing different spatial scales and complexities could be nested with each other and their linkages presented the cause effect relationships through the abovementioned causal hypotheses jakeman et al 2006 chen and pollion 2012 the model eventually characterised the process of land degradation i e risk formation by describing several ecological mechanisms our model comprised 46 nodes and 64 arrows the majority of which were included in our model to represent the general status of land degradation in the study area not all the factors mentioned in the model were dealt with in the bn model but they do represent the complete profile of the land degradation in the study area future research may take into consideration all the factors that form the general knowledge of ecology chen and pollion 2012 2 3 2 spatial bn implementation 2 3 2 1 bayesian networks a bn is a graphical multivariate statistical model that comprises two structural components namely 1 a qualitative component that consists of a causal network which includes all the important variables and cause effect interactions among these variables and 2 a quantitative component that consists of conditional probabilities which quantify the aforementioned cause effect relationships marcot et al 2006 landuyt et al 2013 bns are often referred to as directed acyclic graphs a bn consists of nodes that visually represent the key variables and arrows that represent the causal relationships among the variables each variable is assigned multiple states aguilera et al 2013 landuyt et al 2013 franco et al 2016 the entire catalogue of these correlations comprises the cpts the strength of the relationships among the variables is defined in the cpt attached to each node the cpts specify the degree of belief that a node will be in a particular state as determined by the state of the parent nodes the bayesian theorem encapsulates the mathematical rules governing the propagation of probabilities based on the conditional dependency of variables combined with data to produce posterior probabilities thus the bn is generally used to perform various simulations based on the specified node corresponding to the input values and by noting the changes in the probability distributions of the output nodes kininmonth et al 2010 grêt regamey et al 2013 the bayesian theorem is mathematically expressed as follows 1 p a i b p a j p b a j i n 1 p a i p b a i where b is an event ai refers to all the possible causes of event b p ai refers to the prior probabilities derived from a priori data and i represents a particular variable castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 johnson et al 2010a fienen et al 2013 the use of probabilities enables a bn to handle uncertain input variables and uncertain relationships among all the nodes in the model these uncertainties propagate through the network and result in model predictions that explicitly account for uncertainties kjaerulff and madsen 2008 pearl et al 2010 landuyt et al 2015 in the current study the bn modelling software netica norsys software corporation 2010 was used to solve the above equation uusitalo 2007 voinov and bousquet 2010 for a detailed description of bns readers may refer to the studies of chen and pollino 2012 and marcot and penman 2019 2 3 2 2 embedding bn into gis our spatially explicit approach was used in the decision making processes by combining bn with gis while following the process outlined by smith et al 2007 all the data present in the network nodes were determined as a set of gis variables in arcgis 10 2 this data set was processed by the bn model as a case and was simulated in netica the cpts were used to quantify the relationships of the related nodes with their parent nodes these relationships depend on the state of each node the tool used spatially explicit input data as raster grids and then executed the bn inference calculations for each raster grid cell of the input data smith et al 2007 johnson et al 2011 the outputs were expressed as raster maps wherein the probability distribution for the target variables was calculated by bn inference the spatially explicit results were acceptable to various land resource stakeholders landuyt et al 2014 gonzalez redin et al 2016 2 4 data and parameter design 2 4 1 data collection and processing field soil from the study area was sampled in 2013 a total of 225 valid samples were obtained from the entire study area the samples were obtained from rural settlements farmlands benchlands and irrigation districts surrounding the industrial and mining areas which are the main land use types in daye city they also represented the opinions of the research group on field investigation the soil degradation was investigated on the basis of the following indicators soil degeneration and soil erosion heavy metal pollution caused by mining and mineral processing has attracted the attention of several local researchers wu et al 2009 wei and yang 2010 wu et al 2010 he et al 2013 ma et al 2013 teng et al 2014 in view of funding constraints and substandard laboratory conditions the research group selected cu pb and cd and determined their content levels in the 225 soil samples atomic absorption spectrophotometry was performed in the laboratory to determine the content levels of cu pb and cd kemper and sommer 2002 viscarra rossel et al 2006 ferrier et al 2009 ren et al 2009 pandit et al 2010 liu et al 2011 barium chromate spectrophotometry was performed to determine the content level of as ren et al 2009 zheng et al 2011 the nemerow index yang et al 2011 hu et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 was applied to calculate the individual values of the heavy metals i e cu pb cd and as and thus obtain the nemerow composite index the aforementioned soil component measurements and heavy metal content data based on geographical coordinates i e global positioning system data of the soil samples as well as the remote sensing image and elevation data of the study area were processed as spatial data and integrated in a gis based on interviews and a survey conducted by the daye environmental protection bureau the research group obtained the quarterly monitoring data of the water quality in water bodies located at 37 monitoring points including the main rivers lakes and sensitive waters from 2013 to 2016 the group selected ammonia nitrogen content eutrophication and heavy metal pollution as the three criteria for water quality deterioration the group then determined the level of the water quality degradation i e heavy moderate or light pollution based on the average level calculated from the data collected in the four year period from 2013 2016 gis spatial processing was performed for the selected indices based on the geographical information of the sampling points the research group along with the daye city land resources bureau frequently organised investigations on ecological environment damage caused by mining in daye city from 2013 to 2016 the investigation sites included copper iron coal gold and silver mines as well as related smelting sites ore dressing sites quarries tailing reservoirs coal gangue dumps and open metal mines the problems included over 800 damages to the earth surface and vegetation 349 geological hazards e g collapse gob areas excavation landslide and water depletion 550 land damages caused by solid waste dumping and 1294 land plaques covering an area of 6943 58 ha in terms of actual harm the research group conducted a field investigation plotting and performed scene photography to obtain the information of each plot an expert group performed intra industry interpretation on site verification and hazard level classification finally the research group performed spatial processing based on the statistical information of each plot the data for waste water discharge and solid waste piling were regional and could not be spatially processed therefore we used industrial point source pollution as a variable to present the discharge and piling this variable was characterised by the kernel density distribution in the gis threats to public safety and health are an important ecological function indicator cheng and nathanail 2009 pinedo et al 2014 huang et al 2016 in view of the characteristics of the traditional mining city of daye the main threat is posed by mines that cause heavy metal pollution and water pollution and result in geological hazards in the surrounding environment the health risk was evaluated via an exposure risk assessment korre et al 2002 gay and korre 2006 li et al 2014d the extent of the impact of heavy metal pollution was considered and the severity of the threat to human health was determined based on the euclidean distance in the gis bien et al 2004 hooker and nathanail 2006 morra et al 2006 poggio and vrščaj 2009 the data application of the land use category was based on the land use maps of daye city of 2013 a large amount of data was obtained from the daye statistical yearbook and from social surveys such as data collected by the daye environmental protection bureau and from the historical information of daye 1949 2010 the data regarding the variables affecting the land degradation in daye city were too complex for general models to process nevertheless the bn model could manage these data landuyt et al 2013 all the above processes were performed in arcgis 10 2 2 4 2 parameter design the strength of the relationships between the nodes was quantified in the cpts attached to each node the relationships between the states of parent and child nodes were quantified within the cpts that presented the probability of a child node taking on each discrete state which is determined by the state of each parent node marcot et al 2001 pollino et al 2007b chen and pollino 2012 the states of marginal nodes were determined based on their own probability distributions marcot et al 2006 chen and pollino 2012 to ensure that the states of the parent and child nodes interacted logically and to avoid bias a combination of empirical data laboratory data past experiences expert opinions and a literature review was used to estimate the conditional probabilities smith et al 2007 pollino et al 2007b the ranges of 0 5 5 10 and 10 20 represent variables under low medium and high conditions respectively for example the cpt for heavy metal accumulation table 1 comprised three states i e high medium and low which were determined by three parent nodes i e application of pesticides industrial point sources and mining 2 5 model application 2 5 1 bn sensitivity a sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the sensitivity of the changes in the probabilities of query nodes when the parameters and inputs changed marcot et al 2006 two types of sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the relative influence of the variables in the network kjaerulff and madsen 2008 norsys 1998 entropy h x is often used to evaluate the uncertainty or randomness of a variable x and is characterised by a probability distribution p x as follows korb and nicholson 2004 pollino et al 2007a 2 h x h x i x n i 1 n p x i l o g x i where x and x represent a variable i represents a particular variable and n denotes the number of all the variables the entropy measures were used to assess the average information required in addition to the current knowledge to specify a particular alternative the most uncertain variables were identified according to the ranked probabilities pollino et al 2007a mutual information mi was used to measure the effect of one variable x on another y korb and nicholson 2004 as follows 3 i x y h x h x y where i x y was the mi between the variables this measure reported the expected degree of divergence of the joint probability of x and y from what it would be if x was independent of y korb and nicholson 2004 if i x y was equal to zero x and y were mutually independent pearl 1988 johnson et al 2010b to determine the degree of independence between the variables in a pair in the bn we performed a sensitivity analysis 2 5 2 model validation the validation is performed to assess the predictive performance of bn models fienen and plant 2015 forio et al 2015 we applied k fold cross validation kfcv which can handle the problem of overfitting and complexity in bn models in the kfcv firstly the dataset was randomly split into k groups each group was considered as the validation set for model building and the remaining groups were treated as a training dataset for evaluating the built models this process was repeated k times and the performances of the bn models were then summarised k was considered as 10 which is a value that was widely adopted in previous studies marcot 2012 beuzen and simmons 2019 the performance of the bn models was assessed based on a useful statistic namely the skill sk the value of sk was between 0 and 1 and a higher score of sk indicated the better performance of the models sk was calculated as follows 4 s k 1 σ e 2 σ 0 2 where σ e 2 was the mean squared error between the observations and σ 0 2 predictions and was the variance of the observationswe selected two variables for the validation skill analysis in the bn simulation namely soil pollution and water quality deterioration 2 5 3 scenario design an important finding of this research was that the bn model could be directly used as a management tool by simply setting the state of an endpoint to a desired level and thereby essentially solving the model backwards ayre and landis 2012 landuyt et al 2013 subtle changes in environment management may result in large changes in the simulation for sensitive endpoints this inherent flexibility of use makes the model a powerful tool for resource management because alternative management scenarios can be easily evaluated for the desired objectives in the current study four different scenarios were designed while taking into consideration the interests of various stakeholders to ensure that the simulation results could be referred to by stakeholders for favourable decision making scenario 1 the land resources department was the most concerned regarding the amount of land resource supply which is closely related to regional economic development the node of usable land shortage was thus set at an extremely low state to identify changes in the probability distribution of the relevant variables scenario 2 the environmental protection department was primarily concerned with soil pollution and water pollution the nodes of soil contamination and water quality deterioration were thus set at an extremely low state scenario 3 the agricultural production department was most interested in land productivity the node of land productivity was thus set at an extremely high state scenario 4 on the basis of the sustainable development of resource exhausted cities the local government seemed to value mining the nodes of mining were thus set at an extremely low state 3 results 3 1 baseline training the base scenario of the bn model showed that the nodes of soil contamination threats to public safety and health and water quality deterioration had high probability distributions i e 42 2 38 5 and 17 5 respectively meanwhile the nodes of eco resilience reduction water shortage and decline in land productivity had moderate probability distributions 32 4 36 7 and 29 3 respectively furthermore the nodes of soil quality deterioration population overload and biodiversity decrease had low probability distributions 54 43 and 41 5 respectively fig 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis the node of soil quality degradation was the most sensitive concerning nutrient runoff intensive land reclamation irrigation and mining mi 0 31 0 24 0 21 and 0 17 respectively however prior to the experiment the expected sources of soil quality degradation comprised the application of pesticides and fertilizers the mi of which were 0 07 and 0 11 respectively the node of water quality deterioration was the most sensitive to aquaculture instead of the industrial point source and the corresponding mi was rather high at 0 19 the node of water shortage was the most sensitive to irrigation instead of lake area reclamation mi 0 18 and 0 13 respectively the nodes of the soil contamination earth surface destruction and heavy metal accumulation were sensitive to threats to public safety and health mi 0 22 0 13 and 0 08 respectively the majority of the other nodes were sensitive to lake area reclamation and mining for example the nodes of water shortage eco resilience reduction biodiversity decrease and land productivity reduction were all sensitive to the lake area reclamation mi 0 13 0 16 0 24 and 0 28 respectively table 2 3 3 model performance table 3 shows the mean for both the variables of soil contamination and water quality deterioration for obtaining the skill mean over bins through a ten fold cross validation the small differences in the performance of the test and training sets suggest that our bn overfitting is minimal for example the performance of the soil contamination bin evaluated through one four and six fold cross validation was similar however the performance of water quality deterioration was less stable in the nine and ten fold cross validations table 3 figs 5 and 6 depict the changes in calibration and validation performance in the ten fold cross validation in terms of the performance of soil contamination no significant change was found in the calibration line and the verification line reached its peak value of 0 6976 at 7 bins and then decreased fig 5 although the verification line rose within the range of 4 5 bins the bins all showed a decline in the performance of water quality deterioration fig 6 3 4 scenario analysis the results of scenario 1 showed that the probabilities of the nodes of urbanisation and decline in land productivity at a high state decreased by 18 14 and 14 5 respectively furthermore we also found that the probability of the related nodes of eco resilience reduction at a low state increased by 4 9 the probability of the node of soil pollution at the medium state increased by 6 1 and the probability of the cause node

respectively and the probability of the cause node of the mine at a high state increased by 6 83 fig 7 the space simulation based on the node of urbanisation showed that the probability of 11 5 of all the grids decreased at a high state over an area of 177 km2 the probability of 15 of all the nodes decreased at a medium state over an area of 230 km2 and the probability of 13 and 17 3 of the grids increased at a low state with no distribution over an area of 199 km2 and 266 km2 respectively fig 8 the results of scenario 2 showed that the probability of the node of heavy metal accumulation at a high state was reduced by 27 25 we also found that the probability of the cause node of mining at a high state decreased by 4 1 the probability of the node of industrial point sources pollution at a medium state decreased by 14 95 in addition the probabilities of the nodes of eutrophication and organic pollutants at a low state increased by 19 and 33 6 respectively and the probabilities of the nodes of mining and aquaculture at a none state increased by 33 and 26 9 respectively fig 9 the spatial simulation based on the node of mining showed that the probability of 35 5 of all the nodes at a high state decreased over an area of 554 km2 in the central and eastern regions the probability of 52 of the grids at a medium state decreased over an area of 811 km2 in the western and northern regions and the probability of 18 5 and 37 of the grids at a low state and no distribution increased over an area of 289 km2 and 577 km2 respectively in the majority of the north central regions fig 10 the results of scenario 3 showed that the probabilities of the nodes of habitat removal and intensive land reclamation at a high state increased by 21 6 and 13 3 respectively we also found that the probability of the related nodes of urbanisation transportation lake area reclamation and mining at a high state increased by 42 95 2 2 17 36 and 15 62 respectively the probability of the node of soil degradation at a low state decreased by 15 1 and the probabilities of the related nodes of earth surface destruction and nutrient runoff at a low state also decreased by 19 and 12 7 respectively furthermore the probability of the node of population overload at a low state decreased by 19 9 fig 11 the spatial simulation based on the node of habitat removal showed that the probability of 6 7 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 87 km2 in the southern regions the probability of 7 3 of the grids at a medium state increased over an area of 114 km2 in the western and central regions and the probability of 16 7 of the grids at a low state increased over an area of 262 km2 for very few southern regions fig 12 the results of scenario 4 showed that the probability of the node of threat to public safety and health at a high state decreased by 4 5 we also found that the probabilities of the related nodes of water quality deterioration and soil contamination at a high state decreased by 6 and 7 8 respectively the probability of the node of earth surface destruction at a medium state decreased by 5 7 and the probabilities of the influenced nodes of soil quality deterioration and dysfunction in landscape aesthetics at a high state also decreased by 2 and 3 7 respectively in addition the probabilities of the nodes of heavy metal accumulation and shortage in usable land at a low state increased by 15 and 5 8 respectively fig 13 the spatial simulation based on the node of threats to public safety and health showed that the probability of 8 4 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 135 km2 in the central regions the probability of 6 2 of the grid at a medium state also decreased over an area of 103 km2 in the central regions and the probability of 14 3 of the grid at a low state increased over an area of 222 km2 in the northwest and southeast regions fig 14 4 discussion the bn gis model that we have developed is an explanatory tool for providing visual evidence for decision making for the prevention of ecological risks in the ecosystem and can be observed as a new approach to research on land resource management the multi factor investigation in the present research can be used to realise the comprehensive protection of an entire land ecosystem on a large scale meanwhile characterising the complex interactive relationships is helpful in interpreting the mechanism of land degradation and formulating appropriate management suggestions the bn was combined with the gis data layer and prior knowledge to determine the probability relationship of each node the probabilities of all the target nodes at different states in our study clearly increased or decreased meanwhile the spatial simulation presented clear variations in distribution under the gis operation in particular the spatial visualisation of the area wherein the probabilities occurred was helpful in understanding the actual ecological processes the sensitivity analysis revealed the relationships among the variables and indicated the complex causes of land degradation at the regional scale for example the serious degradation of the soil quality is caused by mining intensive land reclamation and irrigation because mining produces waste water solid waste piles damage the nutrient profile of soil intensive land reclamation exhausts soil fertility and abusive irrigation results in soil salinization li et al 2014c singh 2015 in addition our model was able to identify the key factors for effectively proving our hypotheses identify knowledge gaps and provide a direction for future research cross validation greatly enhances the validation of the bn application in various ecosystems chen and pollino 2012 marcot 2012 in our study the status of calibration and validation soil contamination 0 006 0 0793 water quality deterioration 0 019 0 153 indicated that the performance was reliable and stable our modelling approach may thus be applied to other complicated land ecosystems the scenario simulation was widely accepted by the land resource management stakeholders who were able to express their concerns regarding their respective interests ticehurst et al 2011 celio et al 2014 the obvious spatial heterogeneity reflected the close relationships between human economic activities and land ecological process at the regional scale in particular the visualisation of the results obtained using the bn gis model helped the stakeholders in examining the effects of strategies proposed to ensure that prior options were considered instead moreover problems arising owing to land degradation are closely related to regional economic development and research in this field exhibits dynamically spatial and temporal characteristics furthermore our proposed bn gis framework could fit in with frequently updated land resource data sets 5 conclusion in this study a bn gis model which is a spatial bn approach was established as a decision making tool for the prevention of ecological risks in a land ecosystem at the regional scale the model revealed the mechanisms of land ecosystem degradation by integrating prior knowledge and data collected in the field which could help policy makers in their work meanwhile our hypothesis regarding the field investigation conducted before the experiment was verified and it reflects the close relationship between human economic activities and land ecological process for example intense irrigation depleted the soil quality with a relatively high mi of 0 21 thus confirming our original hypothesis that salinization was responsible the research involved different stakeholders throughout the process in order to significantly reduce disputes over the measures to be implemented for the prevention of ecological risks moreover this not only ensures the transparency of policy implementation but also promotes the establishment of a platform for discussing land resource protection in the future the specific locations identified via visual simulation helped the officials to identify the priorities in land conservation while avoiding costly blind actions for example the simulation in which the most severe measures for limit mining were taken into consideration can be used to reduce the threats to human health over an area of 135 km2 in the mining zone which is widely recognised by the local residents the conducted cross validation indicated that the performance of the bn gis model was reliable and it was effective in the present study the use of this novel method was more convenient for the development of bn modelling in ecological research however the policy makers strategies derived from our model are still required to be evaluated and confirmed in practice for land resource management in particular with respect to the factors of safety of human life we should focus our attention on the investigation of first line resources and the environment in mining cities according to each specific situation in order to implement timely measures and we must not be confined to experimental simulations however the bn has some limitations in that it cannot represent feedback loops and dynamic relationships uusitalo 2007 kelly et al 2013 these limitations may be addressed in future research declaration of competing interest the authors

24903,prevention of ecological risks in land ecosystems is crucial for environmental protection and sustainable land use with increasingly severe land degradation new and effective methods must be developed for the management of ecological risks in this study a conceptual decision making model in ecological risk prevention was developed using the bayesian belief network with a geographic information system gis for the regional scale land ecosystem in the traditional mining city of daye in central china based on the results of a sensitivity analysis the variable of eco resilience reduction was identified as the most sensitive to habitat removal with the highest mutual information at 0 71 the two variables of soil pollution and water quality deterioration were selected for a cross validation analysis and the changes in both the calibration and validation performance were very small the scenarios we considered based on the interests of various stakeholders presented the spatial distribution of the following regulative effects of various management measures on a regional scale 1 the variable of urbanisation showed that the probability of 11 5 of all the grids decreased at a high state over an area of 177 km2 2 the variable of mining showed that the probability of 35 5 of the all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 554 km2 3 the variable of habitat removal showed that the probability of 6 7 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 87 km2 and 4 the variable of health threats showed that the probability of 8 4 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 135 km2 the bayesian network gis based tools can support the decision making process used for ecological risk prevention in land ecosystems keywords regional scale ecological risks prevention decision making tool spatial bayesian network cross validation land ecosystem 1 introduction the functions of a land ecosystem such as supporting vegetative growth producing and maintaining biodiversity providing habitat for humans and other organisms purifying the environment and protecting soil and water and modifying climate are important ferretti and pomarico 2013 turner et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the reduction of the ecological functions of land causes damage to habitats biodiversity air water and soil which limit the regional economic development and human survival li et al 2014a bai et al 2014 bryan et al 2018 thus the ecological risk management of land ecosystems is attracting attention in research and administration globally li et al 2014b liang et al 2017 kang et al 2018 the decision making analysis for ecological risk prevention requires knowledge of the causes and mechanisms of land degradation and exploration of techniques and methods for controlling and restoring degraded land ecosystems ferretti and pomarico 2013 comino et al 2014 turner et al 2016 studies on the prevention of ecological risks in a land ecosystem are generally focused on the environment economy and social culture li et al 2014 turner et al 2016 guo et al 2017 the prevention of environmental degradation involves combating erosion salinization and desertification of soil damage to the natural landscape li et al 2014c ochoa cueva et al 2015 price et al 2015 kosmas et al 2017 soil contamination water quality deterioration and soil depletion guo et al 2014 kibblewhite 2012 pries et al 2008 xu et al 2016 the development of an agricultural economy requires the preservation of arable land reclamation of waste land and maintenance and improvement of land productivity eld initiative 2013 jackson et al 2013 a stable society relies on its land ecosystem for supporting sustainable human well being costanza et al 2013 iniesta arandia et al 2014 however previous studies have primarily been focused on the individual aspects of the land ecosystem with discreet results that did not provide effective guidance for realising the comprehensive protection of a complex ecosystem therefore an integrative approach to research involving multiple factors that function simultaneously and interactively in the entire land ecosystem has been proposed guo et al 2017 integrative research on ecological risk management often depends on the use of appropriate tools or models and it has been increasingly attracting the attention of researchers these researchers in this field have made valuable contributions such as multi agent systems for the decision making processes involved in forest management xu et al 2015 ahlqvist et al 2018 artificial intelligence models for simulating and predicting the risks of a land ecosystem liu et al 2018 tsai et al 2018 multi criteria decision making models for risk zoning and management of large areas li et al 2014b gallego et al 2019 souissi et al 2019 designs for an integrated risk index that can serve as a warning for implementing the appropriate regional development strategies partl et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and environmental risk mapping as guidance for risk minimisation in risk management and decision making ma et al 2013 maldonado et al 2016 petus et al 2016 the aforementioned tools and models however can still be further improved when applied to research on land ecosystems firstly they can be applied primarily in mono factor stud ies as has been mentioned in this paper and they cannot provide motivation for the comprehensive risk prevention for a land ecosystem secondly they represent linear relationships between the factors of the land ecosystem and are unfit for research on nonlinear relationships in a land ecosystem guo et al 2015 w q zhou et al 2019 thirdly they cannot be used to simultaneously process multiple data fourthly they have been established based on single isolated issues and do not encourage researchers to formulate extensive and comprehensive hypotheses finally they have primarily been designed by researchers without involving the related stakeholders and the obtained results cannot be easily understood and accepted by the public to address the above drawbacks in this study we used the bayesian belief network bn model with a geographic information system gis which has been believed to be more scientific and powerful the bn model is a semi quantitative model that combines ecological models with expert knowledge and it has shown its effectiveness in studies on ecological issues marcot et al 2006 2017 chen and pollino 2012 the model reveals the complex ecological mechanisms underlying the results of previous research fienen et al 2013 mcdonald et al 2015 franco et al 2016 and helps researchers to present various valuable hypotheses landuyt et al 2013 chee et al 2016 marcot and penman 2019 that contribute to realising comprehensive and feasible research designs that then provide convincing results for the current work of land protection the emphasis is on the participation of different stakeholders voinov and bousquet 2010 luyet et al 2012 and the bn may provide such convenience various related stakeholders are involved in the research to help in identifying realistic and practical research objectives krueger et al 2012 dick et al 2018 the bn can process multi type data operate in a poor data collection environment uusitalo 2007 chen and pollino 2012 handle uncertainty aguilera et al 2013 be updated using follow up data and be combined with other algorithms for obtaining accurate calculations aitkenhead and aalders 2009 johnson et al 2011 marcot and penman 2019 furthermore with the advantages of its combination with other software programs the application of the bn also presents convenience in testing and validating marcot 2012 fienen et al 2013 for example the technique of cross validation that is successfully used in bn modelling prevents the occurrence of the overfitting resulting from overly complex bns marcot 2012 beuzen and simmons 2019 however the results obtained on using the bn model comprise abstract statistical data that research participants cannot understand the explicit benefits of and based on which they cannot immediately and confidently make decisions therefore it has been recommended that the bn model be used in combination with a gis for visualising the statistical data smith et al 2007 celio et al 2014 gonzalez redin et al 2016 such that researchers can locate the uncertainty and observe the uncertainty level this solution also helps other people related to the research to observed the consequences of ecosystem degradation on a map which then encourages them to accept proposals for ecological risk prevention johnson et al 2011 chee et al 2016 in addition for the bn gis approach further research is required for developing large scale methods for optimising the models used by land ecologists and managers these include transparent modelling processes the application of different types of data and communication platform construction however information regarding the utilisation of the spatial bn model in the study of land degradation is limited in the present study the spatial bn model was used to test a decision making tool for the prevention of ecological risks of the land ecosystem in the mining city of daye china netica norsys software corporation 1998 2010 a bn software package frequently used in ecosystem service modelling research chen and pollino 2012 landuyt et al 2013 forio et al 2015 was used to evaluate the performance of the bn model the scenario simulation was designed to identify prior decision making options for stakeholders in land management and cross validation was performed to confirm the validity of our assessment model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area daye city 114 31 115 20 e 29 40 30 15 n fig 1 is located in the south eastern part of the hubei province in central china this area is rich in mineral deposits and has well developed mining and metallurgy industries the ecosystem in and around the city is comprehensive and it consists of lakes rivers forests mines arable lands gardens and urban and rural residential areas the entire study area is 1566 3 km2 at present the ever increasing industries have been harming the ecosystem in the entire area which has resulted in dysfunctions of the ecosystem services including soil contamination water pollution and loss of arable land 2 2 framework of risk prevention of land ecosystem on a regional scale the ecological risk assessment concept of the united states environmental protection agency usepa with respect to land ecosystem degradation suter 1993 usepa 1998 is introduced in the present study several key factors including sources stressors and endpoints were identified and selected as research variables previous papers have been reviewed to obtain existing knowledge regarding model construction on the basis of the bn model a conceptual model was developed to determine the cause effect relationships among the variables to describe the land degradation in daye city the various types of data obtained were spatialized in the gis the relationships among the variables were quantified by defining the conditional probability table cpt of each node the spatial bn model was combined with the gis for the model operation scenarios were simulated to assist decision makers in identifying prior options for risk prevention in the future a sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the ability of our model and cross validation was performed for validating the model data imperfections and knowledge gaps were identified in the evaluation of the model operation to guide future research these procedures are similar to those of previous studies comprising the use of bn fig 2 2 3 building of bayesian networks 2 3 1 identification of variables for bn on the basis of previous bns cain 2001 marcot et al 2006 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 chen and pollion 2012 we initially identified all the possible components as variables including the problem formulation and candidate stressors and their possible sources we formed a research group before the present study was started the group members performed field investigations and conducted a literature review by reading related papers in web of science the problem formulation is a critical step in the determination of the evaluation range and target of ecological risk prevention in a land ecosystem suter 1993 guo et al 2017 the problems identified in this research reflected the current condition of the land degradation in daye city our problem formulation was based on a comprehensive literature review which aided in conducting related field investigations and surveys mccloskey et al 2011 chen and pollion 2012 franco et al 2016 in addition the problem formulation was supported by subsequent laboratory examinations and by the historical data provided by related local government departments seminars were then conducted to refine the identified problems in order to focus on the major problems in the present study 11 problems were identified as follows 1 soil quality deterioration 2 soil contamination 3 water shortage 4 water quality deterioration 5 threats to public safety and health 6 biodiversity decrease 7 eco resilience reduction eco resilience is the ability of a complex eco system to recover quickly after suffering severe disruptions 8 dysfunction in landscape aesthetics 9 decline in land productivity 10 shortage of usable land and 11 population overload see appendix 1 for the detailed description of these problems the candidate stressors were determined according to the aforementioned problems by a panel of experts i e professors and local officials from different but related fields e g ecology agronomy geology land resources and urban development these stressors have a physical chemical and biological effect on the land ecosystem in our study area fourteen stressors were identified as follows 1 atmospheric deposition 2 alteration of the earth surface runoff 3 alteration of underground runoff 4 destruction of the earth surface 5 desertification 6 removal of habitat 7 space occupation 8 accumulation of heavy metals 9 organic pollutants 10 pathogens 11 soil erosion 12 soil salinization 13 nutrient runoff and 14 eutrophication see appendix 2 candidate risk sources for the land degradation in daye city were identified under the following conditions i familiarity with the local economic development pattern ii concern with major pollutant emitting enterprises iii interview conducted with local residents suffering from past hazardous events and iv potential disturbances identified according to our knowledge usepa 2000 yu et al 2010 teng et al 2014 twenty sources of stressors were determined as follows 1 storms and floods 2 geological disasters 3 extreme weather 4 acid rain 5 urbanisation 6 population growth 7 intensive land reclamation 8 mining 9 transportation 10 water projects 11 lake area reclamation 12 industrial point source pollution 13 solid waste piles 14 application of pesticides 15 application of fertilizers 16 application of mulch plastic films 17 aquaculture 18 irrigation 19 lumbering and 20 grazing see appendix 3 generally in terms of the interactions among the aforementioned problems stressors and sources the sources released stressors and the stressors caused problems these interactions damaged the biotic and abiotic feedback mechanisms of the land ecosystem suter 1993 guo et al 2017 therefore these interactions should be represented by several hypotheses in the form of a conceptual model platt 1994 huelsenbeck et al 2001 jerald and omland 2004 a conceptual model fig 3 was constructed to represent the complex interactions among the sources stressors and endpoints the nodes representing different spatial scales and complexities could be nested with each other and their linkages presented the cause effect relationships through the abovementioned causal hypotheses jakeman et al 2006 chen and pollion 2012 the model eventually characterised the process of land degradation i e risk formation by describing several ecological mechanisms our model comprised 46 nodes and 64 arrows the majority of which were included in our model to represent the general status of land degradation in the study area not all the factors mentioned in the model were dealt with in the bn model but they do represent the complete profile of the land degradation in the study area future research may take into consideration all the factors that form the general knowledge of ecology chen and pollion 2012 2 3 2 spatial bn implementation 2 3 2 1 bayesian networks a bn is a graphical multivariate statistical model that comprises two structural components namely 1 a qualitative component that consists of a causal network which includes all the important variables and cause effect interactions among these variables and 2 a quantitative component that consists of conditional probabilities which quantify the aforementioned cause effect relationships marcot et al 2006 landuyt et al 2013 bns are often referred to as directed acyclic graphs a bn consists of nodes that visually represent the key variables and arrows that represent the causal relationships among the variables each variable is assigned multiple states aguilera et al 2013 landuyt et al 2013 franco et al 2016 the entire catalogue of these correlations comprises the cpts the strength of the relationships among the variables is defined in the cpt attached to each node the cpts specify the degree of belief that a node will be in a particular state as determined by the state of the parent nodes the bayesian theorem encapsulates the mathematical rules governing the propagation of probabilities based on the conditional dependency of variables combined with data to produce posterior probabilities thus the bn is generally used to perform various simulations based on the specified node corresponding to the input values and by noting the changes in the probability distributions of the output nodes kininmonth et al 2010 grêt regamey et al 2013 the bayesian theorem is mathematically expressed as follows 1 p a i b p a j p b a j i n 1 p a i p b a i where b is an event ai refers to all the possible causes of event b p ai refers to the prior probabilities derived from a priori data and i represents a particular variable castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 johnson et al 2010a fienen et al 2013 the use of probabilities enables a bn to handle uncertain input variables and uncertain relationships among all the nodes in the model these uncertainties propagate through the network and result in model predictions that explicitly account for uncertainties kjaerulff and madsen 2008 pearl et al 2010 landuyt et al 2015 in the current study the bn modelling software netica norsys software corporation 2010 was used to solve the above equation uusitalo 2007 voinov and bousquet 2010 for a detailed description of bns readers may refer to the studies of chen and pollino 2012 and marcot and penman 2019 2 3 2 2 embedding bn into gis our spatially explicit approach was used in the decision making processes by combining bn with gis while following the process outlined by smith et al 2007 all the data present in the network nodes were determined as a set of gis variables in arcgis 10 2 this data set was processed by the bn model as a case and was simulated in netica the cpts were used to quantify the relationships of the related nodes with their parent nodes these relationships depend on the state of each node the tool used spatially explicit input data as raster grids and then executed the bn inference calculations for each raster grid cell of the input data smith et al 2007 johnson et al 2011 the outputs were expressed as raster maps wherein the probability distribution for the target variables was calculated by bn inference the spatially explicit results were acceptable to various land resource stakeholders landuyt et al 2014 gonzalez redin et al 2016 2 4 data and parameter design 2 4 1 data collection and processing field soil from the study area was sampled in 2013 a total of 225 valid samples were obtained from the entire study area the samples were obtained from rural settlements farmlands benchlands and irrigation districts surrounding the industrial and mining areas which are the main land use types in daye city they also represented the opinions of the research group on field investigation the soil degradation was investigated on the basis of the following indicators soil degeneration and soil erosion heavy metal pollution caused by mining and mineral processing has attracted the attention of several local researchers wu et al 2009 wei and yang 2010 wu et al 2010 he et al 2013 ma et al 2013 teng et al 2014 in view of funding constraints and substandard laboratory conditions the research group selected cu pb and cd and determined their content levels in the 225 soil samples atomic absorption spectrophotometry was performed in the laboratory to determine the content levels of cu pb and cd kemper and sommer 2002 viscarra rossel et al 2006 ferrier et al 2009 ren et al 2009 pandit et al 2010 liu et al 2011 barium chromate spectrophotometry was performed to determine the content level of as ren et al 2009 zheng et al 2011 the nemerow index yang et al 2011 hu et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 was applied to calculate the individual values of the heavy metals i e cu pb cd and as and thus obtain the nemerow composite index the aforementioned soil component measurements and heavy metal content data based on geographical coordinates i e global positioning system data of the soil samples as well as the remote sensing image and elevation data of the study area were processed as spatial data and integrated in a gis based on interviews and a survey conducted by the daye environmental protection bureau the research group obtained the quarterly monitoring data of the water quality in water bodies located at 37 monitoring points including the main rivers lakes and sensitive waters from 2013 to 2016 the group selected ammonia nitrogen content eutrophication and heavy metal pollution as the three criteria for water quality deterioration the group then determined the level of the water quality degradation i e heavy moderate or light pollution based on the average level calculated from the data collected in the four year period from 2013 2016 gis spatial processing was performed for the selected indices based on the geographical information of the sampling points the research group along with the daye city land resources bureau frequently organised investigations on ecological environment damage caused by mining in daye city from 2013 to 2016 the investigation sites included copper iron coal gold and silver mines as well as related smelting sites ore dressing sites quarries tailing reservoirs coal gangue dumps and open metal mines the problems included over 800 damages to the earth surface and vegetation 349 geological hazards e g collapse gob areas excavation landslide and water depletion 550 land damages caused by solid waste dumping and 1294 land plaques covering an area of 6943 58 ha in terms of actual harm the research group conducted a field investigation plotting and performed scene photography to obtain the information of each plot an expert group performed intra industry interpretation on site verification and hazard level classification finally the research group performed spatial processing based on the statistical information of each plot the data for waste water discharge and solid waste piling were regional and could not be spatially processed therefore we used industrial point source pollution as a variable to present the discharge and piling this variable was characterised by the kernel density distribution in the gis threats to public safety and health are an important ecological function indicator cheng and nathanail 2009 pinedo et al 2014 huang et al 2016 in view of the characteristics of the traditional mining city of daye the main threat is posed by mines that cause heavy metal pollution and water pollution and result in geological hazards in the surrounding environment the health risk was evaluated via an exposure risk assessment korre et al 2002 gay and korre 2006 li et al 2014d the extent of the impact of heavy metal pollution was considered and the severity of the threat to human health was determined based on the euclidean distance in the gis bien et al 2004 hooker and nathanail 2006 morra et al 2006 poggio and vrščaj 2009 the data application of the land use category was based on the land use maps of daye city of 2013 a large amount of data was obtained from the daye statistical yearbook and from social surveys such as data collected by the daye environmental protection bureau and from the historical information of daye 1949 2010 the data regarding the variables affecting the land degradation in daye city were too complex for general models to process nevertheless the bn model could manage these data landuyt et al 2013 all the above processes were performed in arcgis 10 2 2 4 2 parameter design the strength of the relationships between the nodes was quantified in the cpts attached to each node the relationships between the states of parent and child nodes were quantified within the cpts that presented the probability of a child node taking on each discrete state which is determined by the state of each parent node marcot et al 2001 pollino et al 2007b chen and pollino 2012 the states of marginal nodes were determined based on their own probability distributions marcot et al 2006 chen and pollino 2012 to ensure that the states of the parent and child nodes interacted logically and to avoid bias a combination of empirical data laboratory data past experiences expert opinions and a literature review was used to estimate the conditional probabilities smith et al 2007 pollino et al 2007b the ranges of 0 5 5 10 and 10 20 represent variables under low medium and high conditions respectively for example the cpt for heavy metal accumulation table 1 comprised three states i e high medium and low which were determined by three parent nodes i e application of pesticides industrial point sources and mining 2 5 model application 2 5 1 bn sensitivity a sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the sensitivity of the changes in the probabilities of query nodes when the parameters and inputs changed marcot et al 2006 two types of sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the relative influence of the variables in the network kjaerulff and madsen 2008 norsys 1998 entropy h x is often used to evaluate the uncertainty or randomness of a variable x and is characterised by a probability distribution p x as follows korb and nicholson 2004 pollino et al 2007a 2 h x h x i x n i 1 n p x i l o g x i where x and x represent a variable i represents a particular variable and n denotes the number of all the variables the entropy measures were used to assess the average information required in addition to the current knowledge to specify a particular alternative the most uncertain variables were identified according to the ranked probabilities pollino et al 2007a mutual information mi was used to measure the effect of one variable x on another y korb and nicholson 2004 as follows 3 i x y h x h x y where i x y was the mi between the variables this measure reported the expected degree of divergence of the joint probability of x and y from what it would be if x was independent of y korb and nicholson 2004 if i x y was equal to zero x and y were mutually independent pearl 1988 johnson et al 2010b to determine the degree of independence between the variables in a pair in the bn we performed a sensitivity analysis 2 5 2 model validation the validation is performed to assess the predictive performance of bn models fienen and plant 2015 forio et al 2015 we applied k fold cross validation kfcv which can handle the problem of overfitting and complexity in bn models in the kfcv firstly the dataset was randomly split into k groups each group was considered as the validation set for model building and the remaining groups were treated as a training dataset for evaluating the built models this process was repeated k times and the performances of the bn models were then summarised k was considered as 10 which is a value that was widely adopted in previous studies marcot 2012 beuzen and simmons 2019 the performance of the bn models was assessed based on a useful statistic namely the skill sk the value of sk was between 0 and 1 and a higher score of sk indicated the better performance of the models sk was calculated as follows 4 s k 1 σ e 2 σ 0 2 where σ e 2 was the mean squared error between the observations and σ 0 2 predictions and was the variance of the observationswe selected two variables for the validation skill analysis in the bn simulation namely soil pollution and water quality deterioration 2 5 3 scenario design an important finding of this research was that the bn model could be directly used as a management tool by simply setting the state of an endpoint to a desired level and thereby essentially solving the model backwards ayre and landis 2012 landuyt et al 2013 subtle changes in environment management may result in large changes in the simulation for sensitive endpoints this inherent flexibility of use makes the model a powerful tool for resource management because alternative management scenarios can be easily evaluated for the desired objectives in the current study four different scenarios were designed while taking into consideration the interests of various stakeholders to ensure that the simulation results could be referred to by stakeholders for favourable decision making scenario 1 the land resources department was the most concerned regarding the amount of land resource supply which is closely related to regional economic development the node of usable land shortage was thus set at an extremely low state to identify changes in the probability distribution of the relevant variables scenario 2 the environmental protection department was primarily concerned with soil pollution and water pollution the nodes of soil contamination and water quality deterioration were thus set at an extremely low state scenario 3 the agricultural production department was most interested in land productivity the node of land productivity was thus set at an extremely high state scenario 4 on the basis of the sustainable development of resource exhausted cities the local government seemed to value mining the nodes of mining were thus set at an extremely low state 3 results 3 1 baseline training the base scenario of the bn model showed that the nodes of soil contamination threats to public safety and health and water quality deterioration had high probability distributions i e 42 2 38 5 and 17 5 respectively meanwhile the nodes of eco resilience reduction water shortage and decline in land productivity had moderate probability distributions 32 4 36 7 and 29 3 respectively furthermore the nodes of soil quality deterioration population overload and biodiversity decrease had low probability distributions 54 43 and 41 5 respectively fig 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis the node of soil quality degradation was the most sensitive concerning nutrient runoff intensive land reclamation irrigation and mining mi 0 31 0 24 0 21 and 0 17 respectively however prior to the experiment the expected sources of soil quality degradation comprised the application of pesticides and fertilizers the mi of which were 0 07 and 0 11 respectively the node of water quality deterioration was the most sensitive to aquaculture instead of the industrial point source and the corresponding mi was rather high at 0 19 the node of water shortage was the most sensitive to irrigation instead of lake area reclamation mi 0 18 and 0 13 respectively the nodes of the soil contamination earth surface destruction and heavy metal accumulation were sensitive to threats to public safety and health mi 0 22 0 13 and 0 08 respectively the majority of the other nodes were sensitive to lake area reclamation and mining for example the nodes of water shortage eco resilience reduction biodiversity decrease and land productivity reduction were all sensitive to the lake area reclamation mi 0 13 0 16 0 24 and 0 28 respectively table 2 3 3 model performance table 3 shows the mean for both the variables of soil contamination and water quality deterioration for obtaining the skill mean over bins through a ten fold cross validation the small differences in the performance of the test and training sets suggest that our bn overfitting is minimal for example the performance of the soil contamination bin evaluated through one four and six fold cross validation was similar however the performance of water quality deterioration was less stable in the nine and ten fold cross validations table 3 figs 5 and 6 depict the changes in calibration and validation performance in the ten fold cross validation in terms of the performance of soil contamination no significant change was found in the calibration line and the verification line reached its peak value of 0 6976 at 7 bins and then decreased fig 5 although the verification line rose within the range of 4 5 bins the bins all showed a decline in the performance of water quality deterioration fig 6 3 4 scenario analysis the results of scenario 1 showed that the probabilities of the nodes of urbanisation and decline in land productivity at a high state decreased by 18 14 and 14 5 respectively furthermore we also found that the probability of the related nodes of eco resilience reduction at a low state increased by 4 9 the probability of the node of soil pollution at the medium state increased by 6 1 and the probability of the cause node of industrial point sources pollution at the none state increased by 14 2 in addition the probabilities of the nodes of space occupation and habitat removal at a low state increased by 17 3 and 35 2 respectively and the probability of the cause node of the mine at a high state increased by 6 83 fig 7 the space simulation based on the node of urbanisation showed that the probability of 11 5 of all the grids decreased at a high state over an area of 177 km2 the probability of 15 of all the nodes decreased at a medium state over an area of 230 km2 and the probability of 13 and 17 3 of the grids increased at a low state with no distribution over an area of 199 km2 and 266 km2 respectively fig 8 the results of scenario 2 showed that the probability of the node of heavy metal accumulation at a high state was reduced by 27 25 we also found that the probability of the cause node of mining at a high state decreased by 4 1 the probability of the node of industrial point sources pollution at a medium state decreased by 14 95 in addition the probabilities of the nodes of eutrophication and organic pollutants at a low state increased by 19 and 33 6 respectively and the probabilities of the nodes of mining and aquaculture at a none state increased by 33 and 26 9 respectively fig 9 the spatial simulation based on the node of mining showed that the probability of 35 5 of all the nodes at a high state decreased over an area of 554 km2 in the central and eastern regions the probability of 52 of the grids at a medium state decreased over an area of 811 km2 in the western and northern regions and the probability of 18 5 and 37 of the grids at a low state and no distribution increased over an area of 289 km2 and 577 km2 respectively in the majority of the north central regions fig 10 the results of scenario 3 showed that the probabilities of the nodes of habitat removal and intensive land reclamation at a high state increased by 21 6 and 13 3 respectively we also found that the probability of the related nodes of urbanisation transportation lake area reclamation and mining at a high state increased by 42 95 2 2 17 36 and 15 62 respectively the probability of the node of soil degradation at a low state decreased by 15 1 and the probabilities of the related nodes of earth surface destruction and nutrient runoff at a low state also decreased by 19 and 12 7 respectively furthermore the probability of the node of population overload at a low state decreased by 19 9 fig 11 the spatial simulation based on the node of habitat removal showed that the probability of 6 7 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 87 km2 in the southern regions the probability of 7 3 of the grids at a medium state increased over an area of 114 km2 in the western and central regions and the probability of 16 7 of the grids at a low state increased over an area of 262 km2 for very few southern regions fig 12 the results of scenario 4 showed that the probability of the node of threat to public safety and health at a high state decreased by 4 5 we also found that the probabilities of the related nodes of water quality deterioration and soil contamination at a high state decreased by 6 and 7 8 respectively the probability of the node of earth surface destruction at a medium state decreased by 5 7 and the probabilities of the influenced nodes of soil quality deterioration and dysfunction in landscape aesthetics at a high state also decreased by 2 and 3 7 respectively in addition the probabilities of the nodes of heavy metal accumulation and shortage in usable land at a low state increased by 15 and 5 8 respectively fig 13 the spatial simulation based on the node of threats to public safety and health showed that the probability of 8 4 of all the grids at a high state decreased over an area of 135 km2 in the central regions the probability of 6 2 of the grid at a medium state also decreased over an area of 103 km2 in the central regions and the probability of 14 3 of the grid at a low state increased over an area of 222 km2 in the northwest and southeast regions fig 14 4 discussion the bn gis model that we have developed is an explanatory tool for providing visual evidence for decision making for the prevention of ecological risks in the ecosystem and can be observed as a new approach to research on land resource management the multi factor investigation in the present research can be used to realise the comprehensive protection of an entire land ecosystem on a large scale meanwhile characterising the complex interactive relationships is helpful in interpreting the mechanism of land degradation and formulating appropriate management suggestions the bn was combined with the gis data layer and prior knowledge to determine the probability relationship of each node the probabilities of all the target nodes at different states in our study clearly increased or decreased meanwhile the spatial simulation presented clear variations in distribution under the gis operation in particular the spatial visualisation of the area wherein the probabilities occurred was helpful in understanding the actual ecological processes the sensitivity analysis revealed the relationships among the variables and indicated the complex causes of land degradation at the regional scale for example the serious degradation of the soil quality is caused by mining intensive land reclamation and irrigation because mining produces waste water solid waste piles damage the nutrient profile of soil intensive land reclamation exhausts soil fertility and abusive irrigation results in soil salinization li et al 2014c singh 2015 in addition our model was able to identify the key factors for effectively proving our hypotheses identify knowledge gaps and provide a direction for future research cross validation greatly enhances the validation of the bn application in various ecosystems chen and pollino 2012 marcot 2012 in our study the status of calibration and validation soil contamination 0 006 0 0793 water quality deterioration 0 019 0 153 indicated that the performance was reliable and stable our modelling approach may thus be applied to other complicated land ecosystems the scenario simulation was widely accepted by the land resource management stakeholders who were able to express their concerns regarding their respective interests ticehurst et al 2011 celio et al 2014 the obvious spatial heterogeneity reflected the close relationships between human economic activities and land ecological process at the regional scale in particular the visualisation of the results obtained using the bn gis model helped the stakeholders in examining the effects of strategies proposed to ensure that prior options were considered instead moreover problems arising owing to land degradation are closely related to regional economic development and research in this field exhibits dynamically spatial and temporal characteristics furthermore our proposed bn gis framework could fit in with frequently updated land resource data sets 5 conclusion in this study a bn gis model which is a spatial bn approach was established as a decision making tool for the prevention of ecological risks in a land ecosystem at the regional scale the model revealed the mechanisms of land ecosystem degradation by integrating prior knowledge and data collected in the field which could help policy makers in their work meanwhile our hypothesis regarding the field investigation conducted before the experiment was verified and it reflects the close relationship between human economic activities and land ecological process for example intense irrigation depleted the soil quality with a relatively high mi of 0 21 thus confirming our original hypothesis that salinization was responsible the research involved different stakeholders throughout the process in order to significantly reduce disputes over the measures to be implemented for the prevention of ecological risks moreover this not only ensures the transparency of policy implementation but also promotes the establishment of a platform for discussing land resource protection in the future the specific locations identified via visual simulation helped the officials to identify the priorities in land conservation while avoiding costly blind actions for example the simulation in which the most severe measures for limit mining were taken into consideration can be used to reduce the threats to human health over an area of 135 km2 in the mining zone which is widely recognised by the local residents the conducted cross validation indicated that the performance of the bn gis model was reliable and it was effective in the present study the use of this novel method was more convenient for the development of bn modelling in ecological research however the policy makers strategies derived from our model are still required to be evaluated and confirmed in practice for land resource management in particular with respect to the factors of safety of human life we should focus our attention on the investigation of first line resources and the environment in mining cities according to each specific situation in order to implement timely measures and we must not be confined to experimental simulations however the bn has some limitations in that it cannot represent feedback loops and dynamic relationships uusitalo 2007 kelly et al 2013 these limitations may be addressed in future research declaration of competing interest the authors

24904,there were three basic forms of land system evolution fluctuation degradation and optimization based on the basic principles of system analysis this study established a framework for analyzing the evolution form of land systems according to the sustainability and the relationship between ascendency and overhead and then identified the evolution froms of land systems in shaanxi province the results showed that the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province was in a fluctuation form and its sustainability showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing between 1980 and 2015 the sustainability of land system evolution in loess plateau and guanzhong basin also increased first and then decreased the changes in loess plateau were particularly significant and reached an optimization form during 1990 2000 and 2005 2010 the land system evolution in guanzhong basin in a less sustainable form of fluctuation after 2000 land systems in qinba mountain were in an optimization form except for during 1980 1990 and 2005 2010 all three geographic units evolved in an optimization form between 1990 and 2000 and the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province has increased from north to south both in 2000 2005 and 2010 2015 however its sustainability weakened from north to south in 2005 2010 the verification of the results based on the information entropy change of the land systems showed that it was feasible and credible to distinguish the evolution form of land systems based on ascendency and overhead keywords land systems evolution form ascendency overhead sustainability 1 introduction the movement of matter is eternal for thousands of years land systems have been formed and evolved in the process of human use transformation and adaptation to the natural environment turner ii et al 2003 hurtt et al 2006 pongratz et al 2008 bauch et al 2016 castro et al 2016 there are three basic forms of land system evolution i fluctuation refers to changes in land systems within a certain threshold range when it is interfered internally or externally and land systems can still return to the normal state after the disturbance disappears ii degradation refers to the structural imbalance and functional attenuation of land systems under the influence of internal and external forces iii optimization refers to the enhanced vitality and functional stability of land systems under the influence of self organization and external interference accurately judging the evolution form of land systems is of great significance for regulating land use for sustainable development turner ii et al 2007 land system change is one of the important contents of global change research glp 2005 rounsevell et al 2012 turner ii et al 2013 verburg et al 2013 many scholars have conducted detailed and in depth research on land system change patterns processes mechanisms and impacts on the global goldewijk 2001 lambin and meyfroidt 2011 václavík et al 2013 bruckner et al 2015 continental boillat et al 2017 national liu and tian 2010 niedertscheider and erb 2014 regional spera et al 2016 peng et al 2017 and local scales moore et al 2012 johansson and isgren 2017 these studies provide a range of models and analytical frameworks for analyzing changes in land systems dai and liang 2018 such as the comprehensive index model of land use change for measuring macroscopic changes in regional land systems wang et al 2001 the land use dynamics model for gathering land system change hotspots liu et al 2003 the land use relative change model for highlighting regional differences in land system changes li et al 2015 and the gravity migration model that characterizes the spatial pattern change of land systems wang et al 2002 however the existing models and analytical frameworks are difficult to objectively and rationally distinguish the evolution forms of the land system with the development of system science the study of land system sustainability provides a good opportunity to solve this problem damien et al 2017 bryan et al 2018 at present land system sustainability evaluation methods mainly include three types index synthesis method energy value analysis method and systematic analysis method ness et al 2007 singh et al 2009 panyam et al 2019 the basic principle of the indicator synthesis method is to divide land systems into several subsystems as long as each subsystem is sustainable land systems are in a sustainable state this method ignores the integrity of land systems the selection of indicators is subjective and the evaluation results are only the relative sustainability of the vertical it is difficult to carry out horizontal comparison of different regions although the energy value analysis method establishes the relationship between the internal components of systems the determination of the energy value conversion rate is greatly influenced by human factors in addition the sustainability of land systems can only be judged from the process of change cai and li 2003 which is insufficiently considered by the indicator synthesis method and the energy value analysis method the systematic analysis method that has emerged in recent years evaluates the sustainability of systems mainly based on the balance between land system efficiency and overhead which provides a new perspective for the sustainable study of land systems huang and xu 2010 bodini 2012 fath 2014 huang 2015 kharrazi et al 2016 based on thermodynamics information theory network analysis etc ulanowicz et al 2009 quantitatively describe the overall behavior of systems with development capability ascendency reserve overhead and robustness etc and constructe a system evolution sustainability model ulanowlcz and norden 1990 ulanowicz et al 2009 the method is objective and effective and could evaluate the system change process which had been applied in the economic system and water resources system sustainability evaluation lietaer et al 2010 li and yang 2011 kharrazi et al 2013 therefore based on the basic principles of system analysis this study constructed an analytical framework for identifying the evolution forms of land systems based on the ascendency and overhead of land system evolution and shaanxi province was selected as the research object for empirical analysis aiming to expand the theory and content of land system research 2 material and methods 2 1 study area shaanxi province 105 29 111 15 e 31 42 39 35 n with a total area of about 205 700 km2 is located in the eastern part of northwest china it belongs to the zone of the continental monsoon climate and also stretches into both the north temperate zone and the semi tropic zone according to topography landform hydrology climate etc shaanxi province can be divided into three geographical units named from the north to the south as the loess plateau guanzhong basin and qinba mountain fig 1 in 2015 the loess plateau was mainly occupied by grassland 43 7 and cultivated land 32 6 farmland and built up land accounted for 71 5 and 14 1 of the total land area of guanzhong basin respectively the main land use types in qinba mountain were grassland 39 8 forest land 36 2 and cultivated land 22 8 2 2 data sources the data used in this study mainly included land use data 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 2015 and geographic unit boundary data fig 1 the land use data comes from the 1 100 000 land use database of the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn default aspx geographical unit boundary data was obtained from the shaanxi provincial geographical white paper 2015 2 3 identification of evolution forms of land system the theoretical basis for evaluating the sustainability of land systems based on the perspective of system evolution is that the sustainability of land system evolution is determined by the ascendency a and overhead φ the ascendency and overhead together constitute the evolutionary capability c of systems that is 1 c a φ i j t i j l o g t i j t s t 2 a i j t i j l o g t i j t s t t i t j 3 φ i j t i j l o g t i j 2 t i t j 4 t s t i j t i j 5 t i j t i j 6 t j i t i j tij refers to the substance information or energy flowing from the i subsystem to the j subsystem ti refers to all substance information or energy flowing out of the i subsystem tj refers to all substance information or energy flowing into the j subsystem tst indicates all substance information or energy that have metastasized in the system i j in this study ti tj tij and tst only involve changes in the area of land use type ascendency a characterizes system efficiency and refers to systems can fully demonstrate organized and effective behavior to maintain the integrity of systems hines et al 2018 overhead φ characterizes the potential for changes in a system meaning that the system has potential for recovery and diverse behavior when interfered by internal components or the external environment bodini 2012 fath 2014 if a system lacks ascendency it is difficult to meet the vitality required for the evolution of the system and the system is in a fluctuation form if the overhead is too small the system will be prone to collapse when subjected to external disturbances and the system is in a degeneration form fig 2 however the increase in systems ascendency will inevitably lead to a decline in the overhead and the increase in overhead will also cause systems to lose some ascendency only when the proportions of the two are suitable it can ensure that systems can effectively deal with the flow of matter information and energy and ensure that systems can recover from external disturbances thus achieving the sustainable development of systems and systems evolve in a optimization form ulanowicz et al 2009 huang 2015 therefore sustainability s of land system evolution can be defined as follows 7 s e log e a β log a β 8 α a c a a φ α 0 1 when α tends to 0 the ascendency tends to 0 and the system evolution sustainability also tends to 0 when α 1 the overhead is 0 s 0 β is the adjustment parameter the evolution of land systems is sustainable only when s exceeds a certain threshold st according to formula 7 it can be known that st corresponds to two values of α m and n in fig 2 that is the evolution of land systems is sustainable only when m α n in this way the value of α can be divided into three intervals 0 m m n n 1 by analyzing the relationship between ascendency and overhead the three value intervals of α can correspond to the three forms of land system evolution if α 0 m it indicates that the overhead of land systems is great and it lcaks of vitality for land system evolution which can be defined as a fluctuation form if α m n the ratio of ascendency and overhead is appropriate indicating the land system evolution is in an optimization form and if α n 1 land systems with excessive ascendency and small overhead lack of redundant options in times of disturbances and is prone to collapse which can be defined as a degeneration form according to calculation results of ulanowicz et al 2009 β should be 1 288 and it can be deduced that the system evolution is sustainable when α 0 2393 0 6971 the specific analysis and derivation process is detailed in the literature of ulanowicz et al 2009 according to the above analysis framework this study analyzed the form and sustainability of land system evolution from the perspective of land use type change the sustainability of the system evolution can be improved by adjusting the ascendency which required calculation of the marginal contribution of the first order path to ascendency 9 a t i j l o g t i j t s t t i t j log e for land systems in a fluctuation form strengthening the land use conversion path with great marginal contribution for ascendency can effectively improve the sustainability of land system evolution for land systems in a degeneration form it is necessary to reduce the land use conversion path with great marginal contribution for ascendency 2 4 information entropy change of land system the information entropy of land systems reflects the number of land use types and the uniformity of the area distribution of each land use type it characterizes the disorder degree of the system the larger the information entropy the higher the degree of disorder and vice versa the structure of a sustainable evolutionary system will tend to be more orderly and the information entropy should not increase therefore the sustainability and evolution form of land systems can be verified according to the change in information entropy the calculation formula of land system information entropy h is as follows pourghasemi et al 2012 10 h i 1 k m i i 1 k m i l n m i i 1 k m i mi i 1 2 k is the area of i th type of land use in the region and k is the total number of land use types the calculation formula of land system information entropy change δh is 11 δ h h e h s i 1 k m s i i 1 k m s i l n m s i i 1 k m s i i 1 k m e i i 1 k m e i l n m e i i 1 k m e i hs and he are the information entropy before and after the land system change respectively msi and mei are the area of a certain land use type before and after the land system change for example the information entropy change in land systems between 2010 and 2015 is 11 δ h 2010 2015 h 2015 h 2010 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of land system evolution form in shaanxi province from the perspective of land use area structure the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province fluctuated over time and it was the most sustainable during 1990 2000 the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province during 1980 1990 was in a fluctuation form with low sustainability table 1 during this period the lack of ascendancy was the main reason for the fluctuation of land systems in particular the conversion of grassland to construction land which concentrated in the loess plateau table 2 had the greatest negative contribution to ascendancy compared to the period of 1980 1990 the magnitude of change in land systems between 1990 and 2000 increased significantly table 3 nearly 1 300 km2 of unused land was converted to grassland due to increased vegetation coverage and the forest area increased by about 200 km2 which effectively enhanced ecosystem services and functions and improved the sustainability of land system evolution during 1990 2000 during 2000 2005 the main characteristics of land system changes in shaanxi province were the reduction of cultivated land and the increase of forest construction land and grassland table 4 the area of construction land increased by 10 4 while the area of forest land and grassland increased by less than 3 compared with 2000 small changes in land use lead to less ascendency and insufficient vitality in the evolution of land systems therefore the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province was in a fluctuation form between 2000 and 2005 in addition the marginal contributions of the conversion of water to forest and built up land as well as the abandonment of cultivated and construction land for ascendency were negative which was the main reason for reducing the ascendency of land system evolution the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province during 2005 2010 ha d improved from the previous period but it was still in a fluctuation form table 1 during this period the construction land in shaanxi province expanded from 3510 9 km2 to 4295 2 km2 an increase of 22 3 which is the most important change in land systems in shaanxi province table 5 at the same time unused land was exploited for grassland arable land and construction land reducing its area by 4 4 due to the implementation of the policy of returning farmland to forests and grassland and the occupation of cultivated land by economic development and urban expansion the area of cultivated land decreased by 2 6 in 2010 compared with 2005 the conversion of these types of land use had a positive marginal contribution to the ascendency of land system evolution and increased the sustainability this trend was particularly evident in the loess plateau the construction land in the loess plateau increased by 44 5 between 2005 and 2010 the grassland increased by 3 7 and the cultivated land and unused land decreased by 5 3 and 4 3 respectively resulted in the sustainability of the land system evolution of the loess plateau increased from 0 6861 to 0 8137 and the evolution of land systems was in an optimization form table 1 in the guanzhong basin the transition from unutilized land to grassland and water had the most prominent marginal contribution to its ascendency all above 3 2 which was the important incentive for the development of land systems to a sustainable direction however the evolution of land systems still in a fluctuation form and lack of vitality contrary to the loess plateau and the guanzhong basin the area of unused land in 2010 in the qinba mountain increased by 17 2 compared with 2005 due to climate change such as reduced precipitation and raised temperature and unreasonable human activities in particular the conversion of cultivated land and water to unused land reached a marginal contribution of 6 2 and 6 1 on ascendency respectively these changes led to the evolution form of land systems in qinba mountain converted from optimization form during 2000 2005 to fluctuation form during 2005 2010 table 1 during 2010 2015 the most obvious features of land system changes in shaanxi province were the expansion of construction land with an increase of 21 2 and water with an increase of 3 6 table 6 except for construction land and water the area change ratios of other land use types were all less than 1 therefore the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province lacked vitality and was in a fluctuation form in this period the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province was only 0 4208 far less than its sustainability in the previous two periods the sustainability of land system evolution in the loess plateau and the guanzhong basin also showed similar trends especially in the loess plateau the sustainability of land system evolution was only 0 2682 and the ascendency was less than 0 1 indicated land system evolution was in a fluctuation form this was closely related to the disorderly expansion of construction land in the loess plateau during these five years the area of construction land in the loess plateau increased from 885 3 km2 to 1356 8 km2 with an increase of 53 2 which was much greater than the growth rate of construction land in other geographic units during the same period guanzhong basin 13 5 qinba mountain 9 9 however the area change of other land use types in the loess plateau was less than 3 resulted in a lower ascendency in land system evolution judging from its marginal contribution to ascendency increasing investment in construction land remediation into farmland or grassland can effectively enhance the ascendency of land system evolution in the loess plateau and achieve sustainable evolution 3 2 spatial differences of land system evolution form in shaanxi province land systems in the loess plateau changed little between 1980 and 1990 with less than 1 change in area of each land use type resulted in insufficient ascendency and great overhead therefore the sustainability of land system evolution in the loess plateau during this period was the lowest of the three geographic units and land systems evoled in a fluctuation form while the the land system evolution in the guanzhong basin characterized by the expansion of cultivated land and construction land and the reduction of grassland and water areas had the greatest sustainability compared to the other two geographic units all three geographic units evolved in an optimization form between 1990 and 2000 in this period significant changes that were suitable for regional development took place in land systems in the loess plateau characterized by greening of unused land the guanzhong basin characterized by the expansion of construction land and the qinba mountains characterized by the appropriate increase in cultivated land area these changes in land use generally promoted the ecosystems maintenance and economic and social development so the land system evolution in three geographic units was highly sustainable in 2000 2005 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province decreased from south to north i e qinba mountain had the highest sustainability followed by guanzhong plain and loess plateau had the lowest sustainability table 1 the main characteristics of the land system changes in the loess plateau were that the construction land and forest increased by 13 and 6 5 respectively the cultivated land decreased by 4 and the evolution of land systems was in a fluctuation form the precipitation on the loess plateau was sparse and the climate was dry unreasonable afforestation on the unused land would aggravate its aridification which was an important reason for the unsustainable land system evolution in the loess plateau during 2000 2005 the land system changes in the guanzhong basin were dominated by the development and utilization of unused land reduced by 14 2 and the expansion of construction land increased by 10 7 although the ascendency of land systems in the guanzhong basin was higher than that in the loess plateau it was still in the evolution form of fluctuation during 2000 2005 the land system evolution in qinba mountain was in an optimization form and the increase in construction land and water with an increase of 12 and 2 8 respectively was the main change characteristic due to the abundant precipitation and humid climate in qinba mountain rational utilization of unused land through afforestation played an important role in enhancing the sustainability of land system evolution in 2005 2010 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province increased from south to north table 1 similar to 2000 2005 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province increased from north to south in 2010 2015 and the qinba mountain had the greatest sustainability and achieved optimization form table 1 3 3 results verification based on information entropy change of land systems by calculating the information entropy change and sustainability of the land system evolution it can be found that except the guanzhong basin the sustainability based on the ascendency and overhead had a significant linear correlation with the information entropy change of land systems at the 0 01 level with a correlation coefficient of 0 749 fig 3 interestingly the information entropy of land system evolution in an optimization form was no more than 0 003 the unused land in the loess plateau decreased by 21 2 and the construction land increased by 15 between 1990 and 2000 the area change ratio of forest grassland and water was also about 2 however these dramatic land use changes not only did not increase the information entropy but made land systems developed in a more orderly direction therefore it can be considered that the evolution of land systems was sustainable and in an optimization form which was consistent with the results calculated based on ascendency and overhead during 2000 2005 the area of construction land water and farmland in qinba mountain increased by 12 2 8 and 1 4 respectively however this obvious land system changes only increased the information entropy by 0 001 that is the obvious land system changes did not increase the information entropy indicating that the land system evolution had a higher sustainability which was consistent with the judgment results in table 1 therefore it was credible that the land system evolution in qinba mountain was in an optimization form during 2000 2005 during 2005 2010 the land system structure of the loess plateau changed drastically with the area of construction land grassland and forest increased by 44 5 3 7 and 1 5 respectively and the area of water cultivated land and unused land respectively decreased by 5 4 5 3 and 4 3 the dramatic structural changes in land systems only led to an increase in information entropy of 0 002 indicating that the evolution of land systems in this period was highly sustainable and in an optimization form this was also consistent with the results in table 1 during 2010 2015 the main characteristics of land system changes in qinba mountain were the increase in unused land and construction land which increased by 22 and 9 9 respectively the change in information entropy caused by these land system changes was little only 0 003 it can be judged that the land system evolution of the qinba mountain during 2010 2015 was reasonable and sustainable and was in an optimization form in addition the land system information entropy changes caused by the land system evolution in the form of fluctuation were all greater than 0 006 for example during 2010 2015 the information entropy change of land systems was 0 017 in the loess plateau which was greater than the information entropy change in other periods however the sustainability only 0 268 of land system evolution was the smallest of the three periods and it was in a fluctuation form in summary it was feasible and credible to identify the evolution form of land systems based on ascendency and overhead 4 discussion the identification of the evolution forms of land systems was a prerequisite for the regulation of land systems according to the ascendency and overhead the evolution forms of land systems can be objectively and accurately identified if a land system was in an optimization form it was not necessary to adjust the land system if in the degradation form its overhead should be improved if in a fluctuation form increase the ascendency would improve the sustainability of land system evolution in particular land systems can be effectively and accurately regulated by analyzing the marginal contribution of the conversion path the three geographic units in shaanxi province represented three different climatic regions semi arid area loess plateau semi humid area guanzhong basin and humid area qinba mountain in general the more humid the region the more sustainable the evolution of land systems that is the sustainability of land system evolution in the humid area was the greatest followed by semi humid area and the evolution of land systems in semi arid regions was the least sustainable in semi arid regions the average sustainability of land system evolution was not only the lowest but also has the largest fluctuations in different periods the evolution of land systems in a region was not static as long as master the evolution laws of land systems and explore the evolution direction that is suitable for the local climate conditions land systems could evolve in the form of optimization the sustainability of land system evolution based on the ascendency and overhead had a positive correlation with the information entropy change that is the smaller the information entropy increases the greater the sustainability of land system evolution however in the rapidly urbanized areas the information entropy change obvious greater than that it should be under its sustainability state as a typical rapid urbanization area in china the evolution sustainability of land systems in the guanzhong basin in the last three periods was 0 720 0 786 and 0 757 respectively however their information entropy changes were 0 023 0 009 and 0 032 respectively which much larger than the information entropy it should be a number of case studies have also supported this chen and liu 2001a 2001b tan and wu 2003 zhao et al 2004 urbanized areas were ordered dissipative structural systems which should be more and more orderly in the process of urban development the information entropy that characterize their degree of disorder should not increase rapidly but the results of these studies all indicated it increased this is mainly because the expansion of urban construction land led to the massive and rapid conversion of suburban arable land into construction land which resulted in an increase in the information entropy in fast urbanized areas wang and wang 2018 although the information entropy change of land systems in the rapidly urbanized area was greater than its due level it was not inconsistent with the unsustainable fluctuation form of the land system evolution that is it did not affect the identification of the evolution form of land systems in fast urbanized areas moreover it demonstrated that the identification of the evolution form based on ascendency and overhead was reasonable and feasible and there was a deeper connotation to be explored although there may be a mathematical relationship between the information entropy change and the sustainability calculated based on ascendency and overhead the thinking and data foundation of the two calculations were completely opposite the calculation of information entropy change was to first calculate the information entropy of each year according to the land use data static data in different years and then compare the changes of the information entropy between the two years which can be summarized as calculating the information entropy first then calculating change however the sustainability was calculated based on the data on the changes in land use between two different years dynamic data which can be summarized as changing first and then calculating sustainability therefore it was feasible to verify the sustainability with changes in information entropy there were some limitations in this study the evolution of land systems was only seen from the conversion of land use types and the results were relatively one sided a land system was a generated human environment system and the transformation of land use types was difficult to reflect the overall evolution of the system rounsevell et al 2012 turner ii et al 2016 in the future we will explore the ascendency and overhead of land system evolution from the aspects of energy flow and ecosystem service flow and provide decision making suggestions for land system management in addition the value range of α was mainly calculated from the results of research based on ecosystems by ulanowicz et al 2009 however the value range of α for different systems such as ecosystems economic systems water resources systems and land systems were different goerner et al 2009 morris et al 2009 huang and xu 2010 li and yang 2011 the exact value range of α for land systems should be explored in conjunction with relevant research results in order to make the research more scientific and reasonable and to provide decision making suggestions for the realization of regional sustainable development 5 conclusion from the perspective of system evolution this study established a framework for the analysis of land system evolution forms based on the relationship between ascendency and overhead shaanxi province was selected as a research case to evaluate the sustainability of land systems and analyze the changes in the land system evolution form of various geographic units in different periods in general the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province was in a fluctuation form and its sustainability increased first and then decreased among them the changes in the loess plateau were particularly dramatic and its evolution during 1990 2000 and 2005 2010 reached an optimization form while its sustainability was only 0 2682 in 2010 2015 the evolution of land systems in the guanzhong basin had been in a less sustainable form of fluctuation the land system evolution in qinba mountain was highly sustainable except for the fluctuation forms during 1980 1990 and 2005 2010 the rest of the period was in optimized forms all three geographic units evolved in an optimization form between 1990 and 2000 during 2000 2005 and 2010 2015 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province increased from north to south it decreased from north to south during 2005 2010 by analyzing the changes of land system information entropy it was known that it was feasible to identify the evolution form of land systems based on ascendency and overhead and the research conclusions were credible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper acknowledgment this research was conducted under the auspices of national natural science foundation of china 41701094 
24904,there were three basic forms of land system evolution fluctuation degradation and optimization based on the basic principles of system analysis this study established a framework for analyzing the evolution form of land systems according to the sustainability and the relationship between ascendency and overhead and then identified the evolution froms of land systems in shaanxi province the results showed that the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province was in a fluctuation form and its sustainability showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing between 1980 and 2015 the sustainability of land system evolution in loess plateau and guanzhong basin also increased first and then decreased the changes in loess plateau were particularly significant and reached an optimization form during 1990 2000 and 2005 2010 the land system evolution in guanzhong basin in a less sustainable form of fluctuation after 2000 land systems in qinba mountain were in an optimization form except for during 1980 1990 and 2005 2010 all three geographic units evolved in an optimization form between 1990 and 2000 and the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province has increased from north to south both in 2000 2005 and 2010 2015 however its sustainability weakened from north to south in 2005 2010 the verification of the results based on the information entropy change of the land systems showed that it was feasible and credible to distinguish the evolution form of land systems based on ascendency and overhead keywords land systems evolution form ascendency overhead sustainability 1 introduction the movement of matter is eternal for thousands of years land systems have been formed and evolved in the process of human use transformation and adaptation to the natural environment turner ii et al 2003 hurtt et al 2006 pongratz et al 2008 bauch et al 2016 castro et al 2016 there are three basic forms of land system evolution i fluctuation refers to changes in land systems within a certain threshold range when it is interfered internally or externally and land systems can still return to the normal state after the disturbance disappears ii degradation refers to the structural imbalance and functional attenuation of land systems under the influence of internal and external forces iii optimization refers to the enhanced vitality and functional stability of land systems under the influence of self organization and external interference accurately judging the evolution form of land systems is of great significance for regulating land use for sustainable development turner ii et al 2007 land system change is one of the important contents of global change research glp 2005 rounsevell et al 2012 turner ii et al 2013 verburg et al 2013 many scholars have conducted detailed and in depth research on land system change patterns processes mechanisms and impacts on the global goldewijk 2001 lambin and meyfroidt 2011 václavík et al 2013 bruckner et al 2015 continental boillat et al 2017 national liu and tian 2010 niedertscheider and erb 2014 regional spera et al 2016 peng et al 2017 and local scales moore et al 2012 johansson and isgren 2017 these studies provide a range of models and analytical frameworks for analyzing changes in land systems dai and liang 2018 such as the comprehensive index model of land use change for measuring macroscopic changes in regional land systems wang et al 2001 the land use dynamics model for gathering land system change hotspots liu et al 2003 the land use relative change model for highlighting regional differences in land system changes li et al 2015 and the gravity migration model that characterizes the spatial pattern change of land systems wang et al 2002 however the existing models and analytical frameworks are difficult to objectively and rationally distinguish the evolution forms of the land system with the development of system science the study of land system sustainability provides a good opportunity to solve this problem damien et al 2017 bryan et al 2018 at present land system sustainability evaluation methods mainly include three types index synthesis method energy value analysis method and systematic analysis method ness et al 2007 singh et al 2009 panyam et al 2019 the basic principle of the indicator synthesis method is to divide land systems into several subsystems as long as each subsystem is sustainable land systems are in a sustainable state this method ignores the integrity of land systems the selection of indicators is subjective and the evaluation results are only the relative sustainability of the vertical it is difficult to carry out horizontal comparison of different regions although the energy value analysis method establishes the relationship between the internal components of systems the determination of the energy value conversion rate is greatly influenced by human factors in addition the sustainability of land systems can only be judged from the process of change cai and li 2003 which is insufficiently considered by the indicator synthesis method and the energy value analysis method the systematic analysis method that has emerged in recent years evaluates the sustainability of systems mainly based on the balance between land system efficiency and overhead which provides a new perspective for the sustainable study of land systems huang and xu 2010 bodini 2012 fath 2014 huang 2015 kharrazi et al 2016 based on thermodynamics information theory network analysis etc ulanowicz et al 2009 quantitatively describe the overall behavior of systems with development capability ascendency reserve overhead and robustness etc and constructe a system evolution sustainability model ulanowlcz and norden 1990 ulanowicz et al 2009 the method is objective and effective and could evaluate the system change process which had been applied in the economic system and water resources system sustainability evaluation lietaer et al 2010 li and yang 2011 kharrazi et al 2013 therefore based on the basic principles of system analysis this study constructed an analytical framework for identifying the evolution forms of land systems based on the ascendency and overhead of land system evolution and shaanxi province was selected as the research object for empirical analysis aiming to expand the theory and content of land system research 2 material and methods 2 1 study area shaanxi province 105 29 111 15 e 31 42 39 35 n with a total area of about 205 700 km2 is located in the eastern part of northwest china it belongs to the zone of the continental monsoon climate and also stretches into both the north temperate zone and the semi tropic zone according to topography landform hydrology climate etc shaanxi province can be divided into three geographical units named from the north to the south as the loess plateau guanzhong basin and qinba mountain fig 1 in 2015 the loess plateau was mainly occupied by grassland 43 7 and cultivated land 32 6 farmland and built up land accounted for 71 5 and 14 1 of the total land area of guanzhong basin respectively the main land use types in qinba mountain were grassland 39 8 forest land 36 2 and cultivated land 22 8 2 2 data sources the data used in this study mainly included land use data 1980 1990 2000 2005 2010 2015 and geographic unit boundary data fig 1 the land use data comes from the 1 100 000 land use database of the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn default aspx geographical unit boundary data was obtained from the shaanxi provincial geographical white paper 2015 2 3 identification of evolution forms of land system the theoretical basis for evaluating the sustainability of land systems based on the perspective of system evolution is that the sustainability of land system evolution is determined by the ascendency a and overhead φ the ascendency and overhead together constitute the evolutionary capability c of systems that is 1 c a φ i j t i j l o g t i j t s t 2 a i j t i j l o g t i j t s t t i t j 3 φ i j t i j l o g t i j 2 t i t j 4 t s t i j t i j 5 t i j t i j 6 t j i t i j tij refers to the substance information or energy flowing from the i subsystem to the j subsystem ti refers to all substance information or energy flowing out of the i subsystem tj refers to all substance information or energy flowing into the j subsystem tst indicates all substance information or energy that have metastasized in the system i j in this study ti tj tij and tst only involve changes in the area of land use type ascendency a characterizes system efficiency and refers to systems can fully demonstrate organized and effective behavior to maintain the integrity of systems hines et al 2018 overhead φ characterizes the potential for changes in a system meaning that the system has potential for recovery and diverse behavior when interfered by internal components or the external environment bodini 2012 fath 2014 if a system lacks ascendency it is difficult to meet the vitality required for the evolution of the system and the system is in a fluctuation form if the overhead is too small the system will be prone to collapse when subjected to external disturbances and the system is in a degeneration form fig 2 however the increase in systems ascendency will inevitably lead to a decline in the overhead and the increase in overhead will also cause systems to lose some ascendency only when the proportions of the two are suitable it can ensure that systems can effectively deal with the flow of matter information and energy and ensure that systems can recover from external disturbances thus achieving the sustainable development of systems and systems evolve in a optimization form ulanowicz et al 2009 huang 2015 therefore sustainability s of land system evolution can be defined as follows 7 s e log e a β log a β 8 α a c a a φ α 0 1 when α tends to 0 the ascendency tends to 0 and the system evolution sustainability also tends to 0 when α 1 the overhead is 0 s 0 β is the adjustment parameter the evolution of land systems is sustainable only when s exceeds a certain threshold st according to formula 7 it can be known that st corresponds to two values of α m and n in fig 2 that is the evolution of land systems is sustainable only when m α n in this way the value of α can be divided into three intervals 0 m m n n 1 by analyzing the relationship between ascendency and overhead the three value intervals of α can correspond to the three forms of land system evolution if α 0 m it indicates that the overhead of land systems is great and it lcaks of vitality for land system evolution which can be defined as a fluctuation form if α m n the ratio of ascendency and overhead is appropriate indicating the land system evolution is in an optimization form and if α n 1 land systems with excessive ascendency and small overhead lack of redundant options in times of disturbances and is prone to collapse which can be defined as a degeneration form according to calculation results of ulanowicz et al 2009 β should be 1 288 and it can be deduced that the system evolution is sustainable when α 0 2393 0 6971 the specific analysis and derivation process is detailed in the literature of ulanowicz et al 2009 according to the above analysis framework this study analyzed the form and sustainability of land system evolution from the perspective of land use type change the sustainability of the system evolution can be improved by adjusting the ascendency which required calculation of the marginal contribution of the first order path to ascendency 9 a t i j l o g t i j t s t t i t j log e for land systems in a fluctuation form strengthening the land use conversion path with great marginal contribution for ascendency can effectively improve the sustainability of land system evolution for land systems in a degeneration form it is necessary to reduce the land use conversion path with great marginal contribution for ascendency 2 4 information entropy change of land system the information entropy of land systems reflects the number of land use types and the uniformity of the area distribution of each land use type it characterizes the disorder degree of the system the larger the information entropy the higher the degree of disorder and vice versa the structure of a sustainable evolutionary system will tend to be more orderly and the information entropy should not increase therefore the sustainability and evolution form of land systems can be verified according to the change in information entropy the calculation formula of land system information entropy h is as follows pourghasemi et al 2012 10 h i 1 k m i i 1 k m i l n m i i 1 k m i mi i 1 2 k is the area of i th type of land use in the region and k is the total number of land use types the calculation formula of land system information entropy change δh is 11 δ h h e h s i 1 k m s i i 1 k m s i l n m s i i 1 k m s i i 1 k m e i i 1 k m e i l n m e i i 1 k m e i hs and he are the information entropy before and after the land system change respectively msi and mei are the area of a certain land use type before and after the land system change for example the information entropy change in land systems between 2010 and 2015 is 11 δ h 2010 2015 h 2015 h 2010 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of land system evolution form in shaanxi province from the perspective of land use area structure the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province fluctuated over time and it was the most sustainable during 1990 2000 the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province during 1980 1990 was in a fluctuation form with low sustainability table 1 during this period the lack of ascendancy was the main reason for the fluctuation of land systems in particular the conversion of grassland to construction land which concentrated in the loess plateau table 2 had the greatest negative contribution to ascendancy compared to the period of 1980 1990 the magnitude of change in land systems between 1990 and 2000 increased significantly table 3 nearly 1 300 km2 of unused land was converted to grassland due to increased vegetation coverage and the forest area increased by about 200 km2 which effectively enhanced ecosystem services and functions and improved the sustainability of land system evolution during 1990 2000 during 2000 2005 the main characteristics of land system changes in shaanxi province were the reduction of cultivated land and the increase of forest construction land and grassland table 4 the area of construction land increased by 10 4 while the area of forest land and grassland increased by less than 3 compared with 2000 small changes in land use lead to less ascendency and insufficient vitality in the evolution of land systems therefore the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province was in a fluctuation form between 2000 and 2005 in addition the marginal contributions of the conversion of water to forest and built up land as well as the abandonment of cultivated and construction land for ascendency were negative which was the main reason for reducing the ascendency of land system evolution the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province during 2005 2010 ha d improved from the previous period but it was still in a fluctuation form table 1 during this period the construction land in shaanxi province expanded from 3510 9 km2 to 4295 2 km2 an increase of 22 3 which is the most important change in land systems in shaanxi province table 5 at the same time unused land was exploited for grassland arable land and construction land reducing its area by 4 4 due to the implementation of the policy of returning farmland to forests and grassland and the occupation of cultivated land by economic development and urban expansion the area of cultivated land decreased by 2 6 in 2010 compared with 2005 the conversion of these types of land use had a positive marginal contribution to the ascendency of land system evolution and increased the sustainability this trend was particularly evident in the loess plateau the construction land in the loess plateau increased by 44 5 between 2005 and 2010 the grassland increased by 3 7 and the cultivated land and unused land decreased by 5 3 and 4 3 respectively resulted in the sustainability of the land system evolution of the loess plateau increased from 0 6861 to 0 8137 and the evolution of land systems was in an optimization form table 1 in the guanzhong basin the transition from unutilized land to grassland and water had the most prominent marginal contribution to its ascendency all above 3 2 which was the important incentive for the development of land systems to a sustainable direction however the evolution of land systems still in a fluctuation form and lack of vitality contrary to the loess plateau and the guanzhong basin the area of unused land in 2010 in the qinba mountain increased by 17 2 compared with 2005 due to climate change such as reduced precipitation and raised temperature and unreasonable human activities in particular the conversion of cultivated land and water to unused land reached a marginal contribution of 6 2 and 6 1 on ascendency respectively these changes led to the evolution form of land systems in qinba mountain converted from optimization form during 2000 2005 to fluctuation form during 2005 2010 table 1 during 2010 2015 the most obvious features of land system changes in shaanxi province were the expansion of construction land with an increase of 21 2 and water with an increase of 3 6 table 6 except for construction land and water the area change ratios of other land use types were all less than 1 therefore the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province lacked vitality and was in a fluctuation form in this period the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province was only 0 4208 far less than its sustainability in the previous two periods the sustainability of land system evolution in the loess plateau and the guanzhong basin also showed similar trends especially in the loess plateau the sustainability of land system evolution was only 0 2682 and the ascendency was less than 0 1 indicated land system evolution was in a fluctuation form this was closely related to the disorderly expansion of construction land in the loess plateau during these five years the area of construction land in the loess plateau increased from 885 3 km2 to 1356 8 km2 with an increase of 53 2 which was much greater than the growth rate of construction land in other geographic units during the same period guanzhong basin 13 5 qinba mountain 9 9 however the area change of other land use types in the loess plateau was less than 3 resulted in a lower ascendency in land system evolution judging from its marginal contribution to ascendency increasing investment in construction land remediation into farmland or grassland can effectively enhance the ascendency of land system evolution in the loess plateau and achieve sustainable evolution 3 2 spatial differences of land system evolution form in shaanxi province land systems in the loess plateau changed little between 1980 and 1990 with less than 1 change in area of each land use type resulted in insufficient ascendency and great overhead therefore the sustainability of land system evolution in the loess plateau during this period was the lowest of the three geographic units and land systems evoled in a fluctuation form while the the land system evolution in the guanzhong basin characterized by the expansion of cultivated land and construction land and the reduction of grassland and water areas had the greatest sustainability compared to the other two geographic units all three geographic units evolved in an optimization form between 1990 and 2000 in this period significant changes that were suitable for regional development took place in land systems in the loess plateau characterized by greening of unused land the guanzhong basin characterized by the expansion of construction land and the qinba mountains characterized by the appropriate increase in cultivated land area these changes in land use generally promoted the ecosystems maintenance and economic and social development so the land system evolution in three geographic units was highly sustainable in 2000 2005 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province decreased from south to north i e qinba mountain had the highest sustainability followed by guanzhong plain and loess plateau had the lowest sustainability table 1 the main characteristics of the land system changes in the loess plateau were that the construction land and forest increased by 13 and 6 5 respectively the cultivated land decreased by 4 and the evolution of land systems was in a fluctuation form the precipitation on the loess plateau was sparse and the climate was dry unreasonable afforestation on the unused land would aggravate its aridification which was an important reason for the unsustainable land system evolution in the loess plateau during 2000 2005 the land system changes in the guanzhong basin were dominated by the development and utilization of unused land reduced by 14 2 and the expansion of construction land increased by 10 7 although the ascendency of land systems in the guanzhong basin was higher than that in the loess plateau it was still in the evolution form of fluctuation during 2000 2005 the land system evolution in qinba mountain was in an optimization form and the increase in construction land and water with an increase of 12 and 2 8 respectively was the main change characteristic due to the abundant precipitation and humid climate in qinba mountain rational utilization of unused land through afforestation played an important role in enhancing the sustainability of land system evolution in 2005 2010 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province increased from south to north table 1 similar to 2000 2005 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province increased from north to south in 2010 2015 and the qinba mountain had the greatest sustainability and achieved optimization form table 1 3 3 results verification based on information entropy change of land systems by calculating the information entropy change and sustainability of the land system evolution it can be found that except the guanzhong basin the sustainability based on the ascendency and overhead had a significant linear correlation with the information entropy change of land systems at the 0 01 level with a correlation coefficient of 0 749 fig 3 interestingly the information entropy of land system evolution in an optimization form was no more than 0 003 the unused land in the loess plateau decreased by 21 2 and the construction land increased by 15 between 1990 and 2000 the area change ratio of forest grassland and water was also about 2 however these dramatic land use changes not only did not increase the information entropy but made land systems developed in a more orderly direction therefore it can be considered that the evolution of land systems was sustainable and in an optimization form which was consistent with the results calculated based on ascendency and overhead during 2000 2005 the area of construction land water and farmland in qinba mountain increased by 12 2 8 and 1 4 respectively however this obvious land system changes only increased the information entropy by 0 001 that is the obvious land system changes did not increase the information entropy indicating that the land system evolution had a higher sustainability which was consistent with the judgment results in table 1 therefore it was credible that the land system evolution in qinba mountain was in an optimization form during 2000 2005 during 2005 2010 the land system structure of the loess plateau changed drastically with the area of construction land grassland and forest increased by 44 5 3 7 and 1 5 respectively and the area of water cultivated land and unused land respectively decreased by 5 4 5 3 and 4 3 the dramatic structural changes in land systems only led to an increase in information entropy of 0 002 indicating that the evolution of land systems in this period was highly sustainable and in an optimization form this was also consistent with the results in table 1 during 2010 2015 the main characteristics of land system changes in qinba mountain were the increase in unused land and construction land which increased by 22 and 9 9 respectively the change in information entropy caused by these land system changes was little only 0 003 it can be judged that the land system evolution of the qinba mountain during 2010 2015 was reasonable and sustainable and was in an optimization form in addition the land system information entropy changes caused by the land system evolution in the form of fluctuation were all greater than 0 006 for example during 2010 2015 the information entropy change of land systems was 0 017 in the loess plateau which was greater than the information entropy change in other periods however the sustainability only 0 268 of land system evolution was the smallest of the three periods and it was in a fluctuation form in summary it was feasible and credible to identify the evolution form of land systems based on ascendency and overhead 4 discussion the identification of the evolution forms of land systems was a prerequisite for the regulation of land systems according to the ascendency and overhead the evolution forms of land systems can be objectively and accurately identified if a land system was in an optimization form it was not necessary to adjust the land system if in the degradation form its overhead should be improved if in a fluctuation form increase the ascendency would improve the sustainability of land system evolution in particular land systems can be effectively and accurately regulated by analyzing the marginal contribution of the conversion path the three geographic units in shaanxi province represented three different climatic regions semi arid area loess plateau semi humid area guanzhong basin and humid area qinba mountain in general the more humid the region the more sustainable the evolution of land systems that is the sustainability of land system evolution in the humid area was the greatest followed by semi humid area and the evolution of land systems in semi arid regions was the least sustainable in semi arid regions the average sustainability of land system evolution was not only the lowest but also has the largest fluctuations in different periods the evolution of land systems in a region was not static as long as master the evolution laws of land systems and explore the evolution direction that is suitable for the local climate conditions land systems could evolve in the form of optimization the sustainability of land system evolution based on the ascendency and overhead had a positive correlation with the information entropy change that is the smaller the information entropy increases the greater the sustainability of land system evolution however in the rapidly urbanized areas the information entropy change obvious greater than that it should be under its sustainability state as a typical rapid urbanization area in china the evolution sustainability of land systems in the guanzhong basin in the last three periods was 0 720 0 786 and 0 757 respectively however their information entropy changes were 0 023 0 009 and 0 032 respectively which much larger than the information entropy it should be a number of case studies have also supported this chen and liu 2001a 2001b tan and wu 2003 zhao et al 2004 urbanized areas were ordered dissipative structural systems which should be more and more orderly in the process of urban development the information entropy that characterize their degree of disorder should not increase rapidly but the results of these studies all indicated it increased this is mainly because the expansion of urban construction land led to the massive and rapid conversion of suburban arable land into construction land which resulted in an increase in the information entropy in fast urbanized areas wang and wang 2018 although the information entropy change of land systems in the rapidly urbanized area was greater than its due level it was not inconsistent with the unsustainable fluctuation form of the land system evolution that is it did not affect the identification of the evolution form of land systems in fast urbanized areas moreover it demonstrated that the identification of the evolution form based on ascendency and overhead was reasonable and feasible and there was a deeper connotation to be explored although there may be a mathematical relationship between the information entropy change and the sustainability calculated based on ascendency and overhead the thinking and data foundation of the two calculations were completely opposite the calculation of information entropy change was to first calculate the information entropy of each year according to the land use data static data in different years and then compare the changes of the information entropy between the two years which can be summarized as calculating the information entropy first then calculating change however the sustainability was calculated based on the data on the changes in land use between two different years dynamic data which can be summarized as changing first and then calculating sustainability therefore it was feasible to verify the sustainability with changes in information entropy there were some limitations in this study the evolution of land systems was only seen from the conversion of land use types and the results were relatively one sided a land system was a generated human environment system and the transformation of land use types was difficult to reflect the overall evolution of the system rounsevell et al 2012 turner ii et al 2016 in the future we will explore the ascendency and overhead of land system evolution from the aspects of energy flow and ecosystem service flow and provide decision making suggestions for land system management in addition the value range of α was mainly calculated from the results of research based on ecosystems by ulanowicz et al 2009 however the value range of α for different systems such as ecosystems economic systems water resources systems and land systems were different goerner et al 2009 morris et al 2009 huang and xu 2010 li and yang 2011 the exact value range of α for land systems should be explored in conjunction with relevant research results in order to make the research more scientific and reasonable and to provide decision making suggestions for the realization of regional sustainable development 5 conclusion from the perspective of system evolution this study established a framework for the analysis of land system evolution forms based on the relationship between ascendency and overhead shaanxi province was selected as a research case to evaluate the sustainability of land systems and analyze the changes in the land system evolution form of various geographic units in different periods in general the evolution of land systems in shaanxi province was in a fluctuation form and its sustainability increased first and then decreased among them the changes in the loess plateau were particularly dramatic and its evolution during 1990 2000 and 2005 2010 reached an optimization form while its sustainability was only 0 2682 in 2010 2015 the evolution of land systems in the guanzhong basin had been in a less sustainable form of fluctuation the land system evolution in qinba mountain was highly sustainable except for the fluctuation forms during 1980 1990 and 2005 2010 the rest of the period was in optimized forms all three geographic units evolved in an optimization form between 1990 and 2000 during 2000 2005 and 2010 2015 the sustainability of land system evolution in shaanxi province increased from north to south it decreased from north to south during 2005 2010 by analyzing the changes of land system information entropy it was known that it was feasible to identify the evolution form of land systems based on ascendency and overhead and the research conclusions were credible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding
