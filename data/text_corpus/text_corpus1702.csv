8510,study region cottonwood lake area wetlands north dakota u s a study focus fluctuations in pond permanence size and salinity are key features of prairie pothole wetlands that provide a variety of wetland habitats for waterfowl in the northern prairie of north america observation of water level and salinity fluctuations in a semi permanent wetland pond over a 20 year period included periods when the wetland occasionally was dry as well as wetter years when the pond depth and surface extent doubled while volume increased 10 times new hydrological insights for the study region compared to all other measured budget components groundwater flow into the pond often contributed the least water 8 28 percent but the largest amount 90 percent of specific solutes to the water and solute budgets of the pond in drier years flow from the pond into groundwater represented 10 percent of water loss and in 1992 was approximately equal to evapotranspiration loss also during the drier years export of calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride and sulfate by flow from the pond to groundwater was substantial compared with previous or subsequent years a process that would have been undetected if groundwater flux had been calculated as a net value independent quantification of water and solute gains and losses were essential to understand controls on water level and salinity fluctuations in the pond in response to variable climate conditions keywords wetland hydrology climate variability groundwater solutes prairie pothole wetlands 1 introduction the northern prairie of north america contains a remarkable variety of wetlands known as prairie potholes or sloughs that serve as an important resource for waterfowl producing as much as 50 80 percent of these birds in the continent batt et al 1989 biota in these wetlands change in response to dynamic fluctuations in water levels and salinity thereby resulting in a mosaic of different community types and vegetation cover stewart and kantrud 1971 that influence waterfowl use of the wetlands swanson and duebbert 1989 weller 1978 understanding factors controlling fluctuations in water levels and salinity in the ponds of these wetlands therefore is of interest to managers of these natural resources euliss et al 2004 2014 renton et al 2015 robarts and bothwell 1992 as well as those who study earth surface processes arndt and richardson 1989 goldhaber et al 2014 wetland hydrological characteristics winter and woo 1990 woo and rowsell 1993 wetland vegetation dynamics van der valk 2005 and waterfowl habitat swanson and duebbert 1989 prairie pothole wetlands occupy depressions capable of storing water these depressions are found within end moraines ground moraines stagnation moraines outwash plains and lake plains formed during the advance and retreat of the continental ice sheet eisenlohr et al 1972 winter 1989 most of these depressions lack interconnection by natural surface channels however water levels in the ponds can increase to points in their basins where water can spill overland to adjacent wetland depressions eisenlohr et al 1972 rosenberry and winter 1997 shaw et al 2012 the ponded portion of the wetlands where surface water is present in the prairie pothole depressions originates primarily from snow that melts in the spring and rainfall most of the water lost from the ponds is through evapotranspiration shjeflo 1968 groundwater interaction with wetland ponds mainly involves localized shallow groundwater flow eisenlohr et al 1972 sloan 1972 within the depressions containing the wetlands lissey 1971 in cases where groundwater flow is generally toward a wetland pond reversals in groundwater flow directions at the periphery of the pond can occur due to two processes transpiration and water input from intense rain and snowmelt transpiration by vegetation at the pond perimeter can cause a localized depression in the water table immediately adjacent to the pond thereby causing water to flow out of the pond into groundwater berthold et al 2004 meyboom 1966 meyboom et al 1966 mills and zwarich 1986 rosenberry and winter 1997 episodes of intense rain and snowmelt can raise the water level in the pond above the adjacent groundwater level also causing water to temporarily flow out of the pond particularly for temporary ponds johnson et al 2004 water stored in prairie pothole wetland ponds varies in salinity from less than 300 ppm fresh water to greater than 35 000 ppm saline water barica 1975 bierhuizen and prepas 1985 hammer 1978 last 1992 petri and larson 1973 rozkowski 1969 swanson et al 1988 wetland ponds that have surface or groundwater outlets are relatively fresh those that have no outlets are more saline sloan 1972 solutes are concentrated in prairie pothole wetland ponds in two ways when evapotranspiration is greater than precipitation wetland pond water levels decline and solutes are concentrated in the ponds jones and deocampo 2003 solutes also are concentrated during ice formation as pond water freezes solutes are excluded from the ice and concentrated in the remaining liquid water when freezing continues into the sediments solutes are concentrated in the pore water in sediments below the maximum ice extent ficken 1967 after the sediments thaw diffusion of solutes from the sediment pore water into the pond contributes to pond salinity ficken 1967 heagle et al 2013 evapotranspiration by plants at the edge of ponds can lead to localized increased salinity of shallow groundwater at the pond periphery arndt and richardson 1993 miller 1969 and salinization of soils arndt and richardson 1989 within the more permanent zone of soil salinization arndt and richardson 1993 noted the increased salinity in the shallow groundwater at the pond periphery can be transient because periodic recharge events result in groundwater flow that moves the accumulated solutes from the periphery into the pond solutes are also added to the ponds from groundwater flow originating from the adjacent uplands arndt and richardson 1993 eisenlohr et al 1972 hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 miller 1969 rozkowski 1969 rain snow and surface runoff are other hydrologic sources of solutes to the ponds eisenlohr et al 1972 hayashi et al 1988b decomposing vegetation also can contribute to solutes in pond water biondini and arndt 1993 solutes are removed from wetland ponds by several mechanisms water flows overland from a pond to an adjacent wetland basin when the pond level rises to its basin s spill point eisenlohr et al 1972 thereby removing solutes from the pond leibowitz and vining 2003 nachshon et al 2014 leibowitz et al 2016 when the pond level is below the surface spill point of the depression it occupies no loss of solutes by surface water flow can occur movement of pond water into groundwater outflow seepage however can remove solutes from the pond when the water level in the pond is higher than the water levels in the adjacent groundwater sloan 1972 processes within a pond can favor removal of solutes from pond water by chemical precipitation goldhaber et al 2014 or by gas flux biondini and arndt 1993 mills et al 2011 when wetlands are dry salts can be removed from the wetland sediment surface by wind eisenlohr et al 1972 jones and deocampo 2003 labaugh et al 1996 luba et al 1988 similar to loss of salts that occurs from closed lakes langbein 1961 the semi arid region occupied by prairie pothole wetlands is subject to considerable variation in climate laird et al 2003 van der valk 2005 episodes of drought commonly recur less common are episodes of very wet conditions and deluge winter and rosenberry 1998 observation of changes in pond water levels and salinity in the past few decades have begun to document how variations in water level and salinity are related to the processes controlling the hydrologic and chemical characteristics of these ponds both during the onset of drought and transition to wetter conditions labaugh et al 1996 as well as during persistent wet conditions and high water levels labaugh et al 2016 nachshon et al 2014 simple water balance models rainfall and runoff have been used to relate wet and dry episodes to fluctuations in water levels of prairie pothole wetlands carroll et al 2005 huang et al 2013 johnson et al 2005 2015 liu and schwartz 2011 poiani et al 1996 quantification of the contribution of each of the various processes affecting variations in pond water levels and salinity in prairie pothole wetlands however are rare and are only of several years duration hayashi et al 1988a 1998b heagle et al 2007 2013 shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 published water and solute budgets provide an initial foundation regarding the quantification of the factors controlling fluctuations in water levels and salinity in the ponds of these wetlands that influence use by waterfowl the several years duration of published budget studies hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 have not yet quantified the full cycle of wet and dry conditions that have such an important influence on wetland habitat dynamics van der valk 2005 measurement of the components of the water and solute budgets of the pond of wetland p1 in the cottonwood lake area north dakota u s a a semi permanent pond that has no surface outlet during a period of drought and deluge between 1979 and 1998 provides the opportunity to add to the foundation of the earlier studies because the duration of the study encompassed hydrologic extremes results of the study of wetland p1 are the focus of this report 1 1 purpose and scope here we examine the water and chemical balances of the pond of a semi permanent wetland in a groundwater discharge area wetland p1 during a period of climatic contrasts examination of such balances provides information about the importance of various water and solute sources and losses on the geochemical characteristics of the wetland which are related to the biological communities for which these wetlands are an important resource complete water budget studies of ponds of prairie pothole wetlands have appeared in only a few studies shjeflo 1968 hayashi et al 1988a woo and rowsell 1993 and such water budgets have only been associated with chemical budgets sulfate and chloride for a recharge wetland hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 presented here are water and solute budgets for wetland p1 for the period of 1979 1998 this period includes years when the wetland pond was dry as well as when water levels increased to a point where the distinct ponds in the wetland merged with each other and with the pond of an adjacent wetland the focus is on budgets for open water periods placed in context of the contribution from snow prior to the open water period which is consistent with analyses of other pond water and solute budgets of prairie pothole wetlands eisenlohr et al 1972 hayashi et al 1988a 1998b heagle et al 2007 shjeflo 1968 2 study area located in stutsman county north dakota u s a the 92 ha study site is a u s fish and wildlife service waterfowl production area winter 2003 native prairie and wetlands covers 80 percent of the site the remainder was cultivated for brome grass and alfalfa prior to purchase in 1963 the cottonwood lake area study site in east central north dakota is near the eastern edge of a large glacial stagnation moraine known as the missouri coteau glacial drift that covers the site is mostly clayey silty till the upper 5 15 m of which is oxidized and fractured goldhaber et al 2014 many depressions occupy this hummocky area of approximately 25 m relief depressions include wetlands that contain water for weeks to months before becoming dry seasonal ponds and those that contain water throughout most years semi permanent ponds becoming dry only during very dry years terms used here to describe the temporal characteristics of the ponds are in accordance with those used by stewart and kantrud 1971 wetlands in the study area include those whose ponds lose water to groundwater recharge wetlands both receive water from and lose water to groundwater flow through wetlands and primarily receive water from groundwater discharge wetlands terms used here to describe the relation of the ponds to groundwater are in accordance with those used by sloan 1972 water levels in some wetland ponds have increased until adjacent ponds coalesce or water can spill out of one depression or basin into an adjacent depression this region of north america is semi arid average annual precipitation in east central north dakota is 440 mm and average annual evapotranspiration is 810 mm rosenberry 2003 based on data from three national weather service stations for 1961 1990 precipitation is greatest during july averaging 90 mm and least during november through february snowfall averages 865 mm and the snowpack commonly extends from early december through late march average annual temperature is 4 c while extreme temperatures range from 47 to 48 c rosenberry 2003 investigations at the site began in 1967 and focused on the relation of waterfowl to prairie pothole wetlands included in that work were intermittent analyses of chemical characteristics of water in the wetland ponds salinity in the ponds varies from fresh to saline detailed study of the hydrological characteristics of the wetlands at the site was added in 1979 and accompanied by more frequent analysis of chemical characteristics of water in the wetland ponds and shallow groundwater the term pond refers to the surface water within the depression containing the hydric soils and associated vegetation that define a wetland following the distinction between a pond and its wetland noted by eisenlohr et al 1972 and hayashi et al 2016 the focus of this study was the semi permanent pond of wetland p1 fig 1 a closed basin receiving groundwater discharge including its episodic merger with a separate seasonal pond in the wetland identified in past studies as wetland t1 but hereafter identified as pond t1 and the seasonal pond of the adjacent wetland wetland t3 between 1979 and 1998 the two seasonal ponds of wetlands t1 and t3 were relatively shallower 0 48 m t1 0 3 m t3 and smaller 853 m3 t1 25 m3 t3 than the semi permanent pond of wetland p1 at the point of merger 1 11 m 16 673 m3 with t1 and 2 03 m 58 164 m3 with t3 changes in the pond surface extent of these wetlands in response to changes between drier and wetter conditions were documented in winter and rosenberry 1998 at times the ponds were absent and the wetlands were dry in wetter years the surface of the ponds extended into the uplands to the point where all wetland emergent vegetation was inundated decomposed and thereafter was absent during the study period changes in the relation between these ponds and groundwater are described in winter and rosenberry 1995 and rosenberry and winter 1997 however water and solute budgets for open water periods were not examined in those previous publications and are presented here 3 material and methods 3 1 hydrological instrumentation 3 1 1 groundwater twenty shallow observation wells depths between 5 2 and 14 6 m below land surface were installed in the cottonwood lake wetlands study area as described in winter and carr 1980 and many of these wells were in the upland of wetland p1 water levels were measured with a chalked steel tape on a monthly basis during winter and weekly to biweekly from spring through fall six additional wells depths between 1 5 and 2 1 m below land surface were installed between wetlands p1 and t3 in june of 1989 rosenberry and winter 1997 and water levels were recorded with potentiometer float systems connected to a digital data logger programmed to produce bihourly and daily averages measuring points of all wells were surveyed to a common datum 3 1 2 surface water staff gages installed in each of the ponds were read weekly to biweekly or monthly on the same day as water levels were measured in the wells beginning in 1979 continuous stage water level data for the pond of wetland p1 were recorded by a potentiometer float system installed in a stilling well near the center of the pond in july 1980 data were recorded every minute from which hourly and daily averages were computed by a digital data logger continuous stage data were collected during as much of the ice free period as was practical typically from april through october all pond staff gages were surveyed each year to a common datum 3 1 3 atmospheric water a tipping bucket rain gage and digital data logger were installed in july 1979 and a standard non recording rain and snow gage was installed in january 1980 both in the upland adjacent to wetland p1 winter and carr 1980 for periods when data from those gages were missing or not available data from a nearby national weather service gage at woodworth north dakota station id ghcnd us1ndsm0008 located approximately 16 km west northwest of the cottonwood site data accessed january 8 2016 were used instrumentation needed to calculate evapotranspiration was installed beginning in 1979 fig 1 water surface and air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were measured at a raft near the center of wetland p1 winter and carr 1980 atmospheric sensors were installed 2 m above the water surface vapor pressure gradient was determined from relative humidity data and by assuming that the atmosphere was saturated at the water surface additional instrumentation was installed in 1982 parkhurst et al 1998 thermistors thermometers were installed approximately 2 cm beneath the water surface and 20 cm above the wetland sediments and also 0 5 m and 1 m below the wetland sediment water interface to determine change in heat stored in the water column and underlying sediments solar and atmospheric radiation was measured in the upland near pond t1 wind speed was measured at 2 m above land surface in the vicinity of the radiation instruments auxiliary air temperature and relative humidity data were measured with a hygrothermograph located in an instrument shelter in the upland between wetlands p1 and t3 3 1 4 measurement uncertainty measurements of the components of the water budgets of lakes and wetland ponds are associated with some uncertainty winter 1981 labaugh 1986 the water budget of the pond of wetland p1 was determined as follows 1 p r gi et go dv where p precipitation snow rain falling directly on the pond surface r runoff from rainfall gi groundwater input et evapotranspiration go groundwater output and dv change in pond volume rainfall groundwater in and out evapotranspiration and change in pond volume were measured independently runoff was calculated using change in pond stage and rainfall data no component however was estimated from the difference between inputs outputs and change in storage this approach enabled us to represent cumulative error of all of the measured components and any water gain or loss unaccounted for in the budget as the residual of the water budget r 2 p r gi et go dv r the cumulative error in the budget δ was determined from a first order error analysis assuming errors in measurement of the budget components are independent and randomly distributed 3 δ square root of δ2p δ2r δ2gi δ2et δ2go δ2dv where δ error δ2p precipitation falling directly on the pond surface error estimate for precipitation 2 δ2r runoff from rainfall error estimate for runoff 2 δ2gi groundwater input error estimate for groundwater input 2 δ2et evapotranspiration error estimate for evapotranspiration 2 δ2go groundwater output error estimate for groundwater output 2 and δ2dv change in pond volume error estimate for change in pond volume 2 estimates of measurement error used in this analysis primarily were based on winter 1981 and were 5 percent for precipitation falling directly on the pond surface 50 percent for groundwater input 10 percent for evapotranspiration determined from the energy budget and 15 percent for evapotranspiration determined from the mather and hamon methods based on rosenberry et al 2004 50 percent for pond water loss by flow to groundwater and 10 percent for change in pond volume runoff error was not quantified in winter 1981 we assumed an estimate of error of 100 percent for runoff from rain based on motz et al 2001 in cases when the cumulative error in the budget was larger than the budget residual we assumed this indicated that all water gains and losses were accounted for within the uncertainty in the measured budget in cases when the cumulative error in the budget was smaller than the budget residual we assumed this indicated some water gain or loss was unaccounted for within the uncertainty in the measured budget whereby the difference between the cumulative error and the budget residual represented the part of the budget not measured 3 2 water budget calculation 3 2 1 pond surface area and volume stage area and stage volume relations for the pond were determined from surveys of the wetland pond bathymetry and adjacent upland including a plane table survey made in 1983 and a lidar light detection and ranging survey of the entire waterfowl production area in 2008 daily change in volume of the pond was calculated by difference between the volume of the pond on one day and the volume of the pond on the previous day summation of daily values was used to calculate monthly values 3 2 2 precipitation volume precipitation falling on the wetland pond was determined in two ways first the total volume contributed by snow at the end of each snow accumulation season was approximated by difference using the last pond volume in fall based on the last recorded pond water level and the first pond volume in the following spring based on the first recorded pond water level this volume includes the combination of snow that fell directly on the wetland or frozen pond snow that drifted onto those surfaces and snowmelt flowing over frozen ground to the pond second during the months when the pond surface was not covered by ice the precipitation volume was determined by multiplying daily rainfall by the pond water surface area associated with the water level elevation on the day the rainfall was recorded monthly values of precipitation in cubic meters were determined from summation of daily values 3 2 3 runoff volume on days when rainfall was measured the volume of the pond was compared to the volume from the previous day if the change in volume of the pond was greater than the volume of rainfall falling on the surface of the pond the difference was attributed to runoff shjeflo 1968 monthly runoff in cubic meters was calculated by summation of daily values within the month 3 2 4 evapotranspiration volume evapotranspiration was calculated using the energy budget method for years 1982 1985 1987 when instrumentation at the site enabled such calculations parkhurst et al 1998 the mather 1978 and hamon 1961 equations were used to determine evapotranspiration for the period 1979 1998 based on an evaluation of results from 13 equations for determining evapotranspiration in comparison with the energy budget rosenberry et al 2004 both the mather commonly called thornthwaite and hamon equations use air temperature data for periods when daily average air temperature was measured at the site monthly average air temperature values were determined from daily data for periods when air temperature data were not available at the site data from the jamestown north dakota national weather service site ghcnd usw00014919 located approximately 37 km southeast of the site mene et al 2012 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center http doi org 10 7289 v5d21vhz access date january 8 2016 were used to determine monthly average air temperature values 1979 to

observatory at http aa usno navy mil data docs dur oneyear php access date january 22 2016 for the location of jamestown north dakota values in millimeters per month determined from both the mather and hamon equations were multiplied by the surface area of the pond on the last day of the month to obtain evapotranspiration in cubic meters for the month 3 2 5 groundwater volume the volume of water either flowing from groundwater into the wetland pond or flowing from the pond to groundwater each month was determined at multiple points around the pond perimeter using the darcy equation 8 q kia where q is groundwater flow volume time k is hydraulic conductivity length time i is the hydraulic gradient and a is the cross sectional area through which water flows into or out of the wetland in relation to groundwater k was determined from 79 aquifer slug tests conducted at 49 observation wells in the study area and averaged 4 7 10 5 cm second i was calculated by subtracting the water level in the pond from the water level in the wells located near the p1 pond and dividing by the horizontal distance between the well and the p1 pond shoreline a was determined by multiplying the length of the shoreline by the average depth 15 2 m of the local shallow groundwater system parkhurst et al 1998 which corresponds to the approximate maximum depth of weathered and fractured till at the site goldhaber et al 2014 the shoreline of p1 was divided into segments each attributed to a well that was used to calculate the hydraulic gradient near that portion of the pond fig 1 segments initially were assigned to each of the following observation wells 13 14 17 20 25 and 26 fig 1 when the ponds of t1 and p1 coalesced additional segments were assigned to observation wells 15 and 23 when the combined pond of p1 t1 coalesced with the pond of t3 the segment assigned to well 13 was assigned to wells 12 and 52 eq 1 was applied to each segment and depending on the direction of the hydraulic gradient the total groundwater flow to the pond or flow from the pond to groundwater was calculated as the sum from each segment as the water level in p1 rose and the shoreline expanded the above calculations were adjusted in three ways first the horizontal distance between each well and the shoreline was reduced as the shoreline moved closer to the well second as the water level in p1 rose and approached to within 3 m of a piezometer used to calculate the hydraulic gradient to the pond a more distant piezometer was used to calculate the hydraulic gradient to the pond fig 1 the gradient calculations were modified by substituting wells 12 and 52 for well 13 well 16 for well 15 well 18 for well 17 well 28 for well 25 and well 27 for well 26 third when the pond of wetland p1 merged with pond t1 and eventually with the pond of wetland t3 the shoreline changed new shoreline segments were then added as noted above fig 1 and the shoreline length for each segment was adjusted for the shoreline configuration of the new merged pond calculating monthly groundwater flow for each segment meant we could distinguish segments where groundwater was flowing into the pond from segments where water was flowing from the pond into groundwater monthly groundwater exchange with the pond therefore was not calculated as a net value instead we determined separate monthly volumes for gi and go also the simultaneous occurrence of groundwater flow into the pond and pond water flow to groundwater did not indicate a flow through condition where water lost to groundwater would eventually leave the local basin instead water flowing out of the pond ended at nearby depressions in the water table resulting from loss of shallow groundwater to evapotranspiration 3 3 chemical data collection 3 3 1 groundwater groundwater was removed from the observation wells by use of a bailer or a peristaltic pump in cases when removal of groundwater left no water in the well groundwater that seeped into the well overnight was collected by bailer or pump for subsequent physical and chemical analysis otherwise samples of groundwater were collected after three casing volumes of water had been removed from the well around the periphery of wetland p1 water was collected from wells 13 14 15 16 17 20 25 and 26 collection from wells 13 and 16 was initiated in 1980 from wells 17 20 25 26 in 1983 and from well 15 in 1984 sample collection took place primarily between april and october approximately monthly prior to 1983 and intermittently from 1983 through 1991 in addition to the more detailed chemical analyses of groundwater collected from the wells in situ measurements were made from 1987 to 1995 water temperature ph and specific conductance commonly were measured once in the summer in wells 17 20 25 and 26 using an in situ hydrolab probe designed to fit into 2 inch diameter wells water collected prior to 1983 was analyzed at the u s fish and wildlife service northern prairie wildlife research center laboratory in jamestown north dakota according to methods described in swanson et al 1988 water collected between 1983 and 1991 was analyzed at the u s geological survey national water quality laboratory in lakewood colorado according to methods described in fishman and friedman 1989 analysis of ph specific conductance and total alkalinity was made on unfiltered groundwater water filtered through a 0 45 micrometer filter was used for analysis of dissolved calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen for water analyzed at the u s geological survey laboratory filtrate used for cation analysis was preserved with 1 ml of nitric acid per 250 ml of filtrate and water used for nitrogen analyses was preserved with 1 ml of hgcl the analysis for dissolved nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen performed by the u s geological survey laboratory was assumed to represent nitrate nitrogen whereas the u s fish and wildlife service laboratory determined nitrate individually as nitrate nitrogen 3 3 2 surface water water was collected from the pond of wetlands at the site using a tube water column sampling device typically 0 65 1 35 m long with a minimum diameter of 10 cm as described in swanson 1978 between 1979 and 1995 water was collected from the mid point of each of three transects transects described in labaugh et al 1987 and from 1996 to 1998 from a single transect within the pond when a pond was very shallow and almost dry water was collected from the center of the pond water collected from each transect was processed separately for subsequent analysis thereby enabling determination of heterogeneity within the pond water from the tube sampling device was transferred to a plastic bucket or large polyethylene bottle then to either 2 l 250 ml or 500 ml polyethylene sample bottles prior to transport to the laboratory according to the protocols of the laboratories swanson et al 1988 fishman and friedman 1989 the u s fish and wildlife service laboratory was used for analysis of pond water collected before 1983 the u s geological survey laboratory was used for analysis of pond water collected from 1983 to 1992 and 1994 for pond water collected from 1992 to 1998 water analysis also was conducted at the bureau of reclamation laboratory in bismarck north dakota using standard methods greenberg et al 1992 3 3 3 atmospheric water results of chemical analyses of atmospheric deposition were obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program national trends network gage at woodworth north dakota located approximately 16 km west northwest of the cottonwood site station nd11 data accessed july 8 2016 data for monthly average values from this site were available beginning december 1983 and continuing through 1998 the north dakota state department of health collected atmospheric deposition at the woodworth site for chemical analysis between 1981 and 1984 deutschman and ell 1986 data for the average values for may to october were available for each of those years from the north dakota state department of health 3 4 chemical budgets 3 4 1 groundwater to determine groundwater contribution to chemical flux entering the pond the median concentrations in the wells within each shoreline segment were multiplied by the monthly volumes of groundwater flow into the pond for their respective segments the median solute values used for groundwater input in each segment were those for the entire study period for that segment when the wetland surface expanded to encompass well 12 the gradient associated with nearby well 52 was used this method of calculation is consistent with other similar studies where solute concentrations in groundwater have been documented on decadal time scales labaugh et al 1995 buso et al 2009 to determine chemical flux from the pond to groundwater the median concentration in the pond for the month was multiplied by the total monthly volume of water flowing from the pond into groundwater in some months detailed chemical analyses were not available to calculate this flux april 1982 1984 1986 1996 may to september 1983 and october 1995 and 1996 for those months with missing data the median specific conductance for the month was used with regression relations between ca mg na k cl so4 and alkalinity in the pond of wetland p1 for the years 1979 1998 to estimate concentrations in the wetland pond ca 25 55 μs cm 0 04347 n 374 r2 0 70 mg 48 28 μs cm 0 11305 n 374 r2 0 96 na 11 18 μs cm 0 06849 n 373 r2 0 74 k 3 53

0 01 level for a few months april 1989 1990 1991 october 1988 and november 1981 no specific conductance data were available therefore chemical concentrations from either the next month or the previous month were used in the calculations of the mass flowing out of the pond into groundwater 3 4 2 change in mass in the pond on the dates for which water was collected for subsequent chemical analysis in the laboratory the volume of water in the pond on that date was multiplied by the solute concentration to determine the mass of solute in the pond because dates of pond water collection for chemical analysis rarely coincided with the beginning or the end of a month monthly changes in mass were not calculated change in mass in the pond during the open water period was determined by the difference between the mass on the individual dates chemical analyses were available during the open water period 3 4 3 rainfall and runoff from rain solute input from atmospheric precipitation during the open water period was determined by summing daily volumes for rain within a month then multiplying the monthly total in cubic meter m3 for the month by the average concentration for that month obtained from the woodworth national atmospheric deposition site for the years 1984 1998 solute input during the open water periods of 1981 1983 was determined by multiplying the monthly total in m3 for each month by the average concentration at the woodworth site for the period may to october for each of those years published by deutschman and ell 1986 to approximate the relative contribution from atmospheric deposition during the years 1979 and 1981 the average concentrations for the period 1981 1984 published by deutschman and ell 1986 were used in the calculation assuming data from those years were a proxy for atmospheric deposition chemical composition in 1979 and 1980 monthly totals for runoff from rain were multiplied by the concentrations in atmospheric deposition for the month to calculate solute input to the pond each month of the open water period open water period values for solute mass input were calculated as the sum of monthly values as in the case of rain average values for chemical constituents determined from the period when data were available 1981 1984 were used to approximate the relative contribution of runoff in the open water periods prior to december 1983 4 results 4 1 water budgets changes in pond volume from spring to fall and water entering the pond or leaving the pond during that period are the main foci of the budget analysis presented herein on an annual basis however moisture deposited on the landscape and the frozen pond surface by snow and rain between fall and spring plays a role in determining the water volume present in the pond at spring thaw rain falling directly on the wetland pond during the open water period commonly was the largest source of water for the pond in most years fig 2 table 1 in a few years 1983 1987 1997 the volume contributed to the pond from snowmelt in the spring exceeded the contribution from rain falling on the pond surface during the subsequent open water period runoff from rain contributed less water to the pond than rain falling directly on the pond surface or snowmelt in many years but was more important in drier years when there was diminished or no snowmelt 1989 1992 and in the wetter year of 1993 runoff from rain was the largest source of water to the pond in 1990 1992 and 1993 groundwater generally was the smallest source of water for the pond in comparison to rainfall or runoff from rain yet did contribute volumes similar to runoff from rain in many years evapotranspiration was the largest water loss from the pond fig 2 representing greater than 90 percent of the total water lost in all but the drier years of 1989 1992 table 2 only in those drier years did pond water lost by flow into groundwater represent more than 10 percent of the total water loss as the pond volume and periphery diminished between 1989 and 1992 the flow of pond water to groundwater became more important as a mechanism removing water from the pond being approximately equivalent to water loss from evapotranspiration in 1992 the importance of evapotranspiration as the primary mechanism removing water from the pond was similar among the three methods used to determine evapotranspiration table 2 even though the absolute volumes determined from each method were not identical table 1 in most years the pond volume declined during the open water period table 1 and the pond was shallower in the late summer or fall than it was in the spring fig 3 in some years 1986 and 1993 1995 pond volume increased during the open water period table 1 and the pond was deeper at the end of the open water period than at the beginning of the period in other years 1990 and 1991 change in volume was negligible because in both years the pond was dry in april and in late summer the budget computation periods for 1990 and 1991 included data from the recording stage gage prior to the installation of the staff gage differences in water depths between the beginning and end of the open water periods for 1990 and 1991 based on staff gage data shown in fig 3 therefore do not reflect the water depths recorded during the entire budget computation period change in pond volume during the open water period was not accounted for completely by the difference between total water gains and losses based on the budget residual the difference between the change in pond volume and total water gains and losses table 3 a value of the budget residual other than zero indicates some water gains or losses may have been underestimated overestimated or unaccounted for by the measured components of the water budget the budget residual however includes uncertainty in measurement in addition to the difference between measured water gains and losses cumulative uncertainty in the budget was obtained from a first order error determination in some years 1986 1990 1995 the value of the cumulative error in the budget was larger than the absolute value of the budget residual therefore indicating all water gains and losses were accounted for within the uncertainty in the measured budget in other years 1979 1985 1987 1989 except 1987 when energy budget evapotranspiration was used and 1996 1998 the value of the cumulative error was less than the absolute value of the budget residual indicating some water gain or loss from the pond was not measured hydraulic gradients based on measurements at wells may not be indicative of gradients closer to the pond it is possible perhaps likely that the water table closer to the pond was lower than at the more distant well in which case more water could have been lost to groundwater due to evpotranspiration drawdown in some years than was indicated based on gradients integrated over the distance between the pond shoreline and the well rosenberry and winter 1997 the unaccounted water loss from the pond in some years also may represent water lost by transpiration not adequately represented by the method used to calculate evapotranspiration as the pond shrank in 1989 cattail germinated on the exposed wetland sediments with cattail increasing in areal extent from 1990 to 1993 in the drier years of 1990 1992 the extent of evapotranspiration drawdown perhaps was sufficient to be adequately represented by the wells more so than in other years in 1994 and 1995 the pond primarily was open water with little living emergent vegetation present in the pond the variable and dynamic effect of water gains and losses on the depth of the pond is evident in fig 3 the amount of snowmelt prior to pond thaw each year determined the starting depth and volume of the pond in most years a rise in pond depth occurred sometime after the snowmelt and pond thaw in response to rainfall as well as when runoff occurred runoff from rainfall to the pond was episodic occurring when rain fell on frozen ground in the spring and occasionally thereafter more commonly during periods when rain occurred over two or more days runoff however was not evident during all periods when rain occurred on multiple consecutive days consequently years with similar volumes of rainfall input such as 1979 and 1986 had dissimilar volumes of runoff table 1 varying by an order of magnitude a general decline in pond depth following peaks that commonly occurred earlier in the open water period reflected the dominance of water loss by evapotranspiration relative to water inputs in some years rainfall on the pond surface and associated episodic runoff in the latter part of the open water period caused increases in pond depth prior to formation of ice cover on the pond changes in pond water depth as a result of water losses exceeding gains or gains exceeding losses during the open water period fig 3 were associated with large changes in the pond surface area at a water depth of 1 11 m the pond of wetland p1 merges with pond t1 and at a depth of approximately 2 03 m that single pond merges with the pond of wetland t3 when either of the adjacent wetland ponds merged with the pond of p1 the combination was identified as the pond of wetland p1 and that volume was used in all of the calculations in this budget analysis because of the variation between drier and wetter conditions observed between 1979 and 1998 the surface area of the pond ranged from zero when dry episodically in 1989 1992 to 63 761 m2 in late april and early may of 1997 the surface area at the peak in 1997 was more than double the peak of 29 489 m2 in mid april of 1987 the largest value recorded prior to the onset of the wetter conditions that began in 1993 water gains and losses to wetlands when presented in terms of water fluxes per unit area such as in fig 4 enable comparison of year to year trends independent of the marked variations between years with respect to pond surface area for the purpose of this comparison evapotranspiration values derived from the mather equation were used because values were available for all years and the distribution of those values was more similar to energy budget values than those derived from the hamon equation fig 2 the year 1993 was the wettest year of the study when rainfall measured during the open water period was 638 mm subsequent years 1994 1998 were associated with consistently higher rainfall amounts during the open water period than occurred in most other years prior to 1993 when rainfall was more variable during some open water periods in years prior to 1993 the rainfall was similar to that measured in the latter wetter years following 1993 471 mm 1980 420 mm 1982 446 mm 1986 451 mm 1997 417 mm 1998 these years of somewhat similar rainfall totals during the open water period however differ substantially in the volumetric contribution to the water budget of the pond table 1 such differences highlight the importance of the size of the pond surface area to the translation of those rainfall totals into the volumetric contribution to the water budget of the pond in different years this also highlights the importance of snowmelt because it affects the size of the pond at the beginning of the open water period upon which rain falls changes in surface area of the pond also were associated with changes in the length of shoreline at the periphery of the pond shoreline length is used in the calculation of groundwater flux to and from the pond consequently as the pond surface and perimeter increased substantially beginning in 1993 the volume of groundwater inflow to the pond was greater 4000 m3 from 1993 to 1998 table 1 than in earlier years even though when expressed on a linear basis values for the open water periods of 1993 1998 were similar to values in many of the other years fig 4 4 2 solute budgets groundwater flowing into the pond of wetland p1 was the largest external source of calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride and sulfate input to the pond table 4 in general in each open water period groundwater accounted for 99 percent of the calcium magnesium sodium and sulfate input greater than 96 percent of potassium input and greater than 90 percent of chloride input the remainder of the input to the pond of these solutes from external sources was provided by rainfall on the pond surface and runoff open water periods in which the volume of runoff was larger than the volume of rainfall input to the pond 1990 1992 and 1993 were also the years when runoff contributed as much or more of the solute input relative to rainfall for these solutes one exception occurred in 1995 when runoff contributed more chloride than rainfall even though the volume of water contributed by runoff was less than for rainfall in april of 1995 the concentration of chloride in rainfall used to calculate chloride input from runoff was nearly three times the concentration during subsequent months and the volume of runoff in april was over four times the volume of rainfall in the same month rainfall was the major external source of input to the pond during open water periods for nitrate nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and hydrogen ions table 4 the input of rainfall was less than 50 percent of total input for nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen only in 1990 1992 and 1993 when runoff contributed the most volume to the pond only in 1992 and 1993 was less than 50 percent of the hydrogen ion input accounted for by rainfall the majority of the remainder coming from runoff in years when rainfall was the major external source of solute input of nitrogen and hydrogen ion the relative contribution of rainfall input of nitrogen and hydrogen ion from one open water period to the next was variable 59 95 percent for nitrate nitrogen 59 92 percent for ammonium nitrogen and 52 95 percent for hydrogen ion supplementary material table a1 solute concentrations in the pond result from the combination of solute gains and losses coincident with changes in pond volume as the relation between water gain and loss vary the seasonal and year to year variation in concentrations of solutes contributing the most to salinity in the pond are shown in figs 5 and 6 concentrations of the most abundant solutes generally increased during the open water periods as pond water levels declined concentrations overall were greater in years when pond levels were lower than 1 m before 1993 before pond levels showed pronounced increases magnesium and sulfate were the most abundant cations and anions in the pond throughout almost the entire study period which reflects their relation in groundwater flowing into the pond also data in figs 5 and 6 include concentration values obtained from each transect within the pond on each day water was collected for analysis the fact there was some within pond variability in concentration on a given day is more readily apparent for magnesium and sulfate figs 5 and 6 but occurred for all solutes the gradual rise in major solute concentration after 1993 reflects increased solute input from groundwater in succeeding years supplementary material table a1 dissolved nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations varied the most of all the major solutes on a given day median standard deviations were 45 percent for nitrate nitrogen and 12 percent for ammonia nitrogen variation within a month and from year to year exhibited no readily identifiable seasonal pattern nitrate nitrogen concentrations commonly were below detection limits and otherwise generally less than ammonia nitrogen concentration these generally low concentrations of nitrate have been observed in ponds of other prairie wetlands in response to uptake by biota barica 1974 neely and baker 1989 overall the sum of external solute inputs was greater than solute mass loss by flow from the pond to groundwater table 4 measured change in solute mass in the pond during the open water period commonly was less than the difference between all external inputs and solute mass loss by flow from the pond to groundwater some of the difference between measured change in mass of solute in the pond and external inputs and loss of solutes may simply be due to uncertainty in measurement of the solute budget uncertainty in the solute budget was determined using the method used to calculate cumulative error in the water budget using eq 1 based on median values the residuals of the solute balances were larger than the cumulative error in the solute balances for all solutes except alkalinity table 4 based on the many days when water was collected for solute analysis from more than one transect some of the uncertainty in the solute budgets may be due to the variability of solute concentrations in the pond on a given day the standard deviation per day expressed in terms of percent of mean concentration on that day is one measure of variability in the mass in the pond the medians of those percentages for all days in open water periods from 1979 to 1998 when data were available from more than one transect were ca 3 3 percent mg 2 5 percent na 2 3 percent k 2 6 percent cl 4 1 percent so4 1 9 percent alkalinity 2 4 percent hydrogen ion 25 percent nitrate nitrogen 45 percent and ammonium nitrogen 12 percent in years when the solute budget residual was larger than the cumulative error some of the residual unaccounted by cumulative error might be due simply to variability in concentration the percentages noted for the solutes above however were all smaller than the percentage of variability estimated from the mass of solute in excess of the cumulative error divided by the solute mass of the pond at the start of the open water period except for alkalinity 1987 1996 and 1997 therefore variability within the pond based on concentration values in each of the separate transects likely did not account for the budget residual mass of solute unexplained by uncertainty in the solute budgets even though in general between 1979 and 1998 some imbalance in the solute budgets of the pond were unaccounted for by measured inputs and outputs this was not the case every year for some years the cumulative error in open water period solute budgets was larger than the absolute value of the solute budget residual indicating all solute gains and losses were accounted for within the uncertainty in the budget however years in which this occurred were not always coincident for all solutes ca 1990 1994 and 1996 mg 1989 1992 1994 1997 na 1980 and 1981 1992 1994 1997 k 1983 and 1987 cl 1989 1997 so4 1992 1996 and 1997 alkalinity 1980 and 1981 1990 1992 1995 ammonium nitrogen 1993 and 1995 in addition not all of these years coincided with years in which the water budget was accounted for within measurement uncertainty 1986 1990 1995 closure of individual solute budgets within uncertainty therefore was not simply a function of closure of water budgets among the possible mechanisms that might explain the imbalance in the solute budgets for the pond is that flow of water from the pond into groundwater may be higher than calculated this could occur if the observation wells used to estimate the groundwater gradient around the wetland were not close enough to the pond to capture the transpiration driven water table depression around the periphery of the wetland pond rosenberry and winter 1997 the fact that mass export occurs as the pond shrinks is evident from year to year changes in the open water period loss of sulfate by flow from the pond to groundwater fig 7 and for calcium magnesium sodium potassium and chloride supplementary material table a1 being most pronounced in dry years these were the periods when the loss of water from the pond to groundwater represented approximately 20 percent or greater of the total loss of water from the pond 1989 1992 this finding also is consistent with the fact that in the preceding years the likely imbalance in the water budget was due to underestimation of evapotranspiration when emergent vegetation was present in the pond another possible source of imbalances that were greater than could be accounted for within uncertainty in the budgets is overestimation of solute contributions to the pond from groundwater median concentrations among groundwater collected from the observation wells were not uniform table 5 groundwater collected at the periphery of the wetland p1 pond in june of 1988 by arndt and richardson 1993 varied with respect to electrical conductivity between 4 6 8 7 ds m 1 4600 8700 microsiemens cm 1 in the shoreline segment associated with well 13 and between 3 4 6 3 ds m 1 3400 6300 microsiemens cm 1 in the shoreline segment associated with well 25 specific conductance in water from well 25 varied from 4680 to 6320 microsiemens cm 1 n 9 based on seven in situ probe measurements and two laboratory analyses values within the range observed at the pond periphery by arndt and richardson 1993 specific conductance in water from well 13 varied between 10600 and 15200 microsiemens cm 1 n 17 values approximately double the values observed at the pond periphery by arndt and richardson 1993 shoreline segments other than the segment associated with well 13 however contributed most of the solutes from groundwater to the pond assuming concentrations in the shoreline segment associated with well 13 were half of what was observed did not significantly decrease solute inputs from groundwater therefore the budgets reported here did use the laboratory solute data from well 13 in addition concentrations in groundwater from the wells including well 13 were within the range observed in groundwater collected from lysimeters along transects perpendicular to the shoreline in the vicinity between wells 13 and 25 and in the vicinity of well 17 between 1988 and 1990 biondini and arndt 1993 such information was consistent with the assumption that solute input from groundwater to the pond based on the concentrations in table 5 was representative of conditions at the site chloride is considered to be unaffected by reactions within the pond at the concentrations observed during the study in nine years of the study 1989 1997 the residual of the open water period budget for chloride was accounted for within the uncertainty in the budget supplementary material table a1 based on this observation no adjustments in the solute budgets were made to account for years when there was a disparity between inputs export and change in mass in the pond instead the disparity was assumed to reflect some unaccounted for export one possible export mechanism is evapotranspiration induced movement of water and solutes out of the pond at the periphery of the pond as the pond surface shrinks such as documented by arndt and richardson 1993 such variations were not quantified by the gradients evident from the wells located outside of the immediate pond periphery loss of solute mass within the pond can occur due to chemical precipitation or gas flux out of the pond one line of evidence for loss by chemical precipitation is provided by the molar ratio of magnesium and calcium concentrations in the pond fig 8 in many years the ratio generally increased through the open water period indicating a loss of calcium relative to magnesium within the pond geochemical models of solute interaction indicated supersaturation conditions exist in the pond for calcite goldhaber et al 2014 therefore calcite precipitation could account for the loss of calcium relative to magnesium in the pond magnesium and sulfate commonly were the most abundant cation and anion respectively based on their concentration in milliequivalents per liter fig 5 and 6 their relation to one another however varied during the study fig 9 the molar ratio of magnesium to sulfate was generally less than one in the wells around the pond the monthly ratios in atmospheric deposition varied from 0 04 to 1 3 95 percent of the values were less than 0 69 values greater than 1 were recorded in only three months between 1979 and 1998 and not after 1992 the noticeable increase in the ratio in the pond in 1993 likely indicates a change in sulfate relative to magnesium outside of that expected from the solute sources of atmospheric deposition and groundwater flow to the pond some change in magnesium does occur through precipitation associated with calcite deposition in the pond goldhaber et al 2014 even so the distinction between 1993 and years immediately thereafter and years prior to 1993 may reflect inundation of all emergent vegetation and subsequent decomposition loss of sulfate due to sulfate reduction occurs in the pond as documented in goldhaber et al 2014 which requires a carbon source such as decomposing vegetation decomposition of above ground biomass in wetland p1 does occur with a rate of 50 percent decomposition over 114 months biondini and arndt 1993 the persistence of ratios above 1 from 1993 onward may reflect the time involved to achieve complete decomposition of above ground biomass inundated in 1993 in general the budget residuals for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen were larger than could be accounted for by cumulative error supplementary material table a1 the budget imbalances for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen are consistent with biological removal mechanisms within wetland ponds noted in other prairie wetland studies barica 1974 neely and baker 1989 removal mechanisms that were beyond the scope of this study similar large budget residuals for ammonia nitrogen also were reported by murkin et al 2000 in experimental wetland ponds a function of uptake by biota calculating groundwater fluxes to and from the pond independently using multiple shoreline segments rather than as a net value enabled unambiguous examination of changes in solute input from groundwater during the years after 1993 the volume of groundwater flow into the pond in the open water periods beginning in 1993 was at least twice that of years prior to 1993 this also was reflected in solute input from groundwater to the pond for calcium alkalinity fig 10 and potassium supplementary material table a1 other solutes also were elevated in input particularly in 1993 such as sulfate but were not consistently elevated in subsequent years the difference in pattern in part reflected the contribution of solutes from wells with relatively smaller concentrations of those solutes than the wells they substituted for in the calculations due to expansion of the pond table 5 5 discussion 5 1 water budgets the relative contribution of water sources to and water losses from the pond of wetland p1 were similar to other water budgets for closed basin prairie pothole wetland ponds hayashi et al 1988a shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 and similar to annual water balances based on a coupled surface subsurface model for the wetland pond carroll et al 2005 rainfall directly on pond surfaces and evapotranspiration were the largest sources and losses of water during open water periods snowmelt was important as a source of water when ponds thawed in spring and provided sufficient water to enable the pond to persist even though water losses commonly exceeded gains through much of the open water period yet snowmelt contribution to ponds infrequently exceeded gains during the open water periods from rainfall and runoff runoff commonly contributed less water to ponds than rain falling directly on the pond surface and most often was associated with rain falling on frozen upland soil after the pond had thawed or during episodes of intense rainfall or rain persisting for more than a day eisenlohr et al 1972 runoff however was variable such that years with similar rainfall could differ substantially in the amount of runoff derived from rain falling on the uplands eisenlohr et al 1972 heagle et al 2007 woo and rowsell 1993 groundwater flow contributed the least to water gains and losses and has been reported as a net value in other water budget studies hayashi et al 1988a shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 the few published water budgets of prairie pothole wetland ponds all reported net seepage outflow for all ponds and years of study hayashi et al 1988a shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 except in ponds intermittently connected by a stream in a year of historically large snow accumulation brannen et al 2015 groundwater inflow to the pond of wetland p1 exceeded loss of pond water to groundwater in all years except 1991 and 1992 when snowmelt was absent or minimal the predominance of water gain from groundwater inflow relative to pond outflow to groundwater compared to other studies may be related to the topographic and hydrogeological setting of wetland p1 that favored groundwater discharge to the pond few water budget studies of lakes and wetlands include determination of the budget residual the difference between measured water gains losses and change in storage including measurement uncertainty or error hayashi et al 1988a noted uncertainty existed in the water budget but did not include a value for the budget residual only shjeflo 1968 and brannen et al 2015 included quantification of the budget residual in their water budgets of prairie pothole wetland ponds for the budgets provided by shjeflo 1968 eisenlohr et al 1972 noted the residual was an indicator of the uncertainty in the budget computations brannen et al 2015 used the relation between the budget residual and the water table depth to indicate the residual may represent net groundwater flow into the ponds as well as error associated with the water budget our approach for the pond of wetland p1 using determination of the cumulative error or uncertainty in the measured budgets based on first order error analysis was not used in other published budgets such determination enabled the identification of periods when the budget residual was indistinguishable from inherent uncertainty in measurements and periods when the budget residual indicated an imbalance in the water budget larger than could be accounted for by uncertainty in measurement alone in the pond of wetland p1 the budget imbalance in the latter case was likely associated with under representation of water loss by transpiration or periods when hydraulic gradients indicated by the wells were not indicative of gradients closer to the pond also as noted by hayashi et al 2016 at some point when the pond surface area declines change in pond water level exceeds that expected based on calculated evapotranspiration because of the increasing influence of water lost at the pond perimeter relative to loss from the pond surface 5 2 solute budgets the fact that change in sulfate mass in the pond of wetland p1 was not always accounted for by the difference between external solute inputs and losses from the pond to groundwater is consistent with other solute budgets for closed basin prairie pothole wetland ponds hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 in the study of the pond of a recharge wetland s109 at the st denis wetland site in saskatchewan canada sulfate reduction accounted for most of the change in concentration of sulfate in the pond heagle et al 2007 sulfate reduction also was an important process removing sulfate from the pond of nearby wetland 50 a discharge wetland heagle et al 2013 based on observations of the change in mass in sulfate in the pond relative to change in volume changes in the stable sulfur isotope of sulfate δs34 so4 measured in the pond of wetland p1 goldhaber et al 2014 mills et al 2011 indicate sulfate reduction did occur in the pond sulfate reduction likely accounts for the loss of sulfate needed to reconcile the difference between change in sulfate in the pond and the imbalance between external solute inputs and loss observed in the open water period of all years except 1992 1996 and 1997 export of sulfate by movement of pond water into wetland sediments at the edge of the pond of discharge wetland 50 as it dries was documented by heagle et al 2013 over 19 years of observation this export was a mechanism associated with long term accumulation within the wetland sediments dry periods also were associated with larger sulfate export from the pond of wetland p1 to groundwater than in wetter periods as the pond shrank the export gradient was into wetland sediments rather than the uplands the fact that some segments of the pond shoreline could be locations of solute export at the same time other segments of shoreline indicated solute import to the pond suggests the areal extent of solute accumulation in the subsurface may not be uniform regarding other solutes heagle et al 2007 found dissolution of magnesium calcite in wetland soils added calcium and magnesium to the pond of recharge wetland s109 in the case of wetland p1 groundwater and runoff solute input to the pond was greater than loss by export from the pond to groundwater loss of calcium and magnesium from the pond was indicated from the budget imbalance in the open water period for many years despite the overall increase in concentration within the pond from the beginning to the end of most periods net precipitation of magnesium carbonate in the pond was documented by goldhaber et al 2014 heagle et al 2013 used chloride to balance the water budget of the pond of s109 the resulting water budget was used to determine the mass balance for other solutes because open water period chloride budgets for the pond of wetland p1 were accounted for within budget measurement uncertainty in nearly half of the years in our study we assumed the years of imbalance indicated unmeasured chloride export likely due to evaporation induced flow of water out of the pond at the periphery hayashi et al 1988b observed a period when chloride concentrations declined in the pond of wetland s109 a decline that was not consistent with physical processes such changes were attributed to uptake by plants as described by hutchinson 1957 such uptake might also be a factor in accounting for those open water periods for wetland p1 when the change in mass in the pond was less than expected based on external solute input and export such occurrences were observed mainly prior to 1989 when living emergent vegetation occupied some of the areal extent of the pond throughout the open water period seasonal measurement of the chloride content of emergent vegetation to examine uptake however was not part of our study wetter conditions have resulted in increased solute mass in the ponds of wetlands such as wetland 50 at the st denis site heagle et al 2013 and the pond of wetland p1 because of solute input to the ponds yet changes in salinity due to wetter conditions are not uniform in prairie pothole wetlands being dependent on their hydrological settings nachshon et al 2014 labaugh et al 2016 either as recharge flow through or discharge ponds as well as the presence or absence of surface water flow between ponds shaw et al 2012 for ponds with increased solute mass during wetter conditions such as in wetland p1 labaugh et al 2016 declining water levels under drier conditions have the potential to increase salinity of the pond in the absence of a substantial loss mechanism as hypothesized by nachshon et al 2014 at the cottonwood site however previous fluctuations in pond levels of wetland p1 have not been associated with higher salinities as the pond declined from water levels similar to that encountered after 1993 labaugh et al 2016 based on the solute budgets for the pond as the pond dries some solutes are lost by flow from the pond to groundwater and wetland sediments and some are lost due to chemical precipitation or gaseous flux out of the pond the increased loss of water at the periphery of declining ponds noted by hayashi et al 2016 and the increased salinization and storage at the pond periphery as pond levels decline as observed by arndt and richardson 1993 also must have been sufficient in the past to moderate the salinity of the pond through episodes of deluge and drought 6 conclusions determination of groundwater input to a wetland pond and flow of water from the pond to groundwater revealed dynamic aspects of groundwater interaction with prairie pothole wetland ponds important to the water and solute budgets of the pond during the open water period in drier years as the pond shrank loss of water from the pond by flow to groundwater became more important than in other years such flow out of the pond also provided for export of solutes to wetland sediments when the pond edge receded from the upland groundwater flow into the pond represented the largest source of many solutes ca mg na k cl so4 alkalinity even though such flow commonly represented the smallest contribution to water input to the pond relative to rainfall or runoff during the wetter periods as the pond increased in size thereby expanding the area of groundwater input to the pond the relatively greater influx of ca and alkalinity was consistent with the presence of readily weathered calcite in the soils arndt and richardson 1993 and subsequent flow into the pond the importance of solute input to the pond and solute loss from the pond as independent processes when examining solute dynamics indicates determination of groundwater input and output separately has benefits over determination of groundwater interaction with the pond as a net water flux alone measurement uncertainty in the solute budgets also enabled distinction between years when change in mass in the pond was accounted for by external inputs and outputs and when change in mass in the pond was not accounted for by external inputs and outputs thereby indicating some unmeasured loss in mass took place pond permanence size and salinity all affect wetland habitats in the prairie pothole region it is important to understand how these factors change under varying climate conditions ranging from drought to deluge as documented here our study indicates the importance of taking into account groundwater as a factor affecting wetland salinity particularly in closed basin wetlands receiving groundwater discharge therefore it is important to know the

8510,study region cottonwood lake area wetlands north dakota u s a study focus fluctuations in pond permanence size and salinity are key features of prairie pothole wetlands that provide a variety of wetland habitats for waterfowl in the northern prairie of north america observation of water level and salinity fluctuations in a semi permanent wetland pond over a 20 year period included periods when the wetland occasionally was dry as well as wetter years when the pond depth and surface extent doubled while volume increased 10 times new hydrological insights for the study region compared to all other measured budget components groundwater flow into the pond often contributed the least water 8 28 percent but the largest amount 90 percent of specific solutes to the water and solute budgets of the pond in drier years flow from the pond into groundwater represented 10 percent of water loss and in 1992 was approximately equal to evapotranspiration loss also during the drier years export of calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride and sulfate by flow from the pond to groundwater was substantial compared with previous or subsequent years a process that would have been undetected if groundwater flux had been calculated as a net value independent quantification of water and solute gains and losses were essential to understand controls on water level and salinity fluctuations in the pond in response to variable climate conditions keywords wetland hydrology climate variability groundwater solutes prairie pothole wetlands 1 introduction the northern prairie of north america contains a remarkable variety of wetlands known as prairie potholes or sloughs that serve as an important resource for waterfowl producing as much as 50 80 percent of these birds in the continent batt et al 1989 biota in these wetlands change in response to dynamic fluctuations in water levels and salinity thereby resulting in a mosaic of different community types and vegetation cover stewart and kantrud 1971 that influence waterfowl use of the wetlands swanson and duebbert 1989 weller 1978 understanding factors controlling fluctuations in water levels and salinity in the ponds of these wetlands therefore is of interest to managers of these natural resources euliss et al 2004 2014 renton et al 2015 robarts and bothwell 1992 as well as those who study earth surface processes arndt and richardson 1989 goldhaber et al 2014 wetland hydrological characteristics winter and woo 1990 woo and rowsell 1993 wetland vegetation dynamics van der valk 2005 and waterfowl habitat swanson and duebbert 1989 prairie pothole wetlands occupy depressions capable of storing water these depressions are found within end moraines ground moraines stagnation moraines outwash plains and lake plains formed during the advance and retreat of the continental ice sheet eisenlohr et al 1972 winter 1989 most of these depressions lack interconnection by natural surface channels however water levels in the ponds can increase to points in their basins where water can spill overland to adjacent wetland depressions eisenlohr et al 1972 rosenberry and winter 1997 shaw et al 2012 the ponded portion of the wetlands where surface water is present in the prairie pothole depressions originates primarily from snow that melts in the spring and rainfall most of the water lost from the ponds is through evapotranspiration shjeflo 1968 groundwater interaction with wetland ponds mainly involves localized shallow groundwater flow eisenlohr et al 1972 sloan 1972 within the depressions containing the wetlands lissey 1971 in cases where groundwater flow is generally toward a wetland pond reversals in groundwater flow directions at the periphery of the pond can occur due to two processes transpiration and water input from intense rain and snowmelt transpiration by vegetation at the pond perimeter can cause a localized depression in the water table immediately adjacent to the pond thereby causing water to flow out of the pond into groundwater berthold et al 2004 meyboom 1966 meyboom et al 1966 mills and zwarich 1986 rosenberry and winter 1997 episodes of intense rain and snowmelt can raise the water level in the pond above the adjacent groundwater level also causing water to temporarily flow out of the pond particularly for temporary ponds johnson et al 2004 water stored in prairie pothole wetland ponds varies in salinity from less than 300 ppm fresh water to greater than 35 000 ppm saline water barica 1975 bierhuizen and prepas 1985 hammer 1978 last 1992 petri and larson 1973 rozkowski 1969 swanson et al 1988 wetland ponds that have surface or groundwater outlets are relatively fresh those that have no outlets are more saline sloan 1972 solutes are concentrated in prairie pothole wetland ponds in two ways when evapotranspiration is greater than precipitation wetland pond water levels decline and solutes are concentrated in the ponds jones and deocampo 2003 solutes also are concentrated during ice formation as pond water freezes solutes are excluded from the ice and concentrated in the remaining liquid water when freezing continues into the sediments solutes are concentrated in the pore water in sediments below the maximum ice extent ficken 1967 after the sediments thaw diffusion of solutes from the sediment pore water into the pond contributes to pond salinity ficken 1967 heagle et al 2013 evapotranspiration by plants at the edge of ponds can lead to localized increased salinity of shallow groundwater at the pond periphery arndt and richardson 1993 miller 1969 and salinization of soils arndt and richardson 1989 within the more permanent zone of soil salinization arndt and richardson 1993 noted the increased salinity in the shallow groundwater at the pond periphery can be transient because periodic recharge events result in groundwater flow that moves the accumulated solutes from the periphery into the pond solutes are also added to the ponds from groundwater flow originating from the adjacent uplands arndt and richardson 1993 eisenlohr et al 1972 hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 miller 1969 rozkowski 1969 rain snow and surface runoff are other hydrologic sources of solutes to the ponds eisenlohr et al 1972 hayashi et al 1988b decomposing vegetation also can contribute to solutes in pond water biondini and arndt 1993 solutes are removed from wetland ponds by several mechanisms water flows overland from a pond to an adjacent wetland basin when the pond level rises to its basin s spill point eisenlohr et al 1972 thereby removing solutes from the pond leibowitz and vining 2003 nachshon et al 2014 leibowitz et al 2016 when the pond level is below the surface spill point of the depression it occupies no loss of solutes by surface water flow can occur movement of pond water into groundwater outflow seepage however can remove solutes from the pond when the water level in the pond is higher than the water levels in the adjacent groundwater sloan 1972 processes within a pond can favor removal of solutes from pond water by chemical precipitation goldhaber et al 2014 or by gas flux biondini and arndt 1993 mills et al 2011 when wetlands are dry salts can be removed from the wetland sediment surface by wind eisenlohr et al 1972 jones and deocampo 2003 labaugh et al 1996 luba et al 1988 similar to loss of salts that occurs from closed lakes langbein 1961 the semi arid region occupied by prairie pothole wetlands is subject to considerable variation in climate laird et al 2003 van der valk 2005 episodes of drought commonly recur less common are episodes of very wet conditions and deluge winter and rosenberry 1998 observation of changes in pond water levels and salinity in the past few decades have begun to document how variations in water level and salinity are related to the processes controlling the hydrologic and chemical characteristics of these ponds both during the onset of drought and transition to wetter conditions labaugh et al 1996 as well as during persistent wet conditions and high water levels labaugh et al 2016 nachshon et al 2014 simple water balance models rainfall and runoff have been used to relate wet and dry episodes to fluctuations in water levels of prairie pothole wetlands carroll et al 2005 huang et al 2013 johnson et al 2005 2015 liu and schwartz 2011 poiani et al 1996 quantification of the contribution of each of the various processes affecting variations in pond water levels and salinity in prairie pothole wetlands however are rare and are only of several years duration hayashi et al 1988a 1998b heagle et al 2007 2013 shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 published water and solute budgets provide an initial foundation regarding the quantification of the factors controlling fluctuations in water levels and salinity in the ponds of these wetlands that influence use by waterfowl the several years duration of published budget studies hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 have not yet quantified the full cycle of wet and dry conditions that have such an important influence on wetland habitat dynamics van der valk 2005 measurement of the components of the water and solute budgets of the pond of wetland p1 in the cottonwood lake area north dakota u s a a semi permanent pond that has no surface outlet during a period of drought and deluge between 1979 and 1998 provides the opportunity to add to the foundation of the earlier studies because the duration of the study encompassed hydrologic extremes results of the study of wetland p1 are the focus of this report 1 1 purpose and scope here we examine the water and chemical balances of the pond of a semi permanent wetland in a groundwater discharge area wetland p1 during a period of climatic contrasts examination of such balances provides information about the importance of various water and solute sources and losses on the geochemical characteristics of the wetland which are related to the biological communities for which these wetlands are an important resource complete water budget studies of ponds of prairie pothole wetlands have appeared in only a few studies shjeflo 1968 hayashi et al 1988a woo and rowsell 1993 and such water budgets have only been associated with chemical budgets sulfate and chloride for a recharge wetland hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 presented here are water and solute budgets for wetland p1 for the period of 1979 1998 this period includes years when the wetland pond was dry as well as when water levels increased to a point where the distinct ponds in the wetland merged with each other and with the pond of an adjacent wetland the focus is on budgets for open water periods placed in context of the contribution from snow prior to the open water period which is consistent with analyses of other pond water and solute budgets of prairie pothole wetlands eisenlohr et al 1972 hayashi et al 1988a 1998b heagle et al 2007 shjeflo 1968 2 study area located in stutsman county north dakota u s a the 92 ha study site is a u s fish and wildlife service waterfowl production area winter 2003 native prairie and wetlands covers 80 percent of the site the remainder was cultivated for brome grass and alfalfa prior to purchase in 1963 the cottonwood lake area study site in east central north dakota is near the eastern edge of a large glacial stagnation moraine known as the missouri coteau glacial drift that covers the site is mostly clayey silty till the upper 5 15 m of which is oxidized and fractured goldhaber et al 2014 many depressions occupy this hummocky area of approximately 25 m relief depressions include wetlands that contain water for weeks to months before becoming dry seasonal ponds and those that contain water throughout most years semi permanent ponds becoming dry only during very dry years terms used here to describe the temporal characteristics of the ponds are in accordance with those used by stewart and kantrud 1971 wetlands in the study area include those whose ponds lose water to groundwater recharge wetlands both receive water from and lose water to groundwater flow through wetlands and primarily receive water from groundwater discharge wetlands terms used here to describe the relation of the ponds to groundwater are in accordance with those used by sloan 1972 water levels in some wetland ponds have increased until adjacent ponds coalesce or water can spill out of one depression or basin into an adjacent depression this region of north america is semi arid average annual precipitation in east central north dakota is 440 mm and average annual evapotranspiration is 810 mm rosenberry 2003 based on data from three national weather service stations for 1961 1990 precipitation is greatest during july averaging 90 mm and least during november through february snowfall averages 865 mm and the snowpack commonly extends from early december through late march average annual temperature is 4 c while extreme temperatures range from 47 to 48 c rosenberry 2003 investigations at the site began in 1967 and focused on the relation of waterfowl to prairie pothole wetlands included in that work were intermittent analyses of chemical characteristics of water in the wetland ponds salinity in the ponds varies from fresh to saline detailed study of the hydrological characteristics of the wetlands at the site was added in 1979 and accompanied by more frequent analysis of chemical characteristics of water in the wetland ponds and shallow groundwater the term pond refers to the surface water within the depression containing the hydric soils and associated vegetation that define a wetland following the distinction between a pond and its wetland noted by eisenlohr et al 1972 and hayashi et al 2016 the focus of this study was the semi permanent pond of wetland p1 fig 1 a closed basin receiving groundwater discharge including its episodic merger with a separate seasonal pond in the wetland identified in past studies as wetland t1 but hereafter identified as pond t1 and the seasonal pond of the adjacent wetland wetland t3 between 1979 and 1998 the two seasonal ponds of wetlands t1 and t3 were relatively shallower 0 48 m t1 0 3 m t3 and smaller 853 m3 t1 25 m3 t3 than the semi permanent pond of wetland p1 at the point of merger 1 11 m 16 673 m3 with t1 and 2 03 m 58 164 m3 with t3 changes in the pond surface extent of these wetlands in response to changes between drier and wetter conditions were documented in winter and rosenberry 1998 at times the ponds were absent and the wetlands were dry in wetter years the surface of the ponds extended into the uplands to the point where all wetland emergent vegetation was inundated decomposed and thereafter was absent during the study period changes in the relation between these ponds and groundwater are described in winter and rosenberry 1995 and rosenberry and winter 1997 however water and solute budgets for open water periods were not examined in those previous publications and are presented here 3 material and methods 3 1 hydrological instrumentation 3 1 1 groundwater twenty shallow observation wells depths between 5 2 and 14 6 m below land surface were installed in the cottonwood lake wetlands study area as described in winter and carr 1980 and many of these wells were in the upland of wetland p1 water levels were measured with a chalked steel tape on a monthly basis during winter and weekly to biweekly from spring through fall six additional wells depths between 1 5 and 2 1 m below land surface were installed between wetlands p1 and t3 in june of 1989 rosenberry and winter 1997 and water levels were recorded with potentiometer float systems connected to a digital data logger programmed to produce bihourly and daily averages measuring points of all wells were surveyed to a common datum 3 1 2 surface water staff gages installed in each of the ponds were read weekly to biweekly or monthly on the same day as water levels were measured in the wells beginning in 1979 continuous stage water level data for the pond of wetland p1 were recorded by a potentiometer float system installed in a stilling well near the center of the pond in july 1980 data were recorded every minute from which hourly and daily averages were computed by a digital data logger continuous stage data were collected during as much of the ice free period as was practical typically from april through october all pond staff gages were surveyed each year to a common datum 3 1 3 atmospheric water a tipping bucket rain gage and digital data logger were installed in july 1979 and a standard non recording rain and snow gage was installed in january 1980 both in the upland adjacent to wetland p1 winter and carr 1980 for periods when data from those gages were missing or not available data from a nearby national weather service gage at woodworth north dakota station id ghcnd us1ndsm0008 located approximately 16 km west northwest of the cottonwood site data accessed january 8 2016 were used instrumentation needed to calculate evapotranspiration was installed beginning in 1979 fig 1 water surface and air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were measured at a raft near the center of wetland p1 winter and carr 1980 atmospheric sensors were installed 2 m above the water surface vapor pressure gradient was determined from relative humidity data and by assuming that the atmosphere was saturated at the water surface additional instrumentation was installed in 1982 parkhurst et al 1998 thermistors thermometers were installed approximately 2 cm beneath the water surface and 20 cm above the wetland sediments and also 0 5 m and 1 m below the wetland sediment water interface to determine change in heat stored in the water column and underlying sediments solar and atmospheric radiation was measured in the upland near pond t1 wind speed was measured at 2 m above land surface in the vicinity of the radiation instruments auxiliary air temperature and relative humidity data were measured with a hygrothermograph located in an instrument shelter in the upland between wetlands p1 and t3 3 1 4 measurement uncertainty measurements of the components of the water budgets of lakes and wetland ponds are associated with some uncertainty winter 1981 labaugh 1986 the water budget of the pond of wetland p1 was determined as follows 1 p r gi et go dv where p precipitation snow rain falling directly on the pond surface r runoff from rainfall gi groundwater input et evapotranspiration go groundwater output and dv change in pond volume rainfall groundwater in and out evapotranspiration and change in pond volume were measured independently runoff was calculated using change in pond stage and rainfall data no component however was estimated from the difference between inputs outputs and change in storage this approach enabled us to represent cumulative error of all of the measured components and any water gain or loss unaccounted for in the budget as the residual of the water budget r 2 p r gi et go dv r the cumulative error in the budget δ was determined from a first order error analysis assuming errors in measurement of the budget components are independent and randomly distributed 3 δ square root of δ2p δ2r δ2gi δ2et δ2go δ2dv where δ error δ2p precipitation falling directly on the pond surface error estimate for precipitation 2 δ2r runoff from rainfall error estimate for runoff 2 δ2gi groundwater input error estimate for groundwater input 2 δ2et evapotranspiration error estimate for evapotranspiration 2 δ2go groundwater output error estimate for groundwater output 2 and δ2dv change in pond volume error estimate for change in pond volume 2 estimates of measurement error used in this analysis primarily were based on winter 1981 and were 5 percent for precipitation falling directly on the pond surface 50 percent for groundwater input 10 percent for evapotranspiration determined from the energy budget and 15 percent for evapotranspiration determined from the mather and hamon methods based on rosenberry et al 2004 50 percent for pond water loss by flow to groundwater and 10 percent for change in pond volume runoff error was not quantified in winter 1981 we assumed an estimate of error of 100 percent for runoff from rain based on motz et al 2001 in cases when the cumulative error in the budget was larger than the budget residual we assumed this indicated that all water gains and losses were accounted for within the uncertainty in the measured budget in cases when the cumulative error in the budget was smaller than the budget residual we assumed this indicated some water gain or loss was unaccounted for within the uncertainty in the measured budget whereby the difference between the cumulative error and the budget residual represented the part of the budget not measured 3 2 water budget calculation 3 2 1 pond surface area and volume stage area and stage volume relations for the pond were determined from surveys of the wetland pond bathymetry and adjacent upland including a plane table survey made in 1983 and a lidar light detection and ranging survey of the entire waterfowl production area in 2008 daily change in volume of the pond was calculated by difference between the volume of the pond on one day and the volume of the pond on the previous day summation of daily values was used to calculate monthly values 3 2 2 precipitation volume precipitation falling on the wetland pond was determined in two ways first the total volume contributed by snow at the end of each snow accumulation season was approximated by difference using the last pond volume in fall based on the last recorded pond water level and the first pond volume in the following spring based on the first recorded pond water level this volume includes the combination of snow that fell directly on the wetland or frozen pond snow that drifted onto those surfaces and snowmelt flowing over frozen ground to the pond second during the months when the pond surface was not covered by ice the precipitation volume was determined by multiplying daily rainfall by the pond water surface area associated with the water level elevation on the day the rainfall was recorded monthly values of precipitation in cubic meters were determined from summation of daily values 3 2 3 runoff volume on days when rainfall was measured the volume of the pond was compared to the volume from the previous day if the change in volume of the pond was greater than the volume of rainfall falling on the surface of the pond the difference was attributed to runoff shjeflo 1968 monthly runoff in cubic meters was calculated by summation of daily values within the month 3 2 4 evapotranspiration volume evapotranspiration was calculated using the energy budget method for years 1982 1985 1987 when instrumentation at the site enabled such calculations parkhurst et al 1998 the mather 1978 and hamon 1961 equations were used to determine evapotranspiration for the period 1979 1998 based on an evaluation of results from 13 equations for determining evapotranspiration in comparison with the energy budget rosenberry et al 2004 both the mather commonly called thornthwaite and hamon equations use air temperature data for periods when daily average air temperature was measured at the site monthly average air temperature values were determined from daily data for periods when air temperature data were not available at the site data from the jamestown north dakota national weather service site ghcnd usw00014919 located approximately 37 km southeast of the site mene et al 2012 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center http doi org 10 7289 v5d21vhz access date january 8 2016 were used to determine monthly average air temperature values 1979 to

observatory at http aa usno navy mil data docs dur oneyear php access date january 22 2016 for the location of jamestown north dakota values in millimeters per month determined from both the mather and hamon equations were multiplied by the surface area of the pond on the last day of the month to obtain evapotranspiration in cubic meters for the month 3 2 5 groundwater volume the volume of water either flowing from groundwater into the wetland pond or flowing from the pond to groundwater each month was determined at multiple points around the pond perimeter using the darcy equation 8 q kia where q is groundwater flow volume time k is hydraulic conductivity length time i is the hydraulic gradient and a is the cross sectional area through which water flows into or out of the wetland in relation to groundwater k was determined from 79 aquifer slug tests conducted at 49 observation wells in the study area and averaged 4 7 10 5 cm second i was calculated by subtracting the water level in the pond from the water level in the wells located near the p1 pond and dividing by the horizontal distance between the well and the p1 pond shoreline a was determined by multiplying the length of the shoreline by the average depth 15 2 m of the local shallow groundwater system parkhurst et al 1998 which corresponds to the approximate maximum depth of weathered and fractured till at the site goldhaber et al 2014 the shoreline of p1 was divided into segments each attributed to a well that was used to calculate the hydraulic gradient near that portion of the pond fig 1 segments initially were assigned to each of the following observation wells 13 14 17 20 25 and 26 fig 1 when the ponds of t1 and p1 coalesced additional segments were assigned to observation wells 15 and 23 when the combined pond of p1 t1 coalesced with the pond of t3 the segment assigned to well 13 was assigned to wells 12 and 52 eq 1 was applied to each segment and depending on the direction of the hydraulic gradient the total groundwater flow to the pond or flow from the pond to groundwater was calculated as the sum from each segment as the water level in p1 rose and the shoreline expanded the above calculations were adjusted in three ways first the horizontal distance between each well and the shoreline was reduced as the shoreline moved closer to the well second as the water level in p1 rose and approached to within 3 m of a piezometer used to calculate the hydraulic gradient to the pond a more distant piezometer was used to calculate the hydraulic gradient to the pond fig 1 the gradient calculations were modified by substituting wells 12 and 52 for well 13 well 16 for well 15 well 18 for well 17 well 28 for well 25 and well 27 for well 26 third when the pond of wetland p1 merged with pond t1 and eventually with the pond of wetland t3 the shoreline changed new shoreline segments were then added as noted above fig 1 and the shoreline length for each segment was adjusted for the shoreline configuration of the new merged pond calculating monthly groundwater flow for each segment meant we could distinguish segments where groundwater was flowing into the pond from segments where water was flowing from the pond into groundwater monthly groundwater exchange with the pond therefore was not calculated as a net value instead we determined separate monthly volumes for gi and go also the simultaneous occurrence of groundwater flow into the pond and pond water flow to groundwater did not indicate a flow through condition where water lost to groundwater would eventually leave the local basin instead water flowing out of the pond ended at nearby depressions in the water table resulting from loss of shallow groundwater to evapotranspiration 3 3 chemical data collection 3 3 1 groundwater groundwater was removed from the observation wells by use of a bailer or a peristaltic pump in cases when removal of groundwater left no water in the well groundwater that seeped into the well overnight was collected by bailer or pump for subsequent physical and chemical analysis otherwise samples of groundwater were collected after three casing volumes of water had been removed from the well around the periphery of wetland p1 water was collected from wells 13 14 15 16 17 20 25 and 26 collection from wells 13 and 16 was initiated in 1980 from wells 17 20 25 26 in 1983 and from well 15 in 1984 sample collection took place primarily between april and october approximately monthly prior to 1983 and intermittently from 1983 through 1991 in addition to the more detailed chemical analyses of groundwater collected from the wells in situ measurements were made from 1987 to 1995 water temperature ph and specific conductance commonly were measured once in the summer in wells 17 20 25 and 26 using an in situ hydrolab probe designed to fit into 2 inch diameter wells water collected prior to 1983 was analyzed at the u s fish and wildlife service northern prairie wildlife research center laboratory in jamestown north dakota according to methods described in swanson et al 1988 water collected between 1983 and 1991 was analyzed at the u s geological survey national water quality laboratory in lakewood colorado according to methods described in fishman and friedman 1989 analysis of ph specific conductance and total alkalinity was made on unfiltered groundwater water filtered through a 0 45 micrometer filter was used for analysis of dissolved calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen for water analyzed at the u s geological survey laboratory filtrate used for cation analysis was preserved with 1 ml of nitric acid per 250 ml of filtrate and water used for nitrogen analyses was preserved with 1 ml of hgcl the analysis for dissolved nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen performed by the u s geological survey laboratory was assumed to represent nitrate nitrogen whereas the u s fish and wildlife service laboratory determined nitrate individually as nitrate nitrogen 3 3 2 surface water water was collected from the pond of wetlands at the site using a tube water column sampling device typically 0 65 1 35 m long with a minimum diameter of 10 cm as described in swanson 1978 between 1979 and 1995 water was collected from the mid point of each of three transects transects described in labaugh et al 1987 and from 1996 to 1998 from a single transect within the pond when a pond was very shallow and almost dry water was collected from the center of the pond water collected from each transect was processed separately for subsequent analysis thereby enabling determination of heterogeneity within the pond water from the tube sampling device was transferred to a plastic bucket or large polyethylene bottle then to either 2 l 250 ml or 500 ml polyethylene sample bottles prior to transport to the laboratory according to the protocols of the laboratories swanson et al 1988 fishman and friedman 1989 the u s fish and wildlife service laboratory was used for analysis of pond water collected before 1983 the u s geological survey laboratory was used for analysis of pond water collected from 1983 to 1992 and 1994 for pond water collected from 1992 to 1998 water analysis also was conducted at the bureau of reclamation laboratory in bismarck north dakota using standard methods greenberg et al 1992 3 3 3 atmospheric water results of chemical analyses of atmospheric deposition were obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program national trends network gage at woodworth north dakota located approximately 16 km west northwest of the cottonwood site station nd11 data accessed july 8 2016 data for monthly average values from this site were available beginning december 1983 and continuing through 1998 the north dakota state department of health collected atmospheric deposition at the woodworth site for chemical analysis between 1981 and 1984 deutschman and ell 1986 data for the average values for may to october were available for each of those years from the north dakota state department of health 3 4 chemical budgets 3 4 1 groundwater to determine groundwater contribution to chemical flux entering the pond the median concentrations in the wells within each shoreline segment were multiplied by the monthly volumes of groundwater flow into the pond for their respective segments the median solute values used for groundwater input in each segment were those for the entire study period for that segment when the wetland surface expanded to encompass well 12 the gradient associated with nearby well 52 was used this method of calculation is consistent with other similar studies where solute concentrations in groundwater have been documented on decadal time scales labaugh et al 1995 buso et al 2009 to determine chemical flux from the pond to groundwater the median concentration in the pond for the month was multiplied by the total monthly volume of water flowing from the pond into groundwater in some months detailed chemical analyses were not available to calculate this flux april 1982 1984 1986 1996 may to september 1983 and october 1995 and 1996 for those months with missing data the median specific conductance for the month was used with regression relations between ca mg na k cl so4 and alkalinity in the pond of wetland p1 for the years 1979 1998 to estimate concentrations in the wetland pond ca 25 55 μs cm 0 04347 n 374 r2 0 70 mg 48 28 μs cm 0 11305 n 374 r2 0 96 na 11 18 μs cm 0 06849 n 373 r2 0 74 k 3 53

0 01 level for a few months april 1989 1990 1991 october 1988 and november 1981 no specific conductance data were available therefore chemical concentrations from either the next month or the previous month were used in the calculations of the mass flowing out of the pond into groundwater 3 4 2 change in mass in the pond on the dates for which water was collected for subsequent chemical analysis in the laboratory the volume of water in the pond on that date was multiplied by the solute concentration to determine the mass of solute in the pond because dates of pond water collection for chemical analysis rarely coincided with the beginning or the end of a month monthly changes in mass were not calculated change in mass in the pond during the open water period was determined by the difference between the mass on the individual dates chemical analyses were available during the open water period 3 4 3 rainfall and runoff from rain solute input from atmospheric precipitation during the open water period was determined by summing daily volumes for rain within a month then multiplying the monthly total in cubic meter m3 for the month by the average concentration for that month obtained from the woodworth national atmospheric deposition site for the years 1984 1998 solute input during the open water periods of 1981 1983 was determined by multiplying the monthly total in m3 for each month by the average concentration at the woodworth site for the period may to october for each of those years published by deutschman and ell 1986 to approximate the relative contribution from atmospheric deposition during the years 1979 and 1981 the average concentrations for the period 1981 1984 published by deutschman and ell 1986 were used in the calculation assuming data from those years were a proxy for atmospheric deposition chemical composition in 1979 and 1980 monthly totals for runoff from rain were multiplied by the concentrations in atmospheric deposition for the month to calculate solute input to the pond each month of the open water period open water period values for solute mass input were calculated as the sum of monthly values as in the case of rain average values for chemical constituents determined from the period when data were available 1981 1984 were used to approximate the relative contribution of runoff in the open water periods prior to december 1983 4 results 4 1 water budgets changes in pond volume from spring to fall and water entering the pond or leaving the pond during that period are the main foci of the budget analysis presented herein on an annual basis however moisture deposited on the landscape and the frozen pond surface by snow and rain between fall and spring plays a role in determining the water volume present in the pond at spring thaw rain falling directly on the wetland pond during the open water period commonly was the largest source of water for the pond in most years fig 2 table 1 in a few years 1983 1987 1997 the volume contributed to the pond from snowmelt in the spring exceeded the contribution from rain falling on the pond surface during the subsequent open water period runoff from rain contributed less water to the pond than rain falling directly on the pond surface or snowmelt in many years but was more important in drier years when there was diminished or no snowmelt 1989 1992 and in the wetter year of 1993 runoff from rain was the largest source of water to the pond in 1990 1992 and 1993 groundwater generally was the smallest source of water for the pond in comparison to rainfall or runoff from rain yet did contribute volumes similar to runoff from rain in many years evapotranspiration was the largest water loss from the pond fig 2 representing greater than 90 percent of the total water lost in all but the drier years of 1989 1992 table 2 only in those drier years did pond water lost by flow into groundwater represent more than 10 percent of the total water loss as the pond volume and periphery diminished between 1989 and 1992 the flow of pond water to groundwater became more important as a mechanism removing water from the pond being approximately equivalent to water loss from evapotranspiration in 1992 the importance of evapotranspiration as the primary mechanism removing water from the pond was similar among the three methods used to determine evapotranspiration table 2 even though the absolute volumes determined from each method were not identical table 1 in most years the pond volume declined during the open water period table 1 and the pond was shallower in the late summer or fall than it was in the spring fig 3 in some years 1986 and 1993 1995 pond volume increased during the open water period table 1 and the pond was deeper at the end of the open water period than at the beginning of the period in other years 1990 and 1991 change in volume was negligible because in both years the pond was dry in april and in late summer the budget computation periods for 1990 and 1991 included data from the recording stage gage prior to the installation of the staff gage differences in water depths between the beginning and end of the open water periods for 1990 and 1991 based on staff gage data shown in fig 3 therefore do not reflect the water depths recorded during the entire budget computation period change in pond volume during the open water period was not accounted for completely by the difference between total water gains and losses based on the budget residual the difference between the change in pond volume and total water gains and losses table 3 a value of the budget residual other than zero indicates some water gains or losses may have been underestimated overestimated or unaccounted for by the measured components of the water budget the budget residual however includes uncertainty in measurement in addition to the difference between measured water gains and losses cumulative uncertainty in the budget was obtained from a first order error determination in some years 1986 1990 1995 the value of the cumulative error in the budget was larger than the absolute value of the budget residual therefore indicating all water gains and losses were accounted for within the uncertainty in the measured budget in other years 1979 1985 1987 1989 except 1987 when energy budget evapotranspiration was used and 1996 1998 the value of the cumulative error was less than the absolute value of the budget residual indicating some water gain or loss from the pond was not measured hydraulic gradients based on measurements at wells may not be indicative of gradients closer to the pond it is possible perhaps likely that the water table closer to the pond was lower than at the more distant well in which case more water could have been lost to groundwater due to evpotranspiration drawdown in some years than was indicated based on gradients integrated over the distance between the pond shoreline and the well rosenberry and winter 1997 the unaccounted water loss from the pond in some years also may represent water lost by transpiration not adequately represented by the method used to calculate evapotranspiration as the pond shrank in 1989 cattail germinated on the exposed wetland sediments with cattail increasing in areal extent from 1990 to 1993 in the drier years of 1990 1992 the extent of evapotranspiration drawdown perhaps was sufficient to be adequately represented by the wells more so than in other years in 1994 and 1995 the pond primarily was open water with little living emergent vegetation present in the pond the variable and dynamic effect of water gains and losses on the depth of the pond is evident in fig 3 the amount of snowmelt prior to pond thaw each year determined the starting depth and volume of the pond in most years a rise in pond depth occurred sometime after the snowmelt and pond thaw in response to rainfall as well as when runoff occurred runoff from rainfall to the pond was episodic occurring when rain fell on frozen ground in the spring and occasionally thereafter more commonly during periods when rain occurred over two or more days runoff however was not evident during all periods when rain occurred on multiple consecutive days consequently years with similar volumes of rainfall input such as 1979 and 1986 had dissimilar volumes of runoff table 1 varying by an order of magnitude a general decline in pond depth following peaks that commonly occurred earlier in the open water period reflected the dominance of water loss by evapotranspiration relative to water inputs in some years rainfall on the pond surface and associated episodic runoff in the latter part of the open water period caused increases in pond depth prior to formation of ice cover on the pond changes in pond water depth as a result of water losses exceeding gains or gains exceeding losses during the open water period fig 3 were associated with large changes in the pond surface area at a water depth of 1 11 m the pond of wetland p1 merges with pond t1 and at a depth of approximately 2 03 m that single pond merges with the pond of wetland t3 when either of the adjacent wetland ponds merged with the pond of p1 the combination was identified as the pond of wetland p1 and that volume was used in all of the calculations in this budget analysis because of the variation between drier and wetter conditions observed between 1979 and 1998 the surface area of the pond ranged from zero when dry episodically in 1989 1992 to 63 761 m2 in late april and early may of 1997 the surface area at the peak in 1997 was more than double the peak of 29 489 m2 in mid april of 1987 the largest value recorded prior to the onset of the wetter conditions that began in 1993 water gains and losses to wetlands when presented in terms of water fluxes per unit area such as in fig 4 enable comparison of year to year trends independent of the marked variations between years with respect to pond surface area for the purpose of this comparison evapotranspiration values derived from the mather equation were used because values were available for all years and the distribution of those values was more similar to energy budget values than those derived from the hamon equation fig 2 the year 1993 was the wettest year of the study when rainfall measured during the open water period was 638 mm subsequent years 1994 1998 were associated with consistently higher rainfall amounts during the open water period than occurred in most other years prior to 1993 when rainfall was more variable during some open water periods in years prior to 1993 the rainfall was similar to that measured in the latter wetter years following 1993 471 mm 1980 420 mm 1982 446 mm 1986 451 mm 1997 417 mm 1998 these years of somewhat similar rainfall totals during the open water period however differ substantially in the volumetric contribution to the water budget of the pond table 1 such differences highlight the importance of the size of the pond surface area to the translation of those rainfall totals into the volumetric contribution to the water budget of the pond in different years this also highlights the importance of snowmelt because it affects the size of the pond at the beginning of the open water period upon which rain falls changes in surface area of the pond also were associated with changes in the length of shoreline at the periphery of the pond shoreline length is used in the calculation of groundwater flux to and from the pond consequently as the pond surface and perimeter increased substantially beginning in 1993 the volume of groundwater inflow to the pond was greater 4000 m3 from 1993 to 1998 table 1 than in earlier years even though when expressed on a linear basis values for the open water periods of 1993 1998 were similar to values in many of the other years fig 4 4 2 solute budgets groundwater flowing into the pond of wetland p1 was the largest external source of calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride and sulfate input to the pond table 4 in general in each open water period groundwater accounted for 99 percent of the calcium magnesium sodium and sulfate input greater than 96 percent of potassium input and greater than 90 percent of chloride input the remainder of the input to the pond of these solutes from external sources was provided by rainfall on the pond surface and runoff open water periods in which the volume of runoff was larger than the volume of rainfall input to the pond 1990 1992 and 1993 were also the years when runoff contributed as much or more of the solute input relative to rainfall for these solutes one exception occurred in 1995 when runoff contributed more chloride than rainfall even though the volume of water contributed by runoff was less than for rainfall in april of 1995 the concentration of chloride in rainfall used to calculate chloride input from runoff was nearly three times the concentration during subsequent months and the volume of runoff in april was over four times the volume of rainfall in the same month rainfall was the major external source of input to the pond during open water periods for nitrate nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and hydrogen ions table 4 the input of rainfall was less than 50 percent of total input for nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen only in 1990 1992 and 1993 when runoff contributed the most volume to the pond only in 1992 and 1993 was less than 50 percent of the hydrogen ion input accounted for by rainfall the majority of the remainder coming from runoff in years when rainfall was the major external source of solute input of nitrogen and hydrogen ion the relative contribution of rainfall input of nitrogen and hydrogen ion from one open water period to the next was variable 59 95 percent for nitrate nitrogen 59 92 percent for ammonium nitrogen and 52 95 percent for hydrogen ion supplementary material table a1 solute concentrations in the pond result from the combination of solute gains and losses coincident with changes in pond volume as the relation between water gain and loss vary the seasonal and year to year variation in concentrations of solutes contributing the most to salinity in the pond are shown in figs 5 and 6 concentrations of the most abundant solutes generally increased during the open water periods as pond water levels declined concentrations overall were greater in years when pond levels were lower than 1 m before 1993 before pond levels showed pronounced increases magnesium and sulfate were the most abundant cations and anions in the pond throughout almost the entire study period which reflects their relation in groundwater flowing into the pond also data in figs 5 and 6 include concentration values obtained from each transect within the pond on each day water was collected for analysis the fact there was some within pond variability in concentration on a given day is more readily apparent for magnesium and sulfate figs 5 and 6 but occurred for all solutes the gradual rise in major solute concentration after 1993 reflects increased solute input from groundwater in succeeding years supplementary material table a1 dissolved nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations varied the most of all the major solutes on a given day median standard deviations were 45 percent for nitrate nitrogen and 12 percent for ammonia nitrogen variation within a month and from year to year exhibited no readily identifiable seasonal pattern nitrate nitrogen concentrations commonly were below detection limits and otherwise generally less than ammonia nitrogen concentration these generally low concentrations of nitrate have been observed in ponds of other prairie wetlands in response to uptake by biota barica 1974 neely and baker 1989 overall the sum of external solute inputs was greater than solute mass loss by flow from the pond to groundwater table 4 measured change in solute mass in the pond during the open water period commonly was less than the difference between all external inputs and solute mass loss by flow from the pond to groundwater some of the difference between measured change in mass of solute in the pond and external inputs and loss of solutes may simply be due to uncertainty in measurement of the solute budget uncertainty in the solute budget was determined using the method used to calculate cumulative error in the water budget using eq 1 based on median values the residuals of the solute balances were larger than the cumulative error in the solute balances for all solutes except alkalinity table 4 based on the many days when water was collected for solute analysis from more than one transect some of the uncertainty in the solute budgets may be due to the variability of solute concentrations in the pond on a given day the standard deviation per day expressed in terms of percent of mean concentration on that day is one measure of variability in the mass in the pond the medians of those percentages for all days in open water periods from 1979 to 1998 when data were available from more than one transect were ca 3 3 percent mg 2 5 percent na 2 3 percent k 2 6 percent cl 4 1 percent so4 1 9 percent alkalinity 2 4 percent hydrogen ion 25 percent nitrate nitrogen 45 percent and ammonium nitrogen 12 percent in years when the solute budget residual was larger than the cumulative error some of the residual unaccounted by cumulative error might be due simply to variability in concentration the percentages noted for the solutes above however were all smaller than the percentage of variability estimated from the mass of solute in excess of the cumulative error divided by the solute mass of the pond at the start of the open water period except for alkalinity 1987 1996 and 1997 therefore variability within the pond based on concentration values in each of the separate transects likely did not account for the budget residual mass of solute unexplained by uncertainty in the solute budgets even though in general between 1979 and 1998 some imbalance in the solute budgets of the pond were unaccounted for by measured inputs and outputs this was not the case every year for some years the cumulative error in open water period solute budgets was larger than the absolute value of the solute budget residual indicating all solute gains and losses were accounted for within the uncertainty in the budget however years in which this occurred were not always coincident for all solutes ca 1990 1994 and 1996 mg 1989 1992 1994 1997 na 1980 and 1981 1992 1994 1997 k 1983 and 1987 cl 1989 1997 so4 1992 1996 and 1997 alkalinity 1980 and 1981 1990 1992 1995 ammonium nitrogen 1993 and 1995 in addition not all of these years coincided with years in which the water budget was accounted for within measurement uncertainty 1986 1990 1995 closure of individual solute budgets within uncertainty therefore was not simply a function of closure of water budgets among the possible mechanisms that might explain the imbalance in the solute budgets for the pond is that flow of water from the pond into groundwater may be higher than calculated this could occur if the observation wells used to estimate the groundwater gradient around the wetland were not close enough to the pond to capture the transpiration driven water table depression around the periphery of the wetland pond rosenberry and winter 1997 the fact that mass export occurs as the pond shrinks is evident from year to year changes in the open water period loss of sulfate by flow from the pond to groundwater fig 7 and for calcium magnesium sodium potassium and chloride supplementary material table a1 being most pronounced in dry years these were the periods when the loss of water from the pond to groundwater represented approximately 20 percent or greater of the total loss of water from the pond 1989 1992 this finding also is consistent with the fact that in the preceding years the likely imbalance in the water budget was due to underestimation of evapotranspiration when emergent vegetation was present in the pond another possible source of imbalances that were greater than could be accounted for within uncertainty in the budgets is overestimation of solute contributions to the pond from groundwater median concentrations among groundwater collected from the observation wells were not uniform table 5 groundwater collected at the periphery of the wetland p1 pond in june of 1988 by arndt and richardson 1993 varied with respect to electrical conductivity between 4 6 8 7 ds m 1 4600 8700 microsiemens cm 1 in the shoreline segment associated with well 13 and between 3 4 6 3 ds m 1 3400 6300 microsiemens cm 1 in the shoreline segment associated with well 25 specific conductance in water from well 25 varied from 4680 to 6320 microsiemens cm 1 n 9 based on seven in situ probe measurements and two laboratory analyses values within the range observed at the pond periphery by arndt and richardson 1993 specific conductance in water from well 13 varied between 10600 and 15200 microsiemens cm 1 n 17 values approximately double the values observed at the pond periphery by arndt and richardson 1993 shoreline segments other than the segment associated with well 13 however contributed most of the solutes from groundwater to the pond assuming concentrations in the shoreline segment associated with well 13 were half of what was observed did not significantly decrease solute inputs from groundwater therefore the budgets reported here did use the laboratory solute data from well 13 in addition concentrations in groundwater from the wells including well 13 were within the range observed in groundwater collected from lysimeters along transects perpendicular to the shoreline in the vicinity between wells 13 and 25 and in the vicinity of well 17 between 1988 and 1990 biondini and arndt 1993 such information was consistent with the assumption that solute input from groundwater to the pond based on the concentrations in table 5 was representative of conditions at the site chloride is considered to be unaffected by reactions within the pond at the concentrations observed during the study in nine years of the study 1989 1997 the residual of the open water period budget for chloride was accounted for within the uncertainty in the budget supplementary material table a1 based on this observation no adjustments in the solute budgets were made to account for years when there was a disparity between inputs export and change in mass in the pond instead the disparity was assumed to reflect some unaccounted for export one possible export mechanism is evapotranspiration induced movement of water and solutes out of the pond at the periphery of the pond as the pond surface shrinks such as documented by arndt and richardson 1993 such variations were not quantified by the gradients evident from the wells located outside of the immediate pond periphery loss of solute mass within the pond can occur due to chemical precipitation or gas flux out of the pond one line of evidence for loss by chemical precipitation is provided by the molar ratio of magnesium and calcium concentrations in the pond fig 8 in many years the ratio generally increased through the open water period indicating a loss of calcium relative to magnesium within the pond geochemical models of solute interaction indicated supersaturation conditions exist in the pond for calcite goldhaber et al 2014 therefore calcite precipitation could account for the loss of calcium relative to magnesium in the pond magnesium and sulfate commonly were the most abundant cation and anion respectively based on their concentration in milliequivalents per liter fig 5 and 6 their relation to one another however varied during the study fig 9 the molar ratio of magnesium to sulfate was generally less than one in the wells around the pond the monthly ratios in atmospheric deposition varied from 0 04 to 1 3 95 percent of the values were less than 0 69 values greater than 1 were recorded in only three months between 1979 and 1998 and not after 1992 the noticeable increase in the ratio in the pond in 1993 likely indicates a change in sulfate relative to magnesium outside of that expected from the solute sources of atmospheric deposition and groundwater flow to the pond some change in magnesium does occur through precipitation associated with calcite deposition in the pond goldhaber et al 2014 even so the distinction between 1993 and years immediately thereafter and years prior to 1993 may reflect inundation of all emergent vegetation and subsequent decomposition loss of sulfate due to sulfate reduction occurs in the pond as documented in goldhaber et al 2014 which requires a carbon source such as decomposing vegetation decomposition of above ground biomass in wetland p1 does occur with a rate of 50 percent decomposition over 114 months biondini and arndt 1993 the persistence of ratios above 1 from 1993 onward may reflect the time involved to achieve complete decomposition of above ground biomass inundated in 1993 in general the budget residuals for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen were larger than could be accounted for by cumulative error supplementary material table a1 the budget imbalances for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen are consistent with biological removal mechanisms within wetland ponds noted in other prairie wetland studies barica 1974 neely and baker 1989 removal mechanisms that were beyond the scope of this study similar large budget residuals for ammonia nitrogen also were reported by murkin et al 2000 in experimental wetland ponds a function of uptake by biota calculating groundwater fluxes to and from the pond independently using multiple shoreline segments rather than as a net value enabled unambiguous examination of changes in solute input from groundwater during the years after 1993 the volume of groundwater flow into the pond in the open water periods beginning in 1993 was at least twice that of years prior to 1993 this also was reflected in solute input from groundwater to the pond for calcium alkalinity fig 10 and potassium supplementary material table a1 other solutes also were elevated in input particularly in 1993 such as sulfate but were not consistently elevated in subsequent years the difference in pattern in part reflected the contribution of solutes from wells with relatively smaller concentrations of those solutes than the wells they substituted for in the calculations due to expansion of the pond table 5 5 discussion 5 1 water budgets the relative contribution of water sources to and water losses from the pond of wetland p1 were similar to other water budgets for closed basin prairie pothole wetland ponds hayashi et al 1988a shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 and similar to annual water balances based on a coupled surface subsurface model for the wetland pond carroll et al 2005 rainfall directly on pond surfaces and evapotranspiration were the largest sources and losses of water during open water periods snowmelt was important as a source of water when ponds thawed in spring and provided sufficient water to enable the pond to persist even though water losses commonly exceeded gains through much of the open water period yet snowmelt contribution to ponds infrequently exceeded gains during the open water periods from rainfall and runoff runoff commonly contributed less water to ponds than rain falling directly on the pond surface and most often was associated with rain falling on frozen upland soil after the pond had thawed or during episodes of intense rainfall or rain persisting for more than a day eisenlohr et al 1972 runoff however was variable such that years with similar rainfall could differ substantially in the amount of runoff derived from rain falling on the uplands eisenlohr et al 1972 heagle et al 2007 woo and rowsell 1993 groundwater flow contributed the least to water gains and losses and has been reported as a net value in other water budget studies hayashi et al 1988a shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 the few published water budgets of prairie pothole wetland ponds all reported net seepage outflow for all ponds and years of study hayashi et al 1988a shjeflo 1968 woo and rowsell 1993 except in ponds intermittently connected by a stream in a year of historically large snow accumulation brannen et al 2015 groundwater inflow to the pond of wetland p1 exceeded loss of pond water to groundwater in all years except 1991 and 1992 when snowmelt was absent or minimal the predominance of water gain from groundwater inflow relative to pond outflow to groundwater compared to other studies may be related to the topographic and hydrogeological setting of wetland p1 that favored groundwater discharge to the pond few water budget studies of lakes and wetlands include determination of the budget residual the difference between measured water gains losses and change in storage including measurement uncertainty or error hayashi et al 1988a noted uncertainty existed in the water budget but did not include a value for the budget residual only shjeflo 1968 and brannen et al 2015 included quantification of the budget residual in their water budgets of prairie pothole wetland ponds for the budgets provided by shjeflo 1968 eisenlohr et al 1972 noted the residual was an indicator of the uncertainty in the budget computations brannen et al 2015 used the relation between the budget residual and the water table depth to indicate the residual may represent net groundwater flow into the ponds as well as error associated with the water budget our approach for the pond of wetland p1 using determination of the cumulative error or uncertainty in the measured budgets based on first order error analysis was not used in other published budgets such determination enabled the identification of periods when the budget residual was indistinguishable from inherent uncertainty in measurements and periods when the budget residual indicated an imbalance in the water budget larger than could be accounted for by uncertainty in measurement alone in the pond of wetland p1 the budget imbalance in the latter case was likely associated with under representation of water loss by transpiration or periods when hydraulic gradients indicated by the wells were not indicative of gradients closer to the pond also as noted by hayashi et al 2016 at some point when the pond surface area declines change in pond water level exceeds that expected based on calculated evapotranspiration because of the increasing influence of water lost at the pond perimeter relative to loss from the pond surface 5 2 solute budgets the fact that change in sulfate mass in the pond of wetland p1 was not always accounted for by the difference between external solute inputs and losses from the pond to groundwater is consistent with other solute budgets for closed basin prairie pothole wetland ponds hayashi et al 1988b heagle et al 2007 in the study of the pond of a recharge wetland s109 at the st denis wetland site in saskatchewan canada sulfate reduction accounted for most of the change in concentration of sulfate in the pond heagle et al 2007 sulfate reduction also was an important process removing sulfate from the pond of nearby wetland 50 a discharge wetland heagle et al 2013 based on observations of the change in mass in sulfate in the pond relative to change in volume changes in the stable sulfur isotope of sulfate δs34 so4 measured in the pond of wetland p1 goldhaber et al 2014 mills et al 2011 indicate sulfate reduction did occur in the pond sulfate reduction likely accounts for the loss of sulfate needed to reconcile the difference between change in sulfate in the pond and the imbalance between external solute inputs and loss observed in the open water period of all years except 1992 1996 and 1997 export of sulfate by movement of pond water into wetland sediments at the edge of the pond of discharge wetland 50 as it dries was documented by heagle et al 2013 over 19 years of observation this export was a mechanism associated with long term accumulation within the wetland sediments dry periods also were associated with larger sulfate export from the pond of wetland p1 to groundwater than in wetter periods as the pond shrank the export gradient was into wetland sediments rather than the uplands the fact that some segments of the pond shoreline could be locations of solute export at the same time other segments of shoreline indicated solute import to the pond suggests the areal extent of solute accumulation in the subsurface may not be uniform regarding other solutes heagle et al 2007 found dissolution of magnesium calcite in wetland soils added calcium and magnesium to the pond of recharge wetland s109 in the case of wetland p1 groundwater and runoff solute input to the pond was greater than loss by export from the pond to groundwater loss of calcium and magnesium from the pond was indicated from the budget imbalance in the open water period for many years despite the overall increase in concentration within the pond from the beginning to the end of most periods net precipitation of magnesium carbonate in the pond was documented by goldhaber et al 2014 heagle et al 2013 used chloride to balance the water budget of the pond of s109 the resulting water budget was used to determine the mass balance for other solutes because open water period chloride budgets for the pond of wetland p1 were accounted for within budget measurement uncertainty in nearly half of the years in our study we assumed the years of imbalance indicated unmeasured chloride export likely due to evaporation induced flow of water out of the pond at the periphery hayashi et al 1988b observed a period when chloride concentrations declined in the pond of wetland s109 a decline that was not consistent with physical processes such changes were attributed to uptake by plants as described by hutchinson 1957 such uptake might also be a factor in accounting for those open water periods for wetland p1 when the change in mass in the pond was less than expected based on external solute input and export such occurrences were observed mainly prior to 1989 when living emergent vegetation occupied some of the areal extent of the pond throughout the open water period seasonal measurement of the chloride content of emergent vegetation to examine uptake however was not part of our study wetter conditions have resulted in increased solute mass in the ponds of wetlands such as wetland 50 at the st denis site heagle et al 2013 and the pond of wetland p1 because of solute input to the ponds yet changes in salinity due to wetter conditions are not uniform in prairie pothole wetlands being dependent on their hydrological settings nachshon et al 2014 labaugh et al 2016 either as recharge flow through or discharge ponds as well as the presence or absence of surface water flow between ponds shaw et al 2012 for ponds with increased solute mass during wetter conditions such as in wetland p1 labaugh et al 2016 declining water levels under drier conditions have the potential to increase salinity of the pond in the absence of a substantial loss mechanism as hypothesized by nachshon et al 2014 at the cottonwood site however previous fluctuations in pond levels of wetland p1 have not been associated with higher salinities as the pond declined from water levels similar to that encountered after 1993 labaugh et al 2016 based on the solute budgets for the pond as the pond dries some solutes are lost by flow from the pond to groundwater and wetland sediments and some are lost due to chemical precipitation or gaseous flux out of the pond the increased loss of water at the periphery of declining ponds noted by hayashi et al 2016 and the increased salinization and storage at the pond periphery as pond levels decline as observed by arndt and richardson 1993 also must have been sufficient in the past to moderate the salinity of the pond through episodes of deluge and drought 6 conclusions determination of groundwater input to a wetland pond and flow of water from the pond to groundwater revealed dynamic aspects of groundwater interaction with prairie pothole wetland ponds important to the water and solute budgets of the pond during the open water period in drier years as the pond shrank loss of water from the pond by flow to groundwater became more important than in other years such flow out of the pond also provided for export of solutes to wetland sediments when the pond edge receded from the upland groundwater flow into the pond represented the largest source of many solutes ca mg na k cl so4 alkalinity even though such flow commonly represented the smallest contribution to water input to the pond relative to rainfall or runoff during the wetter periods as the pond increased in size thereby expanding the area of groundwater input to the pond the relatively greater influx of ca and alkalinity was consistent with the presence of readily weathered calcite in the soils arndt and richardson 1993 and subsequent flow into the pond the importance of solute input to the pond and solute loss from the pond as independent processes when examining solute dynamics indicates determination of groundwater input and output separately has benefits over determination of groundwater interaction with the pond as a net water flux alone measurement uncertainty in the solute budgets also enabled distinction between years when change in mass in the pond was accounted for by external inputs and outputs and when change in mass in the pond was not accounted for by external inputs and outputs thereby indicating some unmeasured loss in mass took place pond permanence size and salinity all affect wetland habitats in the prairie pothole region it is important to understand how these factors change under varying climate conditions ranging from drought to deluge as documented here our study indicates the importance of taking into account groundwater as a factor affecting wetland salinity particularly in closed basin wetlands receiving groundwater discharge therefore it is important to know the relation of the pond to the adjacent groundwater system before projecting what salinity dependent habitat changes might occur in individual wetland basins as conditions either become drier or wetter in the future acknowledgements the ability to examine processes over such a long term were made possible because of the work of our colleagues george swanson and vyto adomaitis who began ecological

8511,study region eastern shore of ringkøbing fjord a coastal lagoon at the west coast of denmark study focus a dual tracer approach based on salinity and δ 18 o is used to assess seasonal dynamics at the saltwater freshwater interface of a coastal lagoon at the site salinity is prone to vary on a sub seasonal or daily frequency due to riverine freshwater inputs to the lagoon in contrast δ 18 o compositions of end members only vary seasonally new hydrological insights the dual tracer approach shows to be valuable in coastal settings where end member concentrations vary substantially over the seasons and hence an unambiguous end member definition does not exist calculated mixing fractions using only salinity deviated from the dual tracer approach on average by 18 but were as high as 97 although these differences decrease to 6 on average when using only δ 18 o our study strongly suggests their simultaneous application moreover we found that seawater intrusion occurs during the summer when salinity in the lagoon is high and fresh submarine groundwater discharge sgd is low this process reverses during the winter wet season when sgd increases by a factor of 2 3 due to the recession of the saltwater wedge from land our findings show that in absence of waves and tides density driven dynamics and particularly the terrestrial freshwater fluxes create a major impact on saltwater wedge dynamics keywords dual tracer δ 18 o δ 2 h salinity saltwater wedge dynamics saltwater freshwater interaction 1 introduction coastal lagoons are an extreme form of barrier estuaries kjerfve 1994 haines 2006 where hydrodynamic conditions are typically defined by the balance of tides and waves woodroffe 2002 riverine freshwater inputs precipitation evaporation and groundwater inputs phleger et al 1981 all these factors are responsible for salinity dynamics kjerfve 1994 and nutrient levels cartwright et al 2004 in lagoon ecosystems the interaction between groundwater and lagoons is similar to coastal systems coastal groundwater aquifers have been recognized as controls to nutrient supplies to estuarine systems burnett et al 2001 michael et al 2003 spruill and and bratton 2008 the freshwater moving through the coastal aquifers discharges to the sea as terrestrial or fresh submarine groundwater discharge sgd and partly controls saltwater intrusion michael et al 2005 barlow and reichard 2010 chang and clement 2012 at the interface of fresh and saltwater density differences occur and a dynamic freshwater saltwater mixing zone develops in non karstic field settings the width of such a mixing zone can vary from a few meters to kilometers barlow 2003 price et al 2003 werner et al 2013 and depends on the aquifer properties geology hydraulic properties salinity of surface water geological history of sea level and groundwater abstractions barlow 2003 barlow and reichard 2010 werner et al 2013 chang and clement 2012 the number of field studies investigating the temporal changes in the size of the mixing zone in shallow porous medium aquifers is limited werner et al 2013 most research has addressed the temporal dynamics of this interface due to tidal wave action via well salinity profiling and surface water observations i e kurup et al 1998 haralambidou et al 2010 or numerical modelling i e ataie ashtiani et al 1999 cartwright et al 2004 showed that the saltwater freshwater interface could recede by several meters over a period of three days and then progress again by several meters over 10 days in response to storm wave activity only a few studies robinson et al 1998 michael et al 2005 show that temporal dynamics of the mixing zone are an interplay between seasonal changes in surface water salinity tidal amplitudes and the hydrological cycle on land periods with high recharge lead to increased freshwater inputs measured as fresh terrestrial sgd and increased hydraulic heads in the near coastal aquifer causing the freshwater saltwater interface to move towards the sea during periods of lower fresh terrestrial sgd but higher sea or lagoon water salinity the opposite occurs and the saltwater interface intrudes further inland poulsen et al 2010 likewise the timing of maximum salinity in the surface water and maximum freshwater discharge affects the interface dynamics in low lying areas of temperate climate maximum freshwater sgd typically occurs between late fall and the middle of winter when surface water salinity in lagoons can be low due to high riverine freshwater inputs during the summer the opposite situation occurs with maximum surface water salinity and minimum freshwater sgd further complexity to the interface dynamics is added by the heterogeneous nature of aquifers and sediment water interfaces yielding increased spatial variability of sgd taniguchi et al 2002 burnett and dulaiova 2003 duque et al 2016 nonetheless there are few field studies in coastal systems where wave and tidal activity are limited in such systems flow dynamics are highly controlled by the seasonal changes in groundwater inputs and density differences between the surface and groundwater this leaves the responses of lagoons to future hydrologic changes poorly understood even though approximately 60 of europe s coastline fits within this classification with mean tidal amplitudes below 0 5 m data from eea 2012 hence a substantial part of saltwater intrusion dynamics on europe s coastline is likely controlled by the density dynamics within aquifers and the temporal off set dynamics of the continental freshwater flux and salinity of lagoons rather than wave or tidal activity by understanding saltwater intrusion within these coastlines we can further understand the temporal character of total terrestrial discharge estimates and thus its corresponding nutrient loads furthermore understanding these density dynamics in aquifers at a small scale helps to improve or refine simulation models that further enables transferability of models to larger scales the complex nature of the saltwater freshwater interface requires a set of methods to be applied that can appropriately characterize such dynamics physically based methods such as seepage meters and hydraulic head observations have been used for many years in coastal situations lee 1977 in order to evaluate the intrusive characteristics of saltwater in coastal areas these methods have to be extended with reactive and conservative chemical and isotopic tracers burnett et al 2006 although salinity is the obvious choice in coastal settings it may not be appropriate when there are large salinity changes in end members over time this can cause high uncertainty in mixing predictions and therefore mislead the conceptual understanding of coastal subsurface flow dynamics in many cases salinity may vary substantially over different temporal scales annually monthly daily due to dilution with freshwater and or chemical conditions at the location e g calcite dissolution of carbonate rocks in such environments the water stable isotopes of 18 o and 2 h may be a robust tracer δ 18 o in surface and terrestrial waters is mainly influenced by temperature and evaporation processes that occur on an annual basis clark and fritz 1997 kendall and caldwell 1998 and the variations in temperate climate zones are minor compared to arid regions δ 18 o and δ 2 h variations in groundwater effectively damp out seasonal variations of meteoric waters due to long travel times and enhanced mixing in aquifers leibundgut et al 2009 hence water stable isotopes of 18 o and 2h provide an effective labelling of seawater and freshwater and enables an understanding of seawater intrusion and mixing ratios moreover the relationship between 18 o and 2 h with salinity is well established yurtsever 1997 clark and fritz 1997 as δ 18 o and salinity are generally known to a increase with evaporation b decrease with higher precipitation or other freshwater inputs and c vary by mixing from advection and diffusion processes as the controlling processes depend on season climate and geographic location the slope and intercept of 18 o salinity relation may vary seasonally and geographically benway and mix 2004 mcconnell et al 2009 singh et al 2010 most importantly their stability at different temporal scales make them complementary to conservative tracers which decreases the uncertainty in mixing estimations due to advances in the measurement techniques for stable water isotopes and the ease to obtain salinity estimates these two tracers are also cost efficient along these lines this study i explores the use and benefits of salinity and water stable isotopes dual tracer approach over the use of only one of these tracers and ii supplement this dual tracer approach with direct physical measurements head gradients seepage rates to further understand the seasonal dynamics of the lagoon saltwater freshwater interface in the absence of tides and wave activity the ringkøbing fjord system in denmark is investigated where the lagoon water is characterized as brackish water and is subject to seasonal salinity changes due to seasonal changes in discharge from the largest river in denmark skjern river as tides and wave activity are negligible the field site provides great field laboratory conditions to study density driven dynamic processes 2 study site the study site is located at the eastern shore of ringkøbing fjord at the west coast of denmark fig 1 a the fjord can be characterized as a restricted lagoon system kjerfve 1994 it has an area of 300 km2 and although it has a mean water depth of 1 9 m more than 25 of the area is less than 0 5 m deep kirkegaard et al 2011 kinnear et al 2013 at its western extent the lagoon is disconnected from the ocean through a natural barrier haider 2013 a man made channel that is regulated by a lock is the only surface connection between the ocean and the lagoon this channel maintains the water level in the lagoon at approximately 0 25 m above sea level m a s l and salinity values between 6 and 15 the lagoon receives freshwater inflow from skjern river with an annual mean discharge of 50 m3 s kirkegaard et al 2011 haider 2013 at its south eastern extent discharge data from a discharge station stat nr 250097 located 16 km upstream of the effluent indicates a seasonal discharge distribution of low flows during summer months may aug and high flows during the winter months dec jan minor freshwater inputs from drainage systems at the eastern shoreline are also present airborne and waterborne geophysical surveys have provided information on groundwater interacting with the lagoon and have shown that groundwater inflow occurs mainly along the eastern shoreline with a highly variable pattern and magnitude but it is also expected at the northern and southern shore kirkegaard et al 2011 groundwater discharge zones are generally located within tens of meters from the shoreline and most often occurring in micro bays along the shore kirkegaard et al 2011 kinnear et al 2013 nevertheless there is evidence for further offshore terrestrial sgd zones kirkegaard et al 2011 haider et al 2014 groundwater input to the lagoon system was estimated to be 14 5 m3 d per meter shoreline by numerical modelling for the 40 km eastern shoreline which corresponds to 17 of the total discharge from skjern river haider et al 2014 this estimate is highly uncertain as its spatial extent and volume strongly depends on aquifer heterogeneities local measurements using temperature as a tracer has estimated a mean flux of 0 026 m d but can vary between 0 07 to below 0 01 m d duque et al 2016 if one assumes a discharge width of 20 m the mean flux translates into a terrestrial input of 0 52 m3 d per meter shoreline much less than predicted by the model of haider et al 2014 the study site on the eastern shore consists of a shallow sandy phreatic aquifer containing pleistocene fluvial glacial sands it includes an area roughly 25 m off shore and 65 m in land fig 1b the onshore elevation up to well j1 is less than 1 m a s l followed by a short steep slope increasing the elevation to 3 m a s l fig 1c the regional aquifer is intervened by low permeability silty units and high permeability paleo channels haider 2013 a confining lower permeable unit is present at about 12 m depth the vegetation has adapted to the brackish water conditions and grows across the shoreline with greater density onshore and in patchy areas offshore 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrogeology a 90 m long transect of 14 piezometer wells was established perpendicular to the shoreline fig 1b based on earlier studies haider et al 2014 duque et al 2016 the saltwater intrusion was expected to be located within this area the wells were screened 0 1 m screen length at different depths ranging from 1 3 m to 15 m below the surface they were assembled from 2 m long stainless steel pipes of 1 in diameter and connected by steel fittings sealed with teflon tape hydraulic heads water stable isotopes and electrical conductivity ec were measured in october 2014 february april and july 2015 in all wells reported hydraulic heads are corrected for density effects according to post et al 2007 additionally at wells j4d and j5 fig 1b vertical tracer profiles were established in october 2014 and february 2015 respectively taking samples with one meter resolution three casing volumes were purged from each well prior to sampling single measurements from the lagoon water isotopic compositions were available from previous years for august 2010 and may 2012 samples obtained in october february and april are grouped as wet season samples and july and august samples are grouped as dry season samples according to the temporal variation of annual precipitation amounts 3 2 lagoon stage and salinity data on the lagoon stage was available from september 1998 2015 from a station in the lagoon north of the field site fig 1a and was provided by the danish coastal authority the lagoon stage varied between 0 07 m a s l during early spring to 0 13 m a s l in december salinity and ec measurements were provided by the danish nature agency also from 1998 2015 fig 1a a data gap existed only for ec data between 2000 and 2009 consequently these dates were excluded from the analysis the highest average ec of 17 ms cm is typically observed during summer months while ec in winter months is around 6 ms cm fig 2 3 3 seepage meter measurements seepage meter measurements were conducted near the offshore wells fig 1b measurements took place in october 2014 wet period and july 2015 dry period the seepage meters were constructed after lee 1977 with a half barrel of 0 25 m2 inflow area a collection bag was attached to a valve connected to the top of the barrel to control the inflow manually the bag was protected from the limited wave activity by a plastic box the bag was pre filled with at least 15 of the total bag volume each location was measured three times 3 4 groundwater electrical conductivity ec and stable isotopes the ec of the lagoon is to a great extent controlled by the incoming seawater through the lock and discharge from skjern river with small daily and high yearly amplitudes in the range of brackish water fig 2 the ec in groundwater is expected to be relatively stable at low values producing a large contrast to the lagoon water increased saltwater intrusion into the groundwater may be expected during summer due to higher salinities in the lagoon in contrast retreating saltwater is expected during the winter when salinity is lower in the lagoon both processes are affected by terrestrial freshwater fluxes as hydraulic gradients are smallest during summer and highest during winter the δ 18 o composition of the incoming fresh groundwater would be expected to remain stable evaporation in summer causes an isotopic enrichment of the lagoon water by several permil compared to groundwater that enrichment remains stable throughout the summer season due to the long water residence times of water in the lagoon hence δ 18 o is potentially a better tracer than ec with more robust and stable end member compositions water samples from the lagoon wells and seepage meters were analyzed for ec and δ 18 o δ 16 o isotopes ec measurements were taken with a calibrated wtw cond 3310 the salinity concentration s in g l is calculated from ec at 25 c using the empirical equation from holzbecher 1998 1 s mg l 3 83 0 699 ec μ s cm samples for isotope analysis were filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and analyzed for δ 18 o 0 1 and δ 2 h 0 2 by the cavity ring down spectroscopy method using a picarro l2021 i at the geological survey of denmark and greenland geus copenhagen the δ notation given in is the relative deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard craig 1961 3 5 mixing analysis a mixing analysis was carried out using the software package mix carrera et al 2004 it uses a maximum likelihood method to calculate mixing ratios accounting for the uncertainty of the end members em s and samples this em uncertainty arises from concentration variations in space and time and from analytical errors two em s were identified lagoon water groundwater which differ in their isotopic composition and ec one em represents the recharge groundwater composition entering the transect from east hence the groundwater em composition is assumed to be represented by the average δ 18 o composition of meteoric water clark and fritz 1997 and a salinity expressed in ec ms cm deduced from the shallow onshore wells j1 j4 the lagoon em concentration for ec was represented by the average observed measured ec between 1998 2015 assuming that enhanced saltwater intrusion mainly occurs at the time of highest salinity summer the isotopic em was chosen based on δ 18 o samples from previous summers and late spring august 2010 may 2012 and combined with current observations of lagoon water from july 2015 the assigned variances for both em compositions are deducted from the standard deviation of the annual changes of groundwater and lagoon water see later for comparison a classical simple linear end member mixing analysis emma was also applied where only a single parameter i e either ec or δ 18 o was used and an observed fraction of lagoon water in a sample f lag was established based on conservative linear mixing process between two em s apello and postma 2005 2 f lag m sample m freshwater m lag m freshwater where m sample is the parameter value in the sample and m freshwater and m lag are the em values of the groundwater and lagoon water respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic head gradients and seepage meter fluxes maximum and minimum lagoon stages in the observational period ranged between 0 07 and 0 13 m a s l fig 3 all onshore wells j1 j5 show a hydraulic gradient from land towards the lagoon the average hydraulic head observations fig 1c show that groundwater flows into the transect site and is confined by the lower permeable silty bottom and organic layers surface causing artesian conditions nevertheless seasonal head fluctuations exist fig 3 those fluctuations are higher for offshore wells j6 j11 than onshore wells j1 j5 and a result of density dynamics in the subsurface of the lagoon this causes offshore hydraulic heads occasionally to be above onshore hydraulic heads thus a dynamic interface is developed where positive hydraulic gradients groundwater flow into the lagoon may partly be reversed and lagoon water is able to flow into the onshore groundwater body seepage meter fluxes from autumn and summer always show discharge from the aquifer into the lagoon fig 3 the average discharge in october is 3 7 cm d with a high seepage occurring close to the shore 5 cm d followed by a decrease 5 15 m offshore and a high seepage 15 23 m offshore the fluxes during july 2015 are lower than in october with an average discharge of 1 6 cm d the lowest seepage is observed near the shore with increased seepage fluxes further offshore higher seepage fluxes in october can be linked to higher hydraulic gradients while the lower fluxes in july correspond to lower hydraulic gradients nonetheless this relation may be modified as recirculating groundwater can amplify seepage rates li et al 1999 taniguchi et al 2002 4 2 water stable isotopes and salinity the δ 18 o isotopic composition of precipitation in the area ranges between 5 5 38 3 δ 2 h and 10 73 4 δ 2 h with an average of 7 8 δ 18 o 52 δ 2 h fig 4 a local meteoric water line lmwl for the area of 7 29 δ 18 o 4 81 has been established on the basis of precipitation measurements at the nearby station müller et al 2017 fig 1a most enriched values are observed during early spring while most depleted values are observed during winter müller et al 2017 the lagoon water samples from the wet period october april plot along the lmwl whereas the dry season samples may august plot below the lmwl with more enriched values this is consistent with an evaporation of lagoon water during summer and higher freshwater inputs to the lagoon with less evaporation during other seasons salinity effects on the fractionation process during evaporation as postulated for brine water or hypersaline environments gonfiantini 1986 gat 2010 are not expected due to the low salinity characteristics of the lagoon combining lagoon samples from both seasons a local evaporation line lel is developed with a slope lower than the lmwl of 6 02 and an intercept value of 4 43 this is a typical slope for evaporating seawater gat 2010 for the august 2012 sample no δ 2 h was available hence it was excluded for the development of the lel however its corresponding deuterium value was recalculated from the lel regression this assumes similar evaporation conditions in 2012 in order to be shown fig 4 all groundwater samples onshore and offshore wells are on average 1 more enriched in δ 18 o 6 91 δ 18 o 46 2 δ 2 h than the average rain composition the range of the groundwater composition is between 8 26 δ 18 o 52 2 δ 2 h at j6 in october to 3 42 δ 18 o 23 9 δ 2 h at j5 in october where the δ 18 o at j5 indicates intruding saltwater yet the majority of the samples plot more closely along the lel than the lmwl the bulk of the groundwater samples from the onshore wells in the wet season plot close to the average value of precipitation this may be an indication of its meteoric origin with enhanced regional freshwater contribution in wet periods as shown above lagoon water undergoes evaporative enrichment during summer the offshore well j11 always plots along the lel as it is distinctively enriched compared to other offshore wells this indicates the presence of summer intruded lagoon water independent of season j7d and j10 also show enriched isotopic compositions but are lower than j11 this is likely due to the screen location being within the saltwater freshwater transition zone where samples from j7d and j10 are subject to mixing dynamics of a large portion of intruding lagoon water from above and less influence of fresh groundwater coming from land samples from j6 and j8 in october are the most depleted samples in the wet period and also show the least enrichment during dry season hence these samples suggest to sample water in the saltwater freshwater transition zone but with a strong freshwater influence mixed with a smaller amount of lagoon water additional information on the saltwater wedge extension can be delineated from the isotopic composition groundwater samples at depths greater than 10 m plot along the lel the onshore well j4d plots around the mean groundwater value contrary to this samples from j5 in the wet period close to shore plot between the most enriched lagoon samples and the intersect of the lel and lmwl hence during the wet season the saltwater wedge is expected to be located between wells j5 and j4 and should have a relatively steep slope because not all depths from j5 and j4 were sampled no information on the exact toe location can be given the relation between the δ 18 o and salinity serves as a basis to deduce end members lagoon water ultimately is a mixture of freshwater inputs gw to the lagoon and seawater from the north sea sw fig 5 therefore indicates a mixing line gw sw mix between a freshwater end member zero salinity 7 8 δ 18 o from the average of precipitation and oceanic seawater 35 g l salinity dmi 2017 0 δ 18 o as a consequence of the seasonal variation of δ 18 o in precipitation a potential range in mixing is indicated by the dashed lines when evaporation from an open water body occurs a steep increase in the δ 18 o of the remaining water will be accompanied by a relatively small increase in salinity gonfiantini 1986 this δ 18 o salinity relation during evaporation is illustrated by the evaporation line in fig 5 see details in figure the lagoon water plots distinctively different fig 5 for different seasons wet season samples are close to that of groundwater dry season samples are outside the gw sw mixing range and instead fall between the evaporation line and the mixing range this points towards evaporative enrichment gonfiantini 1986 of the lagoon water during summer months all shallow onshore wells have very low salinity 0 3 g l and δ 18 o above the average value of precipitation fig 5 the offshore wells deep onshore wells and wet season lagoon water plot along the gw sw mixing line however the samples at 11 m and 12 m depth from j5 show a composition on the right end of the gw sw mixing line yet not close to lagoon water similar trends are seen for j11 independent of the season suggesting that deep j5 and j11 samples are partially composed of north sea water rather than lagoon water nonetheless the dual isotope plot fig 4 illustrates that these samples plot close to lagoon water suggesting an opposite result however from the conceptual understanding of the system it is more likely that deep j5 and j11 samples are biased towards the faster changing salinity in the lagoon hence they are not capable of reflecting salinities similar to those observed in the lagoon on the other hand δ 18 o due its stability serves as a better predictor for the seawater composition at j5 and j11 4 3 mixing analysis two end member mixing analysis was carried out for the wet season periods of october 14 february 15 and april 15 and for the dry period july 15 the assigned input values and variances are based on the average and standard deviation of samples and end members the δ 18 o composition of both em lagoon and groundwater can be considered relatively stable with a variation by 1 09 and 0 01 respectively the ec of groundwater can also be considered stable while the variance of 4 5 ms cm expresses the observed seasonal variation in the lagoon water table 1 this indicates the added advantage of using δ 18 o as a more robust and stable tracer the mixing model always forces the ec of the lagoon em composition to be higher than the average value in order to fit the observations ec values are estimated to be between 18 ms cm in february and 24 ms cm in october which is much higher than the average input value of 11 7 ms cm the δ 18 o composition appears to be more stable but is forced to be more depleted with ranges between 0 1 and 1 the smaller error introduced with δ 18 o compared to ec promises more stability in the calculation and suggests the right em choice of δ 18 o as the average simulated lagoon em concentration of ec was always increased it suggests that the initial use of an average value may be biased and the true em concentration could be higher values in the range of modelled ec em values are exclusively observed during the summer as shown in fig 5 which fits the actual timing of the greatest saltwater intrusion nonetheless a value of 24 ms cm calculated for the lagoon em in october has not been observed the results from the linear emma either ec or δ 18 o show a high deviation compared to the results of the dual end member approach fig 6 the ec tends to be over predicting while δ 18 o under predicts lagoon water fractions the outcome of the linear emma is shown to be sensitive to the choice of em composition an average em choice results in fractions far above 100 this suggests incorrect em values for the emma analysis furthermore it highlights the advantage for two or more species for mixing analysis assuming that the mix model results in most certain fractions the use of one tracer can be highly biased i e choosing ec over δ 18 o fig 6 when only ec is used and compared to mix fraction estimates the two approaches yield an average difference of 18 for single wells with a standard deviation stdv of 33 in extreme cases a well may contain 3 lagoon water based on the mix model but 100 lagoon water based on the ec end member estimation when using δ 18 o instead these differences decrease on average to 6 with a stdv of 7 hence errors by choosing δ 18 o for linear emma are smaller in general the results show the advantage of a mix model analysis over the emma approach on the basis of these results the emma analysis is not considered in the following from the average mixing fractions fig 7 a seasonal dynamics are suggested to be limited to offshore wells as indicated by the error bars the lowest lagoon water fraction is found in the february samples where except for j11 f lag 100 the wells show less than 20 seawater content table 1 the february observations are responsible for the increased variation in the offshore wells fig 7a october april and july show similar trends amongst all wells where the shallow onshore wells have less than 10 lagoon water content table 1 among these july always shows the greatest lagoon water contributions while the lowest fractions are observed in april j6 j9 indicating high freshwater influence during that period october and july fractions show similar trends in the offshore wells with july always containing the greatest lagoon water content mixing fractions observed from the profile of well j5 at the shoreline show a large fraction of lagoon water 50 at a depth of 10 m below the surface october this reached 100 over the next 2m before gradually decreasing to 0 at 15 m depth fig 7b further onshore at well j4 the same distinct increase in the fraction of lagoon water at the same depth is not repeated however at 12 m depth the lagoon water content did increase to be 10 fig 7b the well compositions are influenced from lagoon water derived from summer intrusions where ec and δ 18 o enrichment are highest furthermore these results suggest that intruding lagoon water is preserved at greater depths at least until autumn 4 4 conceptualization of saltwater intrusion in the near shore aquifer at ringkøbing fjord using october as a starting point a refreshing of the study area is initiated fig 8 mixing fractions at the offshore wells show high lagoon water content originating from the previous summer where lagoon water with higher salinities intruded the aquifer the salinity of the lagoon is around 8 g l while the average lagoon water level and the groundwater heads between j7 j11 are at 0 1 m a s l and slightly below respectively suggesting lagoon water intrusion even the limited wave activity present in this system may elevate hydraulic heads of the lagoon increasing the likelihood of saltwater intrusion on the other hand the average seepage meter discharge fluxes across the lagoon bed are highest 3 7 cm d henceforth terrestrial freshwater input to the lagoon is present the increasing freshwater contribution continues to february as hydraulic heads are on average 10 cm higher average 0 24 m a s l than in october and above lagoon stage max 0 1 m a s l thereby a progression of freshwater input and very low lagoon water salinities 4 2 g l produces the lowest observed lagoon water fractions in the wells only the most offshore well j11 retains high salinities fig 5 in april the groundwater flux is similar to february average heads of 0 22 m a s l but due to a salinity increase 6 1 g l saltwater begins to slowly intrude again towards the summer months hydraulic heads are slightly reduced and terrestrial sgd inflow is lowered avg seepage flux 1 6 cm d by a factor of two when compared to october 3 7 cm d at the same time increasing salinity due to evaporation and minimal freshwater inputs from groundwater enhances a progressive intrusion of lagoon water moreover field observations suggest the presence of a low hydraulic conductivity unit around 12 m depth such a unit was also reported from earlier studies haider 2013 kinnear et al 2013 this unit locally confines the base of upper aquifer and is also believed to be responsible for the high freshwater content seen from mixing fractions in j5 below 14 m depth saltwater is limited from intruding this confining unit and consequently is mainly transported inland above the unit as no saltwater was observed in february at a depth of 12 m a dynamic interface is to be expected at j4 a seasonal variation of saltwater intrusion pattern was postulated from robinson et al 1998 who collected a yearly dataset of head measurements and salinities with one time samples from seepage meters in the chesapeake bay virginia they concluded that seasons with low freshwater discharge and high surface water salinities were associated with landward intrusion of saltwater and vice versa increased freshwater contribution can be attributed to higher groundwater discharge and low surface water salinities however their study lacks a seasonal observed component of sgd seasonal dynamics were also found by poulsen et al 2010 at a danish coastal field site using vertical ert profiling where the annual salinity pattern within the aquifer is modified seasonally as a consequence of an increasing and decreasing freshwater lens due to recharge variations yet at their study site a change in surface water salinities was not considered a tracer study conducted in a mediterranean lagoon system in turkey showed that on a larger scale lagoon water was composed of mainly freshwater derived from lake water upstream of the lagoon during the wet seasons as a consequence of increased hydraulic heads stumpp et al 2014 whereas during dry seasons the lagoon water was fed mostly by ocean water due to density induced inflow as well as reduced hydraulic heads in the catchment which decreased the freshwater contribution our study however is the first to use ec and δ 18 o in a dual tracer approach with uncertain end members to quantify seasonal dynamics of sgd and movement of the saltwater freshwater interface jørgensen et al 2008 used 87sr 86sr and δ 18 o to study saltwater intrusion during a pumping experiment but did not account for end member uncertainty the tracer data corroborates the interpretation of hydraulic gradients and seepage meters results but additionally provides information regarding internal flow dynamics observed off shore below the lagoon bed elaborations on the seasonality of saltwater freshwater wedge dynamics are speculative as the data from the lower areas of the aquifer are not sufficient enough to make conclusions however based on the observations in the shallow parts of the aquifer it can be speculated that the replacement of saltwater by freshwater takes place throughout the aquifer down to the low confining unit starting in october saltwater intrusion also affects the whole offshore part of the upper aquifer during summer months based on observations in the profile wells the maximum extension of the saltwater wedge toe appears to be located between j5 and j4 5 conclusions a dual tracer approach using electrical conductivity and water stable isotopes was used to assess and quantify seasonal flow dynamics and the movement of a saltwater freshwater interface near ringkøbing fjord a coastal lagoon system in denmark the site provides natural conditions to isolate the effects of density driven subsurface flow and freshwater fluxes on the seasonal development of a saltwater wedge the lagoon stage is very stable and wedge dynamics are mainly introduced by the seasonal variation of salinities in the lagoon and seasonal varying inland hydraulic gradients our study demonstrated that this leads to seawater intrusion during summer conditions dry period when salinity is high and hydraulic gradients are low and a retreating saltwater wedge in the aquifer during winter conditions wet period when surface water salinities are low and hydraulic gradients high the total submarine groundwater discharge to the lagoon varies roughly by a factor of 2 3 between seasons flow dynamics and changes in salinity are almost entirely below the lagoon however our observations do not provide certain conclusions regarding the seasonal dynamics of the toe location of the saltwater wedge in our study a dual tracer end member analysis was effective in quantifying the saltwater intrusion the dual tracer end member mixing analysis was compared with a single tracer end member analysis using only ec as a cheap measurement of salinity and δ 18 o we demonstrate that the dual tracer approach yields different mixing fractions especially below the lagoon bed where the system is most dynamic δ 18 o is a more robust tracer than ec and its end member concentrations particularly of lagoon water are more seasonal stable and improve the estimations of mixing fractions we show that with the use of ec in a single tracer end member estimate lagoon fractions in wells differ 18 on average with individual wells differing as much as 97 these variations have the potential to introduce biased conclusions about the lagoon system by only using δ 18 o differences could be minimized to 6 but single wells still had differences up to 30 compared to the dual tracer approach the performance of a single tracer mixing estimate strongly depends on the right choice of end member concentration we believe the mix model estimates to be most reliable as the model treats observations as true values incorporates both tracers simultaneously and accounts for variances or uncertainties in the end members consequently we recommend that when dealing with coastal environments or lagoon settings where ec of the lagoon is prone to high temporal variations daily weekly monthly to concurrently apply δ 18 o as a more robust tracer the simultaneous application of both tracers can improve mixing estimations substantially acknowledgements this

8511,study region eastern shore of ringkøbing fjord a coastal lagoon at the west coast of denmark study focus a dual tracer approach based on salinity and δ 18 o is used to assess seasonal dynamics at the saltwater freshwater interface of a coastal lagoon at the site salinity is prone to vary on a sub seasonal or daily frequency due to riverine freshwater inputs to the lagoon in contrast δ 18 o compositions of end members only vary seasonally new hydrological insights the dual tracer approach shows to be valuable in coastal settings where end member concentrations vary substantially over the seasons and hence an unambiguous end member definition does not exist calculated mixing fractions using only salinity deviated from the dual tracer approach on average by 18 but were as high as 97 although these differences decrease to 6 on average when using only δ 18 o our study strongly suggests their simultaneous application moreover we found that seawater intrusion occurs during the summer when salinity in the lagoon is high and fresh submarine groundwater discharge sgd is low this process reverses during the winter wet season when sgd increases by a factor of 2 3 due to the recession of the saltwater wedge from land our findings show that in absence of waves and tides density driven dynamics and particularly the terrestrial freshwater fluxes create a major impact on saltwater wedge dynamics keywords dual tracer δ 18 o δ 2 h salinity saltwater wedge dynamics saltwater freshwater interaction 1 introduction coastal lagoons are an extreme form of barrier estuaries kjerfve 1994 haines 2006 where hydrodynamic conditions are typically defined by the balance of tides and waves woodroffe 2002 riverine freshwater inputs precipitation evaporation and groundwater inputs phleger et al 1981 all these factors are responsible for salinity dynamics kjerfve 1994 and nutrient levels cartwright et al 2004 in lagoon ecosystems the interaction between groundwater and lagoons is similar to coastal systems coastal groundwater aquifers have been recognized as controls to nutrient supplies to estuarine systems burnett et al 2001 michael et al 2003 spruill and and bratton 2008 the freshwater moving through the coastal aquifers discharges to the sea as terrestrial or fresh submarine groundwater discharge sgd and partly controls saltwater intrusion michael et al 2005 barlow and reichard 2010 chang and clement 2012 at the interface of fresh and saltwater density differences occur and a dynamic freshwater saltwater mixing zone develops in non karstic field settings the width of such a mixing zone can vary from a few meters to kilometers barlow 2003 price et al 2003 werner et al 2013 and depends on the aquifer properties geology hydraulic properties salinity of surface water geological history of sea level and groundwater abstractions barlow 2003 barlow and reichard 2010 werner et al 2013 chang and clement 2012 the number of field studies investigating the temporal changes in the size of the mixing zone in shallow porous medium aquifers is limited werner et al 2013 most research has addressed the temporal dynamics of this interface due to tidal wave action via well salinity profiling and surface water observations i e kurup et al 1998 haralambidou et al 2010 or numerical modelling i e ataie ashtiani et al 1999 cartwright et al 2004 showed that the saltwater freshwater interface could recede by several meters over a period of three days and then progress again by several meters over 10 days in response to storm wave activity only a few studies robinson et al 1998 michael et al 2005 show that temporal dynamics of the mixing zone are an interplay between seasonal changes in surface water salinity tidal amplitudes and the hydrological cycle on land periods with high recharge lead to increased freshwater inputs measured as fresh terrestrial sgd and increased hydraulic heads in the near coastal aquifer causing the freshwater saltwater interface to move towards the sea during periods of lower fresh terrestrial sgd but higher sea or lagoon water salinity the opposite occurs and the saltwater interface intrudes further inland poulsen et al 2010 likewise the timing of maximum salinity in the surface water and maximum freshwater discharge affects the interface dynamics in low lying areas of temperate climate maximum freshwater sgd typically occurs between late fall and the middle of winter when surface water salinity in lagoons can be low due to high riverine freshwater inputs during the summer the opposite situation occurs with maximum surface water salinity and minimum freshwater sgd further complexity to the interface dynamics is added by the heterogeneous nature of aquifers and sediment water interfaces yielding increased spatial variability of sgd taniguchi et al 2002 burnett and dulaiova 2003 duque et al 2016 nonetheless there are few field studies in coastal systems where wave and tidal activity are limited in such systems flow dynamics are highly controlled by the seasonal changes in groundwater inputs and density differences between the surface and groundwater this leaves the responses of lagoons to future hydrologic changes poorly understood even though approximately 60 of europe s coastline fits within this classification with mean tidal amplitudes below 0 5 m data from eea 2012 hence a substantial part of saltwater intrusion dynamics on europe s coastline is likely controlled by the density dynamics within aquifers and the temporal off set dynamics of the continental freshwater flux and salinity of lagoons rather than wave or tidal activity by understanding saltwater intrusion within these coastlines we can further understand the temporal character of total terrestrial discharge estimates and thus its corresponding nutrient loads furthermore understanding these density dynamics in aquifers at a small scale helps to improve or refine simulation models that further enables transferability of models to larger scales the complex nature of the saltwater freshwater interface requires a set of methods to be applied that can appropriately characterize such dynamics physically based methods such as seepage meters and hydraulic head observations have been used for many years in coastal situations lee 1977 in order to evaluate the intrusive characteristics of saltwater in coastal areas these methods have to be extended with reactive and conservative chemical and isotopic tracers burnett et al 2006 although salinity is the obvious choice in coastal settings it may not be appropriate when there are large salinity changes in end members over time this can cause high uncertainty in mixing predictions and therefore mislead the conceptual understanding of coastal subsurface flow dynamics in many cases salinity may vary substantially over different temporal scales annually monthly daily due to dilution with freshwater and or chemical conditions at the location e g calcite dissolution of carbonate rocks in such environments the water stable isotopes of 18 o and 2 h may be a robust tracer δ 18 o in surface and terrestrial waters is mainly influenced by temperature and evaporation processes that occur on an annual basis clark and fritz 1997 kendall and caldwell 1998 and the variations in temperate climate zones are minor compared to arid regions δ 18 o and δ 2 h variations in groundwater effectively damp out seasonal variations of meteoric waters due to long travel times and enhanced mixing in aquifers leibundgut et al 2009 hence water stable isotopes of 18 o and 2h provide an effective labelling of seawater and freshwater and enables an understanding of seawater intrusion and mixing ratios moreover the relationship between 18 o and 2 h with salinity is well established yurtsever 1997 clark and fritz 1997 as δ 18 o and salinity are generally known to a increase with evaporation b decrease with higher precipitation or other freshwater inputs and c vary by mixing from advection and diffusion processes as the controlling processes depend on season climate and geographic location the slope and intercept of 18 o salinity relation may vary seasonally and geographically benway and mix 2004 mcconnell et al 2009 singh et al 2010 most importantly their stability at different temporal scales make them complementary to conservative tracers which decreases the uncertainty in mixing estimations due to advances in the measurement techniques for stable water isotopes and the ease to obtain salinity estimates these two tracers are also cost efficient along these lines this study i explores the use and benefits of salinity and water stable isotopes dual tracer approach over the use of only one of these tracers and ii supplement this dual tracer approach with direct physical measurements head gradients seepage rates to further understand the seasonal dynamics of the lagoon saltwater freshwater interface in the absence of tides and wave activity the ringkøbing fjord system in denmark is investigated where the lagoon water is characterized as brackish water and is subject to seasonal salinity changes due to seasonal changes in discharge from the largest river in denmark skjern river as tides and wave activity are negligible the field site provides great field laboratory conditions to study density driven dynamic processes 2 study site the study site is located at the eastern shore of ringkøbing fjord at the west coast of denmark fig 1 a the fjord can be characterized as a restricted lagoon system kjerfve 1994 it has an area of 300 km2 and although it has a mean water depth of 1 9 m more than 25 of the area is less than 0 5 m deep kirkegaard et al 2011 kinnear et al 2013 at its western extent the lagoon is disconnected from the ocean through a natural barrier haider 2013 a man made channel that is regulated by a lock is the only surface connection between the ocean and the lagoon this channel maintains the water level in the lagoon at approximately 0 25 m above sea level m a s l and salinity values between 6 and 15 the lagoon receives freshwater inflow from skjern river with an annual mean discharge of 50 m3 s kirkegaard et al 2011 haider 2013 at its south eastern extent discharge data from a discharge station stat nr 250097 located 16 km upstream of the effluent indicates a seasonal discharge distribution of low flows during summer months may aug and high flows during the winter months dec jan minor freshwater inputs from drainage systems at the eastern shoreline are also present airborne and waterborne geophysical surveys have provided information on groundwater interacting with the lagoon and have shown that groundwater inflow occurs mainly along the eastern shoreline with a highly variable pattern and magnitude but it is also expected at the northern and southern shore kirkegaard et al 2011 groundwater discharge zones are generally located within tens of meters from the shoreline and most often occurring in micro bays along the shore kirkegaard et al 2011 kinnear et al 2013 nevertheless there is evidence for further offshore terrestrial sgd zones kirkegaard et al 2011 haider et al 2014 groundwater input to the lagoon system was estimated to be 14 5 m3 d per meter shoreline by numerical modelling for the 40 km eastern shoreline which corresponds to 17 of the total discharge from skjern river haider et al 2014 this estimate is highly uncertain as its spatial extent and volume strongly depends on aquifer heterogeneities local measurements using temperature as a tracer has estimated a mean flux of 0 026 m d but can vary between 0 07 to below 0 01 m d duque et al 2016 if one assumes a discharge width of 20 m the mean flux translates into a terrestrial input of 0 52 m3 d per meter shoreline much less than predicted by the model of haider et al 2014 the study site on the eastern shore consists of a shallow sandy phreatic aquifer containing pleistocene fluvial glacial sands it includes an area roughly 25 m off shore and 65 m in land fig 1b the onshore elevation up to well j1 is less than 1 m a s l followed by a short steep slope increasing the elevation to 3 m a s l fig 1c the regional aquifer is intervened by low permeability silty units and high permeability paleo channels haider 2013 a confining lower permeable unit is present at about 12 m depth the vegetation has adapted to the brackish water conditions and grows across the shoreline with greater density onshore and in patchy areas offshore 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrogeology a 90 m long transect of 14 piezometer wells was established perpendicular to the shoreline fig 1b based on earlier studies haider et al 2014 duque et al 2016 the saltwater intrusion was expected to be located within this area the wells were screened 0 1 m screen length at different depths ranging from 1 3 m to 15 m below the surface they were assembled from 2 m long stainless steel pipes of 1 in diameter and connected by steel fittings sealed with teflon tape hydraulic heads water stable isotopes and electrical conductivity ec were measured in october 2014 february april and july 2015 in all wells reported hydraulic heads are corrected for density effects according to post et al 2007 additionally at wells j4d and j5 fig 1b vertical tracer profiles were established in october 2014 and february 2015 respectively taking samples with one meter resolution three casing volumes were purged from each well prior to sampling single measurements from the lagoon water isotopic compositions were available from previous years for august 2010 and may 2012 samples obtained in october february and april are grouped as wet season samples and july and august samples are grouped as dry season samples according to the temporal variation of annual precipitation amounts 3 2 lagoon stage and salinity data on the lagoon stage was available from september 1998 2015 from a station in the lagoon north of the field site fig 1a and was provided by the danish coastal authority the lagoon stage varied between 0 07 m a s l during early spring to 0 13 m a s l in december salinity and ec measurements were provided by the danish nature agency also from 1998 2015 fig 1a a data gap existed only for ec data between 2000 and 2009 consequently these dates were excluded from the analysis the highest average ec of 17 ms cm is typically observed during summer months while ec in winter months is around 6 ms cm fig 2 3 3 seepage meter measurements seepage meter measurements were conducted near the offshore wells fig 1b measurements took place in october 2014 wet period and july 2015 dry period the seepage meters were constructed after lee 1977 with a half barrel of 0 25 m2 inflow area a collection bag was attached to a valve connected to the top of the barrel to control the inflow manually the bag was protected from the limited wave activity by a plastic box the bag was pre filled with at least 15 of the total bag volume each location was measured three times 3 4 groundwater electrical conductivity ec and stable isotopes the ec of the lagoon is to a great extent controlled by the incoming seawater through the lock and discharge from skjern river with small daily and high yearly amplitudes in the range of brackish water fig 2 the ec in groundwater is expected to be relatively stable at low values producing a large contrast to the lagoon water increased saltwater intrusion into the groundwater may be expected during summer due to higher salinities in the lagoon in contrast retreating saltwater is expected during the winter when salinity is lower in the lagoon both processes are affected by terrestrial freshwater fluxes as hydraulic gradients are smallest during summer and highest during winter the δ 18 o composition of the incoming fresh groundwater would be expected to remain stable evaporation in summer causes an isotopic enrichment of the lagoon water by several permil compared to groundwater that enrichment remains stable throughout the summer season due to the long water residence times of water in the lagoon hence δ 18 o is potentially a better tracer than ec with more robust and stable end member compositions water samples from the lagoon wells and seepage meters were analyzed for ec and δ 18 o δ 16 o isotopes ec measurements were taken with a calibrated wtw cond 3310 the salinity concentration s in g l is calculated from ec at 25 c using the empirical equation from holzbecher 1998 1 s mg l 3 83 0 699 ec μ s cm samples for isotope analysis were filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and analyzed for δ 18 o 0 1 and δ 2 h 0 2 by the cavity ring down spectroscopy method using a picarro l2021 i at the geological survey of denmark and greenland geus copenhagen the δ notation given in is the relative deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard craig 1961 3 5 mixing analysis a mixing analysis was carried out using the software package mix carrera et al 2004 it uses a maximum likelihood method to calculate mixing ratios accounting for the uncertainty of the end members em s and samples this em uncertainty arises from concentration variations in space and time and from analytical errors two em s were identified lagoon water groundwater which differ in their isotopic composition and ec one em represents the recharge groundwater composition entering the transect from east hence the groundwater em composition is assumed to be represented by the average δ 18 o composition of meteoric water clark and fritz 1997 and a salinity expressed in ec ms cm deduced from the shallow onshore wells j1 j4 the lagoon em concentration for ec was represented by the average observed measured ec between 1998 2015 assuming that enhanced saltwater intrusion mainly occurs at the time of highest salinity summer the isotopic em was chosen based on δ 18 o samples from previous summers and late spring august 2010 may 2012 and combined with current observations of lagoon water from july 2015 the assigned variances for both em compositions are deducted from the standard deviation of the annual changes of groundwater and lagoon water see later for comparison a classical simple linear end member mixing analysis emma was also applied where only a single parameter i e either ec or δ 18 o was used and an observed fraction of lagoon water in a sample f lag was established based on conservative linear mixing process between two em s apello and postma 2005 2 f lag m sample m freshwater m lag m freshwater where m sample is the parameter value in the sample and m freshwater and m lag are the em values of the groundwater and lagoon water respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic head gradients and seepage meter fluxes maximum and minimum lagoon stages in the observational period ranged between 0 07 and 0 13 m a s l fig 3 all onshore wells j1 j5 show a hydraulic gradient from land towards the lagoon the average hydraulic head observations fig 1c show that groundwater flows into the transect site and is confined by the lower permeable silty bottom and organic layers surface causing artesian conditions nevertheless seasonal head fluctuations exist fig 3 those fluctuations are higher for offshore wells j6 j11 than onshore wells j1 j5 and a result of density dynamics in the subsurface of the lagoon this causes offshore hydraulic heads occasionally to be above onshore hydraulic heads thus a dynamic interface is developed where positive hydraulic gradients groundwater flow into the lagoon may partly be reversed and lagoon water is able to flow into the onshore groundwater body seepage meter fluxes from autumn and summer always show discharge from the aquifer into the lagoon fig 3 the average discharge in october is 3 7 cm d with a high seepage occurring close to the shore 5 cm d followed by a decrease 5 15 m offshore and a high seepage 15 23 m offshore the fluxes during july 2015 are lower than in october with an average discharge of 1 6 cm d the lowest seepage is observed near the shore with increased seepage fluxes further offshore higher seepage fluxes in october can be linked to higher hydraulic gradients while the lower fluxes in july correspond to lower hydraulic gradients nonetheless this relation may be modified as recirculating groundwater can amplify seepage rates li et al 1999 taniguchi et al 2002 4 2 water stable isotopes and salinity the δ 18 o isotopic composition of precipitation in the area ranges between 5 5 38 3 δ 2 h and 10 73 4 δ 2 h with an average of 7 8 δ 18 o 52 δ 2 h fig 4 a local meteoric water line lmwl for the area of 7 29 δ 18 o 4 81 has been established on the basis of precipitation measurements at the nearby station müller et al 2017 fig 1a most enriched values are observed during early spring while most depleted values are observed during winter müller et al 2017 the lagoon water samples from the wet period october april plot along the lmwl whereas the dry season samples may august plot below the lmwl with more enriched values this is consistent with an evaporation of lagoon water during summer and higher freshwater inputs to the lagoon with less evaporation during other seasons salinity effects on the fractionation process during evaporation as postulated for brine water or hypersaline environments gonfiantini 1986 gat 2010 are not expected due to the low salinity characteristics of the lagoon combining lagoon samples from both seasons a local evaporation line lel is developed with a slope lower than the lmwl of 6 02 and an intercept value of 4 43 this is a typical slope for evaporating seawater gat 2010 for the august 2012 sample no δ 2 h was available hence it was excluded for the development of the lel however its corresponding deuterium value was recalculated from the lel regression this assumes similar evaporation conditions in 2012 in order to be shown fig 4 all groundwater samples onshore and offshore wells are on average 1 more enriched in δ 18 o 6 91 δ 18 o 46 2 δ 2 h than the average rain composition the range of the groundwater composition is between 8 26 δ 18 o 52 2 δ 2 h at j6 in october to 3 42 δ 18 o 23 9 δ 2 h at j5 in october where the δ 18 o at j5 indicates intruding saltwater yet the majority of the samples plot more closely along the lel than the lmwl the bulk of the groundwater samples from the onshore wells in the wet season plot close to the average value of precipitation this may be an indication of its meteoric origin with enhanced regional freshwater contribution in wet periods as shown above lagoon water undergoes evaporative enrichment during summer the offshore well j11 always plots along the lel as it is distinctively enriched compared to other offshore wells this indicates the presence of summer intruded lagoon water independent of season j7d and j10 also show enriched isotopic compositions but are lower than j11 this is likely due to the screen location being within the saltwater freshwater transition zone where samples from j7d and j10 are subject to mixing dynamics of a large portion of intruding lagoon water from above and less influence of fresh groundwater coming from land samples from j6 and j8 in october are the most depleted samples in the wet period and also show the least enrichment during dry season hence these samples suggest to sample water in the saltwater freshwater transition zone but with a strong freshwater influence mixed with a smaller amount of lagoon water additional information on the saltwater wedge extension can be delineated from the isotopic composition groundwater samples at depths greater than 10 m plot along the lel the onshore well j4d plots around the mean groundwater value contrary to this samples from j5 in the wet period close to shore plot between the most enriched lagoon samples and the intersect of the lel and lmwl hence during the wet season the saltwater wedge is expected to be located between wells j5 and j4 and should have a relatively steep slope because not all depths from j5 and j4 were sampled no information on the exact toe location can be given the relation between the δ 18 o and salinity serves as a basis to deduce end members lagoon water ultimately is a mixture of freshwater inputs gw to the lagoon and seawater from the north sea sw fig 5 therefore indicates a mixing line gw sw mix between a freshwater end member zero salinity 7 8 δ 18 o from the average of precipitation and oceanic seawater 35 g l salinity dmi 2017 0 δ 18 o as a consequence of the seasonal variation of δ 18 o in precipitation a potential range in mixing is indicated by the dashed lines when evaporation from an open water body occurs a steep increase in the δ 18 o of the remaining water will be accompanied by a relatively small increase in salinity gonfiantini 1986 this δ 18 o salinity relation during evaporation is illustrated by the evaporation line in fig 5 see details in figure the lagoon water plots distinctively different fig 5 for different seasons wet season samples are close to that of groundwater dry season samples are outside the gw sw mixing range and instead fall between the evaporation line and the mixing range this points towards evaporative enrichment gonfiantini 1986 of the lagoon water during summer months all shallow onshore wells have very low salinity 0 3 g l and δ 18 o above the average value of precipitation fig 5 the offshore wells deep onshore wells and wet season lagoon water plot along the gw sw mixing line however the samples at 11 m and 12 m depth from j5 show a composition on the right end of the gw sw mixing line yet not close to lagoon water similar trends are seen for j11 independent of the season suggesting that deep j5 and j11 samples are partially composed of north sea water rather than lagoon water nonetheless the dual isotope plot fig 4 illustrates that these samples plot close to lagoon water suggesting an opposite result however from the conceptual understanding of the system it is more likely that deep j5 and j11 samples are biased towards the faster changing salinity in the lagoon hence they are not capable of reflecting salinities similar to those observed in the lagoon on the other hand δ 18 o due its stability serves as a better predictor for the seawater composition at j5 and j11 4 3 mixing analysis two end member mixing analysis was carried out for the wet season periods of october 14 february 15 and april 15 and for the dry period july 15 the assigned input values and variances are based on the average and standard deviation of samples and end members the δ 18 o composition of both em lagoon and groundwater can be considered relatively stable with a variation by 1 09 and 0 01 respectively the ec of groundwater can also be considered stable while the variance of 4 5 ms cm expresses the observed seasonal variation in the lagoon water table 1 this indicates the added advantage of using δ 18 o as a more robust and stable tracer the mixing model always forces the ec of the lagoon em composition to be higher than the average value in order to fit the observations ec values are estimated to be between 18 ms cm in february and 24 ms cm in october which is much higher than the average input value of 11 7 ms cm the δ 18 o composition appears to be more stable but is forced to be more depleted with ranges between 0 1 and 1 the smaller error introduced with δ 18 o compared to ec promises more stability in the calculation and suggests the right em choice of δ 18 o as the average simulated lagoon em concentration of ec was always increased it suggests that the initial use of an average value may be biased and the true em concentration could be higher values in the range of modelled ec em values are exclusively observed during the summer as shown in fig 5 which fits the actual timing of the greatest saltwater intrusion nonetheless a value of 24 ms cm calculated for the lagoon em in october has not been observed the results from the linear emma either ec or δ 18 o show a high deviation compared to the results of the dual end member approach fig 6 the ec tends to be over predicting while δ 18 o under predicts lagoon water fractions the outcome of the linear emma is shown to be sensitive to the choice of em composition an average em choice results in fractions far above 100 this suggests incorrect em values for the emma analysis furthermore it highlights the advantage for two or more species for mixing analysis assuming that the mix model results in most certain fractions the use of one tracer can be highly biased i e choosing ec over δ 18 o fig 6 when only ec is used and compared to mix fraction estimates the two approaches yield an average difference of 18 for single wells with a standard deviation stdv of 33 in extreme cases a well may contain 3 lagoon water based on the mix model but 100 lagoon water based on the ec end member estimation when using δ 18 o instead these differences decrease on average to 6 with a stdv of 7 hence errors by choosing δ 18 o for linear emma are smaller in general the results show the advantage of a mix model analysis over the emma approach on the basis of these results the emma analysis is not considered in the following from the average mixing fractions fig 7 a seasonal dynamics are suggested to be limited to offshore wells as indicated by the error bars the lowest lagoon water fraction is found in the february samples where except for j11 f lag 100 the wells show less than 20 seawater content table 1 the february observations are responsible for the increased variation in the offshore wells fig 7a october april and july show similar trends amongst all wells where the shallow onshore wells have less than 10 lagoon water content table 1 among these july always shows the greatest lagoon water contributions while the lowest fractions are observed in april j6 j9 indicating high freshwater influence during that period october and july fractions show similar trends in the offshore wells with july always containing the greatest lagoon water content mixing fractions observed from the profile of well j5 at the shoreline show a large fraction of lagoon water 50 at a depth of 10 m below the surface october this reached 100 over the next 2m before gradually decreasing to 0 at 15 m depth fig 7b further onshore at well j4 the same distinct increase in the fraction of lagoon water at the same depth is not repeated however at 12 m depth the lagoon water content did increase to be 10 fig 7b the well compositions are influenced from lagoon water derived from summer intrusions where ec and δ 18 o enrichment are highest furthermore these results suggest that intruding lagoon water is preserved at greater depths at least until autumn 4 4 conceptualization of saltwater intrusion in the near shore aquifer at ringkøbing fjord using october as a starting point a refreshing of the study area is initiated fig 8 mixing fractions at the offshore wells show high lagoon water content originating from the previous summer where lagoon water with higher salinities intruded the aquifer the salinity of the lagoon is around 8 g l while the average lagoon water level and the groundwater heads between j7 j11 are at 0 1 m a s l and slightly below respectively suggesting lagoon water intrusion even the limited wave activity present in this system may elevate hydraulic heads of the lagoon increasing the likelihood of saltwater intrusion on the other hand the average seepage meter discharge fluxes across the lagoon bed are highest 3 7 cm d henceforth terrestrial freshwater input to the lagoon is present the increasing freshwater contribution continues to february as hydraulic heads are on average 10 cm higher average 0 24 m a s l than in october and above lagoon stage max 0 1 m a s l thereby a progression of freshwater input and very low lagoon water salinities 4 2 g l produces the lowest observed lagoon water fractions in the wells only the most offshore well j11 retains high salinities fig 5 in april the groundwater flux is similar to february average heads of 0 22 m a s l but due to a salinity increase 6 1 g l saltwater begins to slowly intrude again towards the summer months hydraulic heads are slightly reduced and terrestrial sgd inflow is lowered avg seepage flux 1 6 cm d by a factor of two when compared to october 3 7 cm d at the same time increasing salinity due to evaporation and minimal freshwater inputs from groundwater enhances a progressive intrusion of lagoon water moreover field observations suggest the presence of a low hydraulic conductivity unit around 12 m depth such a unit was also reported from earlier studies haider 2013 kinnear et al 2013 this unit locally confines the base of upper aquifer and is also believed to be responsible for the high freshwater content seen from mixing fractions in j5 below 14 m depth saltwater is limited from intruding this confining unit and consequently is mainly transported inland above the unit as no saltwater was observed in february at a depth of 12 m a dynamic interface is to be expected at j4 a seasonal variation of saltwater intrusion pattern was postulated from robinson et al 1998 who collected a yearly dataset of head measurements and salinities with one time samples from seepage meters in the chesapeake bay virginia they concluded that seasons with low freshwater discharge and high surface water salinities were associated with landward intrusion of saltwater and vice versa increased freshwater contribution can be attributed to higher groundwater discharge and low surface water salinities however their study lacks a seasonal observed component of sgd seasonal dynamics were also found by poulsen et al 2010 at a danish coastal field site using vertical ert profiling where the annual salinity pattern within the aquifer is modified seasonally as a consequence of an increasing and decreasing freshwater lens due to recharge variations yet at their study site a change in surface water salinities was not considered a tracer study conducted in a mediterranean lagoon system in turkey showed that on a larger scale lagoon water was composed of mainly freshwater derived from lake water upstream of the lagoon during the wet seasons as a consequence of increased hydraulic heads stumpp et al 2014 whereas during dry seasons the lagoon water was fed mostly by ocean water due to density induced inflow as well as reduced hydraulic heads in the catchment which decreased the freshwater contribution our study however is the first to use ec and δ 18 o in a dual tracer approach with uncertain end members to quantify seasonal dynamics of sgd and movement of the saltwater freshwater interface jørgensen et al 2008 used 87sr 86sr and δ 18 o to study saltwater intrusion during a pumping experiment but did not account for end member uncertainty the tracer data corroborates the interpretation of hydraulic gradients and seepage meters results but additionally provides information regarding internal flow dynamics observed off shore below the lagoon bed elaborations on the seasonality of saltwater freshwater wedge dynamics are speculative as the data from the lower areas of the aquifer are not sufficient enough to make conclusions however based on the observations in the shallow parts of the aquifer it can be speculated that the replacement of saltwater by freshwater takes place throughout the aquifer down to the low confining unit starting in october saltwater intrusion also affects the whole offshore part of the upper aquifer during summer months based on observations in the profile wells the maximum extension of the saltwater wedge toe appears to be located between j5 and j4 5 conclusions a dual tracer approach using electrical conductivity and water stable isotopes was used to assess and quantify seasonal flow dynamics and the movement of a saltwater freshwater interface near ringkøbing fjord a coastal lagoon system in denmark the site provides natural conditions to isolate the effects of density driven subsurface flow and freshwater fluxes on the seasonal development of a saltwater wedge the lagoon stage is very stable and wedge dynamics are mainly introduced by the seasonal variation of salinities in the lagoon and seasonal varying inland hydraulic gradients our study demonstrated that this leads to seawater intrusion during summer conditions dry period when salinity is high and hydraulic gradients are low and a retreating saltwater wedge in the aquifer during winter conditions wet period when surface water salinities are low and hydraulic gradients high the total submarine groundwater discharge to the lagoon varies roughly by a factor of 2 3 between seasons flow dynamics and changes in salinity are almost entirely below the lagoon however our observations do not provide certain conclusions regarding the seasonal dynamics of the toe location of the saltwater wedge in our study a dual tracer end member analysis was effective in quantifying the saltwater intrusion the dual tracer end member mixing analysis was compared with a single tracer end member analysis using only ec as a cheap measurement of salinity and δ 18 o we demonstrate that the dual tracer approach yields different mixing fractions especially below the lagoon bed where the system is most dynamic δ 18 o is a more robust tracer than ec and its end member concentrations particularly of lagoon water are more seasonal stable and improve the estimations of mixing fractions we show that with the use of ec in a single tracer end member estimate lagoon fractions in wells differ 18 on average with individual wells differing as much as 97 these variations have the potential to introduce biased conclusions about the lagoon system by only using δ 18 o differences could be minimized to 6 but single wells still had differences up to 30 compared to the dual tracer approach the performance of a single tracer mixing estimate strongly depends on the right choice of end member concentration we believe the mix model estimates to be most reliable as the model treats observations as true values incorporates both tracers simultaneously and accounts for variances or uncertainties in the end members consequently we recommend that when dealing with coastal environments or lagoon settings where ec of the lagoon is prone to high temporal variations daily weekly monthly to concurrently apply δ 18 o as a more robust tracer the simultaneous application of both tracers can improve mixing estimations substantially acknowledgements this

8512,study region the state of utah western usa study focus analysis of annual hydrographs from most rivers in the western u s suggests that snowmelt provides the majority of streamflow in these areas in this study we attempt to quantify what proportion of utah s streamflow comes from cold season processes previous estimates have ranged from around 60 80 of total annual streamflow with uncertainty stemming from complexities related to rain on snow events the geographic and temporal distribution of precipitation events and the partitioning of rainfall snowmelt into streamflow new hydrological insights the proportion of streamflow in the western u s that is snowmelt in origin is well understood to be quite high but has rarely been explicitly quantified our data indicate that 98 99 of streamflow in utah watersheds originates from melting snow and associated processes the contribution of summer month precipitation to annual streamflow in utah is extraordinarily low typically 1 2 using soil moisture and well depth data we also demonstrate that vast areas of utah watersheds are incapable of producing event flow from summer precipitation due to consumptive losses from evapotranspiration and other factors this analysis is likely representative of areas within other western states that have cool continental climates abundant snowfall long duration snowpacks meaning that substantial portions of the snowpack do not typically melt during the winter and sedimentary bedrock keywords snowmelt streamflow utah soil moisture snotel cold season processes 1 introduction the importance of snow as a resource for states in the western u s would be hard to overstate strum et al 2017 most rivers that drain mountainous terrain in the western u s have hydrographs that are strongly driven by snowmelt processes in fig 1 the average daily streamflow of the multiple watersheds in utah exhibits a pattern ubiquitous to many western watersheds the beginning of snowmelt in april produces the annual rise in flow which typically continues until around late july at which time streamflow returns to base flow conditions snowmelt driven hydrographs tend to have unimodal peak discharge with modest increases and decreases in flow rates and very little variation in discharge outside the snowmelt runoff period as shown in fig 1 the period of the streamflow hydrographs from august to april is remarkably steady suggesting that whatever precipitation falls during this period does not typically manifest in substantial increases in streamflow with the exception of the virgin river discussed later this raises the issue of quantifying what percent of water flowing in typical western streams is generated from snowmelt versus rainfall the proportion of streamflow in the western u s that is snowmelt in origin is well understood to be quite high but has rarely been explicitly quantified li et al 2017 previous estimates range from 60 85 or most for mountainous areas in the west e g campbell et al 1995 lins 1997 serreze et al 1999 pederson et al 2011 li et al 2015 strum et al 2017 see additional details in li et al 2017 table 1 though some researchers have cited a slightly lower range e g 40 70 value given in maurer and bowling 2014 in an analysis that spanned the western u s li et al 2017 concluded that roughly 50 of all runoff in the region began as snowmelt that proportion was much higher 70 for mountainous areas in utah the estimates have ranged from 80 to close to 100 barnett et al 2005 however the majority of these estimates are rough guesses instead of exact proportions based on regional factors even with widespread high quality point data from high altitude weather stations nrcs snow telemetry network snotel the exact proportion of streamflow that stems from a basin s snowmelt is problematic to derive in any given year due to the complexities of temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation across the watershed the proportion of precipitation that falls as rain versus snow kormos et al 2014 subsequent redistribution of snow heterogeneities in soil types depths and antecedent water content spatial and temporal variations in snowmelt rates and other factors in addition some distinctions may be semantic for example a rain on snow event midwinter that did not generate melt water is not relevant to streamflow and effectively becomes part of the watershed s snow water equivalent swe until the entire snowpack begins to melt during the spring melt season as such we elected to sidestep this issue by 1 quantifying the contribution of summer precipitation to annual streamflow and 2 lumping all of the hydrological phenomena associated with snow water accumulation and snowmelt such as warming rain on snow rain on the watershed but not on snow etc together as one category called cold season processes csp a similar approach to this seasonal partitioning of precipitation was used by stage 1957 who found that 98 of the flow originated as winter precipitation for benton creek within the priest river experimental forest idaho similarly yenko 2003 found that close to 100 of the water contributing to streamflow in a small idaho watershed could be accounted for by cold season precipitation occurring in the basin williams and ehleringer 1996 stated that only around 18 25 of the annual precipitation in northern utah was received during summer months understanding how much streamflow is derived from summer precipitation can therefore be used to derive how much annual flow comes from snow and snow related processes in this study we estimate the relative contribution of summer precipitation versus csp in the annual discharge of utah rivers in addition we examine herein the source area of streamflow in utah watersheds and demonstrate that the vast majority of flow comes from areas proximal to the channel or from areas that have a short distance to an impermeable layer such as bedrock while soil moisture observed at snotel sites has been shown to contribute to annual streamflow for utah watersheds clayton 2016 harpold et al 2017 we note that higher elevations with shallow soils and high permeability are the most substantial streamflow contribution areas watershed areas that have deeper soils with finer textures and are distal to the channel contribute little or no flow on an annual basis 2 methods this study makes use of the snotel snowpack telemetry data network maintained by the nrcs there are more than 800 automated snotel weather stations in remote high elevation mountainous locations in the western u s data are available from https www wcc nrcs usda gov snow there are roughly 130 snotel sites in utah and each is equipped with sensors to measure snow water equivalent accumulated precipitation 0 1 inch resolution snow depth 1 inch resolution air temperature 0 1 c resolution soil moisture 0 1 percent volumetric water content resolution and soil temperature 0 1 c resolution hourly data are telemetered to a data collection office and quality controlled most snotel sites in utah were installed in the late 1970s to mid 1980s and therefore have a reliably long period of record to evaluate trends and weather extremes additional details about the snotel data network can be obtained from https www wcc nrcs usda gov about mon automate html as well as from serreze et al 1999 salzmann and mearns 2012 and numerous other publications for this analysis summer precipitation streamflow sps is defined as event flow during the summer months meaning that there has been a non negligible response increase in the stream s hydrograph this occurs from when the annual snowmelt hydrograph approaches base flow and snotel sites have melted out to that time in the fall when precipitation is recorded as snowfall at representative snotel sites within the watershed we distinguished sps events during early summer as occurring subsequent to the time at which the recessional portion of the annual snowmelt hydrograph was 25 higher than its summer base flow level the overall time period in any given year is therefore variable depending on the length of the snowmelt season and the arrival of snowfall later in the year this delineation works well in utah as june july are typically the driest months of the year resulting in the occurrence of relatively few precipitation events concurrent with the declining limb of the snowmelt hydrograph in the fall and early winter as rainfall changes to snowfall the number of storms producing discernible increases in streamflow declines dramatically until there are none we used this definition of sps to quantify all flows not related to csp for rivers and streams throughout utah for the period of 1981 2011 we allowed this delineation to be subjective meaning that we based our definition of a non negligible increase in the hydrograph upon our hydrological expertise rather than assigning a threshold value in order to afford flexibility and to draw on professional experience with precipitation data in the region we started by using an algorithm to identify precipitation events in the watershed in the daily snotel precipitation data we then attempted to identify corresponding increases in daily usgs streamflow data at the locations provided in table 1 the increase in flow was calculated by taking that amount of flow where the hydrograph first increased until it receded to its original level in general streamflow duration and magnitude responses varied in proportion with the magnitude and duration of the precipitation event we also identified some spikes increases in discharge that were not associated with a precipitation event it is likely that these responses were associated with precipitation events that were not observed at the various snotel sites in the basin either because of the localized nature of the event or because the precipitation occurred at lower elevation these hydrograph events were not removed but instead were included as sps in the watershed total in order to provide a conservative estimate of the portion of the annual discharge that did not originate as sps though some degree of subjectivity in this approach was unavoidable we took care to apply this methodology consistently for all watersheds in the study the volume of water attributed to each sps event was then determined by totaling all flows from the initial streamflow increase over its base flow to the point when the flow had declined back to the previous base flow level we omitted fluctuations in base flow if they oscillated above and below steady levels as these are interpreted to be due to sensor error or diurnal patterns however all non zero increases in discharge indicative of a stream response were included even if no associated precipitation was captured at snotel sites in the basin sps events were summed to obtain an annual total which was then compared to the total flow for that year for each stream this approach is similar to the effort by stage 1957 to quantify winter precipitation in another snow dominated basin in the western u s streamflow discharge data was obtained from u s geological survey gaging stations these span all major and most minor watersheds in the state table 1 gaging stations with significant upstream controls e g diversions were generally excluded from the analysis but we retained a few that have minor upstream flow regulation but also have sufficient unimpaired areas to allow the streamflow to reflect both rainfall and csp generated streamflow these sites represent a huge diversity in soils vegetation aspect geology and topography such as the high elevation metamorphic bedrock of the uinta mountains the sandstone slick rock of the virgin river headwaters and the dense clay soils overlying limestone bedrock of the wasatch plateau in addition period of record soil moisture data for utah were analyzed for all 130 snotel sites in the state to determine how frequently these soils were saturated and capable of producing sps saturation was defined as the maximum observed volumetric water content for a particular sensor depth excluding unrealistically high values and was specific to each site and sensor depth the only sites that were excluded from this analysis were five locations buck pasture burts miller ranch ef blacks fk buck flat and spirit lake where the soil moisture data are collected in a permanently wet environment and do not reflect watershed conditions finally well log data from the state of utah division of water rights http www waterrights utah gov were used to determine the overall depth to the surface of the water table including both those that were located near adjacent to streams and more distant locations close to watershed divides these data were obtained in order to determine the potential for subsurface water to contribute to observed variations in sps 3 results in fig 2 the percent of april july flow is compared with streamflow for the remaining eight months of the year for 17 major rivers in utah the average percentage of april july flow of the annual total flow for these watersheds across utah is 75 conversely only 25 of the annual flow occurs during the remainder of the year fig 2 in general the proportion of annual flow that occurs from april july was greater for higher elevation watersheds such as the bear and weber rivers than for lower elevation watersheds such as blacksmiths fork however a couple exceptions were manti creek and fish creek two mid elevation watersheds that receive more than 80 of their total annual flow between april and july this may be due to the thick clayey soils sedimentary geology and comparatively modest relief of the wasatch plateau where these watersheds are located that together augment water retention i e minimize runoff generation in the basin during summer months these proportions suggest that csp constitutes the dominant input in these basins supply and given that these rivers have hydrographs similar to fig 1 implies that the august april flow is predominantly base flow with minimal input from sps events we explore this possibility below by examining the average percent of annual streamflow that was contributed by sps events in each watershed fig 3 total average annual streamflow from sps events ranged from about 0 5 to about 2 for utah rivers except for the virgin river where sps contributed to about 7 of annual flow differences in basin characteristics provide some explanation for the higher sps contribution for the virgin river including a large proportion of the basin is impervious rock primarily sandstone with cliffs and exposed bedrock close to the stream channel soils are very coarse sandy textures from the sandstone parent material allowing little water retention the watershed is in the southwestern corner of the state and is more susceptible to high intensity convective precipitation during the summer monsoon and the watershed area is larger than the other basins included in this study these effects are manifest in both the substantial amount of sps and the trend of increasing base flow during the summer fall months that is evident in fig 1 for the virgin river conversely given the generally lower elevations and warmer climate of the virgin river basin relative to the others considered here there is a comparatively large proportion of the watershed that may receive winter rain outside of below the snow accumulation zone which would have the effect of overestimating the csp contribution to annual flow so the 7 sps value presented above may be an underestimation every basin had years where there was very little streamflow response to sps with as low as around 0 02 of the annual total flow for the majority of basins and 0 87 for the virgin river conversely the maximum sps varied regionally ranging from 4 to 5 for northern utah basins to between 0 75 and 1 25 for central utah streams particularly for those streams draining the wasatch plateau fish creek and manti creek the maximum annual sps contribution to overall flow was much higher for the virgin at around 19 22 for the base flow portion of the overall flow roughly 20 25 of the annual discharge volume as noted above we acknowledge the challenge and uncertainty inherent in attempting to discern sources of water that are integrated into a single base flow discharge value lacking tracer or other diagnostic data there is no way to know what exact proportion of csp versus rainfall comprises the base flow portion of the hydrograph however teleconnections in utah watersheds described in clayton 2016 between declining soil moisture values subsequent to snowmelt driven peaks and the transition from event flow to base flow in downstream channels strongly support the idea that base flow levels are established by the magnitude of the snowmelt and do not vary significantly until the following spring as shown in fig 1 for all basins except the virgin while it is possible or even likely that rainfall adds some water to area streams as base flow we argue in subsequent sections related to soil moisture and groundwater that conditions in the basins during summer tend to promote losses to evapotranspiration rather than additions to streamflow moreover during the summer months soil moisture values over the measured profile tend to decrease these typically rebound during fall months as evapotranspiration declines some moisture remains in the upper 50 cm soil profile some of which is likely from summer precipitation particularly for the upper 20 cm however since summer precipitation is less likely to reach the 50 cm sensor see details below much of the water content at that depth is probably residual from csp residual soil moisture during fall months eventually contributes to streamflow during the next snowmelt runoff period harpold et al 2017 the exact contribution of residual soil moisture to the following year s runoff is complicated by the following factors 1 the proportion of volumetric water content in the soil column that is derived from summer rainfall versus csp is unknown 2 the portion of the watershed that contributes to streamflow varies seasonally and may or may not be well represented by observations of soil moisture at nearby snotel sites 3 converting the volumetric water content observed at soil moisture monitoring sites to a depth of water requires dimensionalizing over the depth of the soil column but the depth of soils in the area are variable and change spatially 4 we lack instrumentation to quantify residual soil moisture in the portions of these watersheds directly adjacent to the streams as snotel sites are generally located in upland settings and 5 we lack information regarding how much residual soil moisture will be lost to continuing evapotranspiration and other processes we therefore deduce that csp contributes 98 99 of the average annual flow to utah streams in most regions except for the virgin river watershed this estimate comes from the fractionation of csp versus sps described above showing that for most areas in the state sps ranges between roughly 1 and 2 assuming that all water inputs to utah streams are accounted for we will explore this assumption in greater detail below we therefore assert that the remaining 98 99 of flow observed as stream discharge comes from csp 4 discussion regional differences in summer precipitation are fairly minor between northern and central utah watersheds around 12 15 centimeters for both areas so differences in runoff production are most likely attributable to other factors for example the central utah basins draining the wasatch plateau have clay rich thick soils and comparatively modest relief which improves their capacity to retain rainfall however for southern utah particularly the virgin watershed high intensity precipitation over small areas and short time periods produces overland flow leading to higher sps values still the exceptionally minimal streamflow response to summer rainfall for most basins in utah implies that snowmelt and snowmelt related processes such as rain on snow supply the remainder of water available to supply the annual streamflow generally in the range of 98 99 of the average annual total flow as noted in fig 4 summer precipitation constitutes between 15 and 25 of the annual total precipitation across utah watersheds with an average of 20 reflecting an aspect of the climatology of the state summers are typically drier than winters however the 20 of the annual total precipitation that is received during the summer months generates just 1 6 of the annual streamflow fig 3 indicating that the runoff efficiency during the summer is substantially lower than that of other seasons this stems from comparatively small precipitation amounts relative to high evapotranspiration from warm temperatures and active vegetation that combine to produce a substantial soil moisture deficit during summer months soils across a large portion of the watershed except for a narrow band along stream corridors are sufficiently dry to infiltrate and retain nearly all of the summer precipitation that falls the vast majority of this precipitation is subsequently consumed by the watershed s vegetation and from evaporation to examine this point further we examined regression coefficients between summer precipitation amounts and sps values per year for each site the resulting r2 values were very low from 0 00 for the manti basin to 0 36 for the sevier basin we also note that poor statistical relations exist between sps and watershed area which is probably due to the typical utah basin characteristics described above moreover we examine in subsequent analysis below the possibility that small areas within utah watersheds disproportionately contribute to their stream s annual flow and that the vast majority of this water is derived from csp as all snotel sites in utah are equipped with soil moisture sensors we explored the low runoff efficiencies discussed above from an examination of typical annual soil moisture patterns in these basins soil moisture at the garden city snotel site fig 5 depicts a common pattern at many sites across utah volumetric soil moisture increases during the spring season when snowmelt begins and soils become saturated or nearly so for a couple of months at the end of the snowmelt influx soils rapidly dry the rate of which decreases with depth in the soil column clayton 2016 midsummer soil moisture values are quite low until a resurgence of soil moisture in the fall as temperatures and transpiration rates decrease and occasional large magnitude precipitation events increase soil moisture percentages as rainfall changes to snow soil moisture decreases and then stabilizes through the winter months in fig 5 there are several summer precipitation events where the 5 cm soil moisture sensor increases substantially note that this moisture does not reach the 20 and 50 cm sensors as they continue to slowly dry it is common that summer precipitation will induce a response in the 5 cm sensor far less frequently at the 20 cm sensor and occasionally at the 50 cm sensor though these responses at the deeper sensors are much less in magnitude and duration compared to the runoff producing season and not nearly sufficient to bring soils to a state of saturation capable of producing runoff moisture that reaches the 50 cm sensor has a short residence time before being consumed either through transpiration or deeper percolation and results shown in fig 3 suggest that little if any of this moisture makes it to streams as base flow or that the residence time of the water from these precipitation events exceeds the three month summer season most summer season precipitation is consumed in shallow portions of the soil profile and is not detectible at the 20 cm soil moisture sensor much less the 50 cm sensor substantial runoff generation is only plausible when soils are saturated or near saturated which typically only occurs during the snowmelt season stage 1957 thus streamflow generated by summer precipitation sps is most likely to occur from precipitation falling directly on near the wetted stream perimeter or from very high intensity precipitation events that exceed infiltration capacity thereby generating some overland flow we also examined elevation controls on the percent of summertime days july september that soils reached saturation when all three soil moisture sensors 5 cm 20 cm and 50 cm attain their saturated values considering all 130 snotel sites in utah above around 2900 m elevation 9500 feet soils are saturated only around 0 8 of the time between july 1 and september 30 the vast majority of which is during years when snowmelt is still active in july below 2900 m elevation soils are almost never saturated in the summer months 0 01 of the time and thus have the capacity to infiltrate most precipitation moisture in order to produce substantial runoff soils must either be saturated or experience precipitation rates that exceed infiltration capacity which is particularly rare where soil textures are coarse e g with sandstone parent material the lightning ridge snotel site in utah has additional one meter depth soil moisture sensors at three different sampling environments 1 in an open meadow 2 in an aspen stand and 3 in a conifer stand these have been used previously to compare vegetative impacts on soil moisture burke and kasahara 2011 here the effect of vegetation type on soil moisture thresholds is examined where differences between other factors e g precipitation inputs soil parent material etc are minimal fig 6 shows the percent of the time that soils are either saturated or at permanent wilting point pwp under three different vegetation types at the lightning ridge site at one meter depth soils are saturated under the meadow about 4 of the time in the aspen setting about 3 of the time and almost never underneath coniferous tree cover note that times when soils are saturated at these settings are almost exclusively during the snowmelt season and not during summer months conversely assuming that pwp is at 10 volumetric soil moisture for all three locations based on graphical analysis of the period of record data soils that underlie the meadow aspen and conifer vegetation reach pwp around 33 1 and 63 of the time respectively these data suggest that soils that underlie meadow and coniferous forest frequently have strong soil moisture deficits and are not likely to produce runoff except during the snowmelt season however this is less clear for soils underlying aspen forest a nearby snotel site usu doc daniel also has a soil moisture sensor at the one meter depth in addition to the standard sensors at 5 20 and 50 cm depths soils are saturated at one meter depth at the usu doc daniels snotel site around 45 of the time and nearly saturated at or above 90 saturation more than 80 of the time however the 50 cm sensor shows the pattern described above fig 5 of saturation during snowmelt and subsequent drying due to evapotranspiration these data indicate that a low permeability layer exists between 50 and 100 cm in this case due to a heavy clay layer in the soil that reduces vertical water movement and thus increases the potential for runoff site specific differences in pedogenic factors vegetation bedrock type soil thickness or other variables will impact the soil saturation threshold at any given location moreover water delivered to utah basins from snowfall is redistributed during winter months reflecting dominant wind patterns which does not necessarily coincide with spatial patterns in soil saturation and pwp thresholds williams et al 2009 fig 7 a shows the ratio of average april 1st peak snowpack snow water equivalent swe to soil saturation where the percent volumetric values are converted to a depth over one meter soil column thickness for all snotel sites in utah ratios of the maximum b and minimum c april 1st swe relative to soil saturation at these sites are also presented to explore regional differences in the capacity for soils to infiltrate snow water during melt for a range of water year conditions fig 7a shows each snotel site s theoretical ability to saturate one meter of soil depth if the average swe observed on april 1st was infiltrated as one continuous input there are around 40 stations which under average snowpack conditions do not have sufficient swe to bring 1 m of soil to saturation shown by the red orange and yellow circles in fig 7b nearly all sites are not only able to saturate the soil but many of them have sufficient excess water to fill the soil s pore spaces several times over dark blue circles alternatively as shown in fig 7c during extremely dry water years only a few sites in utah are theoretically able to saturate one meter of soil green circles these results are similar to those described in miller et al 2014 who used chemical tracer data to show that deep regional subsurface flow does not represent a major source of base flow during normal snowpack years for the upper colorado river basin and that overland flow and local shallow subsurface flow constitute the majority of annual discharge regional trends shown in fig 7 are more reflective of broad geologic soil character differences than spatial variations in precipitation snowfall similar to fig 9 in rumsey et al 2015 as snotel sites are usually located in uplands headwater locations far from stream corridors these data support the idea that there are large portions of utah watersheds that do not contribute substantial quantities of water to streamflow discharge on an annual or shorter basis we explored this point further by using well log data from the utah division of water rights https www waterrights utah gov to obtain the distance from the ground surface to the water table prior to any pumping artificial drawdown table 2 the data were available for wells that were located at various cabins and summer homes in several northern utah watersheds including the closest stream elevation weber river 2347 m and 2408 m bear river 2530 m ogden river 1951 m provo river 2073 m and dry fork creek 2134 m well data were selected for three regions in each watershed adjacent or close to the stream intermediate distance from the stream in a direction perpendicular to the channel and in the headwaters although data quality varied see details in link provided the well data showed that the depth to the water table increased with distance from the stream channel for those wells closest to the channel depths to water table were around 5 10 m for farther wells 100 s of meters from the channel depths to the water table were around 20 60 m for the most distant wells from the stream nearest the headwaters depths to the water table were between 50 and 100 or more meters this suggests that moisture not consumed by et held in place by upland soils or transported quickly through macropore conduits must travel either vertically downward tens to hundreds of meters through unsaturated unconsolidated material or horizontally hundreds to thousands of meters through the same medium to reach the stream channel these data indicate that the travel time required for water received during precipitation exceeds the three month summer season similar to blumstock et al 2016 and helps to explain the extremely low sps values described herein moreover it is likely that the portions of the watershed immediately adjacent to the stream corridors are the only areas of the basin with travel times less than one year stated differently the majority of the variability in annual discharge for these streams must therefore come from portions of the watershed that produce at least annual runoff it follows that the greatest annual runoff producing areas in utah watersheds would be those that are rather close to stream channels with high snow accumulation high elevation and shallow soils the water table for many wells in utah that are located far from stream channels is often hundreds of meters deep and groundwater in these locations is not typically being recharged by annual snowmelt or other cold season processes for example the depth to water in the humbug well near oakley is approximately 400 m and advertises the water s age to be at least 10 000 years old when utah had a cooler wetter climate that filled many pluvial lakes http www oakleyartesian com the source taken together the preceding discussion of the soil moisture and groundwater levels is provided to reinforce that the farther a water particle is from the stream channel the lower the probability of that water ever becoming streamflow in fact in many cases that water is not likely to percolate farther down than one meter of soil depth the majority of the snowmelt and rainfall in these locations is consumptively used over time by evapotranspiration processes with only a couple exceptions utah snotel sites do not have soil moisture data deeper than 50 cm so we have no information regarding exactly how deeply the zone of saturation extends below that depth when conditions are very wet however the data presented above suggest that water that does infiltrate to such depths is probably not transmitted to streams over short timescales moreover the transition between portions of utah watersheds that provide annual recharge to groundwater where streams are gaining and those where the water table is lower than the stream level losing stream reaches may be higher in the watershed than previously thought in addition to varying over time lambert et al 2011 not only do our data support the concept that relatively small portions of the watersheds contribute to annual flow but these areas may grow or shrink according to antecedent hydrologic conditions blumstock et al 2016 this may explain why for certain utah watersheds such as the bear river forecasts overestimate discharge during below normal water years and conversely tend to underestimate flow after a series of average or above average years of snowpack have occurred 5 conclusions the contribution of summer precipitation to streamflow in the utah watersheds analyzed in this study is extremely low roughly 1 2 of the annual total streamflow for each basin with the exception of the virgin river where summertime precipitation produces around 7 of the annual flow the remaining 98 99 of total annual flow is derived from snowmelt and snowmelt related processes this may actually be a conservative estimate since we attributed all increases during summer months to rainfall and not csp event flow from direct snowmelt during the april july season contributes on average about 71 of total annual flow the remaining discharge is base flow during the remaining eight months of the year and the vast majority of this base flow is also csp in origin summer precipitation contributes little to streamflow in utah rivers as shown from our examination of discharge soil moisture and well data water delivered during the summer season is unlikely to contribute to streamflow during the summer because of 1 the low likelihood for saturation in the soil and 2 the distance required for water to travel to make it to the area streams soil moisture deficits and large depths to groundwater in upland areas also indicate that streamflow typically originates from areas close to the channel or from portions of the watershed that have shallow depths to low permeability e g bedrock or clay layers these findings are generated from high quality snotel data and reflect conditions in mountainous locations we acknowledge that the applicability of these results is best suited for small to medium size watersheds and that complications are inherent with such analysis for large basins e g spatial variations in hydrologic inputs due to larger portions of the watershed at lower elevation and the diminishing representativeness of the snotel data with increasing watershed size the hydrologic budget in utah watersheds varies seasonally and with elevation for many utah watersheds we demonstrate that the water from both rainfall and csp do not simultaneously take part in evapotranspiration infiltration and percolation and overland or quick flow instead for mountainous headwater locations csp inputs predominantly occur in the late spring early summer which drives infiltration into the deeper portions of the soil column percolation to groundwater and runoff to streams later evapotranspiration dominates during warm summer months and the growing season the timing of these patterns shifts earlier in the season with decreasing elevation implications of this research include 1 as many previous studies have concluded that utah snowpacks may be thinning and will continue to get smaller in future years due to climate warming see reviews for utah in julander and clayton 2015 and for global snow resources in strum et al 2017 it is important to be able to quantify the proportion of streamflow that originates during the winter spring versus summer season these data suggest that during low snowpack years a greater amount of the annual precipitation that portion that falls as rain could ultimately not contribute to area streamflow thereby reducing the already small sps contribution water managers can use the proportion of streamflow and reservoir recharge that can be expected from snowpacks relative to summer rain as well as recent efforts e g scalzitti et al 2016 to define elevation thresholds below which reductions in snowpack are attributable to warming temperatures and above which variability in precipitation will remain the main driver of snowpack size 2 the location of hydro climatic instrumentation for water supply analyses in utah particularly precipitation runoff relations would be best suited in areas proximal to stream channels where runoff is produced similarly hydrologic modeling of utah watersheds should focus on small water producing areas rather than the average of the entire watershed as the movement of water to deep storage changes from year to year and by location in the watershed large portions of the watersheds may not contribute to streamflow either directly or through base flow 3 water managers interested in improving water yield from utah watersheds by increasing the snow catch e g by forest thinning snow fencing etc may have limited success outside those areas immediately adjacent to stream channels as noted by loik et al 2004 until quite recently there were an insufficient number of long term soil moisture datasets in the western u s to explore these relationships in 2016 the period of record editing and quality control was completed for the hourly soil moisture and temperature data for all snotel sites in utah for most sites the sensors were installed between 2002 and 2006 although a couple sites have data

8512,study region the state of utah western usa study focus analysis of annual hydrographs from most rivers in the western u s suggests that snowmelt provides the majority of streamflow in these areas in this study we attempt to quantify what proportion of utah s streamflow comes from cold season processes previous estimates have ranged from around 60 80 of total annual streamflow with uncertainty stemming from complexities related to rain on snow events the geographic and temporal distribution of precipitation events and the partitioning of rainfall snowmelt into streamflow new hydrological insights the proportion of streamflow in the western u s that is snowmelt in origin is well understood to be quite high but has rarely been explicitly quantified our data indicate that 98 99 of streamflow in utah watersheds originates from melting snow and associated processes the contribution of summer month precipitation to annual streamflow in utah is extraordinarily low typically 1 2 using soil moisture and well depth data we also demonstrate that vast areas of utah watersheds are incapable of producing event flow from summer precipitation due to consumptive losses from evapotranspiration and other factors this analysis is likely representative of areas within other western states that have cool continental climates abundant snowfall long duration snowpacks meaning that substantial portions of the snowpack do not typically melt during the winter and sedimentary bedrock keywords snowmelt streamflow utah soil moisture snotel cold season processes 1 introduction the importance of snow as a resource for states in the western u s would be hard to overstate strum et al 2017 most rivers that drain mountainous terrain in the western u s have hydrographs that are strongly driven by snowmelt processes in fig 1 the average daily streamflow of the multiple watersheds in utah exhibits a pattern ubiquitous to many western watersheds the beginning of snowmelt in april produces the annual rise in flow which typically continues until around late july at which time streamflow returns to base flow conditions snowmelt driven hydrographs tend to have unimodal peak discharge with modest increases and decreases in flow rates and very little variation in discharge outside the snowmelt runoff period as shown in fig 1 the period of the streamflow hydrographs from august to april is remarkably steady suggesting that whatever precipitation falls during this period does not typically manifest in substantial increases in streamflow with the exception of the virgin river discussed later this raises the issue of quantifying what percent of water flowing in typical western streams is generated from snowmelt versus rainfall the proportion of streamflow in the western u s that is snowmelt in origin is well understood to be quite high but has rarely been explicitly quantified li et al 2017 previous estimates range from 60 85 or most for mountainous areas in the west e g campbell et al 1995 lins 1997 serreze et al 1999 pederson et al 2011 li et al 2015 strum et al 2017 see additional details in li et al 2017 table 1 though some researchers have cited a slightly lower range e g 40 70 value given in maurer and bowling 2014 in an analysis that spanned the western u s li et al 2017 concluded that roughly 50 of all runoff in the region began as snowmelt that proportion was much higher 70 for mountainous areas in utah the estimates have ranged from 80 to close to 100 barnett et al 2005 however the majority of these estimates are rough guesses instead of exact proportions based on regional factors even with widespread high quality point data from high altitude weather stations nrcs snow telemetry network snotel the exact proportion of streamflow that stems from a basin s snowmelt is problematic to derive in any given year due to the complexities of temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation across the watershed the proportion of precipitation that falls as rain versus snow kormos et al 2014 subsequent redistribution of snow heterogeneities in soil types depths and antecedent water content spatial and temporal variations in snowmelt rates and other factors in addition some distinctions may be semantic for example a rain on snow event midwinter that did not generate melt water is not relevant to streamflow and effectively becomes part of the watershed s snow water equivalent swe until the entire snowpack begins to melt during the spring melt season as such we elected to sidestep this issue by 1 quantifying the contribution of summer precipitation to annual streamflow and 2 lumping all of the hydrological phenomena associated with snow water accumulation and snowmelt such as warming rain on snow rain on the watershed but not on snow etc together as one category called cold season processes csp a similar approach to this seasonal partitioning of precipitation was used by stage 1957 who found that 98 of the flow originated as winter precipitation for benton creek within the priest river experimental forest idaho similarly yenko 2003 found that close to 100 of the water contributing to streamflow in a small idaho watershed could be accounted for by cold season precipitation occurring in the basin williams and ehleringer 1996 stated that only around 18 25 of the annual precipitation in northern utah was received during summer months understanding how much streamflow is derived from summer precipitation can therefore be used to derive how much annual flow comes from snow and snow related processes in this study we estimate the relative contribution of summer precipitation versus csp in the annual discharge of utah rivers in addition we examine herein the source area of streamflow in utah watersheds and demonstrate that the vast majority of flow comes from areas proximal to the channel or from areas that have a short distance to an impermeable layer such as bedrock while soil moisture observed at snotel sites has been shown to contribute to annual streamflow for utah watersheds clayton 2016 harpold et al 2017 we note that higher elevations with shallow soils and high permeability are the most substantial streamflow contribution areas watershed areas that have deeper soils with finer textures and are distal to the channel contribute little or no flow on an annual basis 2 methods this study makes use of the snotel snowpack telemetry data network maintained by the nrcs there are more than 800 automated snotel weather stations in remote high elevation mountainous locations in the western u s data are available from https www wcc nrcs usda gov snow there are roughly 130 snotel sites in utah and each is equipped with sensors to measure snow water equivalent accumulated precipitation 0 1 inch resolution snow depth 1 inch resolution air temperature 0 1 c resolution soil moisture 0 1 percent volumetric water content resolution and soil temperature 0 1 c resolution hourly data are telemetered to a data collection office and quality controlled most snotel sites in utah were installed in the late 1970s to mid 1980s and therefore have a reliably long period of record to evaluate trends and weather extremes additional details about the snotel data network can be obtained from https www wcc nrcs usda gov about mon automate html as well as from serreze et al 1999 salzmann and mearns 2012 and numerous other publications for this analysis summer precipitation streamflow sps is defined as event flow during the summer months meaning that there has been a non negligible response increase in the stream s hydrograph this occurs from when the annual snowmelt hydrograph approaches base flow and snotel sites have melted out to that time in the fall when precipitation is recorded as snowfall at representative snotel sites within the watershed we distinguished sps events during early summer as occurring subsequent to the time at which the recessional portion of the annual snowmelt hydrograph was 25 higher than its summer base flow level the overall time period in any given year is therefore variable depending on the length of the snowmelt season and the arrival of snowfall later in the year this delineation works well in utah as june july are typically the driest months of the year resulting in the occurrence of relatively few precipitation events concurrent with the declining limb of the snowmelt hydrograph in the fall and early winter as rainfall changes to snowfall the number of storms producing discernible increases in streamflow declines dramatically until there are none we used this definition of sps to quantify all flows not related to csp for rivers and streams throughout utah for the period of 1981 2011 we allowed this delineation to be subjective meaning that we based our definition of a non negligible increase in the hydrograph upon our hydrological expertise rather than assigning a threshold value in order to afford flexibility and to draw on professional experience with precipitation data in the region we started by using an algorithm to identify precipitation events in the watershed in the daily snotel precipitation data we then attempted to identify corresponding increases in daily usgs streamflow data at the locations provided in table 1 the increase in flow was calculated by taking that amount of flow where the hydrograph first increased until it receded to its original level in general streamflow duration and magnitude responses varied in proportion with the magnitude and duration of the precipitation event we also identified some spikes increases in discharge that were not associated with a precipitation event it is likely that these responses were associated with precipitation events that were not observed at the various snotel sites in the basin either because of the localized nature of the event or because the precipitation occurred at lower elevation these hydrograph events were not removed but instead were included as sps in the watershed total in order to provide a conservative estimate of the portion of the annual discharge that did not originate as sps though some degree of subjectivity in this approach was unavoidable we took care to apply this methodology consistently for all watersheds in the study the volume of water attributed to each sps event was then determined by totaling all flows from the initial streamflow increase over its base flow to the point when the flow had declined back to the previous base flow level we omitted fluctuations in base flow if they oscillated above and below steady levels as these are interpreted to be due to sensor error or diurnal patterns however all non zero increases in discharge indicative of a stream response were included even if no associated precipitation was captured at snotel sites in the basin sps events were summed to obtain an annual total which was then compared to the total flow for that year for each stream this approach is similar to the effort by stage 1957 to quantify winter precipitation in another snow dominated basin in the western u s streamflow discharge data was obtained from u s geological survey gaging stations these span all major and most minor watersheds in the state table 1 gaging stations with significant upstream controls e g diversions were generally excluded from the analysis but we retained a few that have minor upstream flow regulation but also have sufficient unimpaired areas to allow the streamflow to reflect both rainfall and csp generated streamflow these sites represent a huge diversity in soils vegetation aspect geology and topography such as the high elevation metamorphic bedrock of the uinta mountains the sandstone slick rock of the virgin river headwaters and the dense clay soils overlying limestone bedrock of the wasatch plateau in addition period of record soil moisture data for utah were analyzed for all 130 snotel sites in the state to determine how frequently these soils were saturated and capable of producing sps saturation was defined as the maximum observed volumetric water content for a particular sensor depth excluding unrealistically high values and was specific to each site and sensor depth the only sites that were excluded from this analysis were five locations buck pasture burts miller ranch ef blacks fk buck flat and spirit lake where the soil moisture data are collected in a permanently wet environment and do not reflect watershed conditions finally well log data from the state of utah division of water rights http www waterrights utah gov were used to determine the overall depth to the surface of the water table including both those that were located near adjacent to streams and more distant locations close to watershed divides these data were obtained in order to determine the potential for subsurface water to contribute to observed variations in sps 3 results in fig 2 the percent of april july flow is compared with streamflow for the remaining eight months of the year for 17 major rivers in utah the average percentage of april july flow of the annual total flow for these watersheds across utah is 75 conversely only 25 of the annual flow occurs during the remainder of the year fig 2 in general the proportion of annual flow that occurs from april july was greater for higher elevation watersheds such as the bear and weber rivers than for lower elevation watersheds such as blacksmiths fork however a couple exceptions were manti creek and fish creek two mid elevation watersheds that receive more than 80 of their total annual flow between april and july this may be due to the thick clayey soils sedimentary geology and comparatively modest relief of the wasatch plateau where these watersheds are located that together augment water retention i e minimize runoff generation in the basin during summer months these proportions suggest that csp constitutes the dominant input in these basins supply and given that these rivers have hydrographs similar to fig 1 implies that the august april flow is predominantly base flow with minimal input from sps events we explore this possibility below by examining the average percent of annual streamflow that was contributed by sps events in each watershed fig 3 total average annual streamflow from sps events ranged from about 0 5 to about 2 for utah rivers except for the virgin river where sps contributed to about 7 of annual flow differences in basin characteristics provide some explanation for the higher sps contribution for the virgin river including a large proportion of the basin is impervious rock primarily sandstone with cliffs and exposed bedrock close to the stream channel soils are very coarse sandy textures from the sandstone parent material allowing little water retention the watershed is in the southwestern corner of the state and is more susceptible to high intensity convective precipitation during the summer monsoon and the watershed area is larger than the other basins included in this study these effects are manifest in both the substantial amount of sps and the trend of increasing base flow during the summer fall months that is evident in fig 1 for the virgin river conversely given the generally lower elevations and warmer climate of the virgin river basin relative to the others considered here there is a comparatively large proportion of the watershed that may receive winter rain outside of below the snow accumulation zone which would have the effect of overestimating the csp contribution to annual flow so the 7 sps value presented above may be an underestimation every basin had years where there was very little streamflow response to sps with as low as around 0 02 of the annual total flow for the majority of basins and 0 87 for the virgin river conversely the maximum sps varied regionally ranging from 4 to 5 for northern utah basins to between 0 75 and 1 25 for central utah streams particularly for those streams draining the wasatch plateau fish creek and manti creek the maximum annual sps contribution to overall flow was much higher for the virgin at around 19 22 for the base flow portion of the overall flow roughly 20 25 of the annual discharge volume as noted above we acknowledge the challenge and uncertainty inherent in attempting to discern sources of water that are integrated into a single base flow discharge value lacking tracer or other diagnostic data there is no way to know what exact proportion of csp versus rainfall comprises the base flow portion of the hydrograph however teleconnections in utah watersheds described in clayton 2016 between declining soil moisture values subsequent to snowmelt driven peaks and the transition from event flow to base flow in downstream channels strongly support the idea that base flow levels are established by the magnitude of the snowmelt and do not vary significantly until the following spring as shown in fig 1 for all basins except the virgin while it is possible or even likely that rainfall adds some water to area streams as base flow we argue in subsequent sections related to soil moisture and groundwater that conditions in the basins during summer tend to promote losses to evapotranspiration rather than additions to streamflow moreover during the summer months soil moisture values over the measured profile tend to decrease these typically rebound during fall months as evapotranspiration declines some moisture remains in the upper 50 cm soil profile some of which is likely from summer precipitation particularly for the upper 20 cm however since summer precipitation is less likely to reach the 50 cm sensor see details below much of the water content at that depth is probably residual from csp residual soil moisture during fall months eventually contributes to streamflow during the next snowmelt runoff period harpold et al 2017 the exact contribution of residual soil moisture to the following year s runoff is complicated by the following factors 1 the proportion of volumetric water content in the soil column that is derived from summer rainfall versus csp is unknown 2 the portion of the watershed that contributes to streamflow varies seasonally and may or may not be well represented by observations of soil moisture at nearby snotel sites 3 converting the volumetric water content observed at soil moisture monitoring sites to a depth of water requires dimensionalizing over the depth of the soil column but the depth of soils in the area are variable and change spatially 4 we lack instrumentation to quantify residual soil moisture in the portions of these watersheds directly adjacent to the streams as snotel sites are generally located in upland settings and 5 we lack information regarding how much residual soil moisture will be lost to continuing evapotranspiration and other processes we therefore deduce that csp contributes 98 99 of the average annual flow to utah streams in most regions except for the virgin river watershed this estimate comes from the fractionation of csp versus sps described above showing that for most areas in the state sps ranges between roughly 1 and 2 assuming that all water inputs to utah streams are accounted for we will explore this assumption in greater detail below we therefore assert that the remaining 98 99 of flow observed as stream discharge comes from csp 4 discussion regional differences in summer precipitation are fairly minor between northern and central utah watersheds around 12 15 centimeters for both areas so differences in runoff production are most likely attributable to other factors for example the central utah basins draining the wasatch plateau have clay rich thick soils and comparatively modest relief which improves their capacity to retain rainfall however for southern utah particularly the virgin watershed high intensity precipitation over small areas and short time periods produces overland flow leading to higher sps values still the exceptionally minimal streamflow response to summer rainfall for most basins in utah implies that snowmelt and snowmelt related processes such as rain on snow supply the remainder of water available to supply the annual streamflow generally in the range of 98 99 of the average annual total flow as noted in fig 4 summer precipitation constitutes between 15 and 25 of the annual total precipitation across utah watersheds with an average of 20 reflecting an aspect of the climatology of the state summers are typically drier than winters however the 20 of the annual total precipitation that is received during the summer months generates just 1 6 of the annual streamflow fig 3 indicating that the runoff efficiency during the summer is substantially lower than that of other seasons this stems from comparatively small precipitation amounts relative to high evapotranspiration from warm temperatures and active vegetation that combine to produce a substantial soil moisture deficit during summer months soils across a large portion of the watershed except for a narrow band along stream corridors are sufficiently dry to infiltrate and retain nearly all of the summer precipitation that falls the vast majority of this precipitation is subsequently consumed by the watershed s vegetation and from evaporation to examine this point further we examined regression coefficients between summer precipitation amounts and sps values per year for each site the resulting r2 values were very low from 0 00 for the manti basin to 0 36 for the sevier basin we also note that poor statistical relations exist between sps and watershed area which is probably due to the typical utah basin characteristics described above moreover we examine in subsequent analysis below the possibility that small areas within utah watersheds disproportionately contribute to their stream s annual flow and that the vast majority of this water is derived from csp as all snotel sites in utah are equipped with soil moisture sensors we explored the low runoff efficiencies discussed above from an examination of typical annual soil moisture patterns in these basins soil moisture at the garden city snotel site fig 5 depicts a common pattern at many sites across utah volumetric soil moisture increases during the spring season when snowmelt begins and soils become saturated or nearly so for a couple of months at the end of the snowmelt influx soils rapidly dry the rate of which decreases with depth in the soil column clayton 2016 midsummer soil moisture values are quite low until a resurgence of soil moisture in the fall as temperatures and transpiration rates decrease and occasional large magnitude precipitation events increase soil moisture percentages as rainfall changes to snow soil moisture decreases and then stabilizes through the winter months in fig 5 there are several summer precipitation events where the 5 cm soil moisture sensor increases substantially note that this moisture does not reach the 20 and 50 cm sensors as they continue to slowly dry it is common that summer precipitation will induce a response in the 5 cm sensor far less frequently at the 20 cm sensor and occasionally at the 50 cm sensor though these responses at the deeper sensors are much less in magnitude and duration compared to the runoff producing season and not nearly sufficient to bring soils to a state of saturation capable of producing runoff moisture that reaches the 50 cm sensor has a short residence time before being consumed either through transpiration or deeper percolation and results shown in fig 3 suggest that little if any of this moisture makes it to streams as base flow or that the residence time of the water from these precipitation events exceeds the three month summer season most summer season precipitation is consumed in shallow portions of the soil profile and is not detectible at the 20 cm soil moisture sensor much less the 50 cm sensor substantial runoff generation is only plausible when soils are saturated or near saturated which typically only occurs during the snowmelt season stage 1957 thus streamflow generated by summer precipitation sps is most likely to occur from precipitation falling directly on near the wetted stream perimeter or from very high intensity precipitation events that exceed infiltration capacity thereby generating some overland flow we also examined elevation controls on the percent of summertime days july september that soils reached saturation when all three soil moisture sensors 5 cm 20 cm and 50 cm attain their saturated values considering all 130 snotel sites in utah above around 2900 m elevation 9500 feet soils are saturated only around 0 8 of the time between july 1 and september 30 the vast majority of which is during years when snowmelt is still active in july below 2900 m elevation soils are almost never saturated in the summer months 0 01 of the time and thus have the capacity to infiltrate most precipitation moisture in order to produce substantial runoff soils must either be saturated or experience precipitation rates that exceed infiltration capacity which is particularly rare where soil textures are coarse e g with sandstone parent material the lightning ridge snotel site in utah has additional one meter depth soil moisture sensors at three different sampling environments 1 in an open meadow 2 in an aspen stand and 3 in a conifer stand these have been used previously to compare vegetative impacts on soil moisture burke and kasahara 2011 here the effect of vegetation type on soil moisture thresholds is examined where differences between other factors e g precipitation inputs soil parent material etc are minimal fig 6 shows the percent of the time that soils are either saturated or at permanent wilting point pwp under three different vegetation types at the lightning ridge site at one meter depth soils are saturated under the meadow about 4 of the time in the aspen setting about 3 of the time and almost never underneath coniferous tree cover note that times when soils are saturated at these settings are almost exclusively during the snowmelt season and not during summer months conversely assuming that pwp is at 10 volumetric soil moisture for all three locations based on graphical analysis of the period of record data soils that underlie the meadow aspen and conifer vegetation reach pwp around 33 1 and 63 of the time respectively these data suggest that soils that underlie meadow and coniferous forest frequently have strong soil moisture deficits and are not likely to produce runoff except during the snowmelt season however this is less clear for soils underlying aspen forest a nearby snotel site usu doc daniel also has a soil moisture sensor at the one meter depth in addition to the standard sensors at 5 20 and 50 cm depths soils are saturated at one meter depth at the usu doc daniels snotel site around 45 of the time and nearly saturated at or above 90 saturation more than 80 of the time however the 50 cm sensor shows the pattern described above fig 5 of saturation during snowmelt and subsequent drying due to evapotranspiration these data indicate that a low permeability layer exists between 50 and 100 cm in this case due to a heavy clay layer in the soil that reduces vertical water movement and thus increases the potential for runoff site specific differences in pedogenic factors vegetation bedrock type soil thickness or other variables will impact the soil saturation threshold at any given location moreover water delivered to utah basins from snowfall is redistributed during winter months reflecting dominant wind patterns which does not necessarily coincide with spatial patterns in soil saturation and pwp thresholds williams et al 2009 fig 7 a shows the ratio of average april 1st peak snowpack snow water equivalent swe to soil saturation where the percent volumetric values are converted to a depth over one meter soil column thickness for all snotel sites in utah ratios of the maximum b and minimum c april 1st swe relative to soil saturation at these sites are also presented to explore regional differences in the capacity for soils to infiltrate snow water during melt for a range of water year conditions fig 7a shows each snotel site s theoretical ability to saturate one meter of soil depth if the average swe observed on april 1st was infiltrated as one continuous input there are around 40 stations which under average snowpack conditions do not have sufficient swe to bring 1 m of soil to saturation shown by the red orange and yellow circles in fig 7b nearly all sites are not only able to saturate the soil but many of them have sufficient excess water to fill the soil s pore spaces several times over dark blue circles alternatively as shown in fig 7c during extremely dry water years only a few sites in utah are theoretically able to saturate one meter of soil green circles these results are similar to those described in miller et al 2014 who used chemical tracer data to show that deep regional subsurface flow does not represent a major source of base flow during normal snowpack years for the upper colorado river basin and that overland flow and local shallow subsurface flow constitute the majority of annual discharge regional trends shown in fig 7 are more reflective of broad geologic soil character differences than spatial variations in precipitation snowfall similar to fig 9 in rumsey et al 2015 as snotel sites are usually located in uplands headwater locations far from stream corridors these data support the idea that there are large portions of utah watersheds that do not contribute substantial quantities of water to streamflow discharge on an annual or shorter basis we explored this point further by using well log data from the utah division of water rights https www waterrights utah gov to obtain the distance from the ground surface to the water table prior to any pumping artificial drawdown table 2 the data were available for wells that were located at various cabins and summer homes in several northern utah watersheds including the closest stream elevation weber river 2347 m and 2408 m bear river 2530 m ogden river 1951 m provo river 2073 m and dry fork creek 2134 m well data were selected for three regions in each watershed adjacent or close to the stream intermediate distance from the stream in a direction perpendicular to the channel and in the headwaters although data quality varied see details in link provided the well data showed that the depth to the water table increased with distance from the stream channel for those wells closest to the channel depths to water table were around 5 10 m for farther wells 100 s of meters from the channel depths to the water table were around 20 60 m for the most distant wells from the stream nearest the headwaters depths to the water table were between 50 and 100 or more meters this suggests that moisture not consumed by et held in place by upland soils or transported quickly through macropore conduits must travel either vertically downward tens to hundreds of meters through unsaturated unconsolidated material or horizontally hundreds to thousands of meters through the same medium to reach the stream channel these data indicate that the travel time required for water received during precipitation exceeds the three month summer season similar to blumstock et al 2016 and helps to explain the extremely low sps values described herein moreover it is likely that the portions of the watershed immediately adjacent to the stream corridors are the only areas of the basin with travel times less than one year stated differently the majority of the variability in annual discharge for these streams must therefore come from portions of the watershed that produce at least annual runoff it follows that the greatest annual runoff producing areas in utah watersheds would be those that are rather close to stream channels with high snow accumulation high elevation and shallow soils the water table for many wells in utah that are located far from stream channels is often hundreds of meters deep and groundwater in these locations is not typically being recharged by annual snowmelt or other cold season processes for example the depth to water in the humbug well near oakley is approximately 400 m and advertises the water s age to be at least 10 000 years old when utah had a cooler wetter climate that filled many pluvial lakes http www oakleyartesian com the source taken together the preceding discussion of the soil moisture and groundwater levels is provided to reinforce that the farther a water particle is from the stream channel the lower the probability of that water ever becoming streamflow in fact in many cases that water is not likely to percolate farther down than one meter of soil depth the majority of the snowmelt and rainfall in these locations is consumptively used over time by evapotranspiration processes with only a couple exceptions utah snotel sites do not have soil moisture data deeper than 50 cm so we have no information regarding exactly how deeply the zone of saturation extends below that depth when conditions are very wet however the data presented above suggest that water that does infiltrate to such depths is probably not transmitted to streams over short timescales moreover the transition between portions of utah watersheds that provide annual recharge to groundwater where streams are gaining and those where the water table is lower than the stream level losing stream reaches may be higher in the watershed than previously thought in addition to varying over time lambert et al 2011 not only do our data support the concept that relatively small portions of the watersheds contribute to annual flow but these areas may grow or shrink according to antecedent hydrologic conditions blumstock et al 2016 this may explain why for certain utah watersheds such as the bear river forecasts overestimate discharge during below normal water years and conversely tend to underestimate flow after a series of average or above average years of snowpack have occurred 5 conclusions the contribution of summer precipitation to streamflow in the utah watersheds analyzed in this study is extremely low roughly 1 2 of the annual total streamflow for each basin with the exception of the virgin river where summertime precipitation produces around 7 of the annual flow the remaining 98 99 of total annual flow is derived from snowmelt and snowmelt related processes this may actually be a conservative estimate since we attributed all increases during summer months to rainfall and not csp event flow from direct snowmelt during the april july season contributes on average about 71 of total annual flow the remaining discharge is base flow during the remaining eight months of the year and the vast majority of this base flow is also csp in origin summer precipitation contributes little to streamflow in utah rivers as shown from our examination of discharge soil moisture and well data water delivered during the summer season is unlikely to contribute to streamflow during the summer because of 1 the low likelihood for saturation in the soil and 2 the distance required for water to travel to make it to the area streams soil moisture deficits and large depths to groundwater in upland areas also indicate that streamflow typically originates from areas close to the channel or from portions of the watershed that have shallow depths to low permeability e g bedrock or clay layers these findings are generated from high quality snotel data and reflect conditions in mountainous locations we acknowledge that the applicability of these results is best suited for small to medium size watersheds and that complications are inherent with such analysis for large basins e g spatial variations in hydrologic inputs due to larger portions of the watershed at lower elevation and the diminishing representativeness of the snotel data with increasing watershed size the hydrologic budget in utah watersheds varies seasonally and with elevation for many utah watersheds we demonstrate that the water from both rainfall and csp do not simultaneously take part in evapotranspiration infiltration and percolation and overland or quick flow instead for mountainous headwater locations csp inputs predominantly occur in the late spring early summer which drives infiltration into the deeper portions of the soil column percolation to groundwater and runoff to streams later evapotranspiration dominates during warm summer months and the growing season the timing of these patterns shifts earlier in the season with decreasing elevation implications of this research include 1 as many previous studies have concluded that utah snowpacks may be thinning and will continue to get smaller in future years due to climate warming see reviews for utah in julander and clayton 2015 and for global snow resources in strum et al 2017 it is important to be able to quantify the proportion of streamflow that originates during the winter spring versus summer season these data suggest that during low snowpack years a greater amount of the annual precipitation that portion that falls as rain could ultimately not contribute to area streamflow thereby reducing the already small sps contribution water managers can use the proportion of streamflow and reservoir recharge that can be expected from snowpacks relative to summer rain as well as recent efforts e g scalzitti et al 2016 to define elevation thresholds below which reductions in snowpack are attributable to warming temperatures and above which variability in precipitation will remain the main driver of snowpack size 2 the location of hydro climatic instrumentation for water supply analyses in utah particularly precipitation runoff relations would be best suited in areas proximal to stream channels where runoff is produced similarly hydrologic modeling of utah watersheds should focus on small water producing areas rather than the average of the entire watershed as the movement of water to deep storage changes

8513,study region this study was conducted within a 100 000 km2 area of british columbia b c canada including vancouver island the georgia basin and the pacific and kitimat mountain ranges rising from the pacific ocean study focus a stable isotope mass balance method is applied to estimate evaporation loss and water yield from a remote network of 560 lakes on vancouver island and coastal b c based on helicopter sampling surveys conducted between 2008 and 2015 spatial patterns in derived hydrological parameters are compared to water quality indicators and watershed characteristics to provide insight into water quantity and water quality relationships in the region to be incorporated within a future critical loads assessment new hydrological insights for the region regional trends in lake water balance underlying physical drivers and geochemical processes potentially influencing critical loads of acidity are described dominant non anthropogenic regional drivers of geochemistry include sea spray lithology weathering and elevation significant contrast is noted in alkalinity between the sedimentary and volcanic substrates on vancouver island and igneous intrusive substrates of the pacific and kitimat ranges a positive correlation is found between elevation and water yield to lakes while the opposite is observed for rivers which is interpreted to reflect disconnection of low elevation lakes from regional drainage networks this may invalidate use of river gauge data for critical loads assessment in this or similar regions keywords stable isotopes geochemistry lakes water yield vancouver island coastal ranges 1 introduction lakes are an important element of the landscape in coastal b c accounting for close to 10 of the land area although relatively few studies have described the hydrology and water quality of these lakes while a limited number of local studies have been conducted to characterize specific lakes and water supply reservoirs on southern vancouver island nowlin et al 2004 werner et al 2015 and selected lake types such as proglacial lakes richards et al 2012 fjord type lakes petticrew et al 2015 or sub alpine lakes dunnington et al 2016 no studies have previously investigated regional patterns in lake water balance parameters across the region in fact most hydrological interest in b c has been focused on the okanagan valley due to water scarcity in this region see wassenaar et al 2011 while many areas of coastal b c are still considered pristine and undeveloped dominance of base poor geologies with poor weathering capacity and potential for rapid growth in emissions due to expansion of shipping industry and urbanization in the south coastal mainland indicate that soils and lakes in some areas may be at risk of acidification mongeon et al 2010 here we report on a systematic survey of lakes in coastal b c designed to provide a regional assessment of critical loads of acidity to lakes as part of canada s national acid rain program acid sensitivity studies within the program have mainly focused on eastern canada over the past several decades largely owing to proximity to emissions from intensive industrial activity in eastern canada and the united states only a few studies have been carried out recently in western canada jeffries et al 2010 in a national assessment preceding initiation of this study jeffries et al 2005 concluded that the information available for evaluating the regional acidification status of lakes in many parts of western canada was too old too sparse or too unrepresentative to permit meaningful analysis and new and representative surveys were recommended as a result new surveys were initiated in alberta saskatchewan and manitoba see gibson et al 2010a b jeffries et al 2010 an additional study was initiated in coastal b c an area potentially sensitive to local marine and transboundary acidifying emissions environment canada and u s environmental protection agency 2014 the purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to the b c survey results describing some of the major regional hydrologic patterns across the region and their relation to climatic and physical characteristics of the selected lakes and watersheds and the lake water geochemistry the hydrologic assessment applies an isotope mass balance approach relying on measurement of the stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h in lakewater which has been previously tested across other regions of canada and the us gibson et al 2010a b gibson et al 2017 brooks et al 2014 the stable isotopes which are contained within the water molecule are used to estimate water yield to the lakes based on a steady state isotope mass balance model gibson et al 2015a and provide a new perspective of hydrologic variability of a large number of lakes and contributing watersheds that have not previously been studied in detail in addition this study provides an initial evaluation of the main drivers of water chemistry of the lakes including physical characteristics of the watersheds and water balance parameters this analysis will underpin an assessment of critical loads of acidity for lakes in the region using the henriksen et al 2002 model and isotope based estimates of water yield 1 1 study area the study area lies in coastal b c between 48 n and 58 n and 124 w and 138 w including vancouver island and coastal regions of b c between the alaska state border to the north and the washington state border to the south 560 lakes were sampled in total fig 1 ranging in size from less than 0 1 124 km2 situated at elevations ranging from 18 to 2003 m above sea level m a s l the watersheds of the study lakes ranged in size up to 1534 km2 averaging 15 km2 the study area occurs predominantly on the windward westward slopes of the coastal mountains and has a cool mesothermal climate with cool summers and mild winters pojar et al 1991a mean annual temperature ranges from 0 5 to 14 c averaging 9 1 c as interpolated from the gridded north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 precipitation has strong inland and northward gradients ranging from 600 mm in areas of the georgia basin with significant rainshadow effects to 3400 mm in the northernmost areas in the vicinity of prince rupert which is on average among the highest annual rainfall areas of b c relative humidity is variable ranging from 66 to 88 averaging 79 mesinger et al 2006 within the national ecozone classification the study area lies within the pacific maritime ecozone which is dominated by coastal mountains rising steeply from fjords and deep channels lining the coast and with glaciers and snowfields capping the tallest ranges wiken 1986 from the biogeoclimatic classification widely used within b c the area is mainly within the coastal western hemlock zone between sea level and 900 m and predominantly within the mountain hemlock zone in sub alpine areas pojar et al 1987 1991a 1991b steep precipitation and continentality gradients are evident with wetter maritime areas being dominated by western hemlock amabilis fir western redcedar and sitka spruce while drier maritime forests typically contain a substantial component of douglas fir pojar et al 1991a tree growth is progressively poorer with increasing elevation due to a shorter growing season prolonged snow cover and cooler temperatures pojar et al 1991b soils within our study watersheds are 80 podzolic most being humo ferric podzols which with increasing precipitation grade into ferro humic podzols see pojar et al 1991a bedrock along the coastal mountain ranges is dominated by intrusive igneous rocks with occurrence of metamorphic sedimentary and volcanic rocks ultramafic rocks are generally absent in the majority of watersheds sampled vancouver island watersheds are distinct in that bedrock is predominantly comprised of volcanic and sedimentary rocks b c ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations 2017 lakes are important features of the landscape in coastal b c occupying roughly 10 of the land surface in the study region a total of 18 land cover classifications are distinguished in these watersheds including alpine subalpine old forest young forest freshwater and recently logged lands 1 2 surveys and lake selection helicopter surveys to collected lake water were conducted in september october each year between 2008 and 2015 with the exception of 2011 lake selection focused on areas with poorly weatherable bedrock geology where the waterbodies are expected to be particularly sensitive to or already influenced by atmospheric deposition within the study area lake locations surface areas and geographic identifiers were extracted from the b c ministry of environment watershed atlas b c ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations 2017 lake buffering capacity was estimated by overlaying the lake layer and a derived weathering class layer using 1 250 000 digital bedrock geology layers available from the b c ministry of mines and petroleum resources 2005 regional bedrock was divided into five weathering classes wc based on nanus and clow 2004 a wc1 low to no buffering capacity e g granite schist b wc2 moderate buffering capacity e g diorite gneiss c wc3 high buffering capacity e g gabbro basalt d wc4 very high buffering capacity e g amphibolites hornblende and e wc5 extremely high buffering capacity e g marble limestones lakes with more sensitive underlying geologies i e wc1 wc2 wc3 were targeted in the lake selections a stratified random sampling methodology was used to select lakes within this target population lakes were selected from five defined size classes 4 10 ha 10 50 ha 50 100 ha 100 500 ha 500 ha applying a four part selection criteria described previously jeffries et al 2010 overall the number of lakes sampled represented approximately 10 of the population of lakes greater than 4 ha surface area in the study area 2 methods 2 1 water sampling and analysis water samples were 2 l grab samples in pre cleaned plastic bottles taken approximately centre lake from a float equipped bell 206 helicopter using a dipper plunged to 1 m depth 2008 22012 or filled using a small pump submerged to 1 m depth 2013 2015 positions were obtained using a garmin 76s global positioning unit gps lake surface elevation was recorded from the aircraft altimeter and water depth at the sample site was measured using an eagle cuda depth sounder with transducer mounted to the helicopter float surface temperature conductivity and ph were measured in situ using a yellow springs instrument model probe calibrated in the morning before each field day at the conclusion of the flight subsamples were transferred to 30 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for isotopic analysis with the majority of the sample then being selectively filtered and transferred to hdpe bottles for various geochemical analysis by standard methods ccme 2011 inorganic analyses were filtered to 0 45 μm using cellulose acetate filters whereas total nutrients were not filtered samples were kept cool and shipped to laboratories as soon as possible normally within one day in 2008 major ions and nutrients were analyzed at als analytical laboratories in vancouver b c from 2009 to 2015 analyses were conducted at the pacific environmental science centre pesc an environment canada laboratory in north vancouver b c hold time prior to analyses was typically several days stable isotopes 16o 18o and 2h 1h were analyzed either at the environmental isotope laboratory university of waterloo waterloo on 2008 or at innotech alberta victoria b c 2009 2015 all water samples were analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry the vast majority using a thermo scientific delta v advantage dual inlet hdevice isotope ratio mass spectrometer in all cases isotopic analyses were made within three months of sample collection results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and normalized to the smow slap scale where slap is standard light arctic precipitation see coplen 1996 analytical uncertainty is estimated to be better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h dissolved major cations and anions were determined by ion chromatography total nitrate tn and total phosphorus tp were measured by flow injection analysis in 2008 dissolved organic carbon doc was quantified by combustion of 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes while in 2009 2015 doc was calculated as the difference between dissolved carbon dc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic measured by combustion alkalinity was determined by gran titration quality assurance and quality control qa qc measures included blank and field duplicate sample submissions a total of 223 water samples were collected as duplicates and for qa qc purposes specifically to establish the uncertainty associated with using a one time sampling strategy incoming analytical data were assessed using concordance of duplicate results and for dissolved ions charge balances 2 2 isotope mass balance hydrology of each lake was characterized using an isotope mass balance imb model developed under the assumption of a well mixed water body and steady state conditions which has been demonstrated previously for shallow lakes in northern canada gibson et al 2002 2010a b 2015a 2017 bennett et al 2008 the imb is used to estimate evaporation inflow based on the isotopic offset between lake water and precipitation input then precipitation evaporation and relative humidity estimates are extracted for each site based on a gridded climate dataset and lake and watershed area estimates are incorporated to constrain the ungauged inflow to the lake and resulting outflows the annual water and isotope balances for a well mixed lake in isotopic and hydrologic steady state can be written respectively as 1 i q e m 3 yr 1 2 iδ i qδ q eδ e m 3 yr 1 where i q and e are lake inflow discharge and evaporation rates m 3 yr 1 and δ i δ q and δ e are the isotopic compositions of inflow discharge and evaporation fluxes respectively note that i p r where p is precipitation on the lake surface and ris ungauged inflow to the lake we can rearrange eq 2 and substitute q i e from eq 1 to yield 3 e i δ i δ q δ e δ q dim e n s i o n l e s s where e i is the evaporation to inflow ratio for well mixed lakes we have often assumed δ q δ l where δ l is isotopic composition of the lake for headwater lakes the isotope composition of inflow is approximated by that of precipitation i e δ i δ p whereas the isotopic composition of lake evaporate δ e is estimated using the craig and gordon 1965 model given by 4 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where h is relative humidity decimal fraction δ a is isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture ε is equilibrium isotopic separation see horita and wesolowski 1994 α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation where ε α 1 and ε k is the kinetic isotopic separation see horita et al 2008 substitution of δ e into eq 3 yields 5 x e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dim e n s i o n l e s s where 6 m h 10 3 ε k ε α 1 h 10 3 ε k dim e n s i o n l e s s and 7 δ h δ a ε k ε α h 10 3 ε k ε α as the inflow to a lake is comprised of precipitation on the lake surface p as well as ungauged inflow r i e i p r we can estimate r for headwater lakes by substitution of eq 5 8 r e x p m 3 y r 1 where e e la and p p la e and p are the annual depth equivalent of evaporation and precipitation m yr 1 and la is the lake area m 2 water yield or the depth equivalent runoff can then be estimated as 9 wy r wa 1000 mm yr 1 where wa is the watershed area for non headwater lakes owing to the fact that many receive a portion of isotopically enriched water from upstream lakes the water yield estimates should be regarded as a lower limit lakes sampled in this survey were not likely influenced significantly by this factor as they were predominantly headwater lakes isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture δ a is estimated by fitting predicted enrichment to the observed local evaporation line based on a partial equilibrium approach see gibson et al 2015a this approach accounts for seasonality observed in evaporation losses to the atmosphere 2 3 climate and watershed parameters climate parameters were obtained from the 32 km resolution north american regional reanalysis narr dataset mesinger et al 2006 monthly climatology based on data from 1979 to 2003 was extracted for the grid cells corresponding to the location of each of the study lakes the parameters extracted were i surface total precipitation mm yr 1 ii 2 m relative humidity iii surface evaporation mm yr 1 and iv 2 m temperature k the evaporation flux weighting approach see gibson et al 2015b was used to weight estimates of relative humidity and temperature so that the water balance calculations were representative of the open water season temperature and precipitation values interpolated from the narr dataset which has been used in numerous isotope based assessments across canada gibson et al 2010a b 2015b 2016 2017 jeffries et al 2010 scott et al 2010 were also compared to that derived from the gridded 800 m resolution prism climatology pacific climate impacts consortium et al 2014 as this dataset has been widely applied by some research groups working in b c overall we found that isotope based estimates of water yield differed by less than 5 on average between the two climate datasets but was most pronounced below 200 mm yr 1 based on this similarity we suggest that either dataset may be used effectively for the purposes of a regional assessment application of the imb model also requires delineation of the watershed areas lake areas and lake elevations for each of the study lakes using the coordinates latitude longitude for each lake watershed area lake area and lake elevation were obtained using digital elevation data in raster format from 1 50 000 canada national topographic series nts map sheets canadian national hydro network data in vector format were obtained from the geobase portal canada natural resources canada 2017 terrain preprocessing to incorporate the vector hydrographic network and to fill small sinks was required before the digital elevation model dem could be used for efficient watershed delineation see jeffries et al 2010 individual watersheds were delineated in the arcgis program using the archydro tools where each watershed was delineated upstream of a lake outlet hydrographic and elevation datasets were used to depict the lake outlet locations in some cases two or more partial watersheds had to be merged together to create a final watershed polygon the planimetric area of both the lake and watershed polygons was calculated in the arcgis program based on the equal area projection 2 4 isotopic parameters monthly precipitation δ18o estimates were obtained for each lake location based on empirically derived global relationships between latitude and elevation bowen and wilkinson 2002 fitted to regional precipitation data from the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation see birks and gibson 2009 the δ2h composition of monthly precipitation was calculated assuming that precipitation would follow the relationship defined by the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 annual averages of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation were amount weighted using monthly precipitation obtained from the narr dataset note that calculations were performed using the long term climatology of all parameters 2 5 correlation and pca analysis we analyzed the relationships between physical and geochemical properties land cover isotopic characteristics and derived water properties to investigate and better understand controlling processes in the lakes and their watersheds a spearman rank order test was used to test correlations as several of the variables were non linearly related or were not normally distributed principal component analysis pca was also applied a technique described in detail by mardia et al 1989 for this study as noted below variables included in the pca included i climate properties ii physical characteristics and land cover iii geochemical properties and iv isotopes and derived hydrologic properties some geological characteristics such as bedrock coverage were not included in the pca due to lack of consistent information in all areas several variables that were highly correlated with others such as δ2h with δ18o were not included as a result 24 variables were used including by class i evaporation flux weighted temperature t fw c evaporation flux weighted relative humidity rh fw precipitation p m m year evaporation e m m year ii elevation ele m a s l watershed area wa km2

and iv lakewater δ18o d18ol v smow evaporation inflow ei 18o and water yield wy mm year note that land cover classes were based on percentages in each watershed and pss was based on the method of wadleigh et al 1994 due to the large range of measurements and variable distributions of selected parameters the compiled database is log transformed and scaled to unit variance prior to the pca analysis the transformation and standardization of raw data is necessary to achieve close to normal distributions and to downweight effects of extreme values in the pca analysis the multi variate analysis leads to multiple principal components that help to understand the variations and relationship of variables the first principal component dim1 a linear combination of the original variables explains the largest amount of variance in the dataset and the second principal component dim2 describes the second largest variation remaining in the dataset when presenting pca results the projection of an individual sample onto the axes defined by principal components dim is termed score whereas the coefficient for each variable in the linear combination is called loading of the variable in the score plot lakes with similar characteristics tend to plot close to each other while lakes with distinct characteristics are expected to be farther apart meanwhile the loading plot is commonly used to examine the relation between variables as highly correlated variables tend to point in the same direction in a loading plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 repeat sampling prior to use in the regional assessment it was important to evaluate whether one time sampling was appropriate to characterize the water balance of most lakes and if so to determine the uncertainty associated with this approach to evaluate this a subset of data was assembled based on 100 lakes sampled on more than one occasion during the course of the study 2008 2015 78 of the lakes were sampled twice 10 lakes were sampled 3 times and the remainder were sampled between 4 and 9 times climatic isotopic and geochemical data and watershed parameters for these lakes were compiled and used to estimate water yield by eq 9 as shown for δ18o and for water yield fig 2 a high degree of autocorrelation was found between the δ18o values obtained from first time and repeat sampling events δ18o r2 0 956 which was also true for wy r2 0 982 results in both cases were found to fall close to the 1 1 line suggesting that there was no systematic bias associated with this approach standard error for estimating δ18o based on one time sampling strategy is found to be 0 23 median value which is close to the analytical uncertainty reported by many labs and only about 2 of the observed range of 12 6 for all lakes while standard error in wy is estimated at 30 mm year median value mean standard error values are higher 0 44 for δ18o and 115 mm year for wy but for wy are significantly impacted by extreme values owing to positively skewed distributions in our judgement repeat sampling results confirm that a one time sampling approach is adequate for evaluating regional trends and can be applied with satisfactory confidence to differentiate lake to lake variations across the region and to meaningfully characterize water balance and evaporation patterns while uncertainty associated with use of the annual steady state method for estimating water balance of individual lakes has been shown to be in the range of 20 30 see gibson et al 2002 jasechko et al 2014 the resulting regional water yield distributions have been shown to be relatively robust and we suggest are useful for capturing the expected range of regional runoff variability for evaluating critical loads gibson et al 2010a b 2017 3 2 climate and watershed characteristics location latitude and longitude of the study lakes is shown to be fairly evenly distributed within the boundaries of the study area fig 3 a b elevation distribution of the study lakes fig 3c is clearly shown to be positively skewed attributed to lakes more frequently being situated in valleys and low lying areas in the landscape distribution of lake area and watershed area is similarly skewed fig 3d e with average lake and watershed areas of 0 9 km2 and 15 km2 respectively however the majority of lakes were less than 0 5 km2 and watersheds less than 10 km2 in area bemrose et al 2009 reported positive skewness in watershed areas for canada s river gauging network although average gauged area for b c stations including both active and discontinued is significantly larger than the dataset reported here 3113 km2 large watersheds in this study which ranged up to 1534 km2 were found to be more commonly situated at lower elevations and a slight increase in both lake size and lake watershed area is noted towards higher elevations histograms illustrating distribution of annual precipitation lake evaporation and surface temperature reveal a wide range of variation across the study region fig 4 a b c respectively with precipitation being distinctly bimodal but evaporation and temperature being unimodal and less systematic note that temperature shown is evaporation flux weighted according to the method of gibson et al 2008 and is therefore representative of conditions when lake evaporation was occurring from both the precipitation and relative humidity datasets fig 4a d a distinct low precipitation low humidity region is evident which corresponds to areas of the georgia basin located inland from the mainland coast which are characterized by a pronounced rain shadow effect associated with the olympic and cascade mountain ranges flux weighted annual temperature for the sites ranges from less than 3 c for some alpine watersheds to 14 c for hyper maritime watersheds this is a slightly narrower range than mean annual temperature as it reflects average conditions when evaporation was occurring 3 3 regional isotopic variations distributions of oxygen 18 and deuterium isotopic composition in precipitation fig 5 c d lake water fig 5a b and atmospheric moisture fig 5d e reveal a wide range in input signatures evaporative enrichment of lake water and atmospheric moisture conditions respectively for the study lakes while isotopic composition of lakes is measured we emphasize that isotopic composition of precipitation is modelled i e based on amount weighted δ18o values interpolated from the cnip network and constrained to fall on the gmwl craig 1961 atmospheric moisture is also modelled using the evaporation flux weighted approach of gibson et al 2008 to reflect conditions when lake evaporation was occurring isotopic characteristics are also illustrated in 2h 18o plots fig 6 relative to precipitation which in our analysis is assumed to be well represented by the gmwl atmospheric moisture is depleted but also falls close to the gmwl while only slight offset from the gmwl is measured in lakes lakes plot along local evaporation lines lels with slopes ranging between 6 52 and 7 28 for individual sampling years table 1 varying spatially mainly according to atmospheric conditions in each specific sampling area overall the average slope of lels is 6 98 and is steeper than observed in previous surveys of lakes in continental regions of canada gibson et al 2010a b 2015b 2017 and the contiguous usa brooks et al 2014 due mainly to consistently higher relative humidity in coastal areas overall offset from the gmwl along lels is also subdued compared to observations made in the aforementioned continental surveys reflecting lower evaporation losses as discussed below 3 4 regional water balance outputs and gradients evaporation inflow is shown to range from 0 to more than 80 although the majority of lakes fall in the range of 0 20 and the median is close to 9 6 evaporation inflow is a sensitive indicator of the partitioning of water between liquid and vapour outflow and as such reveals that lake evaporation is much less important for most watersheds in coastal b c than liquid discharge the latter being predominantly as surface outflow via channelized streams given the shallow soil development and dominance of bedrock in most areas distribution of evaporation inflow is found to be slightly positively skewed fig 4e as noted in previous surveys in northwestern ontario and alberta gibson et al 2015b 2017 water yields for each yearly survey and for the entire dataset reveal positively skewed distributions in all cases fig 7 similar skewness has been observed in previous surveys in continental canada gibson et al 2010a 2010b 2015b 2017 overall water yield was found to range from near zero to 5000 mm yr 1 averaging 656 mm with a standard deviation of 884 mm the median was 277 mm while there are a few lakes with high water yield the results indicate existence of a large population of lakes that have significantly lower water yield than average several of the lakes at higher elevation also appear to have water yield values that exceed mean annual precipitation which may reflect uncertainty in basin areas or other model parameters anomalous precipitation received in some areas during the study year or prior years and or augmentation of runoff by glaciers perennial snowpack or glaciogenic groundwaters the augmentation of runoff sources does not likely explain the higher water yield values predicted in parts of vancouver island with a warmer climate and lower elevation mountains here uncertainty in model parameters such as isotopic composition of precipitation may be more important excessively high water yields in these areas may also indicate heightened sensitivity of the model at high relative humidity which is expected based on previous assessments of the model e g gibson et al 2002 however bemrose et al 2009 also show that water yield based on river gauging may exceed observed precipitation by up to 25 for coastal areas of northern b c so this may be a more general sign of uncertainty in precipitation amounts as well elevation which is also significantly correlated with distance from the coast is found to be a dominant driver of precipitation lake and precipitation isotopic compositions evaporation inflow and water yield across the study region fig 8 for precipitation values for sites between sea level and 500 m are found to span the full range observed across the region 700 3500 mm whereas the upper limit of precipitation amount becomes truncated at 2500 mm at mid range elevations 500 and 1500 m and is in all cases less than 1500 mm at higher elevations above 1500m this is an expression of the classic rainout process for the coastal mountain ranges isotopic composition of precipitation fig 8c is shown to be strongly correlated with elevation which is evidence of the isotope altitude effect dangaard 1964 gat 1996 in this study precipitation was modelled for each sub region each year based on the method of bowen and wilkinson 2002 fitted to regional precipitation data from cnip birks and gibson 2009 this method has been shown to reproduce globally observed gradients in latitude and elevation overall the interpolated model data capture the effect of air masses being transported from the pacific ocean over the coastal b c ranges and the associated removal of moisture from the atmosphere as a result of cooling of air masses and related isotopic fractionation values and ranges in isotopic composition of lake water were also found to be elevation dependent in general high elevation lakes were found to be more depleted in δ18o fig 8b and δ2h not shown higher elevation lakes were typically less evaporated had more depleted input waters including precipitation and precipitation derived surface and groundwater inputs from their catchments and therefore were less isotopically enriched lower elevation lakes had more isotopically depleted precipitation sources and showed a larger range in isotopic composition as water balance factors were evidently more important spatially in determining the isotopic composition of the lakes a unique group of low elevation lakes with depleted δ18o fig 8b are large fjord type lakes suspected of being fed by springs originating at higher elevations evaporation inflow variations with elevation largely mimic the patterns exhibited by isotopic composition of lakes fig 8d evaporation inflow shows a narrow range for high elevation lakes and a larger range for low elevation lakes most probably owing to the greater influence of lake and watershed configuration on surface water storage and evaporation in flatter non alpine areas such patterns have not previously been described for the region while detailed annual water yield estimates have been reported and mapped for the study region from river discharge data bemrose et al 2009 no previous studies have specifically focused on characterizing water yield to lakes we note that water yield based on 1971 2000 river discharge measurements ranges between 1000 to 4300 mm yr 1 for our study region and evidently increases towards low elevation hyper maritime coastal areas where rainfall is highest in contrast our dataset clearly shows a significant positive correlation between elevation and water yield to lakes log transformed with an r value close to 0 518 p 0 001 we postulate that this may be due to greater potential for disconnection between lakes and rivers in low lying areas with lower slope and better connectivity between lakes and rivers in steeper higher elevation areas rivers are commonly observed to originate from lakes often proglacial lakes at higher elevations while beyond the scope of this article a systematic analysis of specific watershed configurations would be of value for verifying this preliminary assessment we also note from our dataset that evaporation flux weighted temperature is negatively correlated with elevation but does not appear to be a dominant driver of the derived water balance parameters 3 5 drivers of water balance and water quality we further investigated the relationships between physical and geochemical properties land cover isotopic characteristics and derived water properties to investigate and better understand controlling processes in the lakes and their watersheds a spearman rank order test was used to test correlations as several of the variables were non linearly related or were not normally distributed a colour coded matrix illustrates the strength and direction of correlation between significantly related variables fig 9 note that numerous relationships 276 are tested in this exercise with significance assessed using an adjusted p value of 0 00005 with the bonferroni correction applied summarizing the apparent physical drivers of water balance we note that ei 18o e i is positively correlated with p and rh fw as well as old forest but negatively correlated with ele and sub alpine alpine and sub apline were highly correlated and so show similar patterns water yield wylog10 is positively correlated with ele e m lawar and f water and negatively correlated with p rh fw old forest and wa for the multi year survey raw isotopic data d18ol are positively correlated with evaporation inflow and negatively correlated with water yield overall it appears that as distance from the coast and elevation increase lakes tend to receive proportionately greater runoff from their watersheds and the amount and variability of water loss by evaporation e i is reduced in contrast coastal areas with lower elevations tend to have a wider range in e i and increased evaporation losses based on the correlation analysis it appears that vegetation is only a minor water balance differentiator across this biogeoclimatic region a weaker relationship evident in the dataset is for increase in f water and la and reduced wa with increased proportions of alpine and sub alpine land covers thereby producing an increase in lawar although it is not clear at the present time whether this bias is reflective of shifts in lake population across the region or how this may affect the regional water balance trends several interesting observations also emerge from examining correlation of the chemical characteristics of the lakes first of all it is important to note that pss for lake water an indicator of sea spray aerosol influence see wadleigh et al 1994 is found to be positively correlated with p rh fw and negatively correlated with ele suggesting as expected that chemistry of the lakes is driven by continentality and distance from the ocean this pattern is also retained in many of the chemical properties including ec cl na not shown but comparable to cl and to some extent tn tp and doc elevated nutrients and doc in the lower elevation lakes are attributed to lush vegetation in the coastal western hemlock zone occurrence of significant wetlands and organic soils as compared to the mountain hemlock zone and longer periods of in lake productivity pss is negatively correlated with f water ele and wy chemical properties that appear to be unrelated to pss include ca mg not shown but similar to ca so4 and k suggesting that these may be controlled by weathering processes and water rock interaction alkalinity alk is negatively correlated with pss and is commonly higher in carbonate rich terrains ph not shown was found to be positively correlated with alk and is weakly correlated with ele and continentality both total base cations and the non marine base cation fraction are found to decrease inland and with ele alpine and sub alpine which suggests enhanced buffering potential in coastal areas as compared to high elevation areas inland nutrients and doc concentration in the lower elevation lakes are also elevated compared to the higher elevation lakes while not confirmed this may be the result of greater vegetation cover across the watershed and longer periods of in lake productivity the pca results indicate that the first two axes dim1 and dim2 account for 43 6 of variation within the entire dataset fig 10 the horizontal axis dim1 differentiates lakes mainly according to ele pristine land cover classes sub alpine f water old forest moisture indicators p rh fw and marine influenced chemistry pss cl doc in contrast the vertical axis dim2 captures variability in e disturbed land classes logged r y forest as well as the remaining ionic chemistry including ec ca so4 and alk as such dim2 captures variations in carbonate and sulfate species tn and tp are influenced by both dominant axes as are the water balance indicators ei 18o wy d18ol one of the interesting results of the pca analysis is that vancouver island lakes sampled in 2010 are visibly offset from the rest of lakes plotting predominantly in the upper quadrants fig 10 carbonate and sulfate species are more prevalent in these lakes which is attributed to predominance of sedimentary 43 and volcanic rocks 50 in these systems as compared to silicate dominated mainland sites in the pacific ranges sampled in 2009 and kitimat ranges sampled 2012 2015 where intrusive igneous and metamorphic rocks are more common samples from the mainland areas of the georgia basin sampled in 2008 are distinguished by stronger elevation control as sampling sites there ascend the cascade range generally higher elevation lakes contained the lowest concentrations of base cations and major anions the concentrations of which are driven largely by marine sources but is also likely reinforced by decreases in chemical weathering rates for high altitude lakes drever and zobrist 1992 kamenik et al 2001 while critical loads of acidity are expected to be dependent on both wy and non marine base cations see henriksen et al 2002 increased runoff with continentality is expected to only partially compensate for gradients in base cations and as such we expect critical loads to be higher in coastal areas and reduced inland in particular the marine influence lithology and chemical weathering appear to be the most influential water quality source determinants it should also be noted that more vigorous watershed runoff to lakes at higher elevations increases throughflow reduces contact time for weathering and contributes to relative dilution of lake waters which is also expected to make high elevation inland watersheds sensitive to acidification based on a preliminary evaluation we attribute the dissimilar water yield patterns to be the result of low elevation lakes being relatively disconnected from the regional river networks and hence having lower water yield values than high elevation lakes high elevation lakes tend to be located in glacially scoured valleys serve as focal points capturing runoff from upstream areas and constitute much of the source water for many alpine and sub alpine streams in addition the water yield estimates based on river gauging network may not be representative of smaller watersheds particularly high elevation sub basins examined in this study 4 summary and conclusions geochemistry and isotopic composition was measured in 783 water samples collected by helicopter from 560 lakes in coastal b c and vancouver island during 2008 2015 lakes and watershed areas were delineated and physical and land cover characteristics of the watersheds were compiled in a database repeat sampling in a subset of 100 lakes was used to confirm that isotopic characterization was meaningful based on one time sampling for most lakes an isotope mass balance method was applied to estimate the evaporation inflow and water yield to lakes and provides a novel perspective on the regional hydrology of lake and watershed characteristics across the coastal mountains of b c and vancouver island notably elevation is found to be a dominant driver of water yield although the observed patterns appear to contrast with river gauge measurements which suggest highest runoff occurs in coastal areas our results imply that low elevation lakes as compared to high elevation lakes must be significantly more disconnected from the regional river drainage networks due to lower slope and more disorganized drainage geochemical drivers across the region include sea spray lithology weathering and elevation the latter being influential on lake flushing distinct geochemical properties are noted for vancouver island lakes as watersheds in this area are typically dominated by sedimentary and volcanic rocks whereas mainland lakes in the coastal mountain ranges are dominated by intrusive and metamorphic rocks overall this study has contributed to new understanding of hydrological processes in coastal areas of british columbia and has identified regional trends in water balance of lakes as well as physical and chemical properties that may influence critical loads of acidity this study has extended application of an isotope mass balance method that has been widely used in continental regions of canada to coastal areas describing similar but subtly different isotopic enrichment effects the major limitation of the analysis is the lack of a spatially distributed precipitation isotope network in the region if established such a network would potentially allow isotope balance methods to be applied with reduced uncertainty and would also serve to better isolate isotopic variations related to rainout versus the subsequent effects of open water evaporation to further improve the understanding of spatial variations in acid sensitivity a steady state critical loads assessment is being developed to systematically integrate and map the base cation buffering information and water yield estimates across the region additional analysis will also target comparison of water yield derived from the river gauging network and this lake network to better understand differences in the runoff characteristics of the region as described the method is a transferable approach for assessing water balance and water quality water quantity relationships at the regional scale in remote or poorly monitored lake rich regions conflict of interest none acknowledgements funding for this research was obtained from environment and climate change canada via canada s national acid rain program

8513,study region this study was conducted within a 100 000 km2 area of british columbia b c canada including vancouver island the georgia basin and the pacific and kitimat mountain ranges rising from the pacific ocean study focus a stable isotope mass balance method is applied to estimate evaporation loss and water yield from a remote network of 560 lakes on vancouver island and coastal b c based on helicopter sampling surveys conducted between 2008 and 2015 spatial patterns in derived hydrological parameters are compared to water quality indicators and watershed characteristics to provide insight into water quantity and water quality relationships in the region to be incorporated within a future critical loads assessment new hydrological insights for the region regional trends in lake water balance underlying physical drivers and geochemical processes potentially influencing critical loads of acidity are described dominant non anthropogenic regional drivers of geochemistry include sea spray lithology weathering and elevation significant contrast is noted in alkalinity between the sedimentary and volcanic substrates on vancouver island and igneous intrusive substrates of the pacific and kitimat ranges a positive correlation is found between elevation and water yield to lakes while the opposite is observed for rivers which is interpreted to reflect disconnection of low elevation lakes from regional drainage networks this may invalidate use of river gauge data for critical loads assessment in this or similar regions keywords stable isotopes geochemistry lakes water yield vancouver island coastal ranges 1 introduction lakes are an important element of the landscape in coastal b c accounting for close to 10 of the land area although relatively few studies have described the hydrology and water quality of these lakes while a limited number of local studies have been conducted to characterize specific lakes and water supply reservoirs on southern vancouver island nowlin et al 2004 werner et al 2015 and selected lake types such as proglacial lakes richards et al 2012 fjord type lakes petticrew et al 2015 or sub alpine lakes dunnington et al 2016 no studies have previously investigated regional patterns in lake water balance parameters across the region in fact most hydrological interest in b c has been focused on the okanagan valley due to water scarcity in this region see wassenaar et al 2011 while many areas of coastal b c are still considered pristine and undeveloped dominance of base poor geologies with poor weathering capacity and potential for rapid growth in emissions due to expansion of shipping industry and urbanization in the south coastal mainland indicate that soils and lakes in some areas may be at risk of acidification mongeon et al 2010 here we report on a systematic survey of lakes in coastal b c designed to provide a regional assessment of critical loads of acidity to lakes as part of canada s national acid rain program acid sensitivity studies within the program have mainly focused on eastern canada over the past several decades largely owing to proximity to emissions from intensive industrial activity in eastern canada and the united states only a few studies have been carried out recently in western canada jeffries et al 2010 in a national assessment preceding initiation of this study jeffries et al 2005 concluded that the information available for evaluating the regional acidification status of lakes in many parts of western canada was too old too sparse or too unrepresentative to permit meaningful analysis and new and representative surveys were recommended as a result new surveys were initiated in alberta saskatchewan and manitoba see gibson et al 2010a b jeffries et al 2010 an additional study was initiated in coastal b c an area potentially sensitive to local marine and transboundary acidifying emissions environment canada and u s environmental protection agency 2014 the purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to the b c survey results describing some of the major regional hydrologic patterns across the region and their relation to climatic and physical characteristics of the selected lakes and watersheds and the lake water geochemistry the hydrologic assessment applies an isotope mass balance approach relying on measurement of the stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h in lakewater which has been previously tested across other regions of canada and the us gibson et al 2010a b gibson et al 2017 brooks et al 2014 the stable isotopes which are contained within the water molecule are used to estimate water yield to the lakes based on a steady state isotope mass balance model gibson et al 2015a and provide a new perspective of hydrologic variability of a large number of lakes and contributing watersheds that have not previously been studied in detail in addition this study provides an initial evaluation of the main drivers of water chemistry of the lakes including physical characteristics of the watersheds and water balance parameters this analysis will underpin an assessment of critical loads of acidity for lakes in the region using the henriksen et al 2002 model and isotope based estimates of water yield 1 1 study area the study area lies in coastal b c between 48 n and 58 n and 124 w and 138 w including vancouver island and coastal regions of b c between the alaska state border to the north and the washington state border to the south 560 lakes were sampled in total fig 1 ranging in size from less than 0 1 124 km2 situated at elevations ranging from 18 to 2003 m above sea level m a s l the watersheds of the study lakes ranged in size up to 1534 km2 averaging 15 km2 the study area occurs predominantly on the windward westward slopes of the coastal mountains and has a cool mesothermal climate with cool summers and mild winters pojar et al 1991a mean annual temperature ranges from 0 5 to 14 c averaging 9 1 c as interpolated from the gridded north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 precipitation has strong inland and northward gradients ranging from 600 mm in areas of the georgia basin with significant rainshadow effects to 3400 mm in the northernmost areas in the vicinity of prince rupert which is on average among the highest annual rainfall areas of b c relative humidity is variable ranging from 66 to 88 averaging 79 mesinger et al 2006 within the national ecozone classification the study area lies within the pacific maritime ecozone which is dominated by coastal mountains rising steeply from fjords and deep channels lining the coast and with glaciers and snowfields capping the tallest ranges wiken 1986 from the biogeoclimatic classification widely used within b c the area is mainly within the coastal western hemlock zone between sea level and 900 m and predominantly within the mountain hemlock zone in sub alpine areas pojar et al 1987 1991a 1991b steep precipitation and continentality gradients are evident with wetter maritime areas being dominated by western hemlock amabilis fir western redcedar and sitka spruce while drier maritime forests typically contain a substantial component of douglas fir pojar et al 1991a tree growth is progressively poorer with increasing elevation due to a shorter growing season prolonged snow cover and cooler temperatures pojar et al 1991b soils within our study watersheds are 80 podzolic most being humo ferric podzols which with increasing precipitation grade into ferro humic podzols see pojar et al 1991a bedrock along the coastal mountain ranges is dominated by intrusive igneous rocks with occurrence of metamorphic sedimentary and volcanic rocks ultramafic rocks are generally absent in the majority of watersheds sampled vancouver island watersheds are distinct in that bedrock is predominantly comprised of volcanic and sedimentary rocks b c ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations 2017 lakes are important features of the landscape in coastal b c occupying roughly 10 of the land surface in the study region a total of 18 land cover classifications are distinguished in these watersheds including alpine subalpine old forest young forest freshwater and recently logged lands 1 2 surveys and lake selection helicopter surveys to collected lake water were conducted in september october each year between 2008 and 2015 with the exception of 2011 lake selection focused on areas with poorly weatherable bedrock geology where the waterbodies are expected to be particularly sensitive to or already influenced by atmospheric deposition within the study area lake locations surface areas and geographic identifiers were extracted from the b c ministry of environment watershed atlas b c ministry of forests lands and natural resource operations 2017 lake buffering capacity was estimated by overlaying the lake layer and a derived weathering class layer using 1 250 000 digital bedrock geology layers available from the b c ministry of mines and petroleum resources 2005 regional bedrock was divided into five weathering classes wc based on nanus and clow 2004 a wc1 low to no buffering capacity e g granite schist b wc2 moderate buffering capacity e g diorite gneiss c wc3 high buffering capacity e g gabbro basalt d wc4 very high buffering capacity e g amphibolites hornblende and e wc5 extremely high buffering capacity e g marble limestones lakes with more sensitive underlying geologies i e wc1 wc2 wc3 were targeted in the lake selections a stratified random sampling methodology was used to select lakes within this target population lakes were selected from five defined size classes 4 10 ha 10 50 ha 50 100 ha 100 500 ha 500 ha applying a four part selection criteria described previously jeffries et al 2010 overall the number of lakes sampled represented approximately 10 of the population of lakes greater than 4 ha surface area in the study area 2 methods 2 1 water sampling and analysis water samples were 2 l grab samples in pre cleaned plastic bottles taken approximately centre lake from a float equipped bell 206 helicopter using a dipper plunged to 1 m depth 2008 22012 or filled using a small pump submerged to 1 m depth 2013 2015 positions were obtained using a garmin 76s global positioning unit gps lake surface elevation was recorded from the aircraft altimeter and water depth at the sample site was measured using an eagle cuda depth sounder with transducer mounted to the helicopter float surface temperature conductivity and ph were measured in situ using a yellow springs instrument model probe calibrated in the morning before each field day at the conclusion of the flight subsamples were transferred to 30 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for isotopic analysis with the majority of the sample then being selectively filtered and transferred to hdpe bottles for various geochemical analysis by standard methods ccme 2011 inorganic analyses were filtered to 0 45 μm using cellulose acetate filters whereas total nutrients were not filtered samples were kept cool and shipped to laboratories as soon as possible normally within one day in 2008 major ions and nutrients were analyzed at als analytical laboratories in vancouver b c from 2009 to 2015 analyses were conducted at the pacific environmental science centre pesc an environment canada laboratory in north vancouver b c hold time prior to analyses was typically several days stable isotopes 16o 18o and 2h 1h were analyzed either at the environmental isotope laboratory university of waterloo waterloo on 2008 or at innotech alberta victoria b c 2009 2015 all water samples were analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry the vast majority using a thermo scientific delta v advantage dual inlet hdevice isotope ratio mass spectrometer in all cases isotopic analyses were made within three months of sample collection results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and normalized to the smow slap scale where slap is standard light arctic precipitation see coplen 1996 analytical uncertainty is estimated to be better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h dissolved major cations and anions were determined by ion chromatography total nitrate tn and total phosphorus tp were measured by flow injection analysis in 2008 dissolved organic carbon doc was quantified by combustion of 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes while in 2009 2015 doc was calculated as the difference between dissolved carbon dc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic measured by combustion alkalinity was determined by gran titration quality assurance and quality control qa qc measures included blank and field duplicate sample submissions a total of 223 water samples were collected as duplicates and for qa qc purposes specifically to establish the uncertainty associated with using a one time sampling strategy incoming analytical data were assessed using concordance of duplicate results and for dissolved ions charge balances 2 2 isotope mass balance hydrology of each lake was characterized using an isotope mass balance imb model developed under the assumption of a well mixed water body and steady state conditions which has been demonstrated previously for shallow lakes in northern canada gibson et al 2002 2010a b 2015a 2017 bennett et al 2008 the imb is used to estimate evaporation inflow based on the isotopic offset between lake water and precipitation input then precipitation evaporation and relative humidity estimates are extracted for each site based on a gridded climate dataset and lake and watershed area estimates are incorporated to constrain the ungauged inflow to the lake and resulting outflows the annual water and isotope balances for a well mixed lake in isotopic and hydrologic steady state can be written respectively as 1 i q e m 3 yr 1 2 iδ i qδ q eδ e m 3 yr 1 where i q and e are lake inflow discharge and evaporation rates m 3 yr 1 and δ i δ q and δ e are the isotopic compositions of inflow discharge and evaporation fluxes respectively note that i p r where p is precipitation on the lake surface and ris ungauged inflow to the lake we can rearrange eq 2 and substitute q i e from eq 1 to yield 3 e i δ i δ q δ e δ q dim e n s i o n l e s s where e i is the evaporation to inflow ratio for well mixed lakes we have often assumed δ q δ l where δ l is isotopic composition of the lake for headwater lakes the isotope composition of inflow is approximated by that of precipitation i e δ i δ p whereas the isotopic composition of lake evaporate δ e is estimated using the craig and gordon 1965 model given by 4 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where h is relative humidity decimal fraction δ a is isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture ε is equilibrium isotopic separation see horita and wesolowski 1994 α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation where ε α 1 and ε k is the kinetic isotopic separation see horita et al 2008 substitution of δ e into eq 3 yields 5 x e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dim e n s i o n l e s s where 6 m h 10 3 ε k ε α 1 h 10 3 ε k dim e n s i o n l e s s and 7 δ h δ a ε k ε α h 10 3 ε k ε α as the inflow to a lake is comprised of precipitation on the lake surface p as well as ungauged inflow r i e i p r we can estimate r for headwater lakes by substitution of eq 5 8 r e x p m 3 y r 1 where e e la and p p la e and p are the annual depth equivalent of evaporation and precipitation m yr 1 and la is the lake area m 2 water yield or the depth equivalent runoff can then be estimated as 9 wy r wa 1000 mm yr 1 where wa is the watershed area for non headwater lakes owing to the fact that many receive a portion of isotopically enriched water from upstream lakes the water yield estimates should be regarded as a lower limit lakes sampled in this survey were not likely influenced significantly by this factor as they were predominantly headwater lakes isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture δ a is estimated by fitting predicted enrichment to the observed local evaporation line based on a partial equilibrium approach see gibson et al 2015a this approach accounts for seasonality observed in evaporation losses to the atmosphere 2 3 climate and watershed parameters climate parameters were obtained from the 32 km resolution north american regional reanalysis narr dataset mesinger et al 2006 monthly climatology based on data from 1979 to 2003 was extracted for the grid cells corresponding to the location of each of the study lakes the parameters extracted were i surface total precipitation mm yr 1 ii 2 m relative humidity iii surface evaporation mm yr 1 and iv 2 m temperature k the evaporation flux weighting approach see gibson et al 2015b was used to weight estimates of relative humidity and temperature so that the water balance calculations were representative of the open water season temperature and precipitation values interpolated from the narr dataset which has been used in numerous isotope based assessments across canada gibson et al 2010a b 2015b 2016 2017 jeffries et al 2010 scott et al 2010 were also compared to that derived from the gridded 800 m resolution prism climatology pacific climate impacts consortium et al 2014 as this dataset has been widely applied by some research groups working in b c overall we found that isotope based estimates of water yield differed by less than 5 on average between the two climate datasets but was most pronounced below 200 mm yr 1 based on this similarity we suggest that either dataset may be used effectively for the purposes of a regional assessment application of the imb model also requires delineation of the watershed areas lake areas and lake elevations for each of the study lakes using the coordinates latitude longitude for each lake watershed area lake area and lake elevation were obtained using digital elevation data in raster format from 1 50 000 canada national topographic series nts map sheets canadian national hydro network data in vector format were obtained from the geobase portal canada natural resources canada 2017 terrain preprocessing to incorporate the vector hydrographic network and to fill small sinks was required before the digital elevation model dem could be used for efficient watershed delineation see jeffries et al 2010 individual watersheds were delineated in the arcgis program using the archydro tools where each watershed was delineated upstream of a lake outlet hydrographic and elevation datasets were used to depict the lake outlet locations in some cases two or more partial watersheds had to be merged together to create a final watershed polygon the planimetric area of both the lake and watershed polygons was calculated in the arcgis program based on the equal area projection 2 4 isotopic parameters monthly precipitation δ18o estimates were obtained for each lake location based on empirically derived global relationships between latitude and elevation bowen and wilkinson 2002 fitted to regional precipitation data from the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation see birks and gibson 2009 the δ2h composition of monthly precipitation was calculated assuming that precipitation would follow the relationship defined by the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 annual averages of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation were amount weighted using monthly precipitation obtained from the narr dataset note that calculations were performed using the long term climatology of all parameters 2 5 correlation and pca analysis we analyzed the relationships between physical and geochemical properties land cover isotopic characteristics and derived water properties to investigate and better understand controlling processes in the lakes and their watersheds a spearman rank order test was used to test correlations as several of the variables were non linearly related or were not normally distributed principal component analysis pca was also applied a technique described in detail by mardia et al 1989 for this study as noted below variables included in the pca included i climate properties ii physical characteristics and land cover iii geochemical properties and iv isotopes and derived hydrologic properties some geological characteristics such as bedrock coverage were not included in the pca due to lack of consistent information in all areas several variables that were highly correlated with others such as δ2h with δ18o were not included as a result 24 variables were used including by class i evaporation flux weighted temperature t fw c evaporation flux weighted relative humidity rh fw precipitation p m m year evaporation e m m year ii elevation ele m a s l watershed area wa km2

and iv lakewater δ18o d18ol v smow evaporation inflow ei 18o and water yield wy mm year note that land cover classes were based on percentages in each watershed and pss was based on the method of wadleigh et al 1994 due to the large range of measurements and variable distributions of selected parameters the compiled database is log transformed and scaled to unit variance prior to the pca analysis the transformation and standardization of raw data is necessary to achieve close to normal distributions and to downweight effects of extreme values in the pca analysis the multi variate analysis leads to multiple principal components that help to understand the variations and relationship of variables the first principal component dim1 a linear combination of the original variables explains the largest amount of variance in the dataset and the second principal component dim2 describes the second largest variation remaining in the dataset when presenting pca results the projection of an individual sample onto the axes defined by principal components dim is termed score whereas the coefficient for each variable in the linear combination is called loading of the variable in the score plot lakes with similar characteristics tend to plot close to each other while lakes with distinct characteristics are expected to be farther apart meanwhile the loading plot is commonly used to examine the relation between variables as highly correlated variables tend to point in the same direction in a loading plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 repeat sampling prior to use in the regional assessment it was important to evaluate whether one time sampling was appropriate to characterize the water balance of most lakes and if so to determine the uncertainty associated with this approach to evaluate this a subset of data was assembled based on 100 lakes sampled on more than one occasion during the course of the study 2008 2015 78 of the lakes were sampled twice 10 lakes were sampled 3 times and the remainder were sampled between 4 and 9 times climatic isotopic and geochemical data and watershed parameters for these lakes were compiled and used to estimate water yield by eq 9 as shown for δ18o and for water yield fig 2 a high degree of autocorrelation was found between the δ18o values obtained from first time and repeat sampling events δ18o r2 0 956 which was also true for wy r2 0 982 results in both cases were found to fall close to the 1 1 line suggesting that there was no systematic bias associated with this approach standard error for estimating δ18o based on one time sampling strategy is found to be 0 23 median value which is close to the analytical uncertainty reported by many labs and only about 2 of the observed range of 12 6 for all lakes while standard error in wy is estimated at 30 mm year median value mean standard error values are higher 0 44 for δ18o and 115 mm year for wy but for wy are significantly impacted by extreme values owing to positively skewed distributions in our judgement repeat sampling results confirm that a one time sampling approach is adequate for evaluating regional trends and can be applied with satisfactory confidence to differentiate lake to lake variations across the region and to meaningfully characterize water balance and evaporation patterns while uncertainty associated with use of the annual steady state method for estimating water balance of individual lakes has been shown to be in the range of 20 30 see gibson et al 2002 jasechko et al 2014 the resulting regional water yield distributions have been shown to be relatively robust and we suggest are useful for capturing the expected range of regional runoff variability for evaluating critical loads gibson et al 2010a b 2017 3 2 climate and watershed characteristics location latitude and longitude of the study lakes is shown to be fairly evenly distributed within the boundaries of the study area fig 3 a b elevation distribution of the study lakes fig 3c is clearly shown to be positively skewed attributed to lakes more frequently being situated in valleys and low lying areas in the landscape distribution of lake area and watershed area is similarly skewed fig 3d e with average lake and watershed areas of 0 9 km2 and 15 km2 respectively however the majority of lakes were less than 0 5 km2 and watersheds less than 10 km2 in area bemrose et al 2009 reported positive skewness in watershed areas for canada s river gauging network although average gauged area for b c stations including both active and discontinued is significantly larger than the dataset reported here 3113 km2 large watersheds in this study which ranged up to 1534 km2 were found to be more commonly situated at lower elevations and a slight increase in both lake size and lake watershed area is noted towards higher elevations histograms illustrating distribution of annual precipitation lake evaporation and surface temperature reveal a wide range of variation across the study region fig 4 a b c respectively with precipitation being distinctly bimodal but evaporation and temperature being unimodal and less systematic note that temperature shown is evaporation flux weighted according to the method of gibson et al 2008 and is therefore representative of conditions when lake evaporation was occurring from both the precipitation and relative humidity datasets fig 4a d a distinct low precipitation low humidity region is evident which corresponds to areas of the georgia basin located inland from the mainland coast which are characterized by a pronounced rain shadow effect associated with the olympic and cascade mountain ranges flux weighted annual temperature for the sites ranges from less than 3 c for some alpine watersheds to 14 c for hyper maritime watersheds this is a slightly narrower range than mean annual temperature as it reflects average conditions when evaporation was occurring 3 3 regional isotopic variations distributions of oxygen 18 and deuterium isotopic composition in precipitation fig 5 c d lake water fig 5a b and atmospheric moisture fig 5d e reveal a wide range in input signatures evaporative enrichment of lake water and atmospheric moisture conditions respectively for the study lakes while isotopic composition of lakes is measured we emphasize that isotopic composition of precipitation is modelled i e based on amount weighted δ18o values interpolated from the cnip network and constrained to fall on the gmwl craig 1961 atmospheric moisture is also modelled using the evaporation flux weighted approach of gibson et al 2008 to reflect conditions when lake evaporation was occurring isotopic characteristics are also illustrated in 2h 18o plots fig 6 relative to precipitation which in our analysis is assumed to be well represented by the gmwl atmospheric moisture is depleted but also falls close to the gmwl while only slight offset from the gmwl is measured in lakes lakes plot along local evaporation lines lels with slopes ranging between 6 52 and 7 28 for individual sampling years table 1 varying spatially mainly according to atmospheric conditions in each specific sampling area overall the average slope of lels is 6 98 and is steeper than observed in previous surveys of lakes in continental regions of canada gibson et al 2010a b 2015b 2017 and the contiguous usa brooks et al 2014 due mainly to consistently higher relative humidity in coastal areas overall offset from the gmwl along lels is also subdued compared to observations made in the aforementioned continental surveys reflecting lower evaporation losses as discussed below 3 4 regional water balance outputs and gradients evaporation inflow is shown to range from 0 to more than 80 although the majority of lakes fall in the range of 0 20 and the median is close to 9 6 evaporation inflow is a sensitive indicator of the partitioning of water between liquid and vapour outflow and as such reveals that lake evaporation is much less important for most watersheds in coastal b c than liquid discharge the latter being predominantly as surface outflow via channelized streams given the shallow soil development and dominance of bedrock in most areas distribution of evaporation inflow is found to be slightly positively skewed fig 4e as noted in previous surveys in northwestern ontario and alberta gibson et al 2015b 2017 water yields for each yearly survey and for the entire dataset reveal positively skewed distributions in all cases fig 7 similar skewness has been observed in previous surveys in continental canada gibson et al 2010a 2010b 2015b 2017 overall water yield was found to range from near zero to 5000 mm yr 1 averaging 656 mm with a standard deviation of 884 mm the median was 277 mm while there are a few lakes with high water yield the results indicate existence of a large population of lakes that have significantly lower water yield than average several of the lakes at higher elevation also appear to have water yield values that exceed mean annual precipitation which may reflect uncertainty in basin areas or other model parameters anomalous precipitation received in some areas during the study year or prior years and or augmentation of runoff by glaciers perennial snowpack or glaciogenic groundwaters the augmentation of runoff sources does not likely explain the higher water yield values predicted in parts of vancouver island with a warmer climate and lower elevation mountains here uncertainty in model parameters such as isotopic composition of precipitation may be more important excessively high water yields in these areas may also indicate heightened sensitivity of the model at high relative humidity which is expected based on previous assessments of the model e g gibson et al 2002 however bemrose et al 2009 also show that water yield based on river gauging may exceed observed precipitation by up to 25 for coastal areas of northern b c so this may be a more general sign of uncertainty in precipitation amounts as well elevation which is also significantly correlated with distance from the coast is found to be a dominant driver of precipitation lake and precipitation isotopic compositions evaporation inflow and water yield across the study region fig 8 for precipitation values for sites between sea level and 500 m are found to span the full range observed across the region 700 3500 mm whereas the upper limit of precipitation amount becomes truncated at 2500 mm at mid range elevations 500 and 1500 m and is in all cases less than 1500 mm at higher elevations above 1500m this is an expression of the classic rainout process for the coastal mountain ranges isotopic composition of precipitation fig 8c is shown to be strongly correlated with elevation which is evidence of the isotope altitude effect dangaard 1964 gat 1996 in this study precipitation was modelled for each sub region each year based on the method of bowen and wilkinson 2002 fitted to regional precipitation data from cnip birks and gibson 2009 this method has been shown to reproduce globally observed gradients in latitude and elevation overall the interpolated model data capture the effect of air masses being transported from the pacific ocean over the coastal b c ranges and the associated removal of moisture from the atmosphere as a result of cooling of air masses and related isotopic fractionation values and ranges in isotopic composition of lake water were also found to be elevation dependent in general high elevation lakes were found to be more depleted in δ18o fig 8b and δ2h not shown higher elevation lakes were typically less evaporated had more depleted input waters including precipitation and precipitation derived surface and groundwater inputs from their catchments and therefore were less isotopically enriched lower elevation lakes had more isotopically depleted precipitation sources and showed a larger range in isotopic composition as water balance factors were evidently more important spatially in determining the isotopic composition of the lakes a unique group of low elevation lakes with depleted δ18o fig 8b are large fjord type lakes suspected of being fed by springs originating at higher elevations evaporation inflow variations with elevation largely mimic the patterns exhibited by isotopic composition of lakes fig 8d evaporation inflow shows a narrow range for high elevation lakes and a larger range for low elevation lakes most probably owing to the greater influence of lake and watershed configuration on surface water storage and evaporation in flatter non alpine areas such patterns have not previously been described for the region while detailed annual water yield estimates have been reported and mapped for the study region from river discharge data bemrose et al 2009 no previous studies have specifically focused on characterizing water yield to lakes we note that water yield based on 1971 2000 river discharge measurements ranges between 1000 to 4300 mm yr 1 for our study region and evidently increases towards low elevation hyper maritime coastal areas where rainfall is highest in contrast our dataset clearly shows a significant positive correlation between elevation and water yield to lakes log transformed with an r value close to 0 518 p 0 001 we postulate that this may be due to greater potential for disconnection between lakes and rivers in low lying areas with lower slope and better connectivity between lakes and rivers in steeper higher elevation areas rivers are commonly observed to originate from lakes often proglacial lakes at higher elevations while beyond the scope of this article a systematic analysis of specific watershed configurations would be of value for verifying this preliminary assessment we also note from our dataset that evaporation flux weighted temperature is negatively correlated with elevation but does not appear to be a dominant driver of the derived water balance parameters 3 5 drivers of water balance and water quality we further investigated the relationships between physical and geochemical properties land cover isotopic characteristics and derived water properties to investigate and better understand controlling processes in the lakes and their watersheds a spearman rank order test was used to test correlations as several of the variables were non linearly related or were not normally distributed a colour coded matrix illustrates the strength and direction of correlation between significantly related variables fig 9 note that numerous relationships 276 are tested in this exercise with significance assessed using an adjusted p value of 0 00005 with the bonferroni correction applied summarizing the apparent physical drivers of water balance we note that ei 18o e i is positively correlated with p and rh fw as well as old forest but negatively correlated with ele and sub alpine alpine and sub apline were highly correlated and so show similar patterns water yield wylog10 is positively correlated with ele e m lawar and f water and negatively correlated with p rh fw old forest and wa for the multi year survey raw isotopic data d18ol are positively correlated with evaporation inflow and negatively correlated with water yield overall it appears that as distance from the coast and elevation increase lakes tend to receive proportionately greater runoff from their watersheds and the amount and variability of water loss by evaporation e i is reduced in contrast coastal areas with lower elevations tend to have a wider range in e i and increased evaporation losses based on the correlation analysis it appears that vegetation is only a minor water balance differentiator across this biogeoclimatic region a weaker relationship evident in the dataset is for increase in f water and la and reduced wa with increased proportions of alpine and sub alpine land covers thereby producing an increase in lawar although it is not clear at the present time whether this bias is reflective of shifts in lake population across the region or how this may affect the regional water balance trends several interesting observations also emerge from examining correlation of the chemical characteristics of the lakes first of all it is important to note that pss for lake water an indicator of sea spray aerosol influence see wadleigh et al 1994 is found to be positively correlated with p rh fw and negatively correlated with ele suggesting as expected that chemistry of the lakes is driven by continentality and distance from the ocean this pattern is also retained in many of the chemical properties including ec cl na not shown but comparable to cl and to some extent tn tp and doc elevated nutrients and doc in the lower elevation lakes are attributed to lush vegetation in the coastal western hemlock zone occurrence of significant wetlands and organic soils as compared to the mountain hemlock zone and longer periods of in lake productivity pss is negatively correlated with f water ele and wy chemical properties that appear to be unrelated to pss include ca mg not shown but similar to ca so4 and k suggesting that these may be controlled by weathering processes and water rock interaction alkalinity alk is negatively correlated with pss and is commonly higher in carbonate rich terrains ph not shown was found to be positively correlated with alk and is weakly correlated with ele and continentality both total base cations and the non marine base cation fraction are found to decrease inland and with ele alpine and sub alpine which suggests enhanced buffering potential in coastal areas as compared to high elevation areas inland nutrients and doc concentration in the lower elevation lakes are also elevated compared to the higher elevation lakes while not confirmed this may be the result of greater vegetation cover across the watershed and longer periods of in lake productivity the pca results indicate that the first two axes dim1 and dim2 account for 43 6 of variation within the entire dataset fig 10 the horizontal axis dim1 differentiates lakes mainly according to ele pristine land cover classes sub alpine f water old forest moisture indicators p rh fw and marine influenced chemistry pss cl doc in contrast the vertical axis dim2 captures variability in e disturbed land classes logged r y forest as well as the remaining ionic chemistry including ec ca so4 and alk as such dim2 captures variations in carbonate and sulfate species tn and tp are influenced by both dominant axes as are the water balance indicators ei 18o wy d18ol one of the interesting results of the pca analysis is that vancouver island lakes sampled in 2010 are visibly offset from the rest of lakes plotting predominantly in the upper quadrants fig 10 carbonate and sulfate species are more prevalent in these lakes which is attributed to predominance of sedimentary 43 and volcanic rocks 50 in these systems as compared to silicate dominated mainland sites in the pacific ranges sampled in 2009 and kitimat ranges sampled 2012 2015 where intrusive igneous and metamorphic rocks are more common samples from the mainland areas of the georgia basin sampled in 2008 are distinguished by stronger elevation control as sampling sites there ascend the cascade range generally higher elevation lakes contained the lowest concentrations of base cations and major anions the concentrations of which are driven largely by marine sources but is also likely reinforced by decreases in chemical weathering rates for high altitude lakes drever and zobrist 1992 kamenik et al 2001 while critical loads of acidity are expected to be dependent on both wy and non marine base cations see henriksen et al 2002 increased runoff with continentality is expected to only partially compensate for gradients in base cations and as such we expect critical loads to be higher in coastal areas and reduced inland in particular the marine influence lithology and chemical weathering appear to be the most influential water quality source determinants it should also be noted that more vigorous watershed runoff to lakes at higher elevations increases throughflow reduces contact time for weathering and contributes to relative dilution of lake waters which is also expected to make high elevation inland watersheds sensitive to acidification based on a preliminary evaluation we attribute the dissimilar water yield patterns to be the result of low elevation lakes being relatively disconnected from the regional river networks and hence having lower water yield values than high elevation lakes high elevation lakes tend to be located in glacially scoured valleys serve as focal points capturing runoff from upstream areas and constitute much of the source water for many alpine and sub alpine streams in addition the water yield estimates based on river gauging network may not be representative of smaller watersheds particularly high elevation sub basins examined in this study 4 summary and conclusions geochemistry and isotopic composition was measured in 783 water samples collected by helicopter from 560 lakes in coastal b c and vancouver island during 2008 2015 lakes and watershed areas were delineated and physical and land cover characteristics of the watersheds were compiled in a database repeat sampling in a subset of 100 lakes was used to confirm that isotopic characterization was meaningful based on one time sampling for most lakes an isotope mass balance method was applied to estimate the evaporation inflow and water yield to lakes and provides a novel perspective on the regional hydrology of lake and watershed characteristics across the coastal mountains of b c and vancouver island notably elevation is found to be a dominant driver of water yield although the observed patterns appear to contrast with river gauge measurements which suggest highest runoff occurs in coastal areas our results imply that low elevation lakes as compared to high elevation lakes must be significantly more disconnected from the regional river drainage networks due to lower slope and more disorganized drainage geochemical drivers across the region include sea spray lithology weathering and elevation the latter being influential on lake flushing distinct geochemical properties are noted for vancouver island lakes as watersheds in this area are typically dominated by sedimentary and volcanic rocks whereas mainland lakes in the coastal mountain ranges are dominated by intrusive and metamorphic rocks overall this study has contributed to new understanding of hydrological processes in coastal areas of british columbia and has identified regional trends in water balance of lakes as well as physical and chemical properties that may influence critical loads of acidity this study has extended application of an isotope mass balance method that has been widely used in continental regions of canada to coastal areas describing similar but subtly different isotopic enrichment effects the major limitation of the analysis is the lack of a spatially distributed precipitation isotope network in the region if established such a network would potentially allow isotope balance methods to be applied with reduced uncertainty and would also serve to better isolate isotopic variations related to rainout versus the subsequent effects of open water evaporation to further improve the understanding of spatial variations in acid sensitivity a steady state critical loads assessment is being developed to systematically integrate and map the base cation buffering information and water yield estimates across the region additional analysis will also target comparison of water yield derived from the river gauging network and this lake network to better understand differences in the runoff characteristics of the region as described the method is a transferable approach for assessing water balance and water quality water quantity relationships at the regional scale in remote or poorly monitored lake rich regions conflict of interest none acknowledgements funding for this research was obtained from environment and climate change canada via canada s national acid rain program

8514,study region 918 basins in the contiguous united states study focus regional regression models were developed to predict 13 percentile flows for groups of basins clustered based on physical and climatic characteristics the research question investigated how the number and information content of independent variables affected model performance and compared data driven versus expert assessment approaches for variable selection new hydrological insights for the region a set of three variables selected based on an expert assessment of factors that influence percentile flows performed similarly to larger sets of variables selected using a data driven method expert assessment variables included mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and baseflow index larger sets of up to 37 variables contributed little if any additional predictive information variables used to describe the distribution of basin data e g standard deviation were not useful and average values were sufficient to characterize physical and climatic basin conditions effectiveness of the expert assessment variables may be due to the high degree of multicollinearity i e cross correlation among additional variables a tool is provided in the supplementary material to predict percentile flows based on the three expert assessment variables future work should develop new variables with a strong understanding of the processes related to percentile flows keywords percentile flow ungauged basin regional regression independent variable united states 1 introduction the flow duration curve fdc is composed of percentile flows that identify the flow equaled or exceeded for a given percent of time percentile flows are used to make decisions in a variety of fields such as environmental regulation over et al 2014 transportation engineering dudley 2015 and drought planning miller and fox 2017 these operations are often conducted without observed percentile flows as most basins are ungauged in this case regionalization procedures are typically adopted to predict percentile flows based on information from gauged basins a common type of regionalization procedure develops regression models that relate observed percentile flows to independent variables derived from physical and climatic basin data see hope and bart 2011 mohamoud 2008 over et al 2014 hydrologic models based on predicted parameters and climatic forcing data are an alternative to derive percentile flows westerberg et al 2014 however the simplicity of using regression models presents an opportunity to provide a tool to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins regression models are known to perform poorly for study areas with a large variance in percentile flows such as the contiguous united states us to reduce the variance in percentile flows separate regression models are developed for groups of basins in a process called regional regression modeling sauquet and catalogne 2011 a typical regional regression first splits the basins into groups using cluster analysis and then develops regression models for each group independent variables such as mean elevation and precipitation are used to identify the groups and parameters of the regression models despite the long standing tradition of regional regression modeling in hydrology few studies have investigated the effect of using different sets of independent variables on the final performance of predictions independent variables can be selected using different approaches the tendency of recent studies is to use many independent variables in a data driven approach see di prinzio et al 2011 over et al 2014 sauquet and catalogne 2011 whereas older studies justify the use of few variables through expert assessment see dingman 1978 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 singh 1971 an expert assessment of independent variables has more potential following the decade on predictions in ungauged basins sivapalan et al 2003 in which a variety of studies identified key variables related to the overall shape of the fdc castellarin et al 2013 a study comparing recently developed physical understanding of the fdc to a data driven approach for selecting independent variables would contribute valuable information to the problem of identifying a generalized solution to predict the fdc in ungauged basins regional regression modeling has been used to predict percentile flows in the us see archfield et al 2007 hope and bart 2011 mohamoud 2008 these studies have focused on particular geographic regions of the us such as southern new england archfield et al 2007 southern and central california hope and bart 2011 and the mid atlantic mohamoud 2008 the national streamflow statistics program of the us geological survey has developed an application for predicting percentile flows called streamstats ries 2007 however it does not cover the contiguous us and regression models were developed for states rather than grouping basins based on characteristics related to flow previous work such as streamstats has been performed for parts of the us although physical and climatic data now exist to develop regional regression models for the contiguous us in this study independent variables are derived to cluster basins in the contiguous us and develop regression models for subsequent groups of basins the resulting models are used as a tool to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins in the contiguous us 1 1 independent variables for regional regression modeling independent variables summarize physical and climatic basin data and serve as the foundation for regional regression modeling both steps of regional regression modeling basin grouping and model development depend on the independent variables chosen to represent the basins despite the importance of independent variables prior studies have primarily evaluated the use of different cluster analyses see di prinzio et al 2011 laaha and blöschl 2006 sauquet and catalogne 2011 and modeling methods see archfield et al 2007 holmes et al 2002 over et al 2014 rather than the input information of the overall regional regression approach a limited number of studies have examined the input information for regional regression modeling of percentile flows these studies have either investigated how to select independent variables from a large number of possible variables ssegane et al 2012a b or experimented with the initial set of variables to assess the predictive potential of a certain type of variable hope and bart 2012 ilorme 2011 a two part study compared the performance of different variable selection methods for clustering basins ssegane et al 2012a and modeling percentile flows ssegane et al 2012b these studies revealed the importance of different variables through the variable selection process i e more important variables were selected more often the importance of different variables can also be evaluated by changing the initial set of variables and assessing the difference in model performance this approach has been used to evaluate the importance of variables describing vegetation cover hope and bart 2012 and the spatial distribution of land surface data ilorme 2011 both of these studies reported only minor differences in model performance after changing the initial set of variables however the study involving the spatial distribution of land surface data could be expanded to include information on climate and geology as these are dominant controls on the fdc yokoo and sivapalan 2011 studies that evaluate different types of variables such as hope and bart 2012 and ilorme 2011 highlight the uncertainty of selecting the initial set of variables for a regional regression approach the approach for selecting the initial set of variables has evolved over the long history of regional regression studies early studies used a small number of variables due to the scarcity of spatially distributed data see dingman 1978 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 singh 1971 these studies included all of the variables in the regression models and attempted to target variables with a strong physical connection to the fdc this early approach to selecting variables could be implemented using contemporary data sources that provide more physical and climatic information variables derived from such data could be selected through an expert assessment of the dominant controls on the fdc an expert assessment of the fdc would select a small number of variables according to a physical understanding of the curve which can be summarized as follows the highest and lowest flows are respectively generated by storms and subsurface drainage and flows in between are a mixture of these sources moderated by evapotranspiration losses summary based on the work of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 with this understanding the climatic controls of the fdc could be summarized by mean annual precipitation map and potential evapotranspiration pet while subsurface drainage could be represented by baseflow index bfi values that describe the percent of streamflow attributed to groundwater discharge drainage area is not included in this expert assessment because normalizing the fdc by a streamflow magnitude controls for the effects of drainage area hope and bart 2011 a recent review of the fdc regionalization problem suggests the use of this type of physical understanding to select independent variables castellarin et al 2013 although bfi values are derived at gauged points they can be interpolated to produce spatially distributed data such as a gridded product for the contiguous us wolock 2003 this data can then be used to create independent variables for regional regression models despite the recent suggestion to select independent variables based on physical understanding castellarin et al 2013 many studies of late have opted to use a large number of independent variables e g over et al 2014 evaluated 21 variables in a data driven approach that attempts to account for more complex and nuanced relations to percentile flows than may be anticipated through an expert assessment all of the variables are first used to cluster the basins and then a subset of the variables is selected to model the percentile flows for each group of basins see di prinzio et al 2011 laaha and blöschl 2006 and sauquet and catalogne 2011 for examples the variables used in these studies may describe the average of the basin data via a single lumped value or the statistical distribution of the basin data via multiple distributed values the latter set of variables describes the spatial distribution of physical data such as topography and geology and the temporal distribution of climatic data this information describes factors potentially associated with streamflow generation such as the variability of subsurface drainage conditions tague and grant 2004 or dispersion of precipitation throughout the year i e seasonality ye et al 2012 distributed variables produce the largest set of variables for regional regression modeling and are thought to be advantageous for accommodating a large variety of relations to the percentile flows 2 research objective and question the objective of this research was to create regional regression models for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us the steps to complete this objective included 1 grouping basins and 2 developing regression models for each group of basins both of these steps were based on independent variables that summarized the physical and climatic data of the basins the approach used to select the independent variables may influence the performance of the regression models a small number of variables could be selected according to an expert assessment of the dominant controls on the fdc or a data driven approach could be adopted to account for many possible relations to the percentile flows using a large number of variables both of these approaches were applied to create the regional regression models the difference in performance was then evaluated to answer the following research question how does the performance of regional regression models for predicting percentile flows differ when using an expert assessment to select a small number of variables versus a data driven approach involving a large number of variables the hypothesis investigated in this study was that the data driven approach would produce better regression models because the large number of variables may account for nuanced relations to the percentile flows not anticipated by the expert assessment a performance evaluation was conducted to test this hypothesis and identify a parsimonious approach for creating the regional regression models these models were then used to develop a tool for predicting the percentile flows of ungauged basins in the contiguous us 3 methods 3 1 overview regional regression models were created using three different sets of independent variables 1 a limited number of variables identified through expert assessment 2 an expanded number of lumped variables and 3 a larger number of distributed variables the first set of variables was selected based on the expert assessment outlined in the introduction and included map pet and bfi herein referred to as expert variables all of the expert variables were used in the regional regression models larger sets of variables were used in a data driven approach to identify the regional regression models a set of lumped variables was used to describe the averages of data for each basin while distributed variables described both the average and distribution of the basin data in space and time a subset of the lumped and distributed variables was selected for the regional regression models using a regression tree method called random forests breiman 2001 to rank the predictive potential of the variables random forests was used as it produced the best regression models for predicting percentile flows in a previous study of data driven variable selection methods fouad 2016 pp 55 56 a preliminary experiment is also conducted here to compare random forests to a regression model procedure based on a branch and bound model search miller 2002 the different sets of variables were used in a cluster analysis to split the basins into groups as a precursor to cluster analysis the variables were processed by a neural network called the self organizing map som noise i e variance unrelated to the actual value and non linearities characterize hydrologic data to address these issues the som is used before cluster analysis see boscarello et al 2015 di prinzio et al 2011 toth 2013 basin values are used to train a som consisting of neurons each neuron has a vector the same length as the number of input basin values neuron vectors converge on the input data during training the training process acts like a smoothing function that reduces noise output neuron vectors also incorporate linear and non linear features of the input data the neuron vectors are then used for multivariate clustering which ultimately leads to the grouping of basins including non linearities and less noise statistical assumptions like a probability distribution do not apply to the som since the training process produces neurons that emulate the input data however the training process does involve some assumptions including the number of neurons and training parameters such as the number of runs i e times the input data is presented to the som the number of neurons was chosen based on the number of neurons not associated with a basin and therefore not linked to the input data training parameters were set to ensure that the neurons converged on the input data the k means clustering method was applied to the trained neuron vectors because the k means method identifies clusters similar to how the data is organized in the som skupin 2004 the basins were then assigned to the neuron clusters using the neuron with the vector that best matched the basin data i e best matching unit groups of basins identified based on the som were used to develop regression models for predicting percentile flows this was accomplished using a set of calibration basins outliers were removed from the calibration basins using the cook s d statistic helsel and hirsch 2002 to finalize the regression models models were applied to an independent set of validation basins predictions for the validation basins were corrected to maintain the decreasing order of percentile flows performance of the predictions was then evaluated the entire process of 1 identifying groups of basins 2 developing regression models and 3 evaluating predictive performance was repeated using the three different sets of independent variables expert lumped and distributed the performance evaluation was used to identify a parsimonious set of variables for creating the regional regression models and a tool based on these models was developed to predict percentile flows for the contiguous us the entire regional regression study is summarized as a flow chart in fig 1 3 2 basins and percentile flows all basins used in this study were located in the contiguous us and were selected based on being classified as near natural by the us geological survey s gages ii database the near natural class consists of basins with little human influences to the flow of water see falcone 2011 for more details near natural basins with at least 30 years of continuous daily streamflow data were used to calculate 13 percentile flows including the high flows exceeded 1 and 5 of the time q01 and q05 low flows exceeded 95 and 99 of the time q95 and q99 and decile values between those flows q10 q20 q90 streamflow data was downloaded from the national water information system http waterdata usgs gov nwis daily data for 30 years was used to calculate percentile flows reasonably stable for different time periods kennard et al 2010 percentile flows were calculated for 918 near natural basins using the weibull plotting position to identify the percent of time that a given flow was equaled or exceeded p as follows 1 p r n 1 100 where r is the rank of the daily flow according to its magnitude n is the total number of daily flow values and the flows were normalized using the mean of nonzero values as in hope and bart 2011 to control for differences in magnitude between the basins a subset of validation basins was used to evaluate the performance of the regression models the validation included 184 20 of the basins which meets the recommendation that the validation should have at least 100 samples for a continuous dependent variable such as percentile flows harrell 2001 the sample of validation basins was selected using a proxy basin approach to identify a sample of basins representative of the remaining calibration basins used to develop the regression models klemeš 1986 the representative sample was identified using a stratified random sample based on independent variables to avoid corrupting the validation the independent variables used to stratify the basins were thought to be indicative of major controls on the fdc and consisted of the broadest köppen climate classes peel et al 2007 the three major rock types reed and bush 2007 and drainage area categories the validation basins were then randomly selected within the strata and the remaining calibration basins had a similar distribution of independent variables according to descriptive statistics and statistical tests kolmogorov smirnov and mann whitney a map of the calibration and validation basins is provided in fig 2 3 3 independent variables independent variables describing topography land cover soil geology and climate were used to develop regional regression models for predicting the percentile flows topographic variables were derived from the national elevation dataset ned 1 arc second 30 m grid http ned usgs gov and the stream channels for calculating additional topographic variables were acquired from gages ii or the national hydrography dataset plus version 2 nhdplusv2 1 100 000 scale product http www nhdplus com land cover was assessed using the 30 m national land cover dataset nlcd for the year 1992 vogelmann et al 2001 as this was the year of the nlcd that coincided with streamflow data from the most basins the nlcd was used to calculate percent forest cover since synthesis of paired catchment experiments identifies a strong relation between forest cover and annual flow brown et al 2005 a variable describing land cover change may be useful but land cover data was not available for the streamflow time periods of all the basins soil variables were calculated using a multilayer soil characteristics dataset for the contiguous us conus soil which provides the state soil geographic database statsgo as 1 km grids miller and white 1998 geology was summarized using the bfi as the two are known to be strongly correlated price 2011 estimates of bfi were previously generated by wolock 2003 for the contiguous us bfi48grd the 1 km grid was spatially interpolated using bfi values at 8249 gauges with at least ten years of daily streamflow data see wolock 2003 for more information on the methodology although the bfi grid was produced using gauged data it is a pre existing dataset that can be used to create independent variables for predicting the percentile flows of ungauged basins as previously demonstrated dudley 2015 hope and bart 2011 yuan 2013 climatic variables were calculated using 30 years of the precipitation elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism 4 km grids http prism oregonstate edu the only exception was a gages ii variable for the average percent of precipitation delivered as snow from 1901 to 2000 percent snow the other climatic variables used monthly prism data concurrent with the streamflow data for each basin or daily prism data from 1981 to 2010 as the daily data was unavailable for all of the streamflow data and the chosen time period overlapped with the most streamflow data precipitation depths mm were weighted according to the fraction of the grid cell located within the basin boundary the independent variables were organized into three different sets of variables listed in table 1 and named expert e lumped l and distributed d these different sets of variables may include some of the same variables but the number of variables increased for each successive dataset the expert variables included map pet and bfi based on expert assessment of the fdc as discussed in the introduction estimates of pet were calculated using an equation based on temperature proposed in oudin et al 2005 p 300 the oudin et al 2005 equation was used because it is simple and generates similar estimates as other more complex equations the larger sets of 22 lumped and 37 distributed variables were used for a data driven approach to identify the regional regression models the lumped variables mainly described the average of the basin data while the distributed variables expanded on this information using the following types of variables 1 the standard deviation of gridded physical data such as elevation and annual climatic statistics such as precipitation intensity mm d 1 2 the percent forest cover in riparian corridors since they are critical areas for groundwater discharge hope et al 2009 and 3 the amplitude and peak timing of monthly precipitation and pet data described using the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient toth 2013 circular statistics dingman 2002 and first term of the fourier transform dalton 2005 3 4 cluster analysis individual basins are assigned to groups through cluster analysis of independent variables converted into z scores with a mean of zero and variance of one in order to give variables on different scales comparable weight the z scores were used as the weights of input vectors for training the som which was composed of hexagonal neurons i e each neuron has six neighbors arranged in a two dimensional grid the number of neurons in the grid was chosen to be significantly larger than the anticipated number of clusters in order to avoid individual neurons acting as cluster centroids neurons are later linked to basins through computation of the similarity of basin input vectors and neuron output vectors empty neurons not linked to any of the basins through strong similarity were deemed unrepresentative of the input data and limited for the cluster analysis preliminary experiments were performed on the total number of neurons in order to limit the occurrence of empty neurons and this led to the choice of a 15 15 neuron som for all training prior to training the neurons were given a random vector of values equal in length to the number of input variables the neuron vectors were adjusted through an iterative training process that presented the basin data to the som and assigned it to the most similar neuron according to the euclidean distance metric the receiving neuron or best matching unit bmu and its neighbors were modified to more closely match the incoming data using a gaussian neighborhood function and a learning rate that decreased the magnitude of the modifications as the training proceeded neural network training was performed with the som toolbox http www cis hut fi projects somtoolbox using techniques described by vesanto et al 2000 the som was trained using a global and local stage as recommended by kohonen 1990 the global stage used a large neighborhood size 8 neurons relative to the size of the som 15 15 neurons a large learning rate 0 04 which decreased over a short number of runs 50 was used during global training to reveal large structures in the data smaller clusters were then distinguished using a smaller neighborhood 5 neurons and learning rate 0 03 for a longer number of runs 4000 during local training both training stages were run until the neuron vectors converged on the basin data i e the difference between the neurons and basins no longer decreased the trained neuron vectors were then clustered using the k means method cluster centroids were initially given a random vector of values and the neuron vectors were assigned to the cluster centroids according to the euclidean distance metric the cluster centroids were then recalculated using the mean of the neuron vectors assigned to each cluster this process continued until the cluster centroids no longer changed and was repeated 1000 times to prevent the randomly initiated cluster centroids from influencing the performance of the clustering the final cluster solution had the minimum sum of squared euclidean distances between the cluster centroids and neuron vectors the basins were assigned to the neuron clusters according to their bmu i e neuron with the shortest euclidean distance to the basin the number of clusters was evaluated for the cluster solutions with 2 50 clusters the criteria for evaluating the number of clusters were 1 the number of calibration basins per cluster available to develop subsequent regression models and 2 the validity of the clusters in terms of their compactness and separation the final number of clusters was determined as follows 1 the number of clusters for each set of variables was identified using five cluster validity indices i e silhouette davies bouldin xie beni calinski harabasz and dunn as defined in desgraupes 2013 2 cluster solutions from the validity indices with less than 20 calibration basins per cluster were eliminated as recommended by hosking and wallis 1997 3 the largest number of clusters remaining was used to accommodate the large variability of basins in the contiguous us 3 5 regression model development regression models were developed for each group of basins the number of calibration basins in the group dictated the number of independent variables used for the model an independent variable was used for every ten calibration basins as this provides an adequate sample size for estimating regression model parameters without overfitting the model harrell 2001 the regression models were able to use all three of the variables from the expert assessment of the fdc 30 calibration basins per group but a subset of the larger sets of variables lumped and distributed had to be selected for the regression models the lumped and distributed variables were selected using random forests because this approach performed best in a previous study of data driven variable selection methods for percentile flow regression models fouad 2016 pp 55 56 since random forests is not a standard method for selecting the independent variables of a regression model a branch and bound model search miller 2002 was also conducted for a performance comparison the branch and bound search evaluated models based on the sum of squared residuals and number of independent variables in the model if the number of independent variables and residuals increased larger forms of the model with more variables were eliminated this process evaluates more models than a stepwise regression the branch and bound search generated a set of candidate models these models were screened for multicollinearity i e cross correlated independent variables using the variance inflation factor vif which is 2 v i f 1 1 r 2 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination between two independent variables models with a maximum vif 10 were eliminated belsley et al 2004 of the remaining models the one with the greatest coefficient of determination adjusted for differences in the number of independent variables adjusted r 2 was used to predict percentile flows the data driven approach to select independent variables was also executed using random forests random forests were generated for each group using the calibration basins and their percentile flows the calibration basins were randomly sampled to grow regression trees until the error of the percentile flow predictions stabilized for the out of bag sample i e calibration basins excluded from the tree the regression trees recursively split the calibration basins into smaller groups using a series of rules based on the independent variables the percentile flows of the smallest groups were averaged to generate predictions for the out of bag sample the mean squared error mse of out of bag predictions was used as an estimate of variable importance each variable was randomly permuted or essentially removed to grow the regression trees and the increase in mse signified the importance of the variable the variable rankings derived from this process may change due to the random samples used to grow the regression trees as a result the entire process was repeated using 100 random forests and the mean increase in mse was used to rank the lumped and distributed variables for each group of basins the lowest ranked variable included in the regression model was calculated based on the number of calibration basins in the group divided by ten harrell 2001 and rounded down to the nearest whole number the different variable selection methods including expert assessment branch and bound and random forests applied a common form of a regression model for predicting fdc statistics see mohamoud 2008 over et al 2014 sauquet and catalogne 2011 3 l n q i β 0 β 1 i 1 β j i j where the dependent variable q i is the percentile flow i plus a constant of one in order to use the natural log transformation to reduce the skew of the flows and their potential to violate the assumption of homoscedasticity i e evenly varying model residuals i 1 i j are the untransformed or natural log transformed independent variables whether they had a non linear or linear relation to the percentile flow i and β 0 β j are the parameters of the regression model estimated using the ordinary least squares method separate regression models were developed to predict each of the 13 percentile flows q01 q05 q10 q20 q95 q99 calibration basins with a large influence on the regression were removed using the cook s d statistic belsley et al 2004 observations with a cook s d the upper limit of the f distribution at a significance level of 0 1 were removed helsel and hirsch 2002 and regression models were re fit without overly influential calibration basins the above modeling approach does not guarantee the property of the fdc that percentile flows decrease from high to low predicted flows that violated this property were corrected if a flow was predicted at zero or less then all lower percentile flows were adjusted to zero this was the case for 15 of validation basins which is similar to the 19 of validation basins with observed zero flows an additional 16 of validation basins had lower percentile flows that increased percentile flows contributing to this problem were identified and replaced using a linear interpolation between the nearest decreasing flows 3 6 performance evaluation the performance of the regional regression models was evaluated using the percentile flows of the validation basins excluded from regression model development the natural log of the percentile flows was applied to reduce the potential influence of large flows the predictive performance for each percentile flow was quantified using the relative error e coefficient of determination r 2 and nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency n calculated as 4 e p b o b o b 1 5 r 2 b 1 n o b o p b p b 1 n o b o 2 b 1 n p b p 2 2 6 n 1 b 1 n o b p b 2 b 1 n o b o 2 where o b and p b are respectively the observed and predicted percentile flow for basin b o and p are the mean of the observed and predicted percentile flows respectively and n is the number of validation basins a constant of one was added to the denominator of e to accommodate zero flows and the absolute value was used to calculate the sum of e for each percentile flow 4 results the study basins were split into 14 groups using three different sets of variables fig 3 the groups were largely geographically contiguous although the independent variables did not describe the location of the basins the geographic contiguity of the groups signifies that spatial proximity is a strong indicator of similarity between the independent variables notable exceptions were distant areas with similar physical and climatic conditions such as southern appalachia and northern california group 6 of fig 3a and b and mountainous areas with sharp changes in elevation such as the pacific northwest groups 5 and 10 of fig 3 the groups derived using the different sets of variables had some major differences such as an additional group for the rocky mountains when information on snow percent snow was included group 13 of fig 3b and c and the loss of a group in the appalachian mountains group 9 of fig 3a and b when using the distributed variables the differences between the groups could be further characterized by an exploratory analysis like that of ley et al 2011 but the present study was concerned with the effect of using the different sets of variables on regional regression models for predicting percentile flows the rest of the results therefore examine the independent variables used for the regression models and compare the performance of the regression models developed using the different sets of variables to evaluate the hypothesis that a data driven approach with a large number of variables is more effective than an expert assessment of the fdc that uses a small number of variables 4 1 comparison of random forests and branch and bound methods to select the independent variables of regression models a preliminary experiment was conducted to select the data driven approach for selecting independent variables having shown previous success fouad 2016 pp 55 56 random forests was compared to a more conventional regression model procedure based on a branch and bound search both methods were applied to develop regression models for each percentile flow using the lumped variables the results are summarized as the sum of absolute relative error e r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency n for the validation basins table 2 smaller e values signify better predictive performance whereas r 2 and n have a maximum of 1 indicating perfect performance random forests performed better than the branch and bound method for each percentile flow table 2 except for the three lowest percentile flows q90 q99 the sum of absolute e for all percentile flows decreased 5 using random forests average r 2 and n for the percentile flows increased 5 and 7 respectively using random forests the overall increase in performance using random forests justifies its use in this study it should also be noted that random forests did not control for multicollinearity i e cross correlation among independent variables yet it performed better than the branch and bound method that screened models for multicollinearity the reason for this result is that multicollinearity does not affect predictions on a validation dataset with similar multicollinearity as the calibration dataset harrell 2001 4 2 independent variables selected for the regression models using random forests the data driven approach used random forests to select a subset of the most important lumped or distributed variables for the regression models and the percent of the models that included each variable was used to rank the importance of the variables for predicting high q01 q20 average q30 q70 and low q80 q99 percentile flows table 3 the most frequently selected variable was bfi the expert assessment of the fdc identified bfi as an important variable for flows other than the highest flows generated by storms but bfi was the most important variable for predicting the entire fdc including the highest flows the other variables selected by the expert assessment of the fdc map and pet were among the top five most selected variables these variables were also frequently used when combined as aridity pet map the remaining frequently selected variables in table 3 described snow accumulation and melt percent snow and spring temp subsurface drainage poorly drained and mean elevation elev the snow related variables were frequently used for snow dominated groups for instance the rocky mountains groups 12 and 13 included the snow related variables in 62 of the models the importance of subsurface drainage was previously highlighted by bfi and is further demonstrated by the frequent use of a variable describing the percent of the basin covered in poorly drained nrcs 2007 groups c and d soils poorly drained mean elevation was frequently used for the regression models but other topographic variables such as mean slope and drainage density were not frequently used which is noteworthy as these variables have been widely used to predict percentile flows the distributed variables included additional variables for describing the within basin statistical distribution of independent variables but these variables were largely absent from the regression models table 3 only two of these variables precip seasonality and aridity sd were among the top five most selected variables this indicates that using the distributed variables had little effect on the performance of the regression models see the next section for those results the more frequently used lumped variables i e basin averages were stronger predictors of the percentile flows and the additional variables on the distribution of the basin data may have been statistically redundant i e cross correlated with the lumped variables the statistical redundancy i e multicollinearity of the independent variables in each regression model was evaluated using the maximum vif table 4 a vif 10 indicates multicollinearity among independent variables belsley et al 2004 regression models developed using the lumped and distributed variables had multicollinearity some may object to this however the goal of this study was to generate the best regression models for predicting percentile flows an alternative branch and bound regression modeling approach that controlled for multicollinearity was evaluated but did not perform as well as random forests table 2 this illustrates that multicollinearity has little bearing on predictions if a representative sample is used for model calibration and multicollinearity is similar in both the calibration and validation datasets harrell 2001 multicollinearity was inspected here to assess the redundancy of the different sets of independent variables the three independent variables selected based on an expert assessment were not redundant as indicated by a vif 10 table 4 the larger sets of lumped and distributed variables used in the data driven approach introduced multicollinearity multicollinearity increased for larger sets of variables from left to right in table 4 according to mean vif this result implies that the additional variables were statistically redundant and contributed little predictive information to the regression models the effect of the variables on model performance is evaluated in the following section 4 3 regression model performance the performance of the regression models was evaluated to identify a parsimonious set of variables expert lumped or distributed and create a tool for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us regression model performance in calibration goodness of fit was assessed using adjusted r 2 to compare models with a different number of independent variables the distribution of adjusted r 2 values is shown in fig 4 the smallest adjusted r 2 values of the regression models were produced using the smallest set of variables expert while the larger sets of variables lumped and distributed had similar adjusted r 2 values although adjusted r 2 considers the number of variables in a model it can still favor larger models greene 2003 calibration performance as measured by adjusted r 2 was influenced by the number of variables in the models an adjusted r 2 0 75 good according to castellarin et al 2004 was obtained by 3 3 10 4 and 13 7 of the models developed using the expert lumped and distributed variables respectively the same order of variables explained over half of the variance in the percentile flows for 25 3 61 5 and 62 1 of the models the median adjusted r 2 of the models developed using the expert lumped and distributed variables was respectively 0 34 0 56 and 0 58 the predictive performance of the regression models was evaluated using validation basins and summarized for each percentile flow using the sum of absolute e r 2 and n table 5 the sum of absolute e was generally larger for high percentile flows q01 q20 and smaller for low percentile flows q80 q99 the magnitude of the flow may have influenced e the other performance metrics r 2 and n summarized the predictive performance for the percentile flows independent of their magnitude the n values were slightly less than the r 2 values and ranged from 0 43 0 77 for the regression modeling approaches predictive performance peaked toward the middle of the fdc average flows and declined at the tails high and low flows regression modeling approaches were compared to a simple drainage area ratio dar method in which the drainage area of the validation basin is divided by the drainage area of the nearest calibration basin and then multiplied by the flow of the nearest calibration basin over et al 2014 the dar method represents a baseline for comparing the more complex regression modeling approaches performance of the dar method was better than regression modeling for the two highest percentile flows see q01 and q05 in table 5c high flows vary with area the influence of area decreases with the percentile flows as indicated by decreasing n values regression modeling performs better than dar for q10 q99 the performance of the regression modeling was influenced by the different approaches for selecting the independent variables expert assessment or data driven the data driven approach performed better using the lumped variables as opposed to the distributed variables for almost all of the percentile flows table 5 therefore the additional information of the distributed variables i e the statistical distribution of the basin data did not contribute to the performance of the regression models this may be because the additional information was statistically redundant table 4 or produced variables that were not strong predictors of the percentile flows table 3 the hypothesis that the data driven approach would outperform the expert assessment of the fdc was contradicted by the predictive performance for the percentile flows although the data driven approach performed better in calibration fig 4 expert assessment of the fdc achieved similar performance to the data driven approach in validation table 5 the percentile flows at the tails of the fdc high and low flows were predicted better using the three variables of the expert assessment whereas the larger set of lumped variables slightly improved the predictions for the percentile flows in the middle of the fdc the three variables of the expert assessment map pet and bfi explained most of the variance in the percentile flows and little to no additional variance was explained using the larger sets of variables for the data driven approach overall performance of the different approaches is summarized by the sum of absolute e and mean r 2 and n for all the percentile flows table 6 regression modeling approaches performed better than dar overall the expert assessment had similar overall performance to the data driven approaches i e lumped and distributed yet it required less computational effort i e calculating and selecting variables the simple regression models of the expert assessment consisted of map pet and bfi and only need these readily available values to predict the percentile flows for ungauged basins in the contiguous us the performance of the expert assessment was lower than prior work for southern new england archfield et al 2007 and the mid atlantic mohamoud 2008 with r 2 and n values of approximately 0 9 however these prior works were conducted with a smaller sample of validation basins the expert assessment had a mean absolute e of 0 06 for q80 in the basin group including southern and central california which was smaller better than a previous study in that region hope and bart 2011 a number of statewide studies have been conducted to build the streamstats application mentioned in the introduction ries 2007 streamstats and associated studies express uncertainty as the 90 confidence interval of the estimate a value influenced by sample size helsel and hirsch 2002 performance of streamstats models in validation is not reported thus a comparison of validation results in this study to previous streamstats studies was not possible the streamstats application can be used to generate predictions for ungauged basins but performance of the predictions could not be evaluated here since the validation basins of this study may have been used to develop the models of streamstats an independent validation analysis of streamstats versus other applications for predicting percentile flows of ungauged basins should be the subject of future work the focus of this study was to compare different approaches for selecting independent variables used for regional regression modeling of percentile flows the outcome was that expert assessment was identified as a parsimonious approach for creating regional regression models due to its simplicity and overall performance regression models based on the expert assessment were used to develop a tool for predicting percentile flows of the contiguous us see the supplementary material section which could be compared to streamstats in a subsequent study 5 discussion 5 1 important variables for predicting the fdc the most important variable for predicting the entire fdc was bfi table 3 the expert assessment of the fdc linked bfi to average and low flows at least partially supplied by subsurface drainage yokoo and sivapalan 2011 but bfi may also be related to the excess precipitation of a basin map pet explaining its ability to predict high flows larger bfi values and high flows may be expected for basins with more excess precipitation and excess precipitation had a statistically significant p value 0 01 correlation with bfi and the representative high flow of q10 spearman s rho of 0 39 and 0 49 respectively the baseflow of a basin may therefore be indirectly related to its potential to produce high flows this is in line with previous findings that the process of infiltration a major control of baseflow also plays a part in controlling floods see gioia et al 2012 among others the top five most selected variables of table 3 included the other variables from the expert assessment of the fdc map and pet a substitute for these variables may be aridity pet map since it was also frequently selected aridity is a measure of the long term water balance that generally represents the proportion of incoming precipitation lost to evapotranspiration high to low flows of the fdc were related to aridity because it influences antecedent moisture and subsurface drainage antecedent moisture moderates the higher flows generated by storms gunkel et al 2015 whereas subsurface drainage provides the lower flows between storms zomlot et al 2015 the long term water balance expressed as aridity has been linked to the variation of the fdc in the contiguous us cheng et al 2012 and may be a more effective means of representing map and pet other important variables for predicting the fdc table 3 included variables representing snow accumulation and melt percent snow and spring temp subsurface drainage poorly drained and mean elevation elev snow accumulation and melt were important for snow dominated basins and closely associated with high flows generated by spring snowmelt solander et al 2017 subsurface drainage represented via poorly drained soils was most strongly related to the low flows a larger percent of poorly drained soils with less subsurface drainage reduced the low flows as illustrated by the statistically significant p value 0 01 negative correlation between poorly drained and q90 pearson s r of 0 38 elevation is an integrative variable that was likely important because it covaries with other important factors such as precipitation daly et al 2008 snowfall grünewald et al 2014 and baseflow rumsey et al 2015 largely absent from the important variables listed in table 3 are the distributed variables that describe the statistical distribution of spatial and temporal basin data this is either because basin averages provide better information for predicting percentile flows table 3 or distributed variables mainly add redundant information to the regression models table 4 5 2 improving performance of percentile flow predictions the performance of the regression models was strongest for percentile flows in the middle of the fdc average flows and poorest for percentile flows toward the tails of the fdc high and low flows this is a commonly noted pattern in other fdc regionalization studies see hope and bart 2012 mohamoud 2008 sauquet and catalogne 2011 poorer performance toward the tails may be attributed to the large variability of basin responses to storms that generate high flows and the challenge of representing the contribution of subsurface drainage to low flows salinas et al 2013 the predictive performance for the high and low flows may have been improved by using additional independent variables high flows are the product of storms which were represented by intensity mm d 1 and maximum events largest 1 day totals however these variables precip intensity and precip 1d max were not frequently used for the regression models table 3 and additional information on the frequency and magnitude of storms may have been useful this information could be represented using a precipitation duration curve pdc derived like a fdc the pdc has previously been effective at reconstructing the high end of the fdc yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and may be equally effective at yielding independent variables i e precipitation percentiles for predicting high flows the frequency of rainy days e g rainy days y 1 may also be informative as an indicator of average antecedent moisture conditions which mediate the high flows generated by storms physical factors also play a role in mediating high flows through interception and infiltration land cover provides readily available information on these physical factors but may have been underrepresented in this study percent forest cover forest was the only land cover variable and it was not frequently used to predict high flows table 3 additional land cover variables specifically targeting the processes of interception e g tree canopy density and infiltration e g natural impervious area may have improved high flow predictions such variables could be developed using remote sensing technology and evaluated for their potential to predict high flows additional independent variables may also have benefited the prediction of low flows controlled by subsurface drainage variables describing subsurface drainage bfi and poorly drained were among the most strongly associated variables to low flows table 3 subsurface drainage could be further characterized using the soil datasets of gssurgo from the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service a hydrologically relevant geologic hydrogeologic classification may also be useful in describing subsurface drainage a hydrogeologic classification of the pacific northwest was previously linked to summer low flows tague and grant 2004 and this prompts the hypothesis that groups of basins identified using a hydrogeologic classification may improve subsequent low flow predictions subsurface drainage may also be characterized by the storage properties of regional aquifers these properties e g aquifer thickness have been mapped for regional aquifers using spatial interpolation methods see williams and dixon 2015 among others and may indicate the contribution of aquifers to low flows the low flows of this study included zero flows which are notably difficult to predict snelder et al 2013 and may require modeling schemes designed to accommodate intermittent streams hope and bart 2011 the expert assessment produced similar performance to more complex data driven approaches table 6 and was thus identified as a parsimonious approach to develop regional regression models regression models of the expert assessment may have been improved by combining map and pet as aridity since this variable was an effective substitute frequently used in the data driven regression models table 3 the third variable of the expert assessment could then target the more challenging to predict high or low flows for instance the high flows may be explained using a variable describing the variability of large storms e g slope of the pdc above the 20th percentile and the low flows may be associated with the percent of the basin underlain by a general hydrogeologic class such as unconsolidated material the uncertainty of the percentile flow predictions may be attributed to the regression modeling approach regression models for individual percentile flows did not preserve the order of percentile flows from high to low this was corrected by forcing lower percentile flows to zero after a predicted flow of zero or less and linearly interpolating between the nearest decreasing percentile flows an alternative approach could be used to enforce the order of percentile flows such as predicting the percent of zero flows and statistical distribution of nonzero flows hope and bart 2011 regression models are sensitive to outliers in the data harrell 2001 outliers were removed using the cook s d statistic helsel and hirsch 2002 however more complex machine learning methods such as neural networks may be able to incorporate the information from outliers without influencing the entire fit of the model dawson and wilby 2001 neural networks are also known for their ability to capture the non linear relations of hydrologic data abrahart and see 2007 and should be evaluated for the modeling of percentile flows the regression modeling approach did not address the multicollinearity of the independent variables according to the maximum vif between variables of a model table 4 the expert assessment had an acceptable level of multicollinearity vif 10 and the lumped variables had an unacceptable level of multicollinearity vif 10 however both regression modeling approaches had similar performance in validation multicollinearity may have had little effect on model performance because the regression models were calibrated using a representative sample of basins harrell 2001 it is important to apply the regression models on basins within the range of conditions in the calibration basins and this matter is addressed in the predictive tool described in the following section multicollinearity can be problematic for predictions in basins with different multicollinearity than the calibration basins a recent study found that methods for managing multicollinearity in regression models such as model screening principal component regression and partial least squares regression are not effective at improving model performance kroll and song 2013 machine learning methods like random forests may be more tolerant to differences in multicollinearity dormann et al 2013 and as a result produce models that can be transferred to a random basin with more confidence machine learning represents a large suite of methods to potentially deal with outliers and multicollinearity despite the potential advantages of machine learning methods regression was applied in this study to produce simple models which could then be converted into a tool for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us see the next section on supplementary material 6 supplementary material conus percentile flow predictor the supplementary material for this paper provides the contiguous us conus percentile flow predictor an open source r graphical user interface for predicting 13 percentile flows q01 q05 q10 q20 q95 q99 of ungauged basins the tool uses regression models developed based on 734 calibration basins in the contiguous us and a set of parsimonious independent variables identified through expert assessment of the fdc input data includes map and pet calculated using long term prism data http prism oregonstate edu and bfi based on a grid for the contiguous us http water usgs gov lookup getspatial bfi48grd for convenience map and pet grids have been calculated using data from 1981 to 2010 and are provided with the aforementioned bfi grid in the supplementary material input data should be within the range of the data used to create the conus percentile flow predictor table 7 and a warning is generated if the input data is outside of this range the percentile flows of the ungauged basin are predicted by first assigning the basin to a group fig 3a and then solving the regression equations for the assigned group the groups were identified using the som and the ungauged basin is assigned to the som neuron with the shortest euclidean distance between the neuron vector and input data the group membership of the neuron is then used for the ungauged basin the regression models of that group are used to predict the percentile flows the percentile flows were normalized using the mean of nonzero daily flows i e the index flow and natural log transformed to develop the regression models the predictions are converted into cubic meters per second using the index flow and the duan 1983 smearing estimate to back transform the percentile flows the index flow is predicted using regression models developed the same way as the percentile flows the index flow and duan 1983 smearing estimate are only used in the tool to generate predictions in cubic meters per second and were not applied in the comparison of methods conducted in this study output of the tool can be generated for multiple ungauged basins and the predictions are accompanied by statistics on the performance of the regression models adjusted r 2 maximum vif and standard error se of the model the predicted percentile flows can be used to reconstruct the complete fdc through an interpolation method such as the one in mohamoud 2008 the conus percentile flow predictor is provided with a metadata file readme txt including instructions on how to use the tool regression models used to create the conus percentile flow predictor are provided with associated statistics in tabular form for use in a variety of software packages 7 conclusions regional regression models were developed to predict percentile flows for the contiguous us the two steps of a regional regression i e identifying groups of basins and developing models depend on the independent variables used to summarize the physical and climatic data of the basins this study compared the following two approaches for selecting the independent variables 1 an expert assessment of the factors that control the fdc to identify a small number of variables and 2 a data driven approach with many variables possibly linked to the fdc the data driven approach was performed using lumped variables i e basin averages and a larger set of distributed variables i e basin averages and statistical distribution the lumped variables were used in a preliminary experiment to compare two data driven approaches based on random forests and a more conventional branch and bound regression model procedure random forests achieved better overall performance for predicting the percentile flows and was used for the data driven approach in this study an expert assessment and data driven approach were used to select the independent variables of percentile flow regression models the underlying hypothesis of this study was that the data driven approach would produce better regression models for predicting the percentile flows this was contradicted by the results of the performance evaluation the predictive performance of the expert assessment mean n 0 66 was similar to the data driven approach using the lumped variables mean n 0 66 and slightly better than the data driven models derived from the distributed variables mean n 0 62 regression modeling approaches performed better than a simple dar method mean n 0 58 however the dar method performed the best for the two highest flows indicating that drainage area is a strong predictor of high flows the additional information of the distributed variables i e the statistical distribution of the basin data did not contribute to the regression models because it was redundant and less important than the lumped variables the expert assessment included three variables map pet and bfi and performed similarly to the 22 lumped variables this signifies that many of the lumped variables were either redundant or otherwise not useful with the exception of mean elevation topographic variables widely used in fdc regionalization studies were not useful predictors of percentile flows an important predictor of percentile flows was aridity pet map which could have been used as a substitute for map and pet in the expert assessment another variable alongside aridity and bfi could be evaluated to possibly improve performance of the expert assessment the expert assessment produced simple models that did not decrease predictive performance and was deemed effective for selecting the independent variables of the regional regression the regression models can be easily used to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins based on map pet and bfi and were used to create a tool for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us see the supplementary material for this paper the conus percentile flow predictor generates predictions for the 13 percentile flows of this study along with estimates of the predictive uncertainty the regional regression was used to predict high to low percentile flows q01 q99 predictive performance of regression models was the worst for the percentile flows at the tails of the fdc high and low flows the highest predictive performance for these flows was obtained using the three variables of the expert assessment and the other variables used in this study did not improve the high and low flow predictions additional variables may have been needed to characterize the magnitude of storms that drive high flows e g precipitation percentiles and the potential contribution of subsurface drainage to low flows e g aquifer thickness the development of new variables may also be in order to characterize factors such as the spatial variability of storms zoccatelli et al 2011 and groundwater levels costelloe et al 2015 the low flow predictions may also have been improved using a modeling scheme that takes the percent of zero flows into account hope and bart 2011 the percentile flow predictions may have been improved by modeling methods other than regression the strongest predictor of the percentile flows was bfi and this was derived from a gridded product for the contiguous us that was spatially interpolated between stream gauges a similar spatial interpolation approach could be used to predict percentile flows and has outperformed regression in a previous study archfield et al 2013 the output of the spatial interpolation could be served as a data product for predicting the percentile flows of ungauged basins regression may also be outperformed by neural networks that are more resilient to the noise and non linearity of hydrologic data hall et al 2002 neural networks such as the som could be used to cluster the basins and generate percentile flow predictions in one step this would eliminate the need to identify groups of basins for percentile flow modeling and should be evaluated in future studies conflict of interest none potential referees

climatic characteristics the research question investigated how the number and information content of independent variables affected model performance and compared data driven versus expert assessment approaches for variable selection new hydrological insights for the region a set of three variables selected based on an expert assessment of factors that influence percentile flows performed similarly to larger sets of variables selected using a data driven method expert assessment variables included mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and baseflow index larger sets of up to 37 variables contributed little if any additional predictive information variables used to describe the distribution of basin data e g standard deviation were not useful and average values were sufficient to characterize physical and climatic basin conditions effectiveness of the expert assessment variables may be due to the high degree of multicollinearity i e cross correlation among

over et al 2014 transportation engineering dudley 2015 and drought planning miller and fox 2017 these operations are often conducted without observed percentile flows as most basins are ungauged in this case regionalization procedures are typically adopted to predict percentile flows based on information from gauged basins a common type of regionalization procedure develops regression models that relate observed percentile flows to independent variables derived from physical and climatic basin data see hope and bart 2011 mohamoud 2008 over et al 2014 hydrologic models based on predicted parameters and climatic forcing data are an alternative to derive percentile flows westerberg et al 2014 however the simplicity of using regression models presents an opportunity to provide a tool to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins regression models are known to perform poorly for study areas with a large variance in percentile flows such as the contiguous united states us to reduce the variance in percentile flows separate regression models are developed for groups of basins in a process called regional regression modeling sauquet and catalogne 2011 a typical regional regression first splits the basins into groups using cluster analysis and then develops regression models for each group independent variables such as mean elevation and precipitation are used to identify the groups and parameters of the regression models despite the long standing tradition of regional regression modeling in hydrology few studies have investigated the effect of using different sets of independent variables on the final performance of predictions independent variables can be selected using different approaches the tendency of recent studies is to use many independent variables in a data driven approach see di prinzio et al 2011 over et al 2014 sauquet and catalogne 2011 whereas older studies justify the use of few variables through expert assessment see dingman 1978 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 singh 1971 an expert assessment of independent variables has more potential following the decade on predictions in ungauged basins sivapalan et al 2003 in which a variety of studies identified key variables related to the overall shape of the fdc castellarin et al 2013 a study comparing recently developed physical understanding of the fdc to a data driven approach for selecting independent variables would contribute valuable information to the problem of identifying a generalized solution to predict the fdc in ungauged basins regional regression modeling has been used to predict percentile flows in the us see archfield et al 2007 hope and bart 2011 mohamoud 2008 these studies have focused on particular geographic regions of the us such as southern new england archfield et al 2007 southern and central california hope and bart 2011 and the mid atlantic mohamoud 2008 the national streamflow statistics program of the us geological survey has developed an application for predicting percentile flows called streamstats ries 2007 however it does not cover the contiguous us and regression models were developed for states rather than grouping basins based on characteristics related to flow previous work such as streamstats has been performed for parts of the us although physical and climatic data now exist to develop regional regression models for the contiguous us in this study independent variables are derived to cluster basins in the contiguous us and develop regression models for subsequent groups of basins the resulting models are used as a tool to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins in the contiguous us 1 1 independent variables for regional regression modeling independent variables summarize physical and climatic basin data and serve as the foundation for regional regression modeling both steps of regional regression modeling basin grouping and model development depend on the independent variables chosen to represent the basins despite the importance of independent variables prior studies have primarily evaluated the use of different cluster analyses see di prinzio et al 2011 laaha and blöschl 2006 sauquet and catalogne 2011 and modeling methods see archfield et al 2007 holmes et al 2002 over et al 2014 rather than the input information of the overall regional regression approach a limited number of studies have examined the input information for regional regression modeling of percentile flows these studies have either investigated how to select independent variables from a large number of possible variables ssegane et al 2012a b or experimented with the initial set of variables to assess the predictive potential of a certain type of variable hope and bart 2012 ilorme 2011 a two part study compared the performance of different variable selection methods for clustering basins ssegane et al 2012a and modeling percentile flows ssegane et al 2012b these studies revealed the importance of different variables through the variable selection process i e more important variables were selected more often the importance of different variables can also be evaluated by changing the initial set of variables and assessing the difference in model performance this approach has been used to evaluate the importance of variables describing vegetation cover hope and bart 2012 and the spatial distribution of land surface data ilorme 2011 both of these studies reported only minor differences in model performance after changing the initial set of variables however the study involving the spatial distribution of land surface data could be expanded to include information on climate and geology as these are dominant controls on the fdc yokoo and sivapalan 2011 studies that evaluate different types of variables such as hope and bart 2012 and ilorme 2011 highlight the uncertainty of selecting the initial set of variables for a regional regression approach the approach for selecting the initial set of variables has evolved over the long history of regional regression studies early studies used a small number of variables due to the scarcity of spatially distributed data see dingman 1978 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 singh 1971 these studies included all of the variables in the regression models and attempted to target variables with a strong physical connection to the fdc this early approach to selecting variables could be implemented using contemporary data sources that provide more physical and climatic information variables derived from such data could be selected through an expert assessment of the dominant controls on the fdc an expert assessment of the fdc would select a small number of variables according to a physical understanding of the curve which can be summarized as follows the highest and lowest flows are respectively generated by storms and subsurface drainage and flows in between are a mixture of these sources moderated by evapotranspiration losses summary based on the work of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 with this understanding the climatic controls of the fdc could be summarized by mean annual precipitation map and potential evapotranspiration pet while subsurface drainage could be represented by baseflow index bfi values that describe the percent of streamflow attributed to groundwater discharge drainage area is not included in this expert assessment because normalizing the fdc by a streamflow magnitude controls for the effects of drainage area hope and bart 2011 a recent review of the fdc regionalization problem suggests the use of this type of physical understanding to select independent variables castellarin et al 2013 although bfi values are derived at gauged points they can be interpolated to produce spatially distributed data such as a gridded product for the contiguous us wolock 2003 this data can then be used to create independent variables for regional regression models despite the recent suggestion to select independent variables based on physical understanding castellarin et al 2013 many studies of late have opted to use a large number of independent variables e g over et al 2014 evaluated 21 variables in a data driven approach that attempts to account for more complex and nuanced relations to percentile flows than may be anticipated through an expert assessment all of the variables are first used to cluster the basins and then a subset of the variables is selected to model the percentile flows for each group of basins see di prinzio et al 2011 laaha and blöschl 2006 and sauquet and catalogne 2011 for examples the variables used in these studies may describe the average of the basin data via a single lumped value or the statistical distribution of the basin data via multiple distributed values the latter set of variables describes the spatial distribution of physical data such as topography and geology and the temporal distribution of climatic data this information describes factors potentially associated with streamflow generation such as the variability of subsurface drainage conditions tague and grant 2004 or dispersion of precipitation throughout the year i e seasonality ye et al 2012 distributed variables produce the largest set of variables for regional regression modeling and are thought to be advantageous for accommodating a large variety of relations to the percentile flows 2 research objective and question the objective of this research was to create regional regression models for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us the steps to complete this objective included 1 grouping basins and 2 developing regression models for each group of basins both of these steps were based on independent variables that summarized the physical and climatic data of the basins the approach used to select the independent variables may influence the performance of the regression models a small number of variables could be selected according to an expert assessment of the dominant controls on the fdc or a data driven approach could be adopted to account for many possible relations to the percentile flows using a large number of variables both of these approaches were applied to create the regional regression models the difference in performance was then evaluated to answer the following research question how does the performance of regional regression models for predicting percentile flows differ when using an expert assessment to select a small number of variables versus a data driven approach involving a large number of variables the hypothesis investigated in this study was that the data driven approach would produce better regression models because the large number of variables may account for nuanced relations to the percentile flows not anticipated by the expert assessment a performance evaluation was conducted to test this hypothesis and identify a parsimonious approach for creating the regional regression models these models were then used to develop a tool for predicting the percentile flows of ungauged basins in the contiguous us 3 methods 3 1 overview regional regression models were created using three different sets of independent variables 1 a limited number of variables identified through expert assessment 2 an expanded number of lumped variables and 3 a larger number of distributed variables the first set of variables was selected based on the expert assessment outlined in the introduction and included map pet and bfi herein referred to as expert variables all of the expert variables were used in the regional regression models larger sets of variables were used in a data driven approach to identify the regional regression models a set of lumped variables was used to describe the averages of data for each basin while distributed variables described both the average and distribution of the basin data in space and time a subset of the lumped and distributed variables was selected for the regional regression models using a regression tree method called random forests breiman 2001 to rank the predictive potential of the variables random forests was used as it produced the best regression models for predicting percentile flows in a previous study of data driven variable selection methods fouad 2016 pp 55 56 a preliminary experiment is also conducted here to compare random forests to a regression model procedure based on a branch and bound model search miller 2002 the different sets of variables were used in a cluster analysis to split the basins into groups as a precursor to cluster analysis the variables were processed by a neural network called the self organizing map som noise i e variance unrelated to the actual value and non linearities characterize hydrologic data to address these issues the som is used before cluster analysis see boscarello et al 2015 di prinzio et al 2011 toth 2013 basin values are used to train a som consisting of neurons each neuron has a vector the same length as the number of input basin values neuron vectors converge on the input data during training the training process acts like a smoothing function that reduces noise output neuron vectors also incorporate linear and non linear features of the input data the neuron vectors are then used for multivariate clustering which ultimately leads to the grouping of basins including non linearities and less noise statistical assumptions like a probability distribution do not apply to the som since the training process produces neurons that emulate the input data however the training process does involve some assumptions including the number of neurons and training parameters such as the number of runs i e times the input data is presented to the som the number of neurons was chosen based on the number of neurons not associated with a basin and therefore not linked to the input data training parameters were set to ensure that the neurons converged on the input data the k means clustering method was applied to the trained neuron vectors because the k means method identifies clusters similar to how the data is organized in the som skupin 2004 the basins were then assigned to the neuron clusters using the neuron with the vector that best matched the basin data i e best matching unit groups of basins identified based on the som were used to develop regression models for predicting percentile flows this was accomplished using a set of calibration basins outliers were removed from the calibration basins using the cook s d statistic helsel and hirsch 2002 to finalize the regression models models were applied to an independent set of validation basins predictions for the validation basins were corrected to maintain the decreasing order of percentile flows performance of the predictions was then evaluated the entire process of 1 identifying groups of basins 2 developing regression models and 3 evaluating predictive performance was repeated using the three different sets of independent variables expert lumped and distributed the performance evaluation was used to identify a parsimonious set of variables for creating the regional regression models and a tool based on these models was developed to predict percentile flows for the contiguous us the entire regional regression study is summarized as a flow chart in fig 1 3 2 basins and percentile flows all basins used in this study were located in the contiguous us and were selected based on being classified as near natural by the us geological survey s gages ii database the near natural class consists of basins with little human influences to the flow of water see falcone 2011 for more details near natural basins with at least 30 years of continuous daily streamflow data were used to calculate 13 percentile flows including the high flows exceeded 1 and 5 of the time q01 and q05 low flows exceeded 95 and 99 of the time q95 and q99 and decile values between those flows q10 q20 q90 streamflow data was downloaded from the national water information system http waterdata usgs gov nwis daily data for 30 years was used to calculate percentile flows reasonably stable for different time periods kennard et al 2010 percentile flows were calculated for 918 near natural basins using the weibull plotting position to identify the percent of time that a given flow was equaled or exceeded p as follows 1 p r n 1 100 where r is the rank of the daily flow according to its magnitude n is the total number of daily flow values and the flows were normalized using the mean of nonzero values as in hope and bart 2011 to control for differences in magnitude between the basins a subset of validation basins was used to evaluate the performance of the regression models the validation included 184 20 of the basins which meets the recommendation that the validation should have at least 100 samples for a continuous dependent variable such as percentile flows harrell 2001 the sample of validation basins was selected using a proxy basin approach to identify a sample of basins representative of the remaining calibration basins used to develop the regression models klemeš 1986 the representative sample was identified using a stratified random sample based on independent variables to avoid corrupting the validation the independent variables used to stratify the basins were thought to be indicative of major controls on the fdc and consisted of the broadest köppen climate classes peel et al 2007 the three major rock types reed and bush 2007 and drainage area categories the validation basins were then randomly selected within the strata and the remaining calibration basins had a similar distribution of independent variables according to descriptive statistics and statistical tests kolmogorov smirnov and mann whitney a map of the calibration and validation basins is provided in fig 2 3 3 independent variables independent variables describing topography land cover soil geology and climate were used to develop regional regression models for predicting the percentile flows topographic variables were derived from the national elevation dataset ned 1 arc second 30 m grid http ned usgs gov and the stream channels for calculating additional topographic variables were acquired from gages ii or the national hydrography dataset plus version 2 nhdplusv2 1 100 000 scale product http www nhdplus com land cover was assessed using the 30 m national land cover dataset nlcd for the year 1992 vogelmann et al 2001 as this was the year of the nlcd that coincided with streamflow data from the most basins the nlcd was used to calculate percent forest cover since synthesis of paired catchment experiments identifies a strong relation between forest cover and annual flow brown et al 2005 a variable describing land cover change may be useful but land cover data was not available for the streamflow time periods of all the basins soil variables were calculated using a multilayer soil characteristics dataset for the contiguous us conus soil which provides the state soil geographic database statsgo as 1 km grids miller and white 1998 geology was summarized using the bfi as the two are known to be strongly correlated price 2011 estimates of bfi were previously generated by wolock 2003 for the contiguous us bfi48grd the 1 km grid was spatially interpolated using bfi values at 8249 gauges with at least ten years of daily streamflow data see wolock 2003 for more information on the methodology although the bfi grid was produced using gauged data it is a pre existing dataset that can be used to create independent variables for predicting the percentile flows of ungauged basins as previously demonstrated dudley 2015 hope and bart 2011 yuan 2013 climatic variables were calculated using 30 years of the precipitation elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism 4 km grids http prism oregonstate edu the only exception was a gages ii variable for the average percent of precipitation delivered as snow from 1901 to 2000 percent snow the other climatic variables used monthly prism data concurrent with the streamflow data for each basin or daily prism data from 1981 to 2010 as the daily data was unavailable for all of the streamflow data and the chosen time period overlapped with the most streamflow data precipitation depths mm were weighted according to the fraction of the grid cell located within the basin boundary the independent variables were organized into three different sets of variables listed in table 1 and named expert e lumped l and distributed d these different sets of variables may include some of the same variables but the number of variables increased for each successive dataset the expert variables included map pet and bfi based on expert assessment of the fdc as discussed in the introduction estimates of pet were calculated using an equation based on temperature proposed in oudin et al 2005 p 300 the oudin et al 2005 equation was used because it is simple and generates similar estimates as other more complex equations the larger sets of 22 lumped and 37 distributed variables were used for a data driven approach to identify the regional regression models the lumped variables mainly described the average of the basin data while the distributed variables expanded on this information using the following types of variables 1 the standard deviation of gridded physical data such as elevation and annual climatic statistics such as precipitation intensity mm d 1 2 the percent forest cover in riparian corridors since they are critical areas for groundwater discharge hope et al 2009 and 3 the amplitude and peak timing of monthly precipitation and pet data described using the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient toth 2013 circular statistics dingman 2002 and first term of the fourier transform dalton 2005 3 4 cluster analysis individual basins are assigned to groups through cluster analysis of independent variables converted into z scores with a mean of zero and variance of one in order to give variables on different scales comparable weight the z scores were used as the weights of input vectors for training the som which was composed of hexagonal neurons i e each neuron has six neighbors arranged in a two dimensional grid the number of neurons in the grid was chosen to be significantly larger than the anticipated number of clusters in order to avoid individual neurons acting as cluster centroids neurons are later linked to basins through computation of the similarity of basin input vectors and neuron output vectors empty neurons not linked to any of the basins through strong similarity were deemed unrepresentative of the input data and limited for the cluster analysis preliminary experiments were performed on the total number of neurons in order to limit the occurrence of empty neurons and this led to the choice of a 15 15 neuron som for all training prior to training the neurons were given a random vector of values equal in length to the number of input variables the neuron vectors were adjusted through an iterative training process that presented the basin data to the som and assigned it to the most similar neuron according to the euclidean distance metric the receiving neuron or best matching unit bmu and its neighbors were modified to more closely match the incoming data using a gaussian neighborhood function and a learning rate that decreased the magnitude of the modifications as the training proceeded neural network training was performed with the som toolbox http www cis hut fi projects somtoolbox using techniques described by vesanto et al 2000 the som was trained using a global and local stage as recommended by kohonen 1990 the global stage used a large neighborhood size 8 neurons relative to the size of the som 15 15 neurons a large learning rate 0 04 which decreased over a short number of runs 50 was used during global training to reveal large structures in the data smaller clusters were then distinguished using a smaller neighborhood 5 neurons and learning rate 0 03 for a longer number of runs 4000 during local training both training stages were run until the neuron vectors converged on the basin data i e the difference between the neurons and basins no longer decreased the trained neuron vectors were then clustered using the k means method cluster centroids were initially given a random vector of values and the neuron vectors were assigned to the cluster centroids according to the euclidean distance metric the cluster centroids were then recalculated using the mean of the neuron vectors assigned to each cluster this process continued until the cluster centroids no longer changed and was repeated 1000 times to prevent the randomly initiated cluster centroids from influencing the performance of the clustering the final cluster solution had the minimum sum of squared euclidean distances between the cluster centroids and neuron vectors the basins were assigned to the neuron clusters according to their bmu i e neuron with the shortest euclidean distance to the basin the number of clusters was evaluated for the cluster solutions with 2 50 clusters the criteria for evaluating the number of clusters were 1 the number of calibration basins per cluster available to develop subsequent regression models and 2 the validity of the clusters in terms of their compactness and separation the final number of clusters was determined as follows 1 the number of clusters for each set of variables was identified using five cluster validity indices i e silhouette davies bouldin xie beni calinski harabasz and dunn as defined in desgraupes 2013 2 cluster solutions from the validity indices with less than 20 calibration basins per cluster were eliminated as recommended by hosking and wallis 1997 3 the largest number of clusters remaining was used to accommodate the large variability of basins in the contiguous us 3 5 regression model development regression models were developed for each group of basins the number of calibration basins in the group dictated the number of independent variables used for the model an independent variable was used for every ten calibration basins as this provides an adequate sample size for estimating regression model parameters without overfitting the model harrell 2001 the regression models were able to use all three of the variables from the expert assessment of the fdc 30 calibration basins per group but a subset of the larger sets of variables lumped and distributed had to be selected for the regression models the lumped and distributed variables were selected using random forests because this approach performed best in a previous study of data driven variable selection methods for percentile flow regression models fouad 2016 pp 55 56 since random forests is not a standard method for selecting the independent variables of a regression model a branch and bound model search miller 2002 was also conducted for a performance comparison the branch and bound search evaluated models based on the sum of squared residuals and number of independent variables in the model if the number of independent variables and residuals increased larger forms of the model with more variables were eliminated this process evaluates more models than a stepwise regression the branch and bound search generated a set of candidate models these models were screened for multicollinearity i e cross correlated independent variables using the variance inflation factor vif which is 2 v i f 1 1 r 2 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination between two independent variables models with a maximum vif 10 were eliminated belsley et al 2004 of the remaining models the one with the greatest coefficient of determination adjusted for differences in the number of independent variables adjusted r 2 was used to predict percentile flows the data driven approach to select independent variables was also executed using random forests random forests were generated for each group using the calibration basins and their percentile flows the calibration basins were randomly sampled to grow regression trees until the error of the percentile flow predictions stabilized for the out of bag sample i e calibration basins excluded from the tree the regression trees recursively split the calibration basins into smaller groups using a series of rules based on the independent variables the percentile flows of the smallest groups were averaged to generate predictions for the out of bag sample the mean squared error mse of out of bag predictions was used as an estimate of variable importance each variable was randomly permuted or essentially removed to grow the regression trees and the increase in mse signified the importance of the variable the variable rankings derived from this process may change due to the random samples used to grow the regression trees as a result the entire process was repeated using 100 random forests and the mean increase in mse was used to rank the lumped and distributed variables for each group of basins the lowest ranked variable included in the regression model was calculated based on the number of calibration basins in the group divided by ten harrell 2001 and rounded down to the nearest whole number the different variable selection methods including expert assessment branch and bound and random forests applied a common form of a regression model for predicting fdc statistics see mohamoud 2008 over et al 2014 sauquet and catalogne 2011 3 l n q i β 0 β 1 i 1 β j i j where the dependent variable q i is the percentile flow i plus a constant of one in order to use the natural log transformation to reduce the skew of the flows and their potential to violate the assumption of homoscedasticity i e evenly varying model residuals i 1 i j are the untransformed or natural log transformed independent variables whether they had a non linear or linear relation to the percentile flow i and β 0 β j are the parameters of the regression model estimated using the ordinary least squares method separate regression models were developed to predict each of the 13 percentile flows q01 q05 q10 q20 q95 q99 calibration basins with a large influence on the regression were removed using the cook s d statistic belsley et al 2004 observations with a cook s d the upper limit of the f distribution at a significance level of 0 1 were removed helsel and hirsch 2002 and regression models were re fit without overly influential calibration basins the above modeling approach does not guarantee the property of the fdc that percentile flows decrease from high to low predicted flows that violated this property were corrected if a flow was predicted at zero or less then all lower percentile flows were adjusted to zero this was the case for 15 of validation basins which is similar to the 19 of validation basins with observed zero flows an additional 16 of validation basins had lower percentile flows that increased percentile flows contributing to this problem were identified and replaced using a linear interpolation between the nearest decreasing flows 3 6 performance evaluation the performance of the regional regression models was evaluated using the percentile flows of the validation basins excluded from regression model development the natural log of the percentile flows was applied to reduce the potential influence of large flows the predictive performance for each percentile flow was quantified using the relative error e coefficient of determination r 2 and nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency n calculated as 4 e p b o b o b 1 5 r 2 b 1 n o b o p b p b 1 n o b o 2 b 1 n p b p 2 2 6 n 1 b 1 n o b p b 2 b 1 n o b o 2 where o b and p b are respectively the observed and predicted percentile flow for basin b o and p are the mean of the observed and predicted percentile flows respectively and n is the number of validation basins a constant of one was added to the denominator of e to accommodate zero flows and the absolute value was used to calculate the sum of e for each percentile flow 4 results the study basins were split into 14 groups using three different sets of variables fig 3 the groups were largely geographically contiguous although the independent variables did not describe the location of the basins the geographic contiguity of the groups signifies that spatial proximity is a strong indicator of similarity between the independent variables notable exceptions were distant areas with similar physical and climatic conditions such as southern appalachia and northern california group 6 of fig 3a and b and mountainous areas with sharp changes in elevation such as the pacific northwest groups 5 and 10 of fig 3 the groups derived using the different sets of variables had some major differences such as an additional group for the rocky mountains when information on snow percent snow was included group 13 of fig 3b and c and the loss of a group in the appalachian mountains group 9 of fig 3a and b when using the distributed variables the differences between the groups could be further characterized by an exploratory analysis like that of ley et al 2011 but the present study was concerned with the effect of using the different sets of variables on regional regression models for predicting percentile flows the rest of the results therefore examine the independent variables used for the regression models and compare the performance of the regression models developed using the different sets of variables to evaluate the hypothesis that a data driven approach with a large number of variables is more effective than an expert assessment of the fdc that uses a small number of variables 4 1 comparison of random forests and branch and bound methods to select the independent variables of regression models a preliminary experiment was conducted to select the data driven approach for selecting independent variables having shown previous success fouad 2016 pp 55 56 random forests was compared to a more conventional regression model procedure based on a branch and bound search both methods were applied to develop regression models for each percentile flow using the lumped variables the results are summarized as the sum of absolute relative error e r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency n for the validation basins table 2 smaller e values signify better predictive performance whereas r 2 and n have a maximum of 1 indicating perfect performance random forests performed better than the branch and bound method for each percentile flow table 2 except for the three lowest percentile flows q90 q99 the sum of absolute e for all percentile flows decreased 5 using random forests average r 2 and n for the percentile flows increased 5 and 7 respectively using random forests the overall increase in performance using random forests justifies its use in this study it should also be noted that random forests did not control for multicollinearity i e cross correlation among independent variables yet it performed better than the branch and bound method that screened models for multicollinearity the reason for this result is that multicollinearity does not affect predictions on a validation dataset with similar multicollinearity as the calibration dataset harrell 2001 4 2 independent variables selected for the regression models using random forests the data driven approach used random forests to select a subset of the most important lumped or distributed variables for the regression models and the percent of the models that included each variable was used to rank the importance of the variables for predicting high q01 q20 average q30 q70 and low q80 q99 percentile flows table 3 the most frequently selected variable was bfi the expert assessment of the fdc identified bfi as an important variable for flows other than the highest flows generated by storms but bfi was the most important variable for predicting the entire fdc including the highest flows the other variables selected by the expert assessment of the fdc map and pet were among the top five most selected variables these variables were also frequently used when combined as aridity pet map the remaining frequently selected variables in table 3 described snow accumulation and melt percent snow and spring temp subsurface drainage poorly drained and mean elevation elev the snow related variables were frequently used for snow dominated groups for instance the rocky mountains groups 12 and 13 included the snow related variables in 62 of the models the importance of subsurface drainage was previously highlighted by bfi and is further demonstrated by the frequent use of a variable describing the percent of the basin covered in poorly drained nrcs 2007 groups c and d soils poorly drained mean elevation was frequently used for the regression models but other topographic variables such as mean slope and drainage density were not frequently used which is noteworthy as these variables have been widely used to predict percentile flows the distributed variables included additional variables for describing the within basin statistical distribution of independent variables but these variables were largely absent from the regression models table 3 only two of these variables precip seasonality and aridity sd were among the top five most selected variables this indicates that using the distributed variables had little effect on the performance of the regression models see the next section for those results the more frequently used lumped variables i e basin averages were stronger predictors of the percentile flows and the additional variables on the distribution of the basin data may have been statistically redundant i e cross correlated with the lumped variables the statistical redundancy i e multicollinearity of the independent variables in each regression model was evaluated using the maximum vif table 4 a vif 10 indicates multicollinearity among independent variables belsley et al 2004 regression models developed using the lumped and distributed variables had multicollinearity some may object to this however the goal of this study was to generate the best regression models for predicting percentile flows an alternative branch and bound regression modeling approach that controlled for multicollinearity was evaluated but did not perform as well as random forests table 2 this illustrates that multicollinearity has little bearing on predictions if a representative sample is used for model calibration and multicollinearity is similar in both the calibration and validation datasets harrell 2001 multicollinearity was inspected here to assess the redundancy of the different sets of independent variables the three independent variables selected based on an expert assessment were not redundant as indicated by a vif 10 table 4 the larger sets of lumped and distributed variables used in the data driven approach introduced multicollinearity multicollinearity increased for larger sets of variables from left to right in table 4 according to mean vif this result implies that the additional variables were statistically redundant and contributed little predictive information to the regression models the effect of the variables on model performance is evaluated in the following section 4 3 regression model performance the performance of the regression models was evaluated to identify a parsimonious set of variables expert lumped or distributed and create a tool for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us regression model performance in calibration goodness of fit was assessed using adjusted r 2 to compare models with a different number of independent variables the distribution of adjusted r 2 values is shown in fig 4 the smallest adjusted r 2 values of the regression models were produced using the smallest set of variables expert while the larger sets of variables lumped and distributed had similar adjusted r 2 values although adjusted r 2 considers the number of variables in a model it can still favor larger models greene 2003 calibration performance as measured by adjusted r 2 was influenced by the number of variables in the models an adjusted r 2 0 75 good according to castellarin et al 2004 was obtained by 3 3 10 4 and 13 7 of the models developed using the expert lumped and distributed variables respectively the same order of variables explained over half of the variance in the percentile flows for 25 3 61 5 and 62 1 of the models the median adjusted r 2 of the models developed using the expert lumped and distributed variables was respectively 0 34 0 56 and 0 58 the predictive performance of the regression models was evaluated using validation basins and summarized for each percentile flow using the sum of absolute e r 2 and n table 5 the sum of absolute e was generally larger for high percentile flows q01 q20 and smaller for low percentile flows q80 q99 the magnitude of the flow may have influenced e the other performance metrics r 2 and n summarized the predictive performance for the percentile flows independent of their magnitude the n values were slightly less than the r 2 values and ranged from 0 43 0 77 for the regression modeling approaches predictive performance peaked toward the middle of the fdc average flows and declined at the tails high and low flows regression modeling approaches were compared to a simple drainage area ratio dar method in which the drainage area of the validation basin is divided by the drainage area of the nearest calibration basin and then multiplied by the flow of the nearest calibration basin over et al 2014 the dar method represents a baseline for comparing the more complex regression modeling approaches performance of the dar method was better than regression modeling for the two highest percentile flows see q01 and q05 in table 5c high flows vary with area the influence of area decreases with the percentile flows as indicated by decreasing n values regression modeling performs better than dar for q10 q99 the performance of the regression modeling was influenced by the different approaches for selecting the independent variables expert assessment or data driven the data driven approach performed better using the lumped variables as opposed to the distributed variables for almost all of the percentile flows table 5 therefore the additional information of the distributed variables i e the statistical distribution of the basin data did not contribute to the performance of the regression models this may be because the additional information was statistically redundant table 4 or produced variables that were not strong predictors of the percentile flows table 3 the hypothesis that the data driven approach would outperform the expert assessment of the fdc was contradicted by the predictive performance for the percentile flows although the data driven approach performed better in calibration fig 4 expert assessment of the fdc achieved similar performance to the data driven approach in validation table 5 the percentile flows at the tails of the fdc high and low flows were predicted better using the three variables of the expert assessment whereas the larger set of lumped variables slightly improved the predictions for the percentile flows in the middle of the fdc the three variables of the expert assessment map pet and bfi explained most of the variance in the percentile flows and little to no additional variance was explained using the larger sets of variables for the data driven approach overall performance of the different approaches is summarized by the sum of absolute e and mean r 2 and n for all the percentile flows table 6 regression modeling approaches performed better than dar overall the expert assessment had similar overall performance to the data driven approaches i e lumped and distributed yet it required less computational effort i e calculating and selecting variables the simple regression models of the expert assessment consisted of map pet and bfi and only need these readily available values to predict the percentile flows for ungauged basins in the contiguous us the performance of the expert assessment was lower than prior work for southern new england archfield et al 2007 and the mid atlantic mohamoud 2008 with r 2 and n values of approximately 0 9 however these prior works were conducted with a smaller sample of validation basins the expert assessment had a mean absolute e of 0 06 for q80 in the basin group including southern and central california which was smaller better than a previous study in that region hope and bart 2011 a number of statewide studies have been conducted to build the streamstats application mentioned in the introduction ries 2007 streamstats and associated studies express uncertainty as the 90 confidence interval of the estimate a value influenced by sample size helsel and hirsch 2002 performance of streamstats models in validation is not reported thus a comparison of validation results in this study to previous streamstats studies was not possible the streamstats application can be used to generate predictions for ungauged basins but performance of the predictions could not be evaluated here since the validation basins of this study may have been used to develop the models of streamstats an independent validation analysis of streamstats versus other applications for predicting percentile flows of ungauged basins should be the subject of future work the focus of this study was to compare different approaches for selecting independent variables used for regional regression modeling of percentile flows the outcome was that expert assessment was identified as a parsimonious approach for creating regional regression models due to its simplicity and overall performance regression models based on the expert assessment were used to develop a tool for predicting percentile flows of the contiguous us see the supplementary material section which could be compared to streamstats in a subsequent study 5 discussion 5 1 important variables for predicting the fdc the most important variable for predicting the entire fdc was bfi table 3 the expert assessment of the fdc linked bfi to average and low flows at least partially supplied by subsurface drainage yokoo and sivapalan 2011 but bfi may also be related to the excess precipitation of a basin map pet explaining its ability to predict high flows larger bfi values and high flows may be expected for basins with more excess precipitation and excess precipitation had a statistically significant p value 0 01 correlation with bfi and the representative high flow of q10 spearman s rho of 0 39 and 0 49 respectively the baseflow of a basin may therefore be indirectly related to its potential to produce high flows this is in line with previous findings that the process of infiltration a major control of baseflow also plays a part in controlling floods see gioia et al 2012 among others the top five most selected variables of table 3 included the other variables from the expert assessment of the fdc map and pet a substitute for these variables may be aridity pet map since it was also frequently selected aridity is a measure of the long term water balance that generally represents the proportion of incoming precipitation lost to evapotranspiration high to low flows of the fdc were related to aridity because it influences antecedent moisture and subsurface drainage antecedent moisture moderates the higher flows generated by storms gunkel et al 2015 whereas subsurface drainage provides the lower flows between storms zomlot et al 2015 the long term water balance expressed as aridity has been linked to the variation of the fdc in the contiguous us cheng et al 2012 and may be a more effective means of representing map and pet other important variables for predicting the fdc table 3 included variables representing snow accumulation and melt percent snow and spring temp subsurface drainage poorly drained and mean elevation elev snow accumulation and melt were important for snow dominated basins and closely associated with high flows generated by spring snowmelt solander et al 2017 subsurface drainage represented via poorly drained soils was most strongly related to the low flows a larger percent of poorly drained soils with less subsurface drainage reduced the low flows as illustrated by the statistically significant p value 0 01 negative correlation between poorly drained and q90 pearson s r of 0 38 elevation is an integrative variable that was likely important because it covaries with other important factors such as precipitation daly et al 2008 snowfall grünewald et al 2014 and baseflow rumsey et al 2015 largely absent from the important variables listed in table 3 are the distributed variables that describe the statistical distribution of spatial and temporal basin data this is either because basin averages provide better information for predicting percentile flows table 3 or distributed variables mainly add redundant information to the regression models table 4 5 2 improving performance of percentile flow predictions the performance of the regression models was strongest for percentile flows in the middle of the fdc average flows and poorest for percentile flows toward the tails of the fdc high and low flows this is a commonly noted pattern in other fdc regionalization studies see hope and bart 2012 mohamoud 2008 sauquet and catalogne 2011 poorer performance toward the tails may be attributed to the large variability of basin responses to storms that generate high flows and the challenge of representing the contribution of subsurface drainage to low flows salinas et al 2013 the predictive performance for the high and low flows may have been improved by using additional independent variables high flows are the product of storms which were represented by intensity mm d 1 and maximum events largest 1 day totals however these variables precip intensity and precip 1d max were not frequently used for the regression models table 3 and additional information on the frequency and magnitude of storms may have been useful this information could be represented using a precipitation duration curve pdc derived like a fdc the pdc has previously been effective at reconstructing the high end of the fdc yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and may be equally effective at yielding independent variables i e precipitation percentiles for predicting high flows the frequency of rainy days e g rainy days y 1 may also be informative as an indicator of average antecedent moisture conditions which mediate the high flows generated by storms physical factors also play a role in mediating high flows through interception and infiltration land cover provides readily available information on these physical factors but may have been underrepresented in this study percent forest cover forest was the only land cover variable and it was not frequently used to predict high flows table 3 additional land cover variables specifically targeting the processes of interception e g tree canopy density and infiltration e g natural impervious area may have improved high flow predictions such variables could be developed using remote sensing technology and evaluated for their potential to predict high flows additional independent variables may also have benefited the prediction of low flows controlled by subsurface drainage variables describing subsurface drainage bfi and poorly drained were among the most strongly associated variables to low flows table 3 subsurface drainage could be further characterized using the soil datasets of gssurgo from the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service a hydrologically relevant geologic hydrogeologic classification may also be useful in describing subsurface drainage a hydrogeologic classification of the pacific northwest was previously linked to summer low flows tague and grant 2004 and this prompts the hypothesis that groups of basins identified using a hydrogeologic classification may improve subsequent low flow predictions subsurface drainage may also be characterized by the storage properties of regional aquifers these properties e g aquifer thickness have been mapped for regional aquifers using spatial interpolation methods see williams and dixon 2015 among others and may indicate the contribution of aquifers to low flows the low flows of this study included zero flows which are notably difficult to predict snelder et al 2013 and may require modeling schemes designed to accommodate intermittent streams hope and bart 2011 the expert assessment produced similar performance to more complex data driven approaches table 6 and was thus identified as a parsimonious approach to develop regional regression models regression models of the expert assessment may have been improved by combining map and pet as aridity since this variable was an effective substitute frequently used in the data driven regression models table 3 the third variable of the expert assessment could then target the more challenging to predict high or low flows for instance the high flows may be explained using a variable describing the variability of large storms e g slope of the pdc above the 20th percentile and the low flows may be associated with the percent of the basin underlain by a general hydrogeologic class such as unconsolidated material the uncertainty of the percentile flow predictions may be attributed to the regression modeling approach regression models for individual percentile flows did not preserve the order of percentile flows from high to low this was corrected by forcing lower percentile flows to zero after a predicted flow of zero or less and linearly interpolating between the nearest decreasing percentile flows an alternative approach could be used to enforce the order of percentile flows such as predicting the percent of zero flows and statistical distribution of nonzero flows hope and bart 2011 regression models are sensitive to outliers in the data harrell 2001 outliers were removed using the cook s d statistic helsel and hirsch 2002 however more complex machine learning methods such as neural networks may be able to incorporate the information from outliers without influencing the entire fit of the model dawson and wilby 2001 neural networks are also known for their ability to capture the non linear relations of hydrologic data abrahart and see 2007 and should be evaluated for the modeling of percentile flows the regression modeling approach did not address the multicollinearity of the independent variables according to the maximum vif between variables of a model table 4 the expert assessment had an acceptable level of multicollinearity vif 10 and the lumped variables had an unacceptable level of multicollinearity vif 10 however both regression modeling approaches had similar performance in validation multicollinearity may have had little effect on model performance because the regression models were calibrated using a representative sample of basins harrell 2001 it is important to apply the regression models on basins within the range of conditions in the calibration basins and this matter is addressed in the predictive tool described in the following section multicollinearity can be problematic for predictions in basins with different multicollinearity than the calibration basins a recent study found that methods for managing multicollinearity in regression models such as model screening principal component regression and partial least squares regression are not effective at improving model performance kroll and song 2013 machine learning methods like random forests may be more tolerant to differences in multicollinearity dormann et al 2013 and as a result produce models that can be transferred to a random basin with more confidence machine learning represents a large suite of methods to potentially deal with outliers and multicollinearity despite the potential advantages of machine learning methods regression was applied in this study to produce simple models which could then be converted into a tool for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us see the next section on supplementary material 6 supplementary material conus percentile flow predictor the supplementary material for this paper provides the contiguous us conus percentile flow predictor an open source r graphical user interface for predicting 13 percentile flows q01 q05 q10 q20 q95 q99 of ungauged basins the tool uses regression models developed based on 734 calibration basins in the contiguous us and a set of parsimonious independent variables identified through expert assessment of the fdc input data includes map and pet calculated using long term prism data http prism oregonstate edu and bfi based on a grid for the contiguous us http water usgs gov lookup getspatial bfi48grd for convenience map and pet grids have been calculated using data from 1981 to 2010 and are provided with the aforementioned bfi grid in the supplementary material input data should be within the range of the data used to create the conus percentile flow predictor table 7 and a warning is generated if the input data is outside of this range the percentile flows of the ungauged basin are predicted by first assigning the basin to a group fig 3a and then solving the regression equations for the assigned group the groups were identified using the som and the ungauged basin is assigned to the som neuron with the shortest euclidean distance between the neuron vector and input data the group membership of the neuron is then used for the ungauged basin the regression models of that group are used to predict the percentile flows the percentile flows were normalized using the mean of nonzero daily flows i e the index flow and natural log transformed to develop the regression models the predictions are converted into cubic meters per second using the index flow and the duan 1983 smearing estimate to back transform the percentile flows the index flow is predicted using regression models developed the same way as the percentile flows the index flow and duan 1983 smearing estimate are only used in the tool to generate predictions in cubic meters per second and were not applied in the comparison of methods conducted in this study output of the tool can be generated for multiple ungauged basins and the predictions are accompanied by statistics on the performance of the regression models adjusted r 2 maximum vif and standard error se of the model the predicted percentile flows can be used to reconstruct the complete fdc through an interpolation method such as the one in mohamoud 2008 the conus percentile flow predictor is provided with a metadata file readme txt including instructions on how to use the tool regression models used to create the conus percentile flow predictor are provided with associated statistics in tabular form for use in a variety of software packages 7 conclusions regional regression models were developed to predict percentile flows for the contiguous us the two steps of a regional regression i e identifying groups of basins and developing models depend on the independent variables used to summarize the physical and climatic data of the basins this study compared the following two approaches for selecting the independent variables 1 an expert assessment of the factors that control the fdc to identify a small number of variables and 2 a data driven approach with many variables possibly linked to the fdc the data driven approach was performed using lumped variables i e basin averages and a larger set of distributed variables i e basin averages and statistical distribution the lumped variables were used in a preliminary experiment to compare two data driven approaches based on random forests and a more conventional branch and bound regression model procedure random forests achieved better overall performance for predicting the percentile flows and was used for the data driven approach in this study an expert assessment and data driven approach were used to select the independent variables of percentile flow regression models the underlying hypothesis of this study was that the data driven approach would produce better regression models for predicting the percentile flows this was contradicted by the results of the performance evaluation the predictive performance of the expert assessment mean n 0 66 was similar to the data driven approach using the lumped variables mean n 0 66 and slightly better than the data driven models derived from the distributed variables mean n 0 62 regression modeling approaches performed better than a simple dar method mean n 0 58 however the dar method performed the best for the two highest flows indicating that drainage area is a strong predictor of high flows the additional information of the distributed variables i e the statistical distribution of the basin data did not contribute to the regression models because it was redundant and less important than the lumped variables the expert assessment included three variables map pet and bfi and performed similarly to the 22 lumped variables this signifies that many of the lumped variables were either redundant or otherwise not useful with the exception of mean elevation topographic variables widely used in fdc regionalization studies were not useful predictors of percentile flows an important predictor of percentile flows was aridity pet map which could have been used as a substitute for map and pet in the expert assessment another variable alongside aridity and bfi could be evaluated to possibly improve performance of the expert assessment the expert assessment produced simple models that did not decrease predictive performance and was deemed effective for selecting the independent variables of the regional regression the regression models can be easily used to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins based on map pet and bfi and were used to create a tool for predicting percentile flows in the contiguous us see the supplementary material for this paper the conus percentile flow predictor generates predictions for the 13 percentile flows of this study along with estimates of the predictive uncertainty the regional regression was used to predict high to low percentile flows q01 q99 predictive performance of regression models was the worst for the percentile flows at the tails of the fdc high and low flows the highest predictive performance for these flows was obtained using the three variables of the expert assessment and the other variables used in this study did not improve the high and low flow predictions additional variables may have been needed to characterize the magnitude of storms that drive high flows e g precipitation percentiles and the potential contribution of subsurface drainage to low flows e g aquifer thickness the development of new variables may also be in order to characterize factors such as the spatial variability of storms zoccatelli et al 2011 and groundwater levels costelloe et al 2015 the low flow predictions may also have been improved using a modeling scheme that takes the percent of zero flows into account hope and bart 2011 the percentile flow predictions may have been improved by modeling methods other than regression the strongest predictor of the percentile flows was bfi and this was derived from a gridded product for the contiguous us that was spatially interpolated between stream gauges a similar spatial interpolation approach could be used to predict percentile flows and has outperformed regression in a previous study archfield et al 2013 the output of the spatial interpolation could be served as a data product for predicting the percentile flows of ungauged basins regression may also be outperformed by neural networks that are more resilient to the noise and non linearity of hydrologic data hall et al 2002 neural networks such as the som could be used to cluster the basins and generate percentile flow predictions in one step this would eliminate the need to identify groups of basins for percentile flow modeling and should be evaluated in future studies conflict of interest none potential referees
