22125,when the offset between the transmitter and the receiver in the multibeam is large neglecting the offset will introduce depth errors into the multibeam footprints although the current non concentric algorithm ncca considers this offset its model is complicated and time consuming to solve the issues a simplified method is developed first the offset is considered by constructing two separated intersecting triangles projected by the transmitted and received cones under the array reference frame arf second two groups of the footprint coordinates under the arf are calculated with slant ranges from the transmitter and receiver to the footprint respectively then the transmitted and received vectors and their corresponding one way travel times owtts are calculated by the two coordinates finally an iteration is used to adjust the two slant ranges according to the measured and the calculated time and the optimal location of the footprint will be obtained to verify the proposed method comparisons between existing methods and ours are made the results indicate that when the depth is about 457 m the average depth deviation between the ncca and ours is only 0 03 m and our new method saves about 17 of computation time compared to that of the ncca keywords multibeam footprints offset simplified algorithm triangles hyperbolas 1 introduction benefitting from the properties of high efficiency and wide coverage the multibeam echo sounder system mbes is widely used in underwater topographic surveys and sediment classification wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 wang et al 2018 generally to accurately acquire the geolocation of the underwater multibeam footprints parameters including 14 orientation angles 4 lever arms and 2 positions should be considered when deriving the accurate and efficient mathematical model hughes clarke et al 2000 lurton 2010 however suffering from the interferences of many effects the mathematical model of the multibeam footprints are very complicated and nonlinear the first effect is the beam steering angle which is used to redirect the main response axis of the beam pattern away from the array orthogonal if there is no beam steering angle the transmitted or received beam pattern is a plane whereas if the beam steering angle is not zero they form cones hughes clarke 2003 second since the seawater column is a non homogenous medium the propagation ray is nonlinear and irregular due to the refraction effect which makes the transmitted cone and received cone also irregular kammerer 2000 third due to the physical size of the transmitter and the receiver of transducers there is a static deviation i e a lever arm vector between the transmitter and the receiver when they are installed besides the movement of the ship during the sound roundtrip will bring a dynamic deviation into the transducers the two deviations constitute the offset between the transmitter and the receiver for multibeam with a single sector the errors caused by the offset are typically ignored however recent developments in complete motion stabilization require multi sectors which complicate the effect of the offset on footprints de moustier et al 1988 the different txsteer angles in sectors make errors caused by the offset larger and lead to terrain discontinuity at sector boundaries hughes clarke et al 2011 teng 2011 hoiroj 2016 for example it s difficult to reprocess bathymetries acquired by mbes like seabeam 3012 em710 or em302 which not only has large transducers but also has multiple sectors consequently the process of calculating the geolocation of the multibeam footprints is hard to implement with accurate mathematical algorithms unless some assumptions and simplifications are supposed to calculate the geolocation of the multibeam footprints li et al 1999 proposed a simplified mathematical model that regarded the transmitter and receiver as an acoustic concentric array under several assumptions the simplifications and assumptions are as follows 1 the transmitter and receiver were assumed as an integrated unit with identical installation parameters and real time attitudes 2 the offset between the transmitter and receiver was ignored which means the transmitted vector overlapped with the received vector and the travel time of the transmitted ray was identical with that of the received ray and 3 the transducers generally used high ping rate ignoring the changes of the attitudes based on the conditions above zhao and liu 2003 developed the coordinate calculation steps of the footprints in detail however due to the ideal assumptions the model has many limitations and errors will be introduced to the geolocation of footprints for instance the model is only suitable for the circumstance of shallow water and a stable attitude during the sound roundtrip when the water depth gets deeper the twtt will be longer errors caused by the change of the attitudes during the sound roundtrip cannot be ignored especially with large changes in the roll direction hare 1995 2001 huang et al 2002 to solve these limitations beaudoin et al 2004 developed a virtual concentric cone algorithm vcca to eliminate errors caused by imperfect surface sound speed the transmitter and receiver were considered as two independent units and a virtual array reference frame arf was constructed by the transmitter at the time of transmitting and the receiver at the time of receiving the installation angles and attitudes of both the transmitter and receiver were used to calculate the beam vector although this improved algorithm could obtain more accurate geolocation of footprints it still had limitations e g the assumption 2 above when a multibeam echosounder has multi sectors this assumption will cause splicing errors in the adjacent sectors hughes clarke and beaudoin 2004 additionally it has been proved that when the received steering rxsteer angles of beams are beyond 60 the depth accuracy significantly suffers from the beam width and the widening effect of beams wu et al 2005 pereira and hughes clark 2015 yang et al 2017 the depth uncertainties of footprints in the edge sectors of the swath can hardly satisfy the iho standards to eliminate the errors caused by the assumption 2 based on the vcca hamilton et al 2014 considered the offset and proposed a non concentric cone algorithm ncca by solving the footprints via the hyperbola intersection the footprints were modeled by two intersecting hyperbolas formed by the projection of the transmitted and received cones on a certain plane and then the optimal depth of the plane was obtained by iterations thereby determining the best estimated intersecting point during the iteration two owtts i e one from the transmitter to the footprints and the other reflecting from the footprints to the receiver and two beam vectors i e the transmitted vector and received vector are calculated to help find the optimal depth of the plane therefore this model realistically simulated the transmitting and receiving propagation process of beams in water and was close to the actual working state of the transducers although the ncca considered almost all comprehensive factors among the published algorithms the algorithm is very complicated and it is time consuming with low efficiency to solve the hyperbolic equations by using the newton iteration method for every footprint especially with massive data vesely and doan 2015 to simplify the amount of computation in the ncca this paper proposed a relatively simple calibration method to account for the errors caused by the offset the proposed method draws on the advantages of both the vcca and ncca and uses two intersected triangles in the vcca rather than two intersected hyperbolas in the ncca but unlike two triangles sharing one common vertex in the vcca the new algorithm considers the offset and constructs two separate intersecting triangles in addition triangles in the new algorithm are based on the projections of cones at a certain depth with the real slant ranges between the footprints and transducers being used however the triangles in the vcca are formed by cones with a unit length of generatrix by using two separately intersecting triangles the analytical expression of the footprint coordinates can be directly developed which avoids calculating the complex hyperbolic equations consequently the proposed calibration method is relatively simple with less computational complexity which has significance in improving the efficiency of data processing 2 methods when calculating the geolocation of the multibeam footprints with measurements mentioned in section 1 the offset between the transmitter and receiver are usually ignored which will introduce errors into footprints to solve errors caused by the offset algorithm modeling the intersection of two non concentric cones with the seabed by two intersecting hyperbolas on a plane focal plane at a defined depth is developed and the coordinate of the footprint x y r under arf can be obtained by eq 1 according to ncca hamilton et al 2014 1 x a t x cosh t 1 y b t x sinh t 1 x b r x cos δ sinh t 2 a r x sin δ cosh t 2 δ x y b r x sin δ sinh t 2 a r x cos δ cosh t 2 δ y where δ is the non orthogonality angle t 1 and t 2 are the unknown parameters representing the angle about the transmitted and received cones respectively a tx and b tx are parameters of the transmitted hyperbola and can be expressed as a tx rtan txsteer and b tx r respectively a rx and b rx are parameters of the received hyperbola and can be expressed as a rx r δz tan rxsteer and b tx r δz respectively kheyfets 2017 r is the depth of the focal plane which can be adjusted during an iteration process finding the best estimated depth δx δy δz is the coordinate deviation between the transmitter and receiver under the arf which can be obtained by the offset as shown by eq 1 although hamilton s geometric theory of the ncca can get the most accurate results among the available algorithms the process of solving the hyperbolic equations by using the newton iteration method for every footprint is computationally expensive so it s necessary to develop a simplified method 2 1 principle of the simplified method before calculating beam vectors and their corresponding owtts it is necessary to give the declaration that the vessel reference frame vrf and the arf from the ncca are used here besides the focal plane in the nccm defined to describe the intersection of the transmitted cone and the received cone is also used however to avoid the complex algorithm in the ncca the method of the intersection of two hyperbolas are replaced with two triangles projected by the transmitted cone and received cone on the focal plane as shown in fig 1 to calculate the coordinate of the footprint in the arf the slant ranges from the transmitter and the receiver to the footprint are used instead of the focal ranges which are actually the norms of the transmitted vector tv and received vector rv as depicted in fig 1 and to find the correct locations of the footprint an iterative process is also used to adjust the length of the slant ranges which can achieve the same results as the adjustment of the vertical focal ranges in the nccm with the vertical focal ranges changing during the adjustment of the two slant ranges 2 2 derivation of the new method before the iteration begins the initial transmitted slant range tl and received slant range rl should be given appropriately to reduce the amount of the iterations which can be obtained by the initially estimated coordinate of the footprint in the ncca first the initial beam vector is calculated by eq 2 2 x y z v r f r g e o 0 sin r x s t e e r cos r x s t e e r a z i m u t h arc tan y x d e p r e s s i o n a n g l e a r c tan z x 2 y 2 o w t t t w t t 2 where r geo is the rotation matrix in the nccm helping transform the coordinate from arf to vrf the azimuth and the depression angle are angles to describe the transmitted or received vector then the approximate coordinate of the footprint in the vrf can be acquired through ray tracing with the calculated azimuth depression angle and owtt lurton 2010 and by rotating the coordinate into the arf with the transpose of r geo the initial tr can be calculated by eq 3 3 t l tv x 2 y 2 z 2 where x y z is the initial location of the footprint in the arf to calculate the rl the offset in the arf is used since the calculation process of the offset between the transmitter and the receiver is specifically elaborated in the nccm no more description will be given here supposing that the offset in the arf is noted as p δ x δ y δ z then rl can be calculated by eq 4 according to the inner product of two vectors in the euclidean space moore 1995 4 φ arccos t v p t v p r l t v 2 p 2 t v 2 p cos φ with the calculated two slant ranges the next step is to determine the location of the footprint under the arf although the method of directly calculating the coordinate of the footprint in the vcca is used the offset between the transmitter and receiver during the sound roundtrip is also considered to help define the actual location of the received cone as shown by fig 2 as depicted in fig 2 the transmitted vector overlaps with the received vector in the existing geometry of the vcca a while the received vector is different from the transmitted vector in the improved geometry of beam vectors b for the effect of the offset consequently the two ray paths i e one traveling from the transmitter to the footprint and the other reflecting from the footprint to the receiver are also different which lead to the non equal partitioning of the twtt and non overlapping beam vectors the location of the footprint is closely determined by the projections of tl and rl as well as the offset and it should be noted that the two improved triangles are the projections of the actual transmitted and received cones on the focal plane whereas the triangles in the vcca fig 2 a are projected by cones constructed with unit vectors beaudoin et al 2004 with the existing offset between the transmitter and receiver the location of the footprint and the received vector vary with the offset which makes it difficult to derive the beam vectors with unit vectors as in the vcca so real slant ranges from the transmitter and the receiver to the footprint tl and rl are used to help calculate the location of the footprint in the arf instead of the unit vectors since the y coordinate of the footprint in the arf is no longer only composed of y 1 and y 2 as shown in fig 2 y 3 and y 4 caused by the offset also become the important components and the new coordinate of the footprint x y z can be calculated by eq 5 5 y 1 r l sin r x s t e e r cos δ y 2 t l sin r x s t e e r tan δ y 3 δ x tan δ y 4 δ y x t l sin t x s t e e r y y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 z t l 2 x 2 y 2 differently the coordinate of the footprint calculated here is the actual value in the arf whereas the corresponding results in the vcca are the projections of the unit beam vector on x y z axes and then the process of calculating the two beam vectors and their corresponding owtts are the same as those in the ncca including ⅰ calculating the coordinate of the footprint x r y r z r referring to the receiver by the coordinate x y z and the offset δx δy δz ⅱ rotating the two calculated coordinates in the arf back into the vrf with the matrix r geo to calculate the new tv and rv ⅲ calculating the two corresponding owtts owttr and owttt with the modified ray tracing algorithm with the two calculated owtts the difference between the calculated twtt and the actual twtt can indicate how the slant ranges need to be adjusted for the next iteration of calculating x y z however since the slant ranges are used to help calculate the coordinate of the footprint instead of the vertical focal range the adjustment of the slant ranges are also different when compared to that changing the vertical focal range in the ncca therefore the adjustment step and the modified tl can be calculated by eq 6 6 t l a d d t w t t o w t t t o w t t r 2 s s t x t l t l t l a d d where ss tx is the sound speed at the currently estimated depth and the direction of the adjustment positive or negative in the slant ranges are determined by the difference between the calculated twtt and the actual twtt finally having the modified tl the modified rl and the new coordinate of the footprint intersected by the two triangles can be updated by eq 4 and eq 5 respectively the following steps are to calculate the new tl add for the next new iteration as described above and the end of the iteration can be set by the magnitude of the time difference between the actual twtt and the calculated twtt such as 10 6 s which can be small enough to ensure the depth bias within 1 cm finally when the iteration ends the best estimated beam vectors and the corresponding owtts are determined and can be ray traced to acquire the final geolocation of the footprints 3 results and discussions in this section simulated data are used to test how the effect of the offset on the depth of the footprints and then measured data are re processed by qimera version of 1 6 3 the vcca the ncca and our method respectively both the results of the qimera qm and the ncca are used as reference datasets and the results of the vcca and our method the compared datasets 3 1 analysis of depth biases with simulated data since the transducers with large size are usually installed at the bottom of a ship with mills cross array configuration the static deviations of the transmitter and the receiver in the across track direction and the vertical direction are usually small and the dynamic separations of the transducers during the sound roundtrip in the two directions are also usually small when compared to that in the along track direction lanzoni and weber 2011 so only the typical effects of the errors caused by the along track offset are analyzed and as the coordinates of the footprints are closely relative to the along track offset the txsteer angle and the rxsteer angle according to the ncca two groups of simulated data are used to weigh the effect of the parameters on the depth of the footprints as shown in table 1 the installation angles and the attitudes of the transmitter and receiver are deliberately ignored and the simulated depths of each group are 20 m 50 m 100 m and 500 m respectively as shown by eq 1 it s difficult to derive the analytical solutions to present the effect of each parameter on the depth of the footprints the differences between the results of the ncca and the vcca with the simulated data are approximately assumed as numerical analysis for each parameter the results are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 when the installation angles and the attitudes of the transducers are not considered the depth biases caused by the along track offset and the txsteer angles are centrosymmetric which indicates that the depth biases are closely related to both the magnitudes and the directions of the two parameters as shown in fig 3 when the along track offset and the txsteer angles are positive the transmitter is in front of the receiver under the vrf and the transmitted beam patterns steer towards the bow the depth biases are large the same situation can be seen when the along track offset and the txsteer angles are both negative and when the two parameters sharing the same directions the depth biases increase rapidly with either of the parameters the maximum depth bias is up to about 0 9 m when the water depth is 20 m fig 3a which far exceeds the standard of 0 5 depth in the iho iho 2008 and when the water depth gets deeper the depth biases decrease and gradually meet the requirement of 0 5 depth as shown in fig 3d with the maximum depth bias decreasing to about 0 5 m at the depth of 500 m however when the two parameters are not in the same direction the depth biases are relatively small in the shallow water and with the water depth getting deeper the depth biases increase gradually the maximum depth bias expands from 0 1 m fig 3a to 0 4 m fig 3d when the simulated water depth varies from 20 m to 500 m although the depth biases also increase with the along track offset or the txsteer angles all the biases are almost within the standard of 0 5 depth fig 4 shows that the depth biases caused by the along track offset and the rxsteer angles are symmetrical which means that the depth biases have no relationship with the direction of the two parameters although the depth biases increase with the rxsteer angles or the along track offset magnitudes of the biases are relatively small when compared to those caused by the txsteer angles when the water gets deeper the depth biases decrease rapidly with the maximum depth bias 0 79 m at the depth of 20 m fig 4a reduced to 0 03 m at the depth of 500 m fig 4d 3 2 verification of the proposed method multibeam bathymetric data from the survey of the eclipse sound canada are used to verify the practicability and efficiency of the method proposed in this paper which are download from the geospatial data and services of the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa the data were captured by kongsberg em 302 multibeam echo sounder in october 2013 with 432 beams in 4 sectors per ping and the swath angle is about 125 there are 468288 points in the data and the average depth of the test area is about 457 m due to the increased beam steering angles for yaw stabilization when the ship is turning the depth biases between sector boundaries are easy to show survey line with ship turning is selected to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the installation parameters of the transmitter and receiver on the ship are interpreted from the original data as shown in table 2 the measured data is processed by qm the vcca the ncca and our method respectively and the results of qm are shown in fig 5 currently commercial software such as qimera and caris considers the influence of offset when calculating the location and depth of footprints in its software processing module however the algorithms used in qimera and caris are not published and only the algorithms of the vcca and the ncca are published to acquire the most accurate and effective results besides due to truth values depths and locations of the seabed in study area are unknown the verification of published algorithms is hard to implement so the results of commercial software such as qimera are used as in situ measurements to evaluate the accuracy of other algorithms results hamilton et al 2014 wu et al 2013 then the results of the vcca the ncca and the proposed method and the corresponding depth differences with the results of qm are calculated and illustrated in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the external performance of the seabed topographic maps processed by the vcca fig 6a the ncca fig 6c and the proposed method fig 6e are almost identical and no discontinuity exists between sectors the reason is that the offset between the transmitter and receiver is a very small value compared to the deep water depth the maps are processed with normal ship parameters with the maximum offset in x axis direction being 2 14 m and biases caused by the offset are much smaller than the water depth of 457 m this phenomenon meets the fact that the beam vectors vary with the depth and will asymptotically approach values calculated by the vcca i e errors caused by the offset decrease as the water gets deeper hamilton et al 2014 the appearance of the seabed topographic maps processed by the vcca the ncca and our method seems almost identical which cannot verify the effectiveness of the algorithms the corresponding depth biases compared to qm are presented as shown in fig 6 b the depth biases between qm and the vcca are relatively large with the maximum and average depth biases being 1 34 m and 0 48 m due to larger steering angles for yaw stabilization in edge areas s1 and s4 illustrated in fig 5 depth biases distributed in these areas are larger than those in the middle areas s2 and s3 illustrated in fig 5 compared to the vcca the depth biases decrease rapidly when using the ncca and our method as shown in fig 6 d and fig 6 f the maximum and average depth biases between qm and the ncca fig 6d are approximately 0 37 m and 0 25 m respectively the maximum and average depth biases between qm and our method fig 6f are about 0 37 m and 0 24 m respectively the magnitude and distribution of the depth biases in fig 6 d and fig 6 f are very similar then to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method the installation parameters are deliberately set wrong due to the reason that errors caused by incorrectly set within the installation parameters of the transducers behave the same as errors introduced by the neglect of the offset hamilton et al 2014 so the x parameter for the installation of the transmitter is deliberately changed to 19 01 m and the data is then reprocessed by qm the vcca the ncca and our method respectively the results and the corresponding depth differences compared with the results of qm are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 when the measured data is reprocessed by qm with the adjusted parameters with the maximum offset in x axis expanded to 7 86 m the depth biases between sectors caused by the offset are obvious as the imprints pointed by the red lines in fig 7 the results of the ncca and our methods also have similar performance as shown in fig 8 c and fig 8 d whereas the results of the vcca have no changes the phenomenon meets the fact that the offset is a parameter in qm the ncca and our method and is not considered by the vcca with the expanded offset errors between sectors are obvious for the comprehensive effect of the txsteer angles and rxsteer angles on the depth of footprints in this case the maximum and the average depth biases between qm and the vcca grow up to 4 37 m and 0 90 m with the maximum biases far beyond the demanding accuracy of 0 5 depth as shown in fig 8b however by using the ncca or our method the depth biases decrease rapidly with the maximum depth biases between qm and the ncca reduced to 0 37 m fig 8d and the maximum depth biases between qm and our method reduced to 0 41 m fig 8f respectively the average depth biases in fig 8 d and fig 8 f are about 0 26 m and 0 25 m respectively therefore with the expanded offset the proposed method still has an almost identical performance with the ncca and approaches the results of qm and depth differences between the results of the ncca and our method are used to further prove the effectiveness of our method as shown in fig 9 besides based on the measured data ten groups of calculations are carried on and the average time consuming for the two methods is counted to prove the high efficiency of our method with the wrong parameters the results of the proposed method are very close to those of the ncca as shown in fig 9 with the maximum and average depth biases being about 0 19 m and 0 03 m respectively and these biases can be neglected when considering the demanding accuracy of 0 5 depth table 3 shows that with the same number of points in the data the proposed method costs less time with the efficiency improved by 17 this is because iteration such as newton iterative method which is used to solve the hyperbolic equations eq 1 in the ncca for each beam is avoided in the proposed method thus the new method can reduce computational complexity and improve data process efficiency 3 3 discussion of the proposed algorithm although the proposed method avoids the complex geometric models with the two intersected hyperbolas in the ncca being replaced by two separate triangles the proposed method is also deduced under the assumption of the transmitted and received patterns being regular cones so the two methods are essentially under the same assumptions with different methods to find the same results as shown by fig 10 and the statistics of the small biases of the two methods in section 3 2 can also confirm it thus it indirectly proves that the proposed method can also eliminate errors caused by the offset between the transmitter and receiver however there are still remaining biases between the two methods which may be caused by the systematic errors of the two methods for instance the newton iterative method to solve eq 1 in the ncca may introduce uncertainties to the final results waltz et al 2006 consequently as pointed out in the ncca the regular cones only form in a homogeneous water column when the sound velocities vary highly with the depth transmitted and received cones are irregular for the effect of refraction which will lead to distortions of the projected hyperbolas or triangles and bring errors into the footprints 4 conclusions this paper focuses on errors caused by the offset between the transmitter and receiver when calculating the geolocations of multibeam footprints and to solve the issue and avoid the sophisticated hyperbola equations in the published methods a simplified calibration method is proposed which is developed on the basis of the existed algorithms i e the vcca and the ncca by using the two intersected triangles the analytical expression of the coordinates of the footprint can be directly given and newton s method to solve the complex hyperbolic equations is left out the results show that with normal installation parameters when the water depth is about 457 m the maximum and the average depth biases between our result and qimera are 0 37 m and 0 24 m respectively when the offset is enlarged the maximum and average biases between our result and qimera are 0 41 m and 0 25 m respectively the average deviation between the complicated ncca and our simplified method is about 0 03 m our new method saves about 17 of the computation time compared to that of the ncca therefore the simplified calibration method has a significant effect on solving errors caused by the offset and improving the efficiency of multibeam post data processing declaration of competing interest the

addition triangles in the new algorithm are based on the projections of cones at a certain depth with the real slant ranges between the footprints and transducers being used however the triangles in the vcca are formed by cones with a unit length of generatrix by using two separately intersecting triangles the analytical expression of the footprint coordinates can be directly developed which avoids calculating the complex hyperbolic equations consequently the proposed calibration method is relatively simple with less computational complexity which has significance in improving the efficiency of data processing 2 methods when calculating the geolocation of the multibeam footprints with measurements mentioned in section 1 the offset between the transmitter and receiver are usually ignored which will introduce errors into footprints to solve errors caused by the offset algorithm modeling the intersection of two non concentric cones with the seabed by two intersecting hyperbolas on a plane focal plane at a defined depth is developed and the coordinate of the footprint x y r under arf can be obtained by eq 1 according to ncca hamilton et al 2014 1 x a t x cosh t 1 y b t x sinh t 1 x b r x cos δ sinh t 2 a r x sin δ cosh t 2 δ x y b r x sin δ sinh t 2 a r x cos δ cosh t 2 δ y where δ is the non orthogonality angle t 1 and t 2 are the unknown parameters representing the angle about the transmitted and received cones respectively a tx and b tx are parameters of the transmitted hyperbola and can be expressed as a tx rtan txsteer and b tx r respectively a rx and b rx are parameters of the received hyperbola and can be expressed as a rx r δz tan rxsteer and b tx r δz respectively kheyfets 2017 r is the depth of the focal plane which can be adjusted during an iteration process finding the best estimated depth δx δy δz is the coordinate deviation between the transmitter and receiver under the arf which can be obtained by the offset as shown by eq 1 although hamilton s geometric theory of the ncca can get the most accurate results among the available algorithms the process of solving the hyperbolic equations by using the newton iteration method for every footprint is computationally expensive so it s necessary to develop a simplified method 2 1 principle of the simplified method before calculating beam vectors and their corresponding owtts it is necessary to give the declaration that the vessel reference frame vrf and the arf from the ncca are used here besides the focal plane in the nccm defined to describe the intersection of the transmitted cone and the received cone is also used however to avoid the complex algorithm in the ncca the method of the intersection of two hyperbolas are replaced with two triangles projected by the transmitted cone and received cone on the focal plane as shown in fig 1 to calculate the coordinate of the footprint in the arf the slant ranges from the transmitter and the receiver to the footprint are used instead of the focal ranges which are actually the norms of the transmitted vector tv and received vector rv as depicted in fig 1 and to find the correct locations of the footprint an iterative process is also used to adjust the length of the slant ranges which can achieve the same results as the adjustment of the vertical focal ranges in the nccm with the vertical focal ranges changing during the adjustment of the two slant ranges 2 2 derivation of the new method before the iteration begins the initial transmitted slant range tl and received slant range rl should be given appropriately to reduce the amount of the iterations which can be obtained by the initially estimated coordinate of the footprint in the ncca first the initial beam vector is calculated by eq 2 2 x y z v r f r g e o 0 sin r x s t e e r cos r x s t e e r a z i m u t h arc tan y x d e p r e s s i o n a n g l e a r c tan z x 2 y 2 o w t t t w t t 2 where r geo is the rotation matrix in the nccm helping transform the coordinate from arf to vrf the azimuth and the depression angle are angles to describe the transmitted or received vector then the approximate coordinate of the footprint in the vrf can be acquired through ray tracing with the calculated azimuth depression angle and owtt lurton 2010 and by rotating the coordinate into the arf with the transpose of r geo the initial tr can be calculated by eq 3 3 t l tv x 2 y 2 z 2 where x y z is the initial location of the footprint in the arf to calculate the rl the offset in the arf is used since the calculation process of the offset between the transmitter and the receiver is specifically elaborated in the nccm no more description will be given here supposing that the offset in the arf is noted as p δ x δ y δ z then rl can be calculated by eq 4 according to the inner product of two vectors in the euclidean space moore 1995 4 φ arccos t v p t v p r l t v 2 p 2 t v 2 p cos φ with the calculated two slant ranges the next step is to determine the location of the footprint under the arf although the method of directly calculating the coordinate of the footprint in the vcca is used the offset between the transmitter and receiver during the sound roundtrip is also considered to help define the actual location of the received cone as shown by fig 2 as depicted in fig 2 the transmitted vector overlaps with the received vector in the existing geometry of the vcca a while the received vector is different from the transmitted vector in the improved geometry of beam vectors b for the effect of the offset consequently the two ray paths i e one traveling from the transmitter to the footprint and the other reflecting from the footprint to the receiver are also different which lead to the non equal partitioning of the twtt and non overlapping beam vectors the location of the footprint is closely determined by the projections of tl and rl as well as the offset and it should be noted that the two improved triangles are the projections of the actual transmitted and received cones on the focal plane whereas the triangles in the vcca fig 2 a are projected by cones constructed with unit vectors beaudoin et al 2004 with the existing offset between the transmitter and receiver the location of the footprint and the received vector vary with the offset which makes it difficult to derive the beam vectors with unit vectors as in the vcca so real slant ranges from the transmitter and the receiver to the footprint tl and rl are used to help calculate the location of the footprint in the arf instead of the unit vectors since the y coordinate of the footprint in the arf is no longer only composed of y 1 and y 2 as shown in fig 2 y 3 and y 4 caused by the offset also become the important components and the new coordinate of the footprint x y z can be calculated by eq 5 5 y 1 r l sin r x s t e e r cos δ y 2 t l sin r x s t e e r tan δ y 3 δ x tan δ y 4 δ y x t l sin t x s t e e r y y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 z t l 2 x 2 y 2 differently the coordinate of the footprint calculated here is the actual value in the arf whereas the corresponding results in the vcca are the projections of the unit beam vector on x y z axes and then the process of calculating the two beam vectors and their corresponding owtts are the same as those in the ncca including ⅰ calculating the coordinate of the footprint x r y r z r referring to the receiver by the coordinate x y z and the offset δx δy δz ⅱ rotating the two calculated coordinates in the arf back into the vrf with the matrix r geo to calculate the new tv and rv ⅲ calculating the two corresponding owtts owttr and owttt with the modified ray tracing algorithm with the two calculated owtts the difference between the calculated twtt and the actual twtt can indicate how the slant ranges need to be adjusted for the next iteration of calculating x y z however since the slant ranges are used to help calculate the coordinate of the footprint instead of the vertical focal range the adjustment of the slant ranges are also different when compared to that changing the vertical focal range in the ncca therefore the adjustment step and the modified tl can be calculated by eq 6 6 t l a d d t w t t o w t t t o w t t r 2 s s t x t l t l t l a d d where ss tx is the sound speed at the currently estimated depth and the direction of the adjustment positive or negative in the slant ranges are determined by the difference between the calculated twtt and the actual twtt finally having the modified tl the modified rl and the new coordinate of the footprint intersected by the two triangles can be updated by eq 4 and eq 5 respectively the following steps are to calculate the new tl add for the next new iteration as described above and the end of the iteration can be set by the magnitude of the time difference between the actual twtt and the calculated twtt such as 10 6 s which can be small enough to ensure the depth bias within 1 cm finally when the iteration ends the best estimated beam vectors and the corresponding owtts are determined and can be ray traced to acquire the final geolocation of the footprints 3 results and discussions in this section simulated data are used to test how the effect of the offset on the depth of the footprints and then measured data are re processed by qimera version of 1 6 3 the vcca the ncca and our method respectively both the results of the qimera qm and the ncca are used as reference datasets and the results of the vcca and our method the compared datasets 3 1 analysis of depth biases with simulated data since the transducers with large size are usually installed at the bottom of a ship with mills cross array configuration the static deviations of the transmitter and the receiver in the across track direction and the vertical direction are usually small and the dynamic separations of the transducers during the sound roundtrip in the two directions are also usually small when compared to that in the along track direction lanzoni and weber 2011 so only the typical effects of the errors caused by the along track offset are analyzed and as the coordinates of the footprints are closely relative to the along track offset the txsteer angle and the rxsteer angle according to the ncca two groups of simulated data are used to weigh the effect of the parameters on the depth of the footprints as shown in table 1 the installation angles and the attitudes of the transmitter and receiver are deliberately ignored and the simulated depths of each group are 20 m 50 m 100 m and 500 m respectively as shown by eq 1 it s difficult to derive the analytical solutions to present the effect of each parameter on the depth of the footprints the differences between the results of the ncca and the vcca with the simulated data are approximately assumed as numerical analysis for each parameter the results are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 when the installation angles and the attitudes of the transducers are not considered the depth biases caused by the along track offset and the txsteer angles are centrosymmetric which indicates that the depth biases are closely related to both the magnitudes and the directions of the two parameters as shown in fig 3 when the along track offset and the txsteer angles are positive the transmitter is in front of the receiver under the vrf and the transmitted beam patterns steer towards the bow the depth biases are large the same situation can be seen when the along track offset and the txsteer angles are both negative and when the two parameters sharing the same directions the depth biases increase rapidly with either of the parameters the maximum depth bias is up to about 0 9 m when the water depth is 20 m fig 3a which far exceeds the standard of 0 5 depth in the iho iho 2008 and when the water depth gets deeper the depth biases decrease and gradually meet the requirement of 0 5 depth as shown in fig 3d with the maximum depth bias decreasing to about 0 5 m at the depth of 500 m however when the two parameters are not in the same direction the depth biases are relatively small in the shallow water and with the water depth getting deeper the depth biases increase gradually the maximum depth bias expands from 0 1 m fig 3a to 0 4 m fig 3d when the simulated water depth varies from 20 m to 500 m although the depth biases also increase with the along track offset or the txsteer angles all the biases are almost within the standard of 0 5 depth fig 4 shows that the depth biases caused by the along track offset and the rxsteer angles are symmetrical which means that the depth biases have no relationship with the direction of the two parameters although the depth biases increase with the rxsteer angles or the along track offset magnitudes of the biases are relatively small when compared to those caused by the txsteer angles when the water gets deeper the depth biases decrease rapidly with the maximum depth bias 0 79 m at the depth of 20 m fig 4a reduced to 0 03 m at the depth of 500 m fig 4d 3 2 verification of the proposed method multibeam bathymetric data from the survey of the eclipse sound canada are used to verify the practicability and efficiency of the method proposed in this paper which are download from the geospatial data and services of the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa the data were captured by kongsberg em 302 multibeam echo sounder in october 2013 with 432 beams in 4 sectors per ping and the swath angle is about 125 there are 468288 points in the data and the average depth of the test area is about 457 m due to the increased beam steering angles for yaw stabilization when the ship is turning the depth biases between sector boundaries are easy to show survey line with ship turning is selected to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the installation parameters of the transmitter and receiver on the ship are interpreted from the original data as shown in table 2 the measured data is processed by qm the vcca the ncca and our method respectively and the results of qm are shown in fig 5 currently commercial software such as qimera and caris considers the influence of offset when calculating the location and depth of footprints in its software processing module however the algorithms used in qimera and caris are not published and only the algorithms of the vcca and the ncca are published to acquire the most accurate and effective results besides due to truth values depths and locations of the seabed in study area are unknown the verification of published algorithms is hard to implement so the results of commercial software such as qimera are used as in situ measurements to evaluate the accuracy of other algorithms results hamilton et al 2014 wu et al 2013 then the results of the vcca the ncca and the proposed method and the corresponding depth differences with the results of qm are calculated and illustrated in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the external performance of the seabed topographic maps processed by the vcca fig 6a the ncca fig 6c and the proposed method fig 6e are almost identical and no discontinuity exists between sectors the reason is that the offset between the transmitter and receiver is a very small value compared to the deep water depth the maps are processed with normal ship parameters with the maximum offset in x axis direction being 2 14 m and biases caused by the offset are much smaller than the water depth of 457 m this phenomenon meets the fact that the beam vectors vary with the depth and will asymptotically approach values calculated by the vcca i e errors caused by the offset decrease as the water gets deeper hamilton et al 2014 the appearance of the seabed topographic maps processed by the vcca the ncca and our method seems almost identical which cannot verify the effectiveness of the algorithms the corresponding depth biases compared to qm are presented as shown in fig 6 b the depth biases between qm and the vcca are relatively large with the maximum and average depth biases being 1 34 m and 0 48 m due to larger steering angles for yaw stabilization in edge areas s1 and s4 illustrated in fig 5 depth biases distributed in these areas are larger than those in the middle areas s2 and s3 illustrated in fig 5 compared to the vcca the depth biases decrease rapidly when using the ncca and our method as shown in fig 6 d and fig 6 f the maximum and average depth biases between qm and the ncca fig 6d are approximately 0 37 m and 0 25 m respectively the maximum and average depth biases between qm and our method fig 6f are about 0 37 m and 0 24 m respectively the magnitude and distribution of the depth biases in fig 6 d and fig 6 f are very similar then to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method the installation parameters are deliberately set wrong due to the reason that errors caused by incorrectly set within the installation parameters of the transducers behave the same as errors introduced by the neglect of the offset hamilton et al 2014 so the x parameter for the installation of the transmitter is deliberately changed to 19 01 m and the data is then reprocessed by qm the vcca the ncca and our method respectively the results and the corresponding depth differences compared with the results of qm are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 when the measured data is reprocessed by qm with the adjusted parameters with the maximum offset in x axis expanded to 7 86 m the depth biases between sectors caused by the offset are obvious as the imprints pointed by the red lines in fig 7 the results of the ncca and our methods also have similar performance as shown in fig 8 c and fig 8 d whereas the results of the vcca have no changes the phenomenon meets the fact that the offset is a parameter in qm the ncca and our method and is not considered by the vcca with the expanded offset errors between sectors are obvious for the comprehensive effect of the txsteer angles and rxsteer angles on the depth of footprints in this case the maximum and the average depth biases between qm and the vcca grow up to 4 37 m and 0 90 m with the maximum biases far beyond the demanding accuracy of 0 5 depth as shown in fig 8b however by using the ncca or our method the depth biases decrease rapidly with the maximum depth biases between qm and the ncca reduced to 0 37 m fig 8d and the maximum depth biases between qm and our method reduced to 0 41 m fig 8f respectively the average depth biases in fig 8 d and fig 8 f are about 0 26 m and 0 25 m respectively therefore with the expanded offset the proposed method still has an almost identical performance with the ncca and approaches the results of qm and depth differences between the results of the ncca and our method are used to further prove the effectiveness of our method as shown in fig 9 besides based on the measured data ten groups of calculations are carried on and the average time consuming for the two methods is counted to prove the high efficiency of our method with the wrong parameters the results of the proposed method are very close to those of the ncca as shown in fig 9 with the maximum and average depth biases being about 0 19 m and 0 03 m respectively and these biases can be neglected when considering the demanding accuracy of 0 5 depth table 3 shows that with the same number of points in the data the proposed method costs less time with the efficiency improved by 17 this is because iteration such as newton iterative method which is used to solve the hyperbolic equations eq 1 in the ncca for each beam is avoided in the proposed method thus the new method can reduce computational complexity and improve data process efficiency 3 3 discussion of the proposed algorithm although the proposed method avoids the complex geometric models with the two intersected hyperbolas in the ncca being replaced by two separate triangles the proposed method is also deduced under the assumption of the transmitted and received patterns being regular cones so the two methods are essentially under the same assumptions with different methods to find the same results as shown by fig 10 and the statistics of the small biases of the two methods in section 3 2 can also confirm it thus it indirectly proves that the proposed method can also eliminate errors caused by the offset between the transmitter and receiver however there are still remaining biases between the two methods which may be caused by the systematic errors of the two methods for instance the newton iterative method to solve eq 1 in the ncca may introduce uncertainties to the final results waltz et al 2006 consequently as pointed out in the ncca the regular cones only form in a homogeneous water column when the sound velocities vary highly with the depth transmitted and received cones are irregular for the effect of refraction which will lead to distortions of the projected hyperbolas or triangles and bring errors into the footprints 4 conclusions this paper focuses on errors caused by the offset between the transmitter and receiver when calculating the geolocations of multibeam footprints and to solve the issue and avoid the sophisticated hyperbola equations in the published methods a simplified calibration method is proposed which is developed on the basis of the existed algorithms i e the vcca and the ncca by using the two intersected triangles the analytical expression of the coordinates of the footprint can be directly given and newton s method to solve the complex hyperbolic equations is left out the results show that with normal installation parameters when the water depth is about 457 m the maximum and the average depth biases between our result and qimera are 0 37 m and 0 24 m respectively when the offset is enlarged the maximum and average biases between our result and qimera are 0 41 m and 0 25 m respectively the average deviation between the complicated ncca and our simplified method is about 0 03 m our new method saves about 17 of the computation time compared to that of the ncca therefore the simplified calibration method has a significant effect on solving errors caused by the offset and improving the efficiency of multibeam post data processing declaration of competing interest the

22126,upcoming legislative developments and modern propeller designs call for numerical methods which are able to assess the complex interaction of the propeller s hydrodynamic and structural dynamic behaviour as well as the resulting influence on the acoustic signature in this work the problem is engaged making use of a partitioned strongly coupled solution approach thus enabling the usage of specialized solvers for each domain on the fluid side a boundary element method is applied while on the structural side a finite element method is employed information transfer between each subproblem is handled by a separate coupling tool the acoustic evaluation is performed by means of a ffowcs williams hawkings equation based technique in the present paper the main focus is to establish the method s capability to simulate the interaction of all fields and its physical consistency the results show that an external excitation of the blade can be captured in the resulting acoustic spectrum keywords propeller fluid structure interaction ffowcs williams hawkings equation 1 introduction recently the increase of noise pollution in the oceans due to human related activities has attracted a lot of attention from corresponding authorities unfortunately ships and their activities are among the main causes of noise generation in the oceans it has been claimed that this industry alone has caused at least 20 db increase in the ambient noise in the oceans consequently specific regulations concerning the noise emission of commercial ships are to be expected in the next couple of years for instance one can point out the recent deliberations of the international maritime organization imo with regard to marine noise pollution imo 2014 or those by the bureau veritas bv which recently introduced the optional class notation nr 614 to address concerns related to underwater radiated noise generated by ships bv 2014 these deliberations are also highlighted by findings of the european commission eu 2010 regarding the preservation of the marine water environmental status it is therefore expected that in the near future one of the major concerns of the marine industry will be to evaluate ship induced far field noise at the design stage naturally marine propellers are subjected to inhomogeneous inflow conditions due to their operation in the hull wake ship maneuvers as well as other influences such as wave motion it is therefore required to consider blade loads as well as the resulting blade deformations as transient in time in conventional propeller design however the blades are usually considered as rigid or simplified methods utilizing mean blade loads and cantilever beam theory carlton 2018 are employed to assess the influence of blade elasticity as propeller geometries as well as materials used in the past were not likely to allow large deformations or vibrations and the acoustic signature of the propeller was of secondary interest this approach was mostly sufficient for modern propeller design procedures this is not the case highly skewed geometries and composite materials may lead to severe deformations and vibrations which affect propeller performance as well as acoustic signature and must be treated in a wholesome manner it is therefore mandatory to develop simulation methods which are able to predict the dynamic behaviour and acoustic far field of flexible marine propellers in inhomogeneous wake conditions under consideration of fluid structure interaction fsi these techniques need to provide a balance between accuracy and efficiency suitable for the design stage considering the modelling of the fluid domain the boundary element method bem offers a balance between accuracy and efficiency most suitable for design purposes katz and plotkin 2001 in this work the potential theory based first order panel method panmare is employed which is an in house development considering the coupled simulation tool presented in this work is intended to be used in the early stages of propeller design it will mainly be used to investigate propellers operating close to the design point for these configurations pressure based effects are dominant as for example leading edge separation or other viscosity based effects should not be present for off design conditions the applicability of the method has to be carefully evaluated with regard to the acoustic signature of marine propellers cavitation effects are considered as one of the most distinct influences on the acoustic spectrum in the scope of a bem a partially non linear model without mesh modification vaz and bosschers 2006 can be employed to efficiently simulate sheet cavitation phenomena which are considered as the dominating factors for the acoustic spectrum in the frequency range below 200 hz collier 1997 in the described frequency range the highest sound pressure amplitudes are usually associated with the blade frequency range and multiples thereof which in turn are mostly dependant on pressure fluctuations due to blade motion and loads as well as the evolution of sheet cavitation on the blade the growth and collapse of cavitation bubbles which is largely responsible for the broadband sound in higher frequency ranges should not hold a large influence for the described application cases on the structural side effort can be made to utilize high order finite element methods p fem szabó and babuška 1991 düster et al 2017 in order to decrease the computational effort here the high order finite element code adhoc düster and kollmannsberger 2010 is employed which is also developed at the tuhh the various solution approaches for fsi problems may roughly be divided into two groups in monolithic approaches the coupled problem is discretized and solved as a whole i e the individual subproblems are solved simultaneously usually using a common numerical method in partitioned approaches the subproblems are solved separately the interaction is accounted for by exchanging coupling quantities between the subproblems which for fsi problems are the structural displacements and the fluid loads during the solution of one subproblem the coupling quantities depending on the other subproblem are held fixed which demands for an iterative solution and exchange of data if an implicit coupling is desired for an in depth explanation of monolithic and partitioned solution approaches for fsi we refer to bungartz and schäfer 2006 bungartz et al 2010 or bazilevs et al 2013 here we like to emphasize that partitioned solution approaches allow to utilize existing software and specialized numerical methods for the individual subproblems in addition different methods can be utilized to stabilize and accelerate the solution process to this end the most promising method was found to be the quasi newton least squares qnls method proposed in degroote et al 2009 an acoustic evaluation of the coupled problem is performed in a post processing fashion considering the fluid problem an approach based on incompressible potential theory is used to simulate the hydrodynamic domain which assumes an infinite magnitude for the speed of sound accurate far field acoustic properties can only be obtained by the use of an additional technique here the ffowcs williams hawkings equation fwhe in formulation 1a brenter and farassat 2003 is used since the required input consists only of body movement and load related terms this formulation facilitates an efficient and easily applicable usage in the context of a bem and allows the consideration of fluid compressibility the paper s main intention is to present a simulation framework capable of handling the complex interaction of the structural fluid and acoustic domains with regard to these problems no validation data is currently available and the chosen simulation setups are therefore intended to highlight the general capabilities of the simulation technique as well as its physical consistency the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in the next section the governing equations for fluid structural and acoustical mechanics are summarized and the initial boundary value problem underlying the fsi simulation is introduced in section 3 the discretization techniques utilized for each domain are described in order to establish confidence in the modelling of the individual domains as well as the coupling software preliminary studies conducted in our previous work are considered in section 4 before the setup investigated in this work is presented in section 5 at last in section 6 the p1356 propeller richter and heinke 2006 is simulated in configurations of varying complexity and the results are discussed 2 governing equations of fluid structural and acoustic subproblem as the partitioned solution approach enables the use of separate solvers for each domain the governing equations for the fluid structural and acoustic subproblem are introduced here separately too the coupled solution of the structural and fluid field is realized using coupling conditions which in each subproblem can be represented by standard boundary conditions since the acoustic evaluation is obtained by means of a post processing technique a cohesive mathematical description is utilized but no further coupling conditions need to be introduced a schematic description of the coupling process is given in fig 1 which also illustrates the respective domains and the associated terminology 2 1 fluid subproblem the hydrodynamic domain is simulated utilizing a potential theory based simulation method thus an incompressible irrotational and inviscid fluid is assumed the potential flow can therefore be computed by solving the laplace equation 1 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 in ω t f for the velocity potential φ the potential φ is a linear combination of the potential due to the movement of the body relative to a fixed

respective surface while r is the distance between x and a point on the surface the introduced doublets μ and sources σ are defined as 4 μ φ φ i and σ φ n φ i n respectively therein φ i denotes the internal potential of the body in order to yield a solvable system of equations from a discretization of equation 3 boundary conditions need to be prescribed as the disturbance due to the body should not be present in the far field 5 lim r φ 0 on γ t f must hold which is already in place due to the general nature of the formula given in equation 3 naturally another condition is to allow no flow normal to the body surface which can be prescribed by 6 grad φ φ n 0 on γ t f for coherent bodies this requires that the potential inside the boundary will not change such that 7 φ i c o n s t in ω t

hence also shed a wake from a sharp trailing edge te are investigated thus the kutta condition katz and plotkin 2001 is employed which enables us to specify the doublet strength in the wake in this context the kutta condition states that there should be no velocity component normal to the camber line at the trailing edge of the respective section assuming a continuous velocity a stagnation point must therefore be present at the trailing edge and the pressure difference between suction and pressure side must be zero this infers a stagnation point at the trailing edge where the pressure difference between suction and pressure side is zero 9 δ p t e 0 physical considerations yield that the wake is force free which in turn infers that equation 9 holds on γ f w with regard to bem special care has to be given to the deformation of the wake in this case a first order accurate explicit euler scheme is used which enforces the wake geometry to be locally tangent to the direction of the flow the general methodology is given in wang et al 2016 2 1 1 sheet cavitation as one of the main contributors to the overall acoustic signature of marine propellers the occurrence and development of sheet cavitation on the blades is considered the boundary conditions utilized in the model are prescribed on the body surface instead of the cavity and the discretization is not altered during the simulation to optimize the grid with regard to the cavitation model thus the model is termed partially non linear without mesh modification vaz 2005 a thorough description of the cavitation model and its implementation would be out of the scope of this work for further information the reader is referred to gaschler 2017 at this time only a schematic view of the underlying theoretical considerations is given in order to illustrate the integration of the sheet cavitation model in the larger scope of the complete method two additional boundary conditions are utilized in the model namely the dynamic dbc and kinematic kbc boundary conditions for the dbc it is assumed that the pressure in the cavity region denoted by γ t c is equal to the vapour pressure p v such that p p v on γ t c this condition can be transformed using the unsteady bernoulli equation such that an expression for the potential on the cavitating part of the body is obtained viz 10 φ φ 0 ξ v 2 2 ρ p p v 2 g z

of the velocity on the cavity sheet must be zero such that 12 d d t f s 1 s 2 s 3 t 0 on γ t c with f s 3 t c a v s 1 s 2 t representing the cavity surface here t c a v refers to the cavity thickness contrary to the approach for the dbc the kbc is formulated making use of a local non orthogonal coordinate system with coordinates s s 1 s 2 s 3 t and basis vectors t 1 t 2 t 3 while directions s 1 and s 3 coincide with ξ and ζ direction s 2 depends on the local discretization see section 3 1 1 the kbc can now be rewritten which yields 13 t c a v s 1 v s 1 t 1 t 2 v s 2 t c a v s 2 v s 2 t 1 t 2 v s 1 t 1 t 2 2 v s 3 t c a v t therein v s 1 s 2 s 3 denote the total velocity components which harbour contributions of the effective velocity due to body movement and inflow conditions as well as those of the induced velocity in direction of the coordinate system s respective basis vectors these velocities are described by 14 v s k φ s k v t k for k 1 2 3 2 2 structural subproblem the underlying differential equation of the structural subproblem is the balance of linear momentum as described for example in wriggers 2008 the balance of linear momentum can be stated in the undeformed reference configuration as 15 ρ 0 d div f s ρ 0 b in ω 0 s with d denoting the acceleration ρ 0 is the density in the undeformed configuration and b denotes a volume load d is the unknown displacement field f x x denotes the deformation gradient and s is the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor we employ the st venant kirchhoff model to relate s with the green lagrange strain e 1 2 f t f 1 by 16 s λ tr e i 2 μ e c e therein c corresponds to the elasticity tensor known from linear theory where it describes the relation between the engineering strain and the cauchy stress in addition to equation 15 dirichlet displacement and neumann traction boundary conditions 17 d d on γ 0 s d 18 f s n t on γ 0 s t and homogeneous initial conditions are prescribed here n represents the unit outward normal vector on the boundary of ω 0 s while t and d are given surface tractions and displacements respectively 2 3 coupling conditions having introduced the governing equations for the structural and fluid domain the interaction of both domains can be achieved by the introduction of coupling constraints obviously the enforcement of the coupling constraints must be carried out on the shared boundary of both domains denoted as γ fsi the motion of the fluid boundary γ t f b must adhere to that of the structure which is easily achieved by specifying the position of nodes of the fluid mesh according to the displacements yielded by the structural simulation if d ˆ x t is used to describe the displacement of γ t f b from its initial position at t 0 19 d ˆ d on γ t fsi must be satisfied equation 19 also facilitates the imposition of the second constraint which enforces equal velocities of fluid and structural boundary such that for the body in the fluid subproblem the velocity 20 v m o v e d on γ t fsi holds the boundary conditions described by equation 19 and equation 20 need to be prescribed in the fluid domain on the structural side an equilibrium of the tractions t must be enforced such that 21 t p n τ w on γ t fsi therein τ w denotes the wall shear stress with regard to potential theory which makes use of the assumption of an inviscid fluid τ w is approximated on a panel wise basis within the bem using an empirical friction coefficient 2 4 acoustic subproblem an acoustic evaluation of the simulations is performed in a post processing fashion making use of the fwhe in formulation 1a brenter and farassat 2003 the required input consists only of load and movement related data to be collected at the surface of the evaluated body thus enabling an easy usage in the scope of bem in general and the coupled problems considered in this work in the present algorithm all data is collected from the fluid domain due to the enforcement of the coupling conditions described in equations 19 and 20 structural deformations and vibrations are accounted for with regard to the acoustic solution a distinction between contributions of fluid displacement p t and body loading p l is made to obtain the overall acoustic pressure p 22 4 π p t x o t γ f b ρ v a n a v a n a e 1 m e 2 ret dγ f b γ f b ρ v a n a e m e c m e c m 2 e 2 1 m e 3 ret dγ f b 23 4 π p l x o t 1 c γ f b l e e 1 m e 2

a refers to the surface unit normal vector in order to account for fsi effects as well as cavitation the fwhe velocity vector v a contains contributions attributed to rigid body movement and structural deformations as well as those associated with the development of cavitation on the blade viz 25 v a v m o v e n a t c a v t the term t c a v t is obtained according to the considerations in section 2 1 1 all values are taken at a retarded time 26 t r e t t e c which refers to the time of emission naturally this time does usually not coincide with the chosen time steps and a linear interpolation is utilized to obtain the required information 3 numerical methods in this work a partitioned solution approach is pursued as this allows the use of specialized and well developed simulation software for each involved domain information transfer between the subproblems is managed by the in house coupling software comana see könig et al 2016 in the following the discretization methods for all involved subproblems are summarized and a coherent description of the coupling process is given 3 1 boundary element method the hydrodynamic domain is handled by means of a boundary element method for detailed information regarding the method s fundamental principles and its implementation the reader is referred to katz and plotkin 2001 for the purpose of this work it is important to note that the surface of body and wake are discretized by first order panels on which a constant variable strength is assumed a discretized formulation of equation 3 which is suitable for numerical solution is given by 27 0 n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b μ n grad 1 r dγ i f b n w i 1 1 4 π γ i f w μ n grad 1 r dγ i f w n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b σ 1 r dγ i f b here n b and n w denote the number of panels used to discretize the body and wake surface respectively considering equation 27 only the doublet strength on the body panels is unkown since the doublet strength in the wake can be prescribed employing the kutta condition katz and plotkin 2001 and the source strength on the body is given by 28 σ n v on γ t f b in this context rigid body motions influences due to structural deformation as well as the inflow field of the propeller are accounted for in the effective velocity v which governs the body panel source strength if a non uniform inflow field is specified the point set describing the inflow is projected onto the propeller blades and the respective velocities are prescribed at the thus identified panels evaluating equation 27 at each collocation point on γ f b yields an equation system and its solution delivers the unknown doublet strength for all body panels the now available doublet and source strengths can be inserted in a discrete formulation of equation 3 yielding the solution for the potential 29 φ x n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b μ n grad 1 r dγ i f b n w i 1 1 4 π γ i f w μ n grad 1 r dγ i f w n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b σ 1 r dγ i f b φ the pressure at each

respective traction is calculated by means of 30 t f t a γ i f b with f t as the total force vector acting on the panel and a γ i f b denoting the panel area 3 1 1 partially non linear cavitation model without mesh modification due to the technique chosen to model sheet cavitation on the propeller blades the discretization of the fluid mesh is not altered the local orthogonal coordinate system s base vectors are defined using the respective panels geometry direction ξ is given by the chordwise edges midpoints while direction ζ is normal to the panel surface the coordinate systems utilized in the sheet cavitation model are illustrated in fig 2 it is assumed that the orientation of the radial panel strips coincides with the direction of the local flow and thus the integral in the dbc is evaluated along each strip pressure and suction side are evaluated separately as the dbc and kbc are prescribed and evaluated for each side a discretized formulation of the dbc is then given by 31 φ l

radial strips here l 0 l r holds with l r referring to the index of the reattachment panel the potential at the detachment point is denoted by φ l d m and ξ d refers to the distance between each panel s chordwise edge midpoints regarding the kbc with l m indicating an approximation of the spatial and temporal derivatives by a central difference scheme and a backwards difference scheme respectively

the corresponding southern edge see fig 2 following the considerations in gaschler 2017 and vaz 2005 prescribing the discrete kbc at all cavitating panels yields a system of equations for the cavity thickness such that 33 m k t k c a v f k here k denotes the discrete time step a schematic description of the solution algorithm for the hydrodynamic domain is then given by 1 compute time steps using the fully wetted solution process depicted in sections 2 1 and 3 1 until a periodical solution is acquired 2 activate cavitation model 3 estimate initial cavity shape based on p p v 4 prescribe dipole strength on cavitating panels according to equation 31 5 utilizing the computed dipole strength set up and solve the new system of equations for an updated pressure and velocity field 6 solve equation 33 for the cavity thickness at all panels 7 if the cavity thickness at the reattachment panels exceed a certain threshold move cavity boundaries up downstream at the respective panel strip the conditions for the modification of the cavity boundaries are described in gaschler 2017 and vaz 2005 8 repeat steps 4 8 until convergence is achieved 9 proceed to next time step and repeat steps 4 9 considering the integration of the cavitation model in the overall fsi algorithm high fidelity is pursued the dynamic interaction of blade movement and deformation with the cavities developing on the propeller blade is considered in each time step as well as each of the fsi iterations see fig 3 3 2 finite element method since the discretization process with respect to fem is well known in this work only a brief description is given in order to ensure a coherent description of the coupling algorithm see section 3 3 the structural domain ω 0 s is described by a set of elements ω e s within each of these elements the unknown displacement field can be obtained as a weighted sum of shape functions 34 d i 1 n n i ξ η ζ d i in ω e s where ξ η and ζ denote the local element coordinates here d i corresponds to the degree of freedom i as commonly described in literature integrated legendre polynomials are used to obtain a hierarchical basis a weak form is acquired from the discretized problem using the formulas for the geometrical description as well as the unkown displacement field see e g wriggers 2008 the generalized α method see e g kuhl and crisfield 1999 is utilized as the time integration method while a mass proportional damping is employed the resulting nonlinear system is solved using the newton raphson method 3 3 coupling algorithms regarding the structural domain the solution process of acquiring a discretized displacement field due to specified loads can be described in each time step k as 35 d k s t k here d k refers to the displacement vector of the fluid nodes considering the basic nature of the coupling process as depicted in fig 1 it is apparent that the fluid solver needs to be supplied with displacements while the input to the structural solver consists of the occurring tractions while the displacements need to be prescribed at the nodes of the fluid mesh the tractions are required at the quadrature points of the structural mesh naturally these point sets do not coincide requiring the use of dedicated techniques to obtain the information at the required positions the displacements at the required points are obtained by projecting the fluid vertices onto the structural mesh and using the shape functions of the fem to acquire the displacement at the respective positions having obtained the required displacement field it is applied to the vertices of the fluid mesh on a pointwise basis the current position of a fluid mesh point is thus prescribed as the addition of the point s original position and it s current displacement the operator s describes the computation of the displacement field as well as its evaluation at the projected points the loads are described by the vector t k which collects the tractions at the quadrature points of the structural mesh in this work vectors marked with an overbar indicate that the therein collected quantities are prescribed within the subproblem the corresponding operator refers to an operator formulation for the fluid subproblem is introduced and reads 36 t k f d k considering the structural subproblem described by equation 35 the displacement field can directly be evaluated at the required points for the fluid problem which is managed by a bem this is not the case and an interpolation of the tractions from the collocation points of the fluid mesh to the quadrature points of the finite elements must be performed the interpolation method utilized here is a mesh based inverse distance weighting könig et al 2016 denoting the interpolation by the operator i yields 37 t k i t k consequently it may be worthwhile to note that for the displacements d k d k holds while for the tractions t k t k the coupling algorithm used here can now be described by the introduced operators such that in terms of a fixed point interpolation 38 d k i 1 a k i s k i f k d k i holds fig 3 illustrates the coupling algorithm the operator a k i refers to a convergence acceleration method which in this case is the quasi newton least squares method for a thorough description of the method the reader is referred to degroote et al 2009 or radtke et al 2016 in the context of the coupling algorithm the convergence acceleration infers a manipulation of the deformation field obtained by the structural solver before it is transferred to the fluid solver it is possible to further simplify the notation by combining the existing operators into p k yielding 39 d k i 1 a k i p k d k i a k i d k i 1 here d k i 1 denotes the unmodified solution obtained from the solver on the basis of this a residual can be formulated concerning the occurring displacements vectors such that 40 r k i d k i 1 d k i by defining a threshold the residual is used to assess the convergence in each iteration of the calculated time steps 3 4 ffowcs williams hawkings equation the discretization used to evaluate the acoustic part of the simulations coincides with that of the fluid mesh the contributions of body displacement and loading as well as the resulting overall pressure at the observer point can therefore be obtained by 41 4 π p t x o t n b i 1 γ i f b ρ v a n a v

multi field problems in general it would be best to investigate the behaviour of each field s solver on its own before assessing the performance of the coupled technique as this would be out of the scope of this paper the reader is referred to several previously published papers in order to establish confidence in the modelling of the structural fluid and acoustic domain as well as the coupling process panmare has been used in the context of a wide range of application cases covering configurations involving propellers as well as propeller acoustics but also wind turbines and others the capabilities of the code with regard to simulations involving propellers in unsteady inflow conditions has been demonstrated in scharf et al 2015 by means of a comparison of pressure fluctuations obtained from panmare and a rans calculation in göttsche et al 2017 the acoustic signature of a pulsating sphere is evaluated and compared to a reference solution based on the bernoulli equation furthermore results of panmare s acoustic evaluation tool where compared against measurements in göttsche et al 2019 and kleinsorge et al 2017 in gaschler 2017 the setup which is investigated here is simulated for a rigid propeller and thus findings regarding the discretization of the fluid domain could be transferred comana which handles the coupling process has likewise been used in various application cases such as the simulation of flexible wind turbines wiegard et al 2019 or the berthing maneuver of offshore service ships ferreira gonzález et al 2015 an investigation of the coupling process as well as the convergence behaviour of propeller related structural meshes used in adhoc has been performed in radtke et al 2018 comana s basic methodology with regard to information transfer and details of its implementation can be accessed in könig et al 2016 5 setup in this work the sva p1356 propeller richter and heinke 2006 of the kcs container ship is investigated the fluid as well as structural mesh used in the following simulations is shown in fig 4 in all simulations the time step for both structural and fluid domain is chosen such that the propeller rotates by 1 in each step table 1 gives an overview of all investigated configurations common parameters naturally material properties are only applied in simulations when elasticity is taken into account for simulations involving inhomogeneous inflow conditions the hull wake field illustrated in fig 5 is prescribed the hull wake field is considered as stationary with respect to time for the acoustic evaluation of all configurations only one of the propeller blades is considered this choice was made in order to facilitate the assessment of the influence of elasticity on the acoustic characteristics which is hard to distinguish for cases in which the interaction of inhomogeneous inflow conditions cavitation effects the effect of the propeller blades on each other and the blade flexibility are taken into account simultaneously the observation point underlying all acoustic evaluations is located at a distance of 30 m in direction of the y axis see fig 4 to the propeller center as the evaluation point is still well within the near field a solution can for non cavitating cases also be obtained by a purely potential theory based approach utilizing the unsteady bernoulli equation throughout the simulations the relative position of propeller and observation point remains fixed 6 results and discussion in the following configurations of varying complexity are simulated in order to demonstrate the capabilities and physical consistency of the presented approach 6 1 homogeneous inflow full propeller for an initial assessment of the presented method the full propeller is simulated in homogeneous inflow conditions after a correct modelling of the hydrodynamic domain has been ensured blade elasticity and its effect on the acoustic signature of the propeller is considered fig 6 presents the thrust and torque coefficient at multiple advance coefficients calculated by panmare for a rigid propeller and compares them to results obtained in experiments by richter and heinke 2006 both thrust and torque coefficient show a slight deviation from the experiments at the entire range of advance coefficients for the torque coefficient an increasing deviation from the experimental results is observed for decreasing advance coefficients since the propeller thrust is expected to have a dominating influence on the occurring deformations the integrity of the results should not be affected though the propeller is then simulated at an advance coefficient of j 0 75 under consideration of varying magnitudes of elasticity table 2 presents the utilized material properties as well as the resulting coefficients for thrust torque and efficiency in this case the blade deformation causes a reduction of both blade thrust and torque the effect becomes increasingly pronounced for high blade flexibility while the efficiency remains relatively unaffected for moderate elasticity parameters the method predicts a slight increase in efficiency for the case with a young s modulus of e 2 10 9 pa since stiffness values of this amount would cause unacceptable vibrations of the blades a transfer of these findings to actually operating propellers is infeasible the reduction of thrust and torque is also reflected in the occurring deformation field fig 7 presents the deformations of the propeller blades median plane at different relative radii the blades experience different amounts of deformation at leading and trailing edge thus changing the pitch angle which is considered as the dominating influence responsible for the altered performance characteristics of the propeller the change in pitch angle estimated employing the deformation values at leading and trailing edge and the assumption of a constant chord length is also given in fig 7 via the annotations associated with each section plot all sections experience a reduction in pitch angle which in turn causes the reduction of propeller thrust and torque the progression of pressures calculated based on the fwhe at the observation point is given in fig 8 although the hydrodynamic results were obtained for the whole propeller only one blade is taken into account in the acoustic evaluation for the reasons given in section 5 for better comparability both graphs are shifted to their mean values although thrust and torque coefficient were severely reduced for the flexible propeller the progression of the fwh pressures is almost unaffected as homogeneous inflow conditions are prescribed no perturbation of the pressure plots due to structural vibrations is present consequently the resulting acoustic spectrum at the observation point which is presented in fig 9 for the rigid case is almost identical 6 2 homogeneous inflow sinusoidal load full propeller the investigations conducted in section 6 1 yielded a static deformation field for each propeller blade since homogeneous inflow conditions were prescribed and no gravitation is considered in the simulations in order to verify the capabilities of the method with respect to capturing the influence of structural vibrations on the resulting acoustic signature another simulation setup is evaluated the full propeller is simulated in homogeneous inflow conditions and a sinusoidally varying traction is added to the loads occurring due to the actual operation of the propeller in this case the added traction field is spatially constant and only acts in direction of the x axis see fig 4 while the excitation frequency is chosen as f e x 36 h z the maximum magnitude of the added tractions is t a d d 25 10 3 n m 2 coherent with the investigations in the previous section the setup is evaluated using varying stiffness parameters as a sinusoidally varying load was prescribed the mean thrust and torque coefficients closely match the final values computed in the previous section see table 2 in the following the fwh pressure time series at the observation point is analysed by means of a fast fourier transform fft and the resulting acoustic spectrum is given in fig 9 the annotations in the plot denote the rotation rate and the excitation frequency the most dominating frequency is found to be the propeller rotation rate with the associated peak in the spectrum developing over multiple adjacent frequencies the reason for the increased energy content in the adjacent frequencies lies in the choice of setup which only considers one of the propeller blades leading to a pressure time series at the observation point which is not entirely based on a single frequency another distinct peak in the spectrum is observed at the excitation frequency the results indicate that the method presented here is capable of capturing the influence of structural vibrations on the acoustic spectrum 6 3 inhomogeneous inflow single blade having established a physically consistent behaviour of the simulation approach with respect to configurations involving homogeneous inflow conditions a setup in which a wake field is prescribed is simulated cavitation is not considered yet here only a single blade is considered for both the hydrodynamic and acoustic investigations the undisturbed inflow velocity is v s 7 4 m s 1 while the actual inflow field is specified according to the velocity distribution illustrated in fig 5 table 3 presents the mean thrust torque and efficiency coefficients for the rigid case as well as three cases with varying elasticity contrary to what has been observed for homogeneous inflow conditions the mean thrust and torque coefficient increase with increasing blade flexibility the mean efficiency remains almost unaffected though fig 10 shows the progression of the thrust coefficient over one rotation period for the rigid blade as well as the case with e 2 10 10 pa while the behaviour of the thrust coefficient is almost identical for large parts of the blade s movement through the wake field the thrust coefficient is increased in the vicinity of the 12 o clock position an indication for the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increase in thrust can again be found in the deformation field of the blade which along with the change in pitch angle associated with each section is given in fig 11 due to the inhomogeneous inflow the blade experiences a deformation field fundamentally different to that found in open water conditions while for sections close to the hub a decrease in pitch angle is still present the sections towards the tip are subjected to an increase in pitch angle since the upper part of the blade delivers a higher contribution of the blade thrust the increased load in this region prevails concerning the effect on the overall loads for comparison fig 12 shows the deformation field in open water conditions assuming thrust identity regarding the average thrust in the behind hull configuration the position of the blade relative to the hull wake as well as the resulting pressure field in comparison to that in open water conditions is shown in fig 13 in the vicinity of the evaluated blade position the spatial gradients of inflow velocity are at their maximum thus creating highly different inflow conditions on the respective parts of the blade surface the described conditions in turn lead to the difference between pressure and deformation fields in open water and behind hull conditions in the following an acoustic evaluation of the cases is performed and the resulting acoustic spectrum is given in fig 14 as expected the dominating frequency for the rigid and flexible case is found to be the rotation rate of the propeller blade in accordance with the small changes in thrust coefficient the flexible blade s rotation rate tonal remains almost unchanged due to the consideration of the structural deformations the amplitudes in the frequency range above the rotation rate change and new peaks are introduced to the spectrum at present it could not be verified if these can be associated with the blade s structural modes or if another mechanism is responsible for this behaviour 6 4 inhomogeneous inflow single blade cavitation cavitation is considered as one of the governing influences on the acoustic signature of propellers the setup described in section 6 3 is therefore augmented in order to incorporate cavitation effects the cavitation number based on the blade s rotational speed is chosen as σ n 3 0 such that a coherent cavity is present on the blade when it passes the 12 o clock position of the inflow field and the blade loads are at their maximum an impression of the cavity developing on the blade is given in fig 15 table 4 summarizes the results of the cases investigated in this section due to the consideration of cavitation on the propeller blade both mean thrust and torque coefficient are slightly reduced for the cases involving flexible blades a similar behaviour to what has been observed in section 6 3 is present as the mean blade loads increase with decreasing blade stiffness the acoustic spectrum for the cavitating rigid and flexible blade is presented in fig 16 in the frequency range above the tonal associated with the rotation rate frequency energy density is increased and the sound pressure levels are raised in comparison to the non cavitating case the distinct peaks in the frequency range in between 15 and 35 hz which were present in the frequency spectrum of the non cavitating blade see fig 14 are not observable any more it is assumed that due to the increased energy density in this frequency range the respective tonals are not as easily distinguishable as before 7 conclusion an approach for the assessment of the far field acoustic signature of marine propellers under consideration of inhomogeneous inflow cavitation and blade elasticity was presented a partitioned algorithm is utilized enabling the usage of well developed solvers and discretization techniques for each domain the respective solvers are chosen pursuing a balance between accuracy and computational effort suitable of the design stage the fluid domain is handled by a bem while for the structural domain a fem is utilized in the context of the bem cavitation is considered using an additional cavitation model the interaction between fluid and structural domain is managed using a separate framework which utilizes the quasi newton least squares method in order to accelerate and stabilize the solution process an acoustic evaluation of the problems is performed with the fwhe in formulation 1a in the paper a coherent mathematical description of each involved domain as well as the coupling process is given the governing equations in their continuous formulation as well as the discretization techniques for each domain are described as no validation data regarding the full complexity of the problem is available a series of configurations intended to verify a physically consistent behaviour of the coupled simulations is simulated for homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous inflow conditions the correlation between loads experienced by the propeller blade and the corresponding deformation field shows a plausible and sound behaviour in general these findings also apply to the acoustic evaluation if the blade is subjected to an excitation by an additional sinusoidally varying load the excitation frequency is clearly visible in the acoustic spectrum for the non cavitating blade in inhomogeneous inflow peaks which might be attributed to the blade s structural modes are present in the acoustic signature as the same configuration with consideration of sheet cavitation does not exhibit these tonals it is assumed that due to the dynamic behaviour of the sheet cavitation energy is introduced to the spectrum at a frequency range which coincides with the previously observed peaks thus obstructing their extraction by means of fft analysis the method presented here shows a stable and consistent behaviour future research priorities should be directed at the integration of the method in an optimization process regarding the acoustic properties of marine propellers naturally a validation of the complete method as well as its components should also be

22126,upcoming legislative developments and modern propeller designs call for numerical methods which are able to assess the complex interaction of the propeller s hydrodynamic and structural dynamic behaviour as well as the resulting influence on the acoustic signature in this work the problem is engaged making use of a partitioned strongly coupled solution approach thus enabling the usage of specialized solvers for each domain on the fluid side a boundary element method is applied while on the structural side a finite element method is employed information transfer between each subproblem is handled by a separate coupling tool the acoustic evaluation is performed by means of a ffowcs williams hawkings equation based technique in the present paper the main focus is to establish the method s capability to simulate the interaction of all fields and its physical consistency the results show that an external excitation of the blade can be captured in the resulting acoustic spectrum keywords propeller fluid structure interaction ffowcs williams hawkings equation 1 introduction recently the increase of noise pollution in the oceans due to human related activities has attracted a lot of attention from corresponding authorities unfortunately ships and their activities are among the main causes of noise generation in the oceans it has been claimed that this industry alone has caused at least 20 db increase in the ambient noise in the oceans consequently specific regulations concerning the noise emission of commercial ships are to be expected in the next couple of years for instance one can point out the recent deliberations of the international maritime organization imo with regard to marine noise pollution imo 2014 or those by the bureau veritas bv which recently introduced the optional class notation nr 614 to address concerns related to underwater radiated noise generated by ships bv 2014 these deliberations are also highlighted by findings of the european commission eu 2010 regarding the preservation of the marine water environmental status it is therefore expected that in the near future one of the major concerns of the marine industry will be to evaluate ship induced far field noise at the design stage naturally marine propellers are subjected to inhomogeneous inflow conditions due to their operation in the hull wake ship maneuvers as well as other influences such as wave motion it is therefore required to consider blade loads as well as the resulting blade deformations as transient in time in conventional propeller design however the blades are usually considered as rigid or simplified methods utilizing mean blade loads and cantilever beam theory carlton 2018 are employed to assess the influence of blade elasticity as propeller geometries as well as materials used in the past were not likely to allow large deformations or vibrations and the acoustic signature of the propeller was of secondary interest this approach was mostly sufficient for modern propeller design procedures this is not the case highly skewed geometries and composite materials may lead to severe deformations and vibrations which affect propeller performance as well as acoustic signature and must be treated in a wholesome manner it is therefore mandatory to develop simulation methods which are able to predict the dynamic behaviour and acoustic far field of flexible marine propellers in inhomogeneous wake conditions under consideration of fluid structure interaction fsi these techniques need to provide a balance between accuracy and efficiency suitable for the design stage considering the modelling of the fluid domain the boundary element method bem offers a balance between accuracy and efficiency most suitable for design purposes katz and plotkin 2001 in this work the potential theory based first order panel method panmare is employed which is an in house development considering the coupled simulation tool presented in this work is intended to be used in the early stages of propeller design it will mainly be used to investigate propellers operating close to the design point for these configurations pressure based effects are dominant as for example leading edge separation or other viscosity based effects should not be present for off design conditions the applicability of the method has to be carefully evaluated with regard to the acoustic signature of marine propellers cavitation effects are considered as one of the most distinct influences on the acoustic spectrum in the scope of a bem a partially non linear model without mesh modification vaz and bosschers 2006 can be employed to efficiently simulate sheet cavitation phenomena which are considered as the dominating factors for the acoustic spectrum in the frequency range below 200 hz collier 1997 in the described frequency range the highest sound pressure amplitudes are usually associated with the blade frequency range and multiples thereof which in turn are mostly dependant on pressure fluctuations due to blade motion and loads as well as the evolution of sheet cavitation on the blade the growth and collapse of cavitation bubbles which is largely responsible for the broadband sound in higher frequency ranges should not hold a large influence for the described application cases on the structural side effort can be made to utilize high order finite element methods p fem szabó and babuška 1991 düster et al 2017 in order to decrease the computational effort here the high order finite element code adhoc düster and kollmannsberger 2010 is employed which is also developed at the tuhh the various solution approaches for fsi problems may roughly be divided into two groups in monolithic approaches the coupled problem is discretized and solved as a whole i e the individual subproblems are solved simultaneously usually using a common numerical method in partitioned approaches the subproblems are solved separately the interaction is accounted for by exchanging coupling quantities between the subproblems which for fsi problems are the structural displacements and the fluid loads during the solution of one subproblem the coupling quantities depending on the other subproblem are held fixed which demands for an iterative solution and exchange of data if an implicit coupling is desired for an in depth explanation of monolithic and partitioned solution approaches for fsi we refer to bungartz and schäfer 2006 bungartz et al 2010 or bazilevs et al 2013 here we like to emphasize that partitioned solution approaches allow to utilize existing software and specialized numerical methods for the individual subproblems in addition different methods can be utilized to stabilize and accelerate the solution process to this end the most promising method was found to be the quasi newton least squares qnls method proposed in degroote et al 2009 an acoustic evaluation of the coupled problem is performed in a post processing fashion considering the fluid problem an approach based on incompressible potential theory is used to simulate the hydrodynamic domain which assumes an infinite magnitude for the speed of sound accurate far field acoustic properties can only be obtained by the use of an additional technique here the ffowcs williams hawkings equation fwhe in formulation 1a brenter and farassat 2003 is used since the required input consists only of body movement and load related terms this formulation facilitates an efficient and easily applicable usage in the context of a bem and allows the consideration of fluid compressibility the paper s main intention is to present a simulation framework capable of handling the complex interaction of the structural fluid and acoustic domains with regard to these problems no validation data is currently available and the chosen simulation setups are therefore intended to highlight the general capabilities of the simulation technique as well as its physical consistency the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in the next section the governing equations for fluid structural and acoustical mechanics are summarized and the initial boundary value problem underlying the fsi simulation is introduced in section 3 the discretization techniques utilized for each domain are described in order to establish confidence in the modelling of the individual domains as well as the coupling software preliminary studies conducted in our previous work are considered in section 4 before the setup investigated in this work is presented in section 5 at last in section 6 the p1356 propeller richter and heinke 2006 is simulated in configurations of varying complexity and the results are discussed 2 governing equations of fluid structural and acoustic subproblem as the partitioned solution approach enables the use of separate solvers for each domain the governing equations for the fluid structural and acoustic subproblem are introduced here separately too the coupled solution of the structural and fluid field is realized using coupling conditions which in each subproblem can be represented by standard boundary conditions since the acoustic evaluation is obtained by means of a post processing technique a cohesive mathematical description is utilized but no further coupling conditions need to be introduced a schematic description of the coupling process is given in fig 1 which also illustrates the respective domains and the associated terminology 2 1 fluid subproblem the hydrodynamic domain is simulated utilizing a potential theory based simulation method thus an incompressible irrotational and inviscid fluid is assumed the potential flow can therefore be computed by solving the laplace equation 1 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 in ω t f for the velocity potential φ the potential φ is a linear combination of the potential due to the movement of the body relative to a fixed frame coordinate system the influence of the perturbation potential induced by the body and an arbitrary background flow the unsteady bernoulli equation is used to obtain the total pressure 2 p p ρ 2 φ 2 φ 2 ρ φ t ρ g z z therein φ and φ denote the disturbed and the free stream potential respectively such that φ φ φ here p and z denote to the atmospheric reference pressure and the reference height where p is prescribed here it refers to the position of the free water surface respectively the constants ρ and g describe fluid density and the gravitational constant by utilizing a distribution of sources σ and doublets μ on the boundary γ f γ f b γ f w a general solution to the described continuity equation is given see e g katz and plotkin 2001 viz 3 φ x 1 4 π γ f μ n grad 1 r dγ f 1 4 π γ f b σ 1 r dγ f b φ in this case the surface of immersed bodies and associated wake surfaces correspond to the boundaries γ f b and γ f w see fig 1 the vector n refers to the unit outward normal of the respective surface while r is the distance between x and a point on the surface the introduced doublets μ and sources σ are defined as 4 μ φ φ i and σ φ n φ i n respectively therein φ i denotes the internal potential of the body in order to yield a solvable system of equations from a discretization of equation 3 boundary conditions need to be prescribed as the disturbance due to the body should not be present in the far field 5 lim r φ 0 on γ t f must hold which is already in place due to the general nature of the formula given in equation 3 naturally another condition is to allow no flow normal to the body surface which can be prescribed by 6 grad φ φ n 0 on γ t f for coherent bodies this requires that the potential inside the boundary will not change such that 7 φ i c o n s t in ω t f b by choosing φ i φ a dirichlet like boundary equation is obtained which reads 8 1 4 π γ f μ n grad 1 r dγ f 1 4 π γ f b σ 1 r dγ f b 0 in this work only propeller blades which produce lift and hence also shed a wake from a sharp trailing edge te are investigated thus the kutta condition katz and plotkin 2001 is employed which enables us to specify the doublet strength in the wake in this context the kutta condition states that there should be no velocity component normal to the camber line at the trailing edge of the respective section assuming a continuous velocity a stagnation point must therefore be present at the trailing edge and the pressure difference between suction and pressure side must be zero this infers a stagnation point at the trailing edge where the pressure difference between suction and pressure side is zero 9 δ p t e 0 physical considerations yield that the wake is force free which in turn infers that equation 9 holds on γ f w with regard to bem special care has to be given to the deformation of the wake in this case a first order accurate explicit euler scheme is used which enforces the wake geometry to be locally tangent to the direction of the flow the general methodology is given in wang et al 2016 2 1 1 sheet cavitation as one of the main contributors to the overall acoustic signature of marine propellers the occurrence and development of sheet cavitation on the blades is considered the boundary conditions utilized in the model are prescribed on the body surface instead of the cavity and the discretization is not altered during the simulation to optimize the grid with regard to the cavitation model thus the model is termed partially non linear without mesh modification vaz 2005 a thorough description of the cavitation model and its implementation would be out of the scope of this work for further information the reader is referred to gaschler 2017 at this time only a schematic view of the underlying theoretical considerations is given in order to illustrate the integration of the sheet cavitation model in the larger scope of the complete method two additional boundary conditions are utilized in the model namely the dynamic dbc and kinematic kbc boundary conditions for the dbc it is assumed that the pressure in the cavity region denoted by γ t c is equal to the vapour pressure p v such that p p v on γ t c this condition can be transformed using the unsteady bernoulli equation such that an expression for the potential on the cavitating part of the body is obtained viz 10 φ φ 0 ξ v 2 2 ρ p p v 2 g z z 2 φ t v i η 2 v e ξ d ξ on γ c here the integration is performed along coordinate ξ of a local orthogonal coordinate system with coordinates ξ ξ η ζ t ξ is oriented in direction of the local streamline and ζ in outward pointing normal direction an illustration of the coordinate systems used for the sheet cavitation model is given in section 3 1 1 in fig 2 the integration starts at the cavity inception or detachment point where φ 0 is present which in this work is always the leading edge pressure and suction side are handled separately the variable v denotes the effective velocity vector due to body movement v m o v e and inflow conditions v i n 11 v v m o v e v i n it should not be confused with the effective velocity term often used in reference to the nature of wake fields v e ξ refers to the component of the effective velocity acting in direction of ξ lastly v i η describes the induced velocity component acting in direction of η the kbc states that the normal component of the velocity on the cavity sheet must be zero such that 12 d d t f s 1 s 2 s 3 t 0 on γ t c with f s 3 t c a v s 1 s 2 t representing the cavity surface here t c a v refers to the cavity thickness contrary to the approach for the dbc the kbc is formulated making use of a local non orthogonal coordinate system with coordinates s s 1 s 2 s 3 t and basis vectors t 1 t 2 t 3 while directions s 1 and s 3 coincide with ξ and ζ direction s 2 depends on the local discretization see section 3 1 1 the kbc can now be rewritten which yields 13 t c a v s 1 v s 1 t 1 t 2 v s 2 t c a v s 2 v s 2 t 1 t 2 v s 1 t 1 t 2 2 v s 3 t c a v t therein v s 1 s 2 s 3 denote the total velocity components which harbour contributions of the effective velocity due to body movement and inflow conditions as well as those of the induced velocity in direction of the coordinate system s respective basis vectors these velocities are described by 14 v s k φ s k v t k for k 1 2 3 2 2 structural subproblem the underlying differential equation of the structural subproblem is the balance of linear momentum as described for example in wriggers 2008 the balance of linear momentum can be stated in the undeformed reference configuration as 15 ρ 0 d div f s ρ 0 b in ω 0 s with d denoting the acceleration ρ 0 is the density in the undeformed configuration and b denotes a volume load d is the unknown displacement field f x x denotes the deformation gradient and s is the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor we employ the st venant kirchhoff model to relate s with the green lagrange strain e 1 2 f t f 1 by 16 s λ tr e i 2 μ e c e therein c corresponds to the elasticity tensor known from linear theory where it describes the relation between the engineering strain and the cauchy stress in addition to equation 15 dirichlet displacement and neumann traction boundary conditions 17 d d on γ 0 s d 18 f s n t on γ 0 s t and homogeneous initial conditions are prescribed here n represents the unit outward normal vector on the boundary of ω 0 s while t and d are given surface tractions and displacements respectively 2 3 coupling conditions having introduced the governing equations for the structural and fluid domain the interaction of both domains can be achieved by the introduction of coupling constraints obviously the enforcement of the coupling constraints must be carried out on the shared boundary of both domains denoted as γ fsi the motion of the fluid boundary γ t f b must adhere to that of the structure which is easily achieved by specifying the position of nodes of the fluid mesh according to the displacements yielded by the structural simulation if d ˆ x t is used to describe the displacement of γ t f b from its initial position at t 0 19 d ˆ d on γ t fsi must be satisfied equation 19 also facilitates the imposition of the second constraint which enforces equal velocities of fluid and structural boundary such that for the body in the fluid subproblem the velocity 20 v m o v e d on γ t fsi holds the boundary conditions described by equation 19 and equation 20 need to be prescribed in the fluid domain on the structural side an equilibrium of the tractions t must be enforced such that 21 t p n τ w on γ t fsi therein τ w denotes the wall shear stress with regard to potential theory which makes use of the assumption of an inviscid fluid τ w is approximated on a panel wise basis within the bem using an empirical friction coefficient 2 4 acoustic subproblem an acoustic evaluation of the simulations is performed in a post processing fashion making use of the fwhe in formulation 1a brenter and farassat 2003 the required input consists only of load and movement related data to be collected at the surface of the evaluated body thus enabling an easy usage in the scope of bem in general and the coupled problems considered in this work in the present algorithm all data is collected from the fluid domain due to the enforcement of the coupling conditions described in equations 19 and 20 structural deformations and vibrations are accounted for with regard to the acoustic solution a distinction between contributions of fluid displacement p t and body loading p l is made to obtain the overall acoustic pressure p 22 4 π p t x o t γ f b ρ v a n a v a n a e 1 m e 2 ret dγ f b γ f b ρ v a n a e m e c m e c m 2 e 2 1 m e 3 ret dγ f b 23 4 π p l x o t 1 c γ f b l e e 1 m e 2

a refers to the surface unit normal vector in order to account for fsi effects as well as cavitation the fwhe velocity vector v a contains contributions attributed to rigid body movement and structural deformations as well as those associated with the development of cavitation on the blade viz 25 v a v m o v e n a t c a v t the term t c a v t is obtained according to the considerations in section 2 1 1 all values are taken at a retarded time 26 t r e t t e c which refers to the time of emission naturally this time does usually not coincide with the chosen time steps and a linear interpolation is utilized to obtain the required information 3 numerical methods in this work a partitioned solution approach is pursued as this allows the use of specialized and well developed simulation software for each involved domain information transfer between the subproblems is managed by the in house coupling software comana see könig et al 2016 in the following the discretization methods for all involved subproblems are summarized and a coherent description of the coupling process is given 3 1 boundary element method the hydrodynamic domain is handled by means of a boundary element method for detailed information regarding the method s fundamental principles and its implementation the reader is referred to katz and plotkin 2001 for the purpose of this work it is important to note that the surface of body and wake are discretized by first order panels on which a constant variable strength is assumed a discretized formulation of equation 3 which is suitable for numerical solution is given by 27 0 n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b μ n grad 1 r dγ i f b n w i 1 1 4 π γ i f w μ n grad 1 r dγ i f w n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b σ 1 r dγ i f b here n b and n w denote the number of panels used to discretize the body and wake surface respectively considering equation 27 only the doublet strength on the body panels is unkown since the doublet strength in the wake can be prescribed employing the kutta condition katz and plotkin 2001 and the source strength on the body is given by 28 σ n v on γ t f b in this context rigid body motions influences due to structural deformation as well as the inflow field of the propeller are accounted for in the effective velocity v which governs the body panel source strength if a non uniform inflow field is specified the point set describing the inflow is projected onto the propeller blades and the respective velocities are prescribed at the thus identified panels evaluating equation 27 at each collocation point on γ f b yields an equation system and its solution delivers the unknown doublet strength for all body panels the now available doublet and source strengths can be inserted in a discrete formulation of equation 3 yielding the solution for the potential 29 φ x n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b μ n grad 1 r dγ i f b n w i 1 1 4 π γ i f w μ n grad 1 r dγ i f w n b i 1 1 4 π γ i f b σ 1 r dγ i f b φ the pressure at each collocation point on the body can now be computed making use of the bernoulli equation 2 in order to obtain the information required for the coupling process a panel force is derived and the respective traction is calculated by means of 30 t f t a γ i f b with f t as the total force vector acting on the panel and a γ i f b denoting the panel area 3 1 1 partially non linear cavitation model without mesh modification due to the technique chosen to model sheet cavitation on the propeller blades the discretization of the fluid mesh is not altered the local orthogonal coordinate system s base vectors are defined using the respective panels geometry direction ξ is given by the chordwise edges midpoints while direction ζ is normal to the panel surface the coordinate systems utilized in the sheet cavitation model are illustrated in fig 2 it is assumed that the orientation of the radial panel strips coincides with the direction of the local flow and thus the integral in the dbc is evaluated along each strip pressure and suction side are evaluated separately as the dbc and kbc are prescribed and evaluated for each side a discretized formulation of the dbc is then given by 31 φ l m φ l d m w l d 1 l v 2 2 ρ p p v 2 g z z 2 φ t v i η 2 v e ξ ξ d w m in this context m and l denote the indices of panel strip and panel in that strip respectively while m covers the range of all radial strips here l 0 l r holds with l r referring to the index of the reattachment panel the potential at the detachment point is denoted by φ l d m and ξ d refers to the distance between each panel s chordwise edge midpoints regarding the kbc with l m indicating an approximation of the spatial and temporal derivatives by a central difference scheme and a backwards difference scheme respectively a discrete formulation is obtained viz 32 t 1 t 2 2 v s 1 t c a v t l m t c a v s 1 v s 1 t 1 t 2 v s 2 l m t c a v s 2 v s 2 t 1 t 2 v s 1 l m in the coordinate system the kbc is formulated in the normal and chordwise direction coincide with the orthogonal coordinate system direction s 2 differs and is oriented in direction of the vector pointing from each panel s center towards the midpoint of the corresponding southern edge see fig 2 following the considerations in gaschler 2017 and vaz 2005 prescribing the discrete kbc at all cavitating panels yields a system of equations for the cavity thickness such that 33 m k t k c a v f k here k denotes the discrete time step a schematic description of the solution algorithm for the hydrodynamic domain is then given by 1 compute time steps using the fully wetted solution process depicted in sections 2 1 and 3 1 until a periodical solution is acquired 2 activate cavitation model 3 estimate initial cavity shape based on p p v 4 prescribe dipole strength on cavitating panels according to equation 31 5 utilizing the computed dipole strength set up and solve the new system of equations for an updated pressure and velocity field 6 solve equation 33 for the cavity thickness at all panels 7 if the cavity thickness at the reattachment panels exceed a certain threshold move cavity boundaries up downstream at the respective panel strip the conditions for the modification of the cavity boundaries are described in gaschler 2017 and vaz 2005 8 repeat steps 4 8 until convergence is achieved 9 proceed to next time step and repeat steps 4 9 considering the integration of the cavitation model in the overall fsi algorithm high fidelity is pursued the dynamic interaction of blade movement and deformation with the cavities developing on the propeller blade is considered in each time step as well as each of the fsi iterations see fig 3 3 2 finite element method since the discretization process with respect to fem is well known in this work only a brief description is given in order to ensure a coherent description of the coupling algorithm see section 3 3 the structural domain ω 0 s is described by a set of elements ω e s within each of these elements the unknown displacement field can be obtained as a weighted sum of shape functions 34 d i 1 n n i ξ η ζ d i in ω e s where ξ η and ζ denote the local element coordinates here d i corresponds to the degree of freedom i as commonly described in literature integrated legendre polynomials are used to obtain a hierarchical basis a weak form is acquired from the discretized problem using the formulas for the geometrical description as well as the unkown displacement field see e g wriggers 2008 the generalized α method see e g kuhl and crisfield 1999 is utilized as the time integration method while a mass proportional damping is employed the resulting nonlinear system is solved using the newton raphson method 3 3 coupling algorithms regarding the structural domain the solution process of acquiring a discretized displacement field due to specified loads can be described in each time step k as 35 d k s t k here d k refers to the displacement vector of the fluid nodes considering the basic nature of the coupling process as depicted in fig 1 it is apparent that the fluid solver needs to be supplied with displacements while the input to the structural solver consists of the occurring tractions while the displacements need to be prescribed at the nodes of the fluid mesh the tractions are required at the quadrature points of the structural mesh naturally these point sets do not coincide requiring the use of dedicated techniques to obtain the information at the required positions the displacements at the required points are obtained by projecting the fluid vertices onto the structural mesh and using the shape functions of the fem to acquire the displacement at the respective positions having obtained the required displacement field it is applied to the vertices of the fluid mesh on a pointwise basis the current position of a fluid mesh point is thus prescribed as the addition of the point s original position and it s current displacement the operator s describes the computation of the displacement field as well as its evaluation at the projected points the loads are described by the vector t k which collects the tractions at the quadrature points of the structural mesh in this work vectors marked with an overbar indicate that the therein collected quantities are prescribed within the subproblem the corresponding operator refers to an operator formulation for the fluid subproblem is introduced and reads 36 t k f d k considering the structural subproblem described by equation 35 the displacement field can directly be evaluated at the required points for the fluid problem which is managed by a bem this is not the case and an interpolation of the tractions from the collocation points of the fluid mesh to the quadrature points of the finite elements must be performed the interpolation method utilized here is a mesh based inverse distance weighting könig et al 2016 denoting the interpolation by the operator i yields 37 t k i t k consequently it may be worthwhile to note that for the displacements d k d k holds while for the tractions t k t k the coupling algorithm used here can now be described by the introduced operators such that in terms of a fixed point interpolation 38 d k i 1 a k i s k i f k d k i holds fig 3 illustrates the coupling algorithm the operator a k i refers to a convergence acceleration method which in this case is the quasi newton least squares method for a thorough description of the method the reader is referred to degroote et al 2009 or radtke et al 2016 in the context of the coupling algorithm the convergence acceleration infers a manipulation of the deformation field obtained by the structural solver before it is transferred to the fluid solver it is possible to further simplify the notation by combining the existing operators into p k yielding 39 d k i 1 a k i p k d k i a k i d k i 1 here d k i 1 denotes the unmodified solution obtained from the solver on the basis of this a residual can be formulated concerning the occurring displacements vectors such that 40 r k i d k i 1 d k i by defining a threshold the residual is used to assess the convergence in each iteration of the calculated time steps 3 4 ffowcs williams hawkings equation the discretization used to evaluate the acoustic part of the simulations coincides with that of the fluid mesh the contributions of body displacement and loading as well as the resulting overall pressure at the observer point can therefore be obtained by 41 4 π p t x o t n b i 1 γ i f b ρ v a n a v

multi field problems in general it would be best to investigate the behaviour of each field s solver on its own before assessing the performance of the coupled technique as this would be out of the scope of this paper the reader is referred to several previously published papers in order to establish confidence in the modelling of the structural fluid and acoustic domain as well as the coupling process panmare has been used in the context of a wide range of application cases covering configurations involving propellers as well as propeller acoustics but also wind turbines and others the capabilities of the code with regard to simulations involving propellers in unsteady inflow conditions has been demonstrated in scharf et al 2015 by means of a comparison of pressure fluctuations obtained from panmare and a rans calculation in göttsche et al 2017 the acoustic signature of a pulsating sphere is evaluated and compared to a reference solution based on the bernoulli equation furthermore results of panmare s acoustic evaluation tool where compared against measurements in göttsche et al 2019 and kleinsorge et al 2017 in gaschler 2017 the setup which is investigated here is simulated for a rigid propeller and thus findings regarding the discretization of the fluid domain could be transferred comana which handles the coupling process has likewise been used in various application cases such as the simulation of flexible wind turbines wiegard et al 2019 or the berthing maneuver of offshore service ships ferreira gonzález et al 2015 an investigation of the coupling process as well as the convergence behaviour of propeller related structural meshes used in adhoc has been performed in radtke et al 2018 comana s basic methodology with regard to information transfer and details of its implementation can be accessed in könig et al 2016 5 setup in this work the sva p1356 propeller richter and heinke 2006 of the kcs container ship is investigated the fluid as well as structural mesh used in the following simulations is shown in fig 4 in all simulations the time step for both structural and fluid domain is chosen such that the propeller rotates by 1 in each step table 1 gives an overview of all investigated configurations common parameters naturally material properties are only applied in simulations when elasticity is taken into account for simulations involving inhomogeneous inflow conditions the hull wake field illustrated in fig 5 is prescribed the hull wake field is considered as stationary with respect to time for the acoustic evaluation of all configurations only one of the propeller blades is considered this choice was made in order to facilitate the assessment of the influence of elasticity on the acoustic characteristics which is hard to distinguish for cases in which the interaction of inhomogeneous inflow conditions cavitation effects the effect of the propeller blades on each other and the blade flexibility are taken into account simultaneously the observation point underlying all acoustic evaluations is located at a distance of 30 m in direction of the y axis see fig 4 to the propeller center as the evaluation point is still well within the near field a solution can for non cavitating cases also be obtained by a purely potential theory based approach utilizing the unsteady bernoulli equation throughout the simulations the relative position of propeller and observation point remains fixed 6 results and discussion in the following configurations of varying complexity are simulated in order to demonstrate the capabilities and physical consistency of the presented approach 6 1 homogeneous inflow full propeller for an initial assessment of the presented method the full propeller is simulated in homogeneous inflow conditions after a correct modelling of the hydrodynamic domain has been ensured blade elasticity and its effect on the acoustic signature of the propeller is considered fig 6 presents the thrust and torque coefficient at multiple advance coefficients calculated by panmare for a rigid propeller and compares them to results obtained in experiments by richter and heinke 2006 both thrust and torque coefficient show a slight deviation from the experiments at the entire range of advance coefficients for the torque coefficient an increasing deviation from the experimental results is observed for decreasing advance coefficients since the propeller thrust is expected to have a dominating influence on the occurring deformations the integrity of the results should not be affected though the propeller is then simulated at an advance coefficient of j 0 75 under consideration of varying magnitudes of elasticity table 2 presents the utilized material properties as well as the resulting coefficients for thrust torque and efficiency in this case the blade deformation causes a reduction of both blade thrust and torque the effect becomes increasingly pronounced for high blade flexibility while the efficiency remains relatively unaffected for moderate elasticity parameters the method predicts a slight increase in efficiency for the case with a young s modulus of e 2 10 9 pa since stiffness values of this amount would cause unacceptable vibrations of the blades a transfer of these findings to actually operating propellers is infeasible the reduction of thrust and torque is also reflected in the occurring deformation field fig 7 presents the deformations of the propeller blades median plane at different relative radii the blades experience different amounts of deformation at leading and trailing edge thus changing the pitch angle which is considered as the dominating influence responsible for the altered performance characteristics of the propeller the change in pitch angle estimated employing the deformation values at leading and trailing edge and the assumption of a constant chord length is also given in fig 7 via the annotations associated with each section plot all sections experience a reduction in pitch angle which in turn causes the reduction of propeller thrust and torque the progression of pressures calculated based on the fwhe at the observation point is given in fig 8 although the hydrodynamic results were obtained for the whole propeller only one blade is taken into account in the acoustic evaluation for the reasons given in section 5 for better comparability both graphs are shifted to their mean values although thrust and torque coefficient were severely reduced for the flexible propeller the progression of the fwh pressures is almost unaffected as homogeneous inflow conditions are prescribed no perturbation of the pressure plots due to structural vibrations is present consequently the resulting acoustic spectrum at the observation point which is presented in fig 9 for the rigid case is almost identical 6 2 homogeneous inflow sinusoidal load full propeller the investigations conducted in section 6 1 yielded a static deformation field for each propeller blade since homogeneous inflow conditions were prescribed and no gravitation is considered in the simulations in order to verify the capabilities of the method with respect to capturing the influence of structural vibrations on the resulting acoustic signature another simulation setup is evaluated the full propeller is simulated in homogeneous inflow conditions and a sinusoidally varying traction is added to the loads occurring due to the actual operation of the propeller in this case the added traction field is spatially constant and only acts in direction of the x axis see fig 4 while the excitation frequency is chosen as f e x 36 h z the maximum magnitude of the added tractions is t a d d 25 10 3 n m 2 coherent with the investigations in the previous section the setup is evaluated using varying stiffness parameters as a sinusoidally varying load was prescribed the mean thrust and torque coefficients closely match the final values computed in the previous section see table 2 in the following the fwh pressure time series at the observation point is analysed by means of a fast fourier transform fft and the resulting acoustic spectrum is given in fig 9 the annotations in the plot denote the rotation rate and the excitation frequency the most dominating frequency is found to be the propeller rotation rate with the associated peak in the spectrum developing over multiple adjacent frequencies the reason for the increased energy content in the adjacent frequencies lies in the choice of setup which only considers one of the propeller blades leading to a pressure time series at the observation point which is not entirely based on a single frequency another distinct peak in the spectrum is observed at the excitation frequency the results indicate that the method presented here is capable of capturing the influence of structural vibrations on the acoustic spectrum 6 3 inhomogeneous inflow single blade having established a physically consistent behaviour of the simulation approach with respect to configurations involving homogeneous inflow conditions a setup in which a wake field is prescribed is simulated cavitation is not considered yet here only a single blade is considered for both the hydrodynamic and acoustic investigations the undisturbed inflow velocity is v s 7 4 m s 1 while the actual inflow field is specified according to the velocity distribution illustrated in fig 5 table 3 presents the mean thrust torque and efficiency coefficients for the rigid case as well as three cases with varying elasticity contrary to what has been observed for homogeneous inflow conditions the mean thrust and torque coefficient increase with increasing blade flexibility the mean efficiency remains almost unaffected though fig 10 shows the progression of the thrust coefficient over one rotation period for the rigid blade as well as the case with e 2 10 10 pa while the behaviour of the thrust coefficient is almost identical for large parts of the blade s movement through the wake field the thrust coefficient is increased in the vicinity of the 12 o clock position an indication for the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increase in thrust can again be found in the deformation field of the blade which along with the change in pitch angle associated with each section is given in fig 11 due to the inhomogeneous inflow the blade experiences a deformation field fundamentally different to that found in open water conditions while for sections close to the hub a decrease in pitch angle is still present the sections towards the tip are subjected to an increase in pitch angle since the upper part of the blade delivers a higher contribution of the blade thrust the increased load in this region prevails concerning the effect on the overall loads for comparison fig 12 shows the deformation field in open water conditions assuming thrust identity regarding the average thrust in the behind hull configuration the position of the blade relative to the hull wake as well as the resulting pressure field in comparison to that in open water conditions is shown in fig 13 in the vicinity of the evaluated blade position the spatial gradients of inflow velocity are at their maximum thus creating highly different inflow conditions on the respective parts of the blade surface the described conditions in turn lead to the difference between pressure and deformation fields in open water and behind hull conditions in the following an acoustic evaluation of the cases is performed and the resulting acoustic spectrum is given in fig 14 as expected the dominating frequency for the rigid and flexible case is found to be the rotation rate of the propeller blade in accordance with the small changes in thrust coefficient the flexible blade s rotation rate tonal remains almost unchanged due to the consideration of the structural deformations the amplitudes in the frequency range above the rotation rate change and new peaks are introduced to the spectrum at present it could not be verified if these can be associated with the blade s structural modes or if another mechanism is responsible for this behaviour 6 4 inhomogeneous inflow single blade cavitation cavitation is considered as one of the governing influences on the acoustic signature of propellers the setup described in section 6 3 is therefore augmented in order to incorporate cavitation effects the cavitation number based on the blade s rotational speed is chosen as σ n 3 0 such that a coherent cavity is present on the blade when it passes the 12 o clock position of the inflow field and the blade loads are at their maximum an impression of the cavity developing on the blade is given in fig 15 table 4 summarizes the results of the cases investigated in this section due to the consideration of cavitation on the propeller blade both mean thrust and torque coefficient are slightly reduced for the cases involving flexible blades a similar behaviour to what has been observed in section 6 3 is present as the mean blade loads increase with decreasing blade stiffness the acoustic spectrum for the cavitating rigid and flexible blade is presented in fig 16 in the frequency range above the tonal associated with the rotation rate frequency energy density is increased and the sound pressure levels are raised in comparison to the non cavitating case the distinct peaks in the frequency range in between 15 and 35 hz which were present in the frequency spectrum of the non cavitating blade see fig 14 are not observable any more it is assumed that due to the increased energy density in this frequency range the respective tonals are not as easily distinguishable as before 7 conclusion an approach for the assessment of the far field acoustic signature of marine propellers under consideration of inhomogeneous inflow cavitation and blade elasticity was presented a partitioned algorithm is utilized enabling the usage of well developed solvers and discretization techniques for each domain the respective solvers are chosen pursuing a balance between accuracy and computational effort suitable of the design stage the fluid domain is handled by a bem while for the structural domain a fem is utilized in the context of the bem cavitation is considered using an additional cavitation model the interaction between fluid and structural domain is managed using a separate framework which utilizes the quasi newton least squares method in order to accelerate and stabilize the solution process an acoustic evaluation of the problems is performed with the fwhe in formulation 1a in the paper a coherent mathematical description of each involved domain as well as the coupling process is given the governing equations in their continuous formulation as well as the discretization techniques for each domain are described as no validation data regarding the full complexity of the problem is available a series of configurations intended to verify a physically consistent behaviour of the coupled simulations is simulated for homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous inflow conditions the correlation between loads experienced by the propeller blade and the corresponding deformation field shows a plausible and sound behaviour in general these findings also apply to the acoustic evaluation if the blade is subjected to an excitation by an additional sinusoidally varying load the excitation frequency is clearly visible in the acoustic spectrum for the non cavitating blade in inhomogeneous inflow peaks which might be attributed to the blade s structural modes are present in the acoustic signature as the same configuration with consideration of sheet cavitation does not exhibit these tonals it is assumed that due to the dynamic behaviour of the sheet cavitation energy is introduced to the spectrum at a frequency range which coincides with the previously observed peaks thus obstructing their extraction by means of fft analysis the method presented here shows a stable and consistent behaviour future research priorities should be directed at the integration of the method in an optimization process regarding the acoustic properties of marine propellers naturally a validation of the complete method as well as its components should also be

biofilm conformation of bacillus sp on stainless steel by a flow cell system static laminar and turbulent conditions were selected for this study the applicability of this flow cell was evaluated by computational fluid dynamics cfd stable wall shear stresses were successfully obtained the results showed that the spatial distribution of bacteria changed from single cell to cluster under the effect of shear force and the higher shear force created smoother and denser clusters the different morphology of clusters under different flow conditions was mainly due to the increased nutrient supply to the clusters with the increase of flow velocity under the effect of shear force bacillus sp could change the shape and increase the production of extracellular polymeric substance which could reduce the effect of shear force and enhance the connection and adhesion respectively under low shear force biofilm preferred to form irregular and complicated structure which could lead to the formation of tower like biofilm and inhibit the external mass transfer the results could shed some light on biofilm control strategies keywords biofilm bacillus sp hydrodynamic shear force morphology conformation 1 introduction marine biofouling on underwater infrastructure is a highly complex process and involved a wide range of up to thousands different species and organisms which has caused a series of harmful consequences arutchelvi et al 2011 buskens et al 2013 qian et al 2015 yebra et al 2004 for a long period people have tried to understand the process of biofouling for the possible prevention chen et al 2010 fitridge et al 2012 indrani et al 2011 the formation of biofilm is the initial stage of the biofouling which is formed by adhesion of marine bacterium diatoms and their extracellular polymeric substance eps stoodley et al 2002 biofilm can protect their cells from damage caused by biocides the sensitivity of cells in biofilm to biocides decreased by 100 1000 times nikolaev and plakunov 2007 in this regard in order to inhibit the development of biofilm the inhibition of the adhesion is privileged however the control and eradication of the biofilm formation remain a significant issue for various factors such as twitching motility growth rate cell signaling stoodley et al 2002 meanwhile the physical factors in growth environment also play important roles such as temperature salinity and hydrodynamic shear force an and friedman 1998 katsikogianni and missirlis 2004 liu and tay 2002 hydrodynamic shear force plays a major role among these factors influenced the formation of biofilm which has been sufficiently demonstrated saur et al 2017 thomas et al 2002 many researches have focused on the influence of hydrodynamic shear force on the biofilm brugnoni et al 2011 investigated the effect of shear force on the biofilm formation by studying the amount of adhered cells on the surface and the difference of biofilm under different flow conditions using a rotating disk system the authors discovered that shear force had no effect on the biofilm at the early stage of biofilm formation but the disposition of the cells in mature biofilm onto the surface was determined by shear force however the flow regime of parallel flow cell system can be manipulated better than that of rotating disk system and another advantage of parallel flow cell recirculating system is that it can achieve much higher flow rate in the flow cell without using impractical media volume stoodley and warwood 2003 lecuyer et al 2011 studied the effect of flow on the adhesion mechanism of individual cells using micro flow channel they found that the individual cells dynamically responded to the shear rate variations modifying their adhesion state menniti et al 2009 explored the effect of shear force on the production of eps and they found that under high shear stress the production of floc associated eps was lower than that under lower shear stress and the decrease in floc associated eps production also corresponded to the decrease in the production of soluble eps the increase of bacterial attachment was caused by shear force until that the shear force exceeded a critical value park et al 2011 however the higher shear force usually resulted in thinner denser and stronger biofilms araújo et al 2016 laspidou and rittmann 2004 this meant the increased shear force could lead to the increased adhesive strength of biofilm which was more resistant to the mechanical treatments and the combined chemical and mechanical treatments in addition all the biofilms had a basal layer strongly resistant to removal by chemical and mechanical actions chen et al 2005 lemos et al 2015 the biofilm generated by higher shear was also metabolically more active and had higher cellular density and protein content simões et al 2007 these studies were mainly about the amount of adhered microorganisms eps production or adhesive strength of biofilm however few studies have focused on the effect of hydrodynamic shear force on the morphology and the conformation of biofilm finite element model had been presented to simulate the interaction between fluid flow and biofilm structure bol et al 2009 and it demonstrated that the change of biofilm structure was contributed to the detachment behavior the substrate concentration the mass transfer the metabolic behavior are also affected by the morphology and the conformation of biofilm picioreanu et al 1998 stewart 2012 and consequently affect the growth maturation and detachment of biofilm thus the researches in the morphology and conformation of biofilm is important the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic shear force on the morphology and conformation of biofilm a parallel flow cell was designed for this study static laminar and turbulent flow conditions were selected for this study and laminar and turbulent flow conditions were simulated by cfd to determine the stable flow region the software imagej and the program comstat were used to analysis the images captured by scanning electron microscope and confocal laser scanning microscopy respectively the results gained from this study could shed some light on the biofilm control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 flow cell design this flow cell system included a recirculating tank

density re reynolds number 2 2 numerical simulation of velocity profiles cfd was performed using fluent 15 0 to simulate the hydrodynamic flow conditions the mesh generated by gambit mesh generator was tetrahedral cells with a total number of 2 236 008 which was used in the calculations the boundary conditions were with a fluid velocity of 0 m s at the wall in all directions and atmospheric pressure at the outlet for the simulation the inlet velocities were set as the bulk velocities of inlet for each simulation the density and viscosity of culture medium at 30 c were 1023 kg m3 and 8 6 10 4 pa s respectively abdoli et al 2018 the sst k ω model was selected for turbulent flow menter 1994 and navier stokes equations was applied for the laminar flow these simulation results were used to determine where the stable flow was established 2 3 microorganism and culture conditions the marine bacterium bacillus sp mccc 1a00791 marine culture collection of china was used in this study bacillus sp was a rod shaped gram positive bacterium which was a typical marine bacterium forming biofilm with its abundant secreted eps to cause biofouling he et al 2016 the medium for culturing bacillus sp was prepared by dissolving 1 g yeast extract and 5 g peptone in 1000 ml artificial seawater asw which was prepared according to astm d1141 98 the suspension containing bacillus sp was shaken at 30 c until the od value at 600 nm reached 1 0 where the bacterial density was equivalent to 109 cells ml and then the bacillus sp suspension with a concentration of 106 cells ml was prepared in culture medium polished 316l stainless steel plates with a dimension of 10 10 0 2 mm were used as substrates before the test 316l stainless steel plates were cleaned by ultrasonic with ethanol and deionized water in turn and subsequent dried in vacuum drying oven at 35 c for 24 h the flow rates of 0 1 5 4 5 7 5 and 10 l min were selected for this study six repeated specimens for each testing group were prepared by bacillus sp suspension for 72 h lee et al 2013 at 30 c the flow cell system was kept in incubator at 30 c after the culture the non adherent bacteria were removed by washing with sterile asw for three times and then fixed by 2 5 glutaraldehyde ar aladdin chemistry co ltd china in asw at 4 c for 4 h 2 4 clsm studies and image analysis three specimens which were fixed by glutaraldehyde were washed by sterile asw to get rid of the glutaraldehyde subsequent stained by using 50 μg ml of propidium iodide pi 95 alfa aesar co ltd china for 30 min and then washed by sterile asw to remove extra pi three duplicated specimens were prepared and all image stacks were acquired from random positions by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp8 germany then the image stacks were analyzed by the program comstat to reconstruct spatial structures of biofilm and get the biofilm parameters such as adhesion ratio total biomass surface to biovolume ratio average thickness average diffusion distance and average cluster size at the substratum heydorn et al 2000a 2000b all of the data were expressed as mean standard deviation sd 2 5 sem studies and analysis morphological features of the adhered bacteria were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem vega3 tescan czech for sem observation dehydration of the samples was conducted by using 25 50 75 90 and 100 ethanol solution sequentially the specimens were dried in vacuum drying oven at 35 c for 24 h three duplicated specimens were prepared subsequently the specimens were coated with platinum and observed using sem and to acquire images from random positions there were 300 bacteria that were selected randomly to be measured the length and width by the software imagej the data were expressed as mean sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation of the flow flow rate used in this study was 1 5 4 5 7 5 and 10 l min corresponding to the approximate bulk velocity in the flow cell 0 10 0 31 0 52 and 0 69 m s and the inlet velocity 0 32 0 95 1 59 2 12 m s respectively the reynolds number is an important dimensionless quantity as it describes when flow changes from laminar to turbulent the flow regime is defined as laminar flow when the reynolds number is less than 2000 busscher and hc 2006 calculated by equation 1 the corresponding reynolds number was 572 1716 2861 and 3815 respectively under the flow rate of 1 5 and 4 5 l min the flow states are laminar flow and turbulent regime was considered for the flow rate of 7 5 and 10 l min the corresponding theoretical wall shear stress of the flow cell calculated using equations 3 and 4 was 0 23 0 68 1 39 2 30 pa respectively table 1 fluent 15 0 was used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow cell under four conditions the axial flow velocities x direction at the four flow rates in the midplane of the flow cell 0 5h0 and 0 5w0 as determined from numerical simulation is shown in fig 1 a for all flow conditions the flow velocity variations are highest in the inlet zone for the laminar flow regimes the laminar jet extends about half length of the flow cell which is consistent with the previous experimental observations todde et al 2009 the formation of transient vortices along the flow cell is clear however the flow stabilizes from 0 6l0 0 8l0 much shorter jet occurs under turbulent flow than that under laminar flow the flow conditions between 0 6l0 and 0 8l0 are also stable fig 1b 0 7l0 and 0 5h0 shows the flow velocity at half height in x direction is almost constant for a major part of the width except the slight fluctuations the velocity rapid decreases in the areas close to the side wall due to the boundary layer these indicate that the stable flow has been established among 0 6l0 0 8l0 0 2w0 0 8w0 as the rectangular area shown in fig 1a fig 2 represents the flow velocity profiles of fully development flow as a function of the dimensionless height at the center 0 7l0 and 0 5w0 at a volumetric flow rate 1 5 l min and 10 l min fig 2a confirms that a parabolic flow develops over the height of the flow cell the velocity profile in fig 2b is flat in the center and drops off sharply near the wall these velocity profiles have the typical characteristics of laminar flow and turbulent flow respectively white 2009 as a summary for the simulations this flow cell could generate stable flow within 0 6l0 0 8l0 0 2w0 0 8w0 and the stable wall shear stresses 0 23 0 68 1 39 2 30 pa were obtained within this area under scheduled flow conditions fig 3 3 2 effect of shear force on morphological features the characteristics of bacillus sp biofilm under different conditions were investigated the flow cell was operated at four different velocities 0 10 0 31 0 52 and 0 69 m s and the static condition was set as control the effect of shear force on the morphology of bacillus sp was assessed by sem fig 4 it was realized that the wall shear stress affected the adhesive behavior of bacillus sp remarkably after 72 h culture under different conditions the stainless steel plates already exhibited adhesion of bacillus sp on their surfaces clearly fig 4a b c d e the bacillus sp distribution pattern on the substratum surface was significantly different between static condition and dynamic conditions single bacteria were scattered on the surface at static condition and several bacteria in rows which was a typical feature of bacillus sp figs 4a 1 however under the effect of shear stress the images showed that the bacteria gathered to form clusters and also remained isolated attached bacteria figs 4b 1 c 1 d 1 e 1 moreover the formation of biofilm was seen from enlarged sem images clearly figs 4a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 e 2 under dynamic conditions the images showed the presence of eps which connected the cells to each other and to the surface these structures became more frequent and the production of eps increased with the shear force increased the formation of biofilm is a process of cell immobilization under static condition the gravity force and cell mobility are the dominant factors of the contact among bacteria or attachment of bacterium onto solid surface liu and tay 2002 pratt and kolter 1998 the adhesion of bacillus sp on the surface appeared discrete distribution under the action of gravity and several bacillus sp stood in row because of the cell motility under dynamic conditions the shear force played a major role to facilitate formation of clusters and the production of eps thibaut saur et al 2017 found that under the effect of shear force the formation of clusters was only related to aggregation of cells instead the growth of microorganisms therefore these aggregates were considered as clusters instead of micro colonies the features of clusters grown under laminar flow fig 4b and c were also different from that grown under turbulent flow fig 4d and e it seemed that the turbulent flow easily created more smooth and rigid clusters than laminar flow picioreanu et al 2000 found that with the nutrient availability increased the biofilm structure could gradual shift toward denser and smoother thus it could be concluded that the difference of formed clusters under different flow conditions was mainly due to the external mass transfer gradually increased with the increase of flow velocity which led to the increase of nutrient supply to the clusters in addition the increased detachment rate with the increase of shear force also contributed to this appearance with the increase of shear force the changes of bacillus sp shape were observed from the enlarged views statistical analysis of the bacillus sp shape was conducted by imagej for each sample fig 4f and g the length of bacillus sp was 3 35 0 93 3 09 0 71 2 75 0 81 2 48 0 51 and 1 92 0 46 μm under different flow conditions respectively fig 4f with the increase of shear force the length of bacteria decreased gradually on the contrary the width of bacteria increased gradually with the increase of wall shear stress fig 4g which is 0 50 0 06 0 68 0 07 0 69 0 08 0 95 0 09 and 0 95 0 10 μm under different flow conditions respectively under the flow condition of maximum wall shear stress 0 69 m s the length of bacteria was almost half of that under static condition and the width increased by 90 approximately these indicated that the bacillus sp could adapt to the shear force environment by shape changing the average adhesion areas of bacteria were estimated by multiply the length by the width which were 1 66 0 06 μm2 2 08 0 05 μm2 1 89 0 07 μm2 2 35 0 05 μm2 1 82 0 05 μm2 under different flow conditions respectively the average adhesion area under static condition was a little smaller than that under the dynamic conditions however there were no significant distinctions of average adhesion area among the five conditions thus we could conclude that under the effect of shear stress the bacillus sp could enhance the adhesion by the changed shape and the increased secretion of eps rather than increased adhesion area the deformation of bacteria could reduce the effect of shear force to benefit the adhesion of bacteria the increased secretion of eps could enhance the cell to cell connection and the adhesion to the substratum morphological analysis showed that with the increase of wall shear stress the spatial distribution of bacteria changed significantly from single cell pattern to cluster pattern the adaptation of bacillus sp to shear force environment was mainly by the deformation and the increased secretion of eps 3 3 effect of shear force on biofilm conformation the effect of shear force on the characteristics of bacillus sp biofilm was evaluated by clsm fig 5 it clearly showed that the shear force had significant effect on the architecture and topography of the bacillus sp biofilm after culture for 72 h to clarify the regulating regimes of shear force on the biofilm several key biofilm parameters were analyzed by the program comstat from the clsm image stacks adhesion ratio is defined as the ratio of bacteria adhesion area to the total substratum surface area after 72 h incubation in the bacillus sp suspension under different conditions the adhesion ratio was 5 09 1 41 16 01 6 67 11 73 3 57 5 81 1 17 and 3 22 1 34 respectively fig 6 f the results showed that adhesion ratio of the biofilm increased significantly under the low shear stress compared to the biofilm formed under static condition and decreased gradually with the increase of shear force the adhesion ratio is determined by the transport of microorganisms to the substratum surface through mass transfer such as convection diffusion or sedimentation korber et al 1990 compared with the static condition the adhesion ratio increased sharply at the flow velocity of 0 10 m s mainly because the convective mass transfer started to play a major role under dynamic condition busscher and hc 2006 which led to a great increase of substrate flux while the adhesion ratio decreased gradually with the increase of wall shear stress when the flow velocity had exceeded a critical limit these was in coincidence with that the high shear force to prevent adhesion morisaki 1991 and stimulate detachment the maximum adhesion ratio was at the flow velocity of 0 10 m s fig 6f while the total biomass of the biofilm was maximum at the flow velocity of 0 31 m s among the five hydrodynamic conditions fig 6g the increased secretion of eps at 0 31 m s resulted in maximum biomass even with the decreased adhesion ratio the total biomass gradually reduced at the flow velocity of 0 52 and 0 69 m s was mainly due to the adhesion ratio decreased under the effect of higher wall shear stress similar trends also occurred in the average thickness and the average cluster size of biofilm fig 6h and i which was in agreement with the sem observation fig 4 in addition the average diffusion distance increased under low wall shear stress and decreased under high wall shear stress fig 6j which reflected the length substrate needed to travel to get to the middle of the cluster yang et al 2000 sd is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of dispersion of a set of data values under the flow velocity of 0 31 m s the average thickness the average cluster size and the average diffusion distance of biofilm were maximum among five hydrodynamic conditions meanwhile the sd of average thickness the average cluster size and the average diffusion distance were also maximum under this flow condition these indicated that the biofilm heterogeneity was maximum and the biofilm was most irregular and complicated under this flow condition the irregular and complicated structure of biofilm under low flow velocity could lead to the formation of tower like biofilm due to the mass transfer limitation and the formation of tower like biofilm could aggravate the uneven distribution of substrate concentration as the biofilm thickness grew the tops of biofilm clusters could access more substrate they grew faster than other parts of the cluster thereby height differences was amplified to eventually produce tall clusters separated by channels stewart 2012 whereas the clusters in the valleys grew in a substrate depleted environment the voids between the clusters could not be filled with new biomass any longer picioreanu et al 1998 thus it can be speculated that under low shear force with the growth of biofilm the detachment of biofilm will occur much more frequent than that under high shear force and the biofilm will repeat this growth process on the compact basal biofilm layer whereas the biofilm grows under high shear force will grow and expand the coverage area slowly forming a denser smoother biofilm with stronger adhesive strength the surface to biovolume ratio is the surface area divided by the biovolume which reflects what fraction of the biofilm is in fact exposed to the nutrient flow heydorn et al 2000b the trend of surface to biovolume ratio was contrary to that of the other parameters fig 6k the decreased surface to biovolume ratio under low wall shear stress further indicated that the low flow velocity promoted the development of biofilm and the increased surface to biovolume ratio under high wall shear stress further indicated that the high flow velocity inhibited the development of biofilm he et al 2018 it is therefore clear that the hydrodynamic shear force plays an important role on the conformation of bacillus sp biofilm in terms of adhesion kinetics and pattern and microbial cluster these effects seem to be dominated by changing the way of mass transfer and stimulating the biofilm to regulate the metabolic pathways liu and tay 2001 the results indicated that the shear force could be used as a control lever to encourage or inhibit the biofilm formation moreover these results can also give insight into the selection of antifouling coating for underwater infrastructure in fluid environment under the environment of high flow velocity fouling release coating should be a better choice because of the increased production of eps and the formation of denser and stronger biofilm which can inhibit the release of biocide and provide protection for the cells from the released biocide to weaken the antifouling performance of biocidal antifouling coating moreover the high shear force can promote the detachment of biofilm from fouling release coating surface under the static or low flow velocity environment the biocidal antifouling coating should be better the reasons are that the extensive and loose biofilm can only provide limited protection for the cells and the low shear force can t give full play to the effect of fouling release coating whether these differences are linear or stable remains to be further studied in the process of biofilm maturation 4 conclusions a parallel flow cell system was designed in this study the flow cell could generate stable flow within 0 6l0 0 8l0 0 2w0 0 8w0 under scheduled flow conditions to obtain the stable wall shear stresses and investigate the effect of hydrodynamic shear force on the morphology and conformation of biofilm compared with the static condition the spatial distribution of bacteria changed from single cell pattern to cluster pattern meanwhile the higher wall shear stress created more smooth and rigid clusters the different morphology of formed clusters under different flow conditions was mainly due to the increase of nutrient supply to the clusters with the increase of flow velocity under the effect of shear stress the bacillus sp could change the shape and increase the production of eps to ensure the adhesion to the substratum under low shear force the biofilm preferred to form irregular and complicated structure which could lead to the formation of tower like biofilm and inhibit the external mass transfer authors contributions jiangfan chang

biofilms had a basal layer strongly resistant to removal by chemical and mechanical actions chen et al 2005 lemos et al 2015 the biofilm generated by higher shear was also metabolically more active and had higher cellular density and protein content simões et al 2007 these studies were mainly about the amount of adhered microorganisms eps production or adhesive strength of biofilm however few studies have focused on the effect of hydrodynamic shear force on the morphology and the conformation of biofilm finite element model had been presented to simulate the interaction between fluid flow and biofilm structure bol et al 2009 and it demonstrated that the change of biofilm structure was contributed to the detachment behavior the substrate concentration the mass transfer the metabolic behavior are also affected by the morphology and the conformation of biofilm picioreanu et al 1998 stewart 2012 and consequently affect the growth maturation and detachment of biofilm thus the researches in the morphology and conformation of biofilm is important the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic shear force on the morphology and conformation of biofilm a parallel flow cell was designed for this study static laminar and turbulent flow conditions were selected for this study and laminar and turbulent flow conditions were simulated by cfd to determine the stable flow region the software imagej and the program comstat were used to analysis the images captured by scanning electron microscope and confocal laser scanning microscopy respectively the results gained from this study could shed some light on the biofilm control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 flow cell design this flow cell system included a recirculating tank

density re reynolds number 2 2 numerical simulation of velocity profiles cfd was performed using fluent 15 0 to simulate the hydrodynamic flow conditions the mesh generated by gambit mesh generator was tetrahedral cells with a total number of 2 236 008 which was used in the calculations the boundary conditions were with a fluid velocity of 0 m s at the wall in all directions and atmospheric pressure at the outlet for the simulation the inlet velocities were set as the bulk velocities of inlet for each simulation the density and viscosity of culture medium at 30 c were 1023 kg m3 and 8 6 10 4 pa s respectively abdoli et al 2018 the sst k ω model was selected for turbulent flow menter 1994 and navier stokes equations was applied for the laminar flow these simulation results were used to determine where the stable flow was established 2 3 microorganism and culture conditions the marine bacterium bacillus sp mccc 1a00791 marine culture collection of china was used in this study bacillus sp was a rod shaped gram positive bacterium which was a typical marine bacterium forming biofilm with its abundant secreted eps to cause biofouling he et al 2016 the medium for culturing bacillus sp was prepared by dissolving 1 g yeast extract and 5 g peptone in 1000 ml artificial seawater asw which was prepared according to astm d1141 98 the suspension containing bacillus sp was shaken at 30 c until the od value at 600 nm reached 1 0 where the bacterial density was equivalent to 109 cells ml and then the bacillus sp suspension with a concentration of 106 cells ml was prepared in culture medium polished 316l stainless steel plates with a dimension of 10 10 0 2 mm were used as substrates before the test 316l stainless steel plates were cleaned by ultrasonic with ethanol and deionized water in turn and subsequent dried in vacuum drying oven at 35 c for 24 h the flow rates of 0 1 5 4 5 7 5 and 10 l min were selected for this study six repeated specimens for each testing group were prepared by bacillus sp suspension for 72 h lee et al 2013 at 30 c the flow cell system was kept in incubator at 30 c after the culture the non adherent bacteria were removed by washing with sterile asw for three times and then fixed by 2 5 glutaraldehyde ar aladdin chemistry co ltd china in asw at 4 c for 4 h 2 4 clsm studies and image analysis three specimens which were fixed by glutaraldehyde were washed by sterile asw to get rid of the glutaraldehyde subsequent stained by using 50 μg ml of propidium iodide pi 95 alfa aesar co ltd china for 30 min and then washed by sterile asw to remove extra pi three duplicated specimens were prepared and all image stacks were acquired from random positions by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp8 germany then the image stacks were analyzed by the program comstat to reconstruct spatial structures of biofilm and get the biofilm parameters such as adhesion ratio total biomass surface to biovolume ratio average thickness average diffusion distance and average cluster size at the substratum heydorn et al 2000a 2000b all of the data were expressed as mean standard deviation sd 2 5 sem studies and analysis morphological features of the adhered bacteria were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem vega3 tescan czech for sem observation dehydration of the samples was conducted by using 25 50 75 90 and 100 ethanol solution sequentially the specimens were dried in vacuum drying oven at 35 c for 24 h three duplicated specimens were prepared subsequently the specimens were coated with platinum and observed using sem and to acquire images from random positions there were 300 bacteria that were selected randomly to be measured the length and width by the software imagej the data were expressed as mean sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation of the flow flow rate used in this study was 1 5 4 5 7 5 and 10 l min corresponding to the approximate bulk velocity in the flow cell 0 10 0 31 0 52 and 0 69 m s and the inlet velocity 0 32 0 95 1 59 2 12 m s respectively the reynolds number is an important dimensionless quantity as it describes when flow changes from laminar to turbulent the flow regime is defined as laminar flow when the reynolds number is less than 2000 busscher and hc 2006 calculated by equation 1 the corresponding reynolds number was 572 1716 2861 and 3815 respectively under the flow rate of 1 5 and 4 5 l min the flow states are laminar flow and turbulent regime was considered for the flow rate of 7 5 and 10 l min the corresponding theoretical wall shear stress of the flow cell calculated using equations 3 and 4 was 0 23 0 68 1 39 2 30 pa respectively table 1 fluent 15 0 was used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow cell under four conditions the axial flow velocities x direction at the four flow rates in the midplane of the flow cell 0 5h0 and 0 5w0 as determined from numerical simulation is shown in fig 1 a for all flow conditions the flow velocity variations are highest in the inlet zone for the laminar flow regimes the laminar jet extends about half length of the flow cell which is consistent with the previous experimental observations todde et al 2009 the formation of transient vortices along the flow cell is clear however the flow stabilizes from 0 6l0 0 8l0 much shorter jet occurs under turbulent flow than that under laminar flow the flow conditions between 0 6l0 and 0 8l0 are also stable fig 1b 0 7l0 and 0 5h0 shows the flow velocity at half height in x direction is almost constant for a major part of the width except the slight fluctuations the velocity rapid decreases in the areas close to the side wall due to the boundary layer these indicate that the stable flow has been established among 0 6l0 0 8l0 0 2w0 0 8w0 as the rectangular area shown in fig 1a fig 2 represents the flow velocity profiles of fully development flow as a function of the dimensionless height at the center 0 7l0 and 0 5w0 at a volumetric flow rate 1 5 l min and 10 l min fig 2a confirms that a parabolic flow develops over the height of the flow cell the velocity profile in fig 2b is flat in the center and drops off sharply near the wall these velocity profiles have the typical characteristics of laminar flow and turbulent flow respectively white 2009 as a summary for the simulations this flow cell could generate stable flow within 0 6l0 0 8l0 0 2w0 0 8w0 and the stable wall shear stresses 0 23 0 68 1 39 2 30 pa were obtained within this area under scheduled flow conditions fig 3 3 2 effect of shear force on morphological features the characteristics of bacillus sp biofilm under different conditions were investigated the flow cell was operated at four different velocities 0 10 0 31 0 52 and 0 69 m s and the static condition was set as control the effect of shear force on the morphology of bacillus sp was assessed by sem fig 4 it was realized that the wall shear stress affected the adhesive behavior of bacillus sp remarkably after 72 h culture under different conditions the stainless steel plates already exhibited adhesion of bacillus sp on their surfaces clearly fig 4a b c d e the bacillus sp distribution pattern on the substratum surface was significantly different between static condition and dynamic conditions single bacteria were scattered on the surface at static condition and several bacteria in rows which was a typical feature of bacillus sp figs 4a 1 however under the effect of shear stress the images showed that the bacteria gathered to form clusters and also remained isolated attached bacteria figs 4b 1 c 1 d 1 e 1 moreover the formation of biofilm was seen from enlarged sem images clearly figs 4a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 e 2 under dynamic conditions the images showed the presence of eps which connected the cells to each other and to the surface these structures became more frequent and the production of eps increased with the shear force increased the formation of biofilm is a process of cell immobilization under static condition the gravity force and cell mobility are the dominant factors of the contact among bacteria or attachment of bacterium onto solid surface liu and tay 2002 pratt and kolter 1998 the adhesion of bacillus sp on the surface appeared discrete distribution under the action of gravity and several bacillus sp stood in row because of the cell motility under dynamic conditions the shear force played a major role to facilitate formation of clusters and the production of eps thibaut saur et al 2017 found that under the effect of shear force the formation of clusters was only related to aggregation of cells instead the growth of microorganisms therefore these aggregates were considered as clusters instead of micro colonies the features of clusters grown under laminar flow fig 4b and c were also different from that grown under turbulent flow fig 4d and e it seemed that the turbulent flow easily created more smooth and rigid clusters than laminar flow picioreanu et al 2000 found that with the nutrient availability increased the biofilm structure could gradual shift toward denser and smoother thus it could be concluded that the difference of formed clusters under different flow conditions was mainly due to the external mass transfer gradually increased with the increase of flow velocity which led to the increase of nutrient supply to the clusters in addition the increased detachment rate with the increase of shear force also contributed to this appearance with the increase of shear force the changes of bacillus sp shape were observed from the enlarged views statistical analysis of the bacillus sp shape was conducted by imagej for each sample fig 4f and g the length of bacillus sp was 3 35 0 93 3 09 0 71 2 75 0 81 2 48 0 51 and 1 92 0 46 μm under different flow conditions respectively fig 4f with the increase of shear force the length of bacteria decreased gradually on the contrary the width of bacteria increased gradually with the increase of wall shear stress fig 4g which is 0 50 0 06 0 68 0 07 0 69 0 08 0 95 0 09 and 0 95 0 10 μm under different flow conditions respectively under the flow condition of maximum wall shear stress 0 69 m s the length of bacteria was almost half of that under static condition and the width increased by 90 approximately these indicated that the bacillus sp could adapt to the shear force environment by shape changing the average adhesion areas of bacteria were estimated by multiply the length by the width which were 1 66 0 06 μm2 2 08 0 05 μm2 1 89 0 07 μm2 2 35 0 05 μm2 1 82 0 05 μm2 under different flow conditions respectively the average adhesion area under static condition was a little smaller than that under the dynamic conditions however there were no significant distinctions of average adhesion area among the five conditions thus we could conclude that under the effect of shear stress the bacillus sp could enhance the adhesion by the changed shape and the increased secretion of eps rather than increased adhesion area the deformation of bacteria could reduce the effect of shear force to benefit the adhesion of bacteria the increased secretion of eps could enhance the cell to cell connection and the adhesion to the substratum morphological analysis showed that with the increase of wall shear stress the spatial distribution of bacteria changed significantly from single cell pattern to cluster pattern the adaptation of bacillus sp to shear force environment was mainly by the deformation and the increased secretion of eps 3 3 effect of shear force on biofilm conformation the effect of shear force on the characteristics of bacillus sp biofilm was evaluated by clsm fig 5 it clearly showed that the shear force had significant effect on the architecture and topography of the bacillus sp biofilm after culture for 72 h to clarify the regulating regimes of shear force on the biofilm several key biofilm parameters were analyzed by the program comstat from the clsm image stacks adhesion ratio is defined as the ratio of bacteria adhesion area to the total substratum surface area after 72 h incubation in the bacillus sp suspension under different conditions the adhesion ratio was 5 09 1 41 16 01 6 67 11 73 3 57 5 81 1 17 and 3 22 1 34 respectively fig 6 f the results showed that adhesion ratio of the biofilm increased significantly under the low shear stress compared to the biofilm formed under static condition and decreased gradually with the increase of shear force the adhesion ratio is determined by the transport of microorganisms to the substratum surface through mass transfer such as convection diffusion or sedimentation korber et al 1990 compared with the static condition the adhesion ratio increased sharply at the flow velocity of 0 10 m s mainly because the convective mass transfer started to play a major role under dynamic condition busscher and hc 2006 which led to a great increase of substrate flux while the adhesion ratio decreased gradually with the increase of wall shear stress when the flow velocity had exceeded a critical limit these was in coincidence with that the high shear force to prevent adhesion morisaki 1991 and stimulate detachment the maximum adhesion ratio was at the flow velocity of 0 10 m s fig 6f while the total biomass of the biofilm was maximum at the flow velocity of 0 31 m s among the five hydrodynamic conditions fig 6g the increased secretion of eps at 0 31 m s resulted in maximum biomass even with the decreased adhesion ratio the total biomass gradually reduced at the flow velocity of 0 52 and 0 69 m s was mainly due to the adhesion ratio decreased under the effect of higher wall shear stress similar trends also occurred in the average thickness and the average cluster size of biofilm fig 6h and i which was in agreement with the sem observation fig 4 in addition the average diffusion distance increased under low wall shear stress and decreased under high wall shear stress fig 6j which reflected the length substrate needed to travel to get to the middle of the cluster yang et al 2000 sd is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of dispersion of a set of data values under the flow velocity of 0 31 m s the average thickness the average cluster size and the average diffusion distance of biofilm were maximum among five hydrodynamic conditions meanwhile the sd of average thickness the average cluster size and the average diffusion distance were also maximum under this flow condition these indicated that the biofilm heterogeneity was maximum and the biofilm was most irregular and complicated under this flow condition the irregular and complicated structure of biofilm under low flow velocity could lead to the formation of tower like biofilm due to the mass transfer limitation and the formation of tower like biofilm could aggravate the uneven distribution of substrate concentration as the biofilm thickness grew the tops of biofilm clusters could access more substrate they grew faster than other parts of the cluster thereby height differences was amplified to eventually produce tall clusters separated by channels stewart 2012 whereas the clusters in the valleys grew in a substrate depleted environment the voids between the clusters could not be filled with new biomass any longer picioreanu et al 1998 thus it can be speculated that under low shear force with the growth of biofilm the detachment of biofilm will occur much more frequent than that under high shear force and the biofilm will repeat this growth process on the compact basal biofilm layer whereas the biofilm grows under high shear force will grow and expand the coverage area slowly forming a denser smoother biofilm with stronger adhesive strength the surface to biovolume ratio is the surface area divided by the biovolume which reflects what fraction of the biofilm is in fact exposed to the nutrient flow heydorn et al 2000b the trend of surface to biovolume ratio was contrary to that of the other parameters fig 6k the decreased surface to biovolume ratio under low wall shear stress further indicated that the low flow velocity promoted the development of biofilm and the increased surface to biovolume ratio under high wall shear stress further indicated that the high flow velocity inhibited the development of biofilm he et al 2018 it is therefore clear that the hydrodynamic shear force plays an important role on the conformation of bacillus sp biofilm in terms of adhesion kinetics and pattern and microbial cluster these effects seem to be dominated by changing the way of mass transfer and stimulating the biofilm to regulate the metabolic pathways liu and tay 2001 the results indicated that the shear force could be used as a control lever to encourage or inhibit the biofilm formation moreover these results can also give insight into the selection of antifouling coating for underwater infrastructure in fluid environment under the environment of high flow velocity fouling release coating should be a better choice because of the increased production of eps and the formation of denser and stronger biofilm which can inhibit the release of biocide and provide protection for the cells from the released biocide to weaken the antifouling performance of biocidal antifouling coating moreover the high shear force can promote the detachment of biofilm from fouling release coating surface under the static or low flow velocity environment the biocidal antifouling coating should be better the reasons are that the extensive and loose biofilm can only provide limited protection for the cells and the low shear force can t give full play to the effect of fouling release coating whether these differences are linear or stable remains to be further studied in the process of biofilm maturation 4 conclusions a parallel flow cell system was designed in this study the flow cell could generate stable flow within 0 6l0 0 8l0 0 2w0 0 8w0 under scheduled flow conditions to obtain the stable wall shear stresses and investigate the effect of hydrodynamic shear force on the morphology and conformation of biofilm compared with the static condition the spatial distribution of bacteria changed from single cell pattern to cluster pattern meanwhile the higher wall shear stress created more smooth and rigid clusters the different morphology of formed clusters under different flow conditions was mainly due to the increase of nutrient supply to the clusters with the increase of flow velocity under the effect of shear stress the bacillus sp could change the shape and increase the production of eps to ensure the adhesion to the substratum under low shear force the biofilm preferred to form irregular and complicated structure which could lead to the formation of tower like biofilm and inhibit the external mass transfer authors contributions jiangfan chang

22128,there have been only a few investigations lately to analyze the flow induced vibrations of a diamond cylinder i e a square cylinder inclined at 45 to the free stream at low and high reynolds numbers r e however for transverse vortex induced motions of diamond cylinders at low r e features of response branching mean surface pressure wake modes and fluid loading are less explored we investigate numerically at r e 100 undamped hydroelastic vortex induced vibrations of a diamond cylinder over a well resolved u range of 1 to 12 the order of magnitude of the maximum response as well as branching of response of the diamond oscillator are analogous to those of the circular cylinder and depart considerably from the ones of a square cylinder at zero incidence interestingly the mean lift from this nominally symmetric cross section deviates from zero at u values of 3 5 and 4 2 corresponding to the quasi periodic initial branch and periodic lower branch respectively at u 3 5 corresponding to low amplitude oscillations three distinct asymmetric wake modes are identified asymmetric 2s and two one sided modes of different nature the well known asymmetric p s mode is identified at u 4 2 relating to high amplitude oscillations keywords stabilized finite element diamond cylinder transverse viv branching of response one sided wake mode comparison of viv 1 introduction the phenomenon of alternate vortex shedding from a bluff obstacle is unsteady in nature and continues to alter the instantaneous pressure on the body surface this induces the time varying lift force across the main flow for a flexibly mounted object the unsteady lift becomes the driving force leading to periodic or non periodic motion of the object under such circumstances the induced translations of the body represent vortex induced vibrations viv viv is the most commonly encountered fluid structure interactions fsi problem the most important quantities of interest in the study of viv are the oscillator response and oscillation frequency in order to prevent or minimize structural failure it is of prime importance to control viv a need therefore arises to have prior information on the response and frequency data for viv of a given oscillator shape cross section while viv of a circular cylinder has been studied extensively in low and high reynolds number r e regimes much less efforts have been put forward to analyze the viv of a square cylinder at zero incidence the available studies for instance sen and mittal 2011 at low r e clearly reveal qualitative as well as quantitative differences between viv of these oscillator shapes a square cylinder at 45 incidence also referred to as diamond cylinder is a symmetric shape that when held stationary exhibit unforeseen and completely distinctive steady flow features kumar et al 2018c 2019 at very low reynolds numbers in the regime of low r e unsteady flow around stationary objects the features of fluid forcing for a square cylinder at 0 and 45 incidences reveal stark contrast sohankar et al 1998 for 45 r e 200 figure 6b of sohankar et al 1998 suggests that the mean drag c d of a diamond cylinder rises with r e whereas for the square cylinder at zero incidence it initially decays and then rises while the r m s lift c l r m s of both cylinders exhibit identical trend with r e figure 6c of sohankar et al 1998 its magnitude for the diamond cylinder dominates considerably over those of the cylinder at zero incidence for viv under identical input conditions one therefore expects appreciable deviations in fluid loading as well as response characteristics of these oscillator shapes the study of viv amounts to extracting the time variation of the mutual feedback between the oscillator or solid medium and the fluid medium experimental and computational approaches are the two primary ways of handling a viv problem in the present effort a stabilized space time finite element solver tezduyar et al 1992a b c based on partitioned or staggered approach is employed in two dimensions in partitioned approach at each time step the flow and rigid body motion are solved separately in absence of a detailed and fundamental study on transversely only viv of a diamond cylinder the present study numerically explores the problem at r e 100 let the cross stream diagonal d of the diamond section cylinder fig 2a represents its characteristic length the controlling non dimensional structural and flow parameters governing viv of a diamond cylinder are structuralparameters i mass ratio or non dimensional mass or relative density of the oscillator m is the ratio of oscillator mass per unit length m to mass of displaced fluid if ρ is the density of fluid then m 2 m ρ d 2 ii reduced speed u is the free stream speed u normalized by the natural or structural frequency f n of the oscillator as well as characteristic dimension i e u u f n d 1 f n where f n is the reduced natural frequency of the oscillator iii damping ratio or coefficient of structural damping ζ is expressed as c 2 k m where c and k respectively stand for the damping and stiffness of the oscillator system the undamped viv corresponds to ζ 0 flowparameter iv reynolds number of flow is based on free stream speed and characteristic length scale i e r e u d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the vibration characteristics are generally studied by one of the following approaches i coupling r e and u by an inverse relationship and ii varying u independent of r e following the second approach the quantities m ζ and r e are held constant in the present analysis while u is allowed to vary the parameter set used for computations is m 10 ζ 0 r e 100 and u 1 12 an account of previous investigations concerning the flow around freely vibrating rigid square cylinders at zero and other angles of incidence is provided below thereafter a brief discussion highlighting the primary objectives of the current study marks the closure of introduction in the discussion that follows reference is frequently made of wake modes the concept of wake mode of vortex formation was introduced by williamson and roshko 1988 they performed extensive forced vibration experiments on a circular cylinder in a towing tank over 300 r e 1000 the upper limit of oscillation amplitude across the flow was as high as five times the diameter of the circular cylinder they presented a vortex synchronization map in the amplitude reduced speed wavelength plane that depicts the possible wake modes and their demarcating boundaries the vortices that are shed in an oscillation cycle constitute the wake mode of vortex formation the type of wake mode relies on oscillation amplitude as well as reduced speed the most common wake modes are 2s c 2s p s 2p 2p 2s etc here s stands for a single vortex p for a vortex pair and c denotes coalescence of vortices later morse and williamson 2009 refined the vortex map further with inclusion of newly identified 2p o mode where o stands for overlap 1 1 flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder at zero incidence vortex induced vibrations of a square cylinder at a low r e 100 were perhaps studied for the first time by su et al 2007 the mass ratio of the oscillator was 10 and it executed undamped transverse only viv a stabilized finite element formulation was employed to model the viv problem results were presented for maximum response beside time traces of response and lift forces an early investigation on vortex induced motion of a square cylinder is due to amandolese and hemon 2010 they performed aeroelastic experiments for transverse only motion at high r e the key parameters used by amandolese and hemon 2010 are r e 2000 8000 m 905 and ζ 0 000828 0 000014 based on stabilized finite element computations sen and mittal 2011 presented limited results for transverse displacement in the galloping branch for r e 200 250 of response the mass ratio of the square cylinder was 10 and its motions were undamped by employing a finite element formulation he et al 2012 investigated the transverse only viv of a square cylinder at a sole reynolds number of 250 the key input parameters for their study were m 20 ζ 0 0037 f n 0 025 and u 6 20 40 and 80 for u 6 40 and 80 the wake mode was 2s the mode at u 20 deviated from 2s by employing a quasi steady model and also by performing direct numerical simulation of the equations of motion joly et al 2012 investigated the onset of galloping of a rigid square cylinder they concluded that galloping of a square cylinder occurs at a reynolds number exceeding 140 under undamped condition two degrees of freedom transverseand in line or 2 dof free hydroelastic vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 was numerically studied by sen and mittal 2011 for r e 60 250 an inverse relationship f n 14 39 r e linking the reduced natural frequency and reynolds number was used for the computations in the initial and lower branches of response they identified the 2s and c 2s modes they mistakenly interpreted the 2p 2s mode in the galloping regime as 2p this was later rectified in sen and mittal 2015 the 2 dof oscillations of an isolated square cylinder was subsequently studied by he et al 2012 based on numerical experiments they presented results using identical input parameter set as well as f n 14 39 r e relationship employed by sen and mittal 2011 they however resolved only the 2s mode of vortex formation sen and mittal 2015 extended their previous work sen and mittal 2011 to understand the link of viv and galloping with mass ratio they demonstrated that motion of the cylinder is purely viv for m 1 while for m 5 the motion is viv at low r e and galloping at high r e the wake modes resolved are 2s c 2s unstable 2s and 2p 2s the study by sen and mittal 2015 explored the dependence of wake mode structure on the magnitude of transverse response the 2p 2s mode was shown to form only above a minimum value of normalized transverse response of 0 7 further analysis of the study by sen and mittal 2015 was later performed by sen and mittal 2016 for each r e and m sen and mittal 2016 noted symmetry of drag lift lissajou diagrams about the zero lift line irrespective of the flow being periodic or quasi periodic based on this observation they concluded that the wake modes of a vibrating square cylinder at low r e must be symmetric such as 2s c 2s 2p or 2p 2s formation of asymmetric modes such as p s was thus ruled out since synchronization between transverse oscillation and vortex shedding in the galloping branch was different from 1 2 sen and mittal 2016 argued that a 2p mode cannot form in the wake of a square cylinder at zero incidence it was also shown that the unstable 2s or 3 2s and 2p 2s modes appear in the quasi periodic and periodic galloping branches respectively synchronization in these sub branches is away from and very close to 1 3 respectively through linear stability analysis as well as finite volume computations li et al 2019 investigated the mechanism leading to transverse galloping of a square cylinder for r e 200 according to them galloping does not commence below a reduced speed of 10 for r e 150 and u 40 li et al 2019 found that the cylinder motion is viv and devoid of galloping as long as the value of m is smaller than 4 for r e 250 sourav and sen 2019 recently determined the value of transition mass ratio at which the motion of an undamped square cylinder alters from viv only to one with combined viv and galloping via direct computations they found that the transition occurs at m 3 4 1 2 flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder at incidence transverse only flow induced vibrations of inclined square cylinders of low m at high r e was experimentally investigated by nemes et al 2012 and zhao et al 2014 for m 2 2 and angles of incidence between 0 and 45 nemes et al 2012 presented results for r e 2500 12500 the wake mode resolved by them for the zero incidence is 2s for an asymmetric configuration with 20 incidence the wake mode is p s at low u and 2p at relatively higher u for 45 incidence the motion is purely viv and wake modes are 2s and 2p detailed numerical results for free undamped vibrations of inclined square cylinders simultaneously along and across the flow at r e 100 were presented by zhao et al 2013 the incidence angles considered were 0 22 5 and 45 and mass ratio of the oscillator was 3 the reduced speed was varied over a wide range of 1 to 30 this study demonstrates an essential interdependence between the angle of attack and wake mode for the 0 configuration the wake mode was 2s for all u for 22 5 incidence two regimes of lock in were found at low and high u respectively the wake mode in the first regime was 2s and it was 2p in the second regime bistable vibrations were noted in the lock in regime for the 45 angle of attack during lock in a continuous switching between p s and 2p modes was found outside synchronization the mode was 2s through spectral element computations at r e 200 leontini and thompson 2013 investigated the free transverse vibrations of a diamond cylinder of m 2 for a u range of 3 to 16 they investigated the response frequency and wake modes for diamond cylinders with all corners pointed and the upper and lower corners rounded to various degrees the effects of rounding the cylinder shoulders on the wake modes were explored the rounding represented by normalized radius r c was progressively increased from 0 for sharp corners to 0 2 and results were compared with those of a circular cylinder for r c 0 15 results display close proximity to those of a circular cylinder for r c 0 15 leontini and thompson 2013 resolved the asymmetric p s mode based on the values of u and r c they classified the flow into six distinct regimes zhao et al 2014 conducted water channel experiments at high r e for three orientations same as considered by nemes et al 2012 of the transversely vibrating square cylinder symmetric configurations of 0 and 45 and an asymmetric configuration of 20 for 0 incidence they varied u from 3 to 25 and the motion was found to be dominated by transverse galloping a detailed account of synchronization type was presented and they demonstrated that only odd synchronization occurs in the galloping branch the absence of even synchronization was explained as the outcome of absence of unbalanced fluid loading to trigger galloping the wake mode identified was n 2s corresponding to 1 n synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding where n 1 3 and 5 the n 2s mode was later resolved by li et al 2019 and sourav and sen 2019 etc the response of the cylinder at 20 incidence consists of the initial branch or ib upper branch or ub and higher amplitude branch or hb reported by nemes et al 2012 earlier a complex asymmetric vortex formation was observed in the upper branch ranging between u 4 and 8 approximately that involved vortex formation shedding and dissipation no nomenclature was used to designate the corresponding wake mode in the higher branch u 8 and above two consecutive cycles of 2s mode of different time period are shed in each oscillation cycle the resulting wake mode was designated as 2 2s by zhao et al 2014 five distinct synchronization regimes of high amplitude oscillations were identified for 3 u 7 5 when the angle of incidence was raised to 45 the wake modes in this high response regime are 2s and 2p the motion is purely viv but different from that of a circular cylinder based on two dimensional finite element simulations transverse flow induced vibrations of inclined square and rectangular cylinders each of m 2 4 were investigated by cui et al 2015 at high r e for the square cylinder the values of angle of incidence were 0 22 5 and 45 whereas for the rectangular cylinder the angles of incidence were 0 45 and 90 for each case the reynolds number was defined as r e 385 u this study indicates that the flow induced vibrations of the square cylinder are dominated by galloping for zero incidence and by viv for 22 5 and 45 angles of incidence respectively goncalves et al 2015 through experiments in an ocean basin at high r e 2000 30000 investigated the response of square diamond and circular cylinders of different aspect ratios 1 2 and 3 for each cylinder the mass ratio was fixed at 1 they reported that both the in line and transverse amplitudes of a diamond cylinder surpass those of a circular cylinder followed by a square cylinder they observed the presence of galloping for a square cylinder while it was absent for diamond and circular cylinders goncalves et al 2016 later performed experiments in an ocean basin to study the effects of rounded edges on flow induced vibrations of square and diamond cylinders for each geometry the cylinder aspect ratio was 2 they observed that rounding of the corners decrease the transverse vibration amplitude they found that response of diamond cylinders with rounded edges exceed those with sharp cornered diamond cylinders the observation that viv of the diamond cylinder is similar to that of the circular cylinder while galloping is executed by the square cylinder alone was later noted by goncalves et al 2017 even over a much wider range of r e stretching from 10000 to 150000 liu et al 2016 ramirez and fernandes 2016 and zhao et al 2018 investigated at high r e the flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder at incidence in a subsequent study zhao et al 2019 experimentally explored the effect of m on transverse only vibrations of a square cylinder at 0 20 and 45 incidences for 3 u 26 the mass ratio was varied from 2 64 to 15 and reynolds number from 1000 to 12300 for the diamond cylinder increased m affected the response significantly in desynchronization regime and slightly in viv regime tamimi et al 2019 experimentally investigated the energy harvesting potential of freely vibrating square and diamond cylinders of m 1 69 at high r e 1 3 objectives of the current work the dominant structural motion under the vortex induced forces occur across the flow because of this abundant research has been performed on transverse only motion of a circular cylinder at low r e anagnostopoulos 1989 by computations at r e 106 and 115 anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 by experiments for r e 90 150 bahmani and akbari 2010 by computations for r e 80 160 as well as high r e aeroelastic experiments of feng 1968 water channel experiments by khalak and williamson 1999 for r e 3500 10000 following the discussions in section1 2 it is clear that there exist only a handful of investigations dealing with the viv phenomenon of a rigid diamond cylinder at low r e pertaining to the two dimensional laminar vortex shedding regime as is seen from table1 vast majority of the available research relate to experimental investigations at r e of the order of 1 0 3 only a pair of computational studies i e leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 for light cylinders of m 2 and 3 respectively are available in the literature that deal with viv of a diamond cylinder at low r e while leontini and thompson 2013 focussed on transverse only viv at r e 200 zhao et al 2013 dealt with simultaneous in line and cross stream vibrations at r e 100 as is well known mass ratio of an oscillator strongly influences its vibration characteristics bahmani and akbari 2010 for y only motion sen and mittal 2015 for x y motion zhao et al 2019 for y only motion in the present work a mass ratio of 10 that is quite higher than those used by leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 is considered and flow viv analyzed for transverse only motion at r e 100 therefore the m r e degree of freedom input parameter set employed in the present study is being used for the first time and hence is expected to extract novel results for viv of a diamond cylinder this indeed happens for instance the response from the present study fig 5a differs substantially from the one presented by leontini and thompson 2013 see fig 4a of their paper for r c 0 0 and zhao et al 2013 see fig 9b of their paper the normalized maximum transverse response y m a x d obtained from all three of these studies are compared in fig 1 below a stark divergence both qualitative and quantitative of the predicted response with the ones reported by leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 is well evident from this figure the resolution of u employed by leontini and thompson 2013 as well as zhao et al 2013 is also not very fine the construction of response of leontini and thompson 2013 appears incomplete in the sense that the response curve starts at u 3 where the value of response exceeds 0 3 d thus finer details of the curve close to the onset of synchronization are missing because of this incompleteness and also because of relatively higher resolution of u close to the drop in y near u 12 details of response branching are unavailable in this study such details are also unavailable in the work of zhao et al 2013 the fluid forces are not analyzed either in leontini and thompson 2013 or in zhao et al 2013 while both of these studies resolved the asymmetric p s mode details of the formation mechanism of the asymmetric mode were not analyzed the associated instantaneous or time averaged surface pressure or time mean lift force was not analyzed as well in addition the primary objective of leontini and thompson 2013 was to investigate the effects of cylinder shoulder rounding on flow and hence they considered multiple cylinder shapes with fig 1 for response in the background incompleteness of the response curve of leontini and thompson 2013 for y only motion absence of analysis of response branching fluid loading surface pressure variation and detailed analysis of the asymmetric wake mode by them sum up to a considerable research gap in y only viv of a diamond cylinder at low r e this research gap forms the primary motivation behind the current numerical investigation the research questions that are dealt with in this work are framed as follows i what are the branches of diamond cylinder response what are the u values for inter branch transition is the transition from lower branch to the second regime of desynchronization smooth as in a square cylinder or abrupt as in a circular cylinder as apparent from fig 1 this transition is abrupt for low m near u 10 for zhao et al 2013 and u 12 for leontini and thompson 2013 however a much finer resolution of u around 10 and 12 respectively could provide finer details of this transition ii the regime of viv for a square cylinder of m 10 is periodic while for a circular cylinder of identical mass ratio viv is associated with both periodicity and quasi periodicity is the viv of a diamond cylinder of m 10 fully periodic or it exhibits both periodicity and quasi periodicity iii how does the fluid loading vary with reduced speed how does the mean surface pressure influence the fluid forcing iv the p s mode is known to exist in viv of a diamond cylinder leontini and thompson 2013 zhao et al 2013 do there exist other asymmetric wake modes how do the mean lift and surface pressure vary in conjunction with asymmetric wake modes v for m 10 and same characteristic dimension how do the vibration characteristics of circular square and diamond cylinders compare why is the range of lock in largest for the diamond cylinder and narrowest for the square cylinder why is the response of the diamond cylinder much larger than that of the square cylinder in order to address the aforementioned queries the partitioned stabilized space time finite element solver of tezduyar et al 1992a b c is employed and undamped viv of a diamond cylinder of m 10 analyzed at r e 100 over u 1 12 a much finer resolution of u than used by leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 is used the remaining of the article is organized as follows in section2 the governing equations for incompressible fluid flow and rigid body motion are reviewed the space time finite element formulation is discussed briefly in section3 definition of the problem and finite element mesh are depicted in section4 validation of the formulation as well as mesh convergence study are addressed in section5 the main results are presented and discussed in section6 section7 closes the article with few concluding remarks 2 the governing equations of motion 2 1 the incompressible flow equations let ω t represents a time varying spatial domain where t stands for dimensional time the boundary of ω t is denoted by γ t and is assumed to be piecewise smooth the spatial coordinates are denoted by x t and temporal domain by s using vector or coordinate free notations the navier stokes equations of motion governing incompressible fluid flow is read in stress divergence form as 1 ρ u t u u f σ 0 on ω t 0 s 2 u 0 on ω t 0 s in the above strong form of conservation equations u u v f and σ are the velocity body force per unit volume and cauchy stress tensor respectively in the present study f 0 both the essential dirichlet and natural neumann type boundary conditions are considered see section4 a divergence free or satisfying zero dilatation rate initial velocity u 0 is specified on ω t such that 3 u x 0 u 0 on ω 0 2 2 equation of undamped transverse motion of a diamond cylinder the transverse translation of a rigid body in a moving viscous fluid is governed by newton s second law of motion by modeling the oscillator via a spring mass damper system its equation of motion may be cast in dimensional form as 4 m d 2 y d t 2 c d y d t k y f y for 0 s where the structural quantities m c and k are defined in section1 ineq 4 y y t denotes instantaneous transverse displacement of the oscillator measured from a fixed reference instantaneous velocity and acceleration of the oscillator are denoted by d y d t and d 2 y d t 2 respectively f y t is the instantaneous transverse fluid loading on the oscillator for c 0 or undamped viv the rigid body equation equation 4 for a square cylinder at 45 incidence reduces to the following second order ode in time after normalization 5 d 2 y d t 2 2 π u 2 y c l m for 0 s u d where the normalized response and time are defined as y y d and t t u d respectively here c l t f y t 12 ρ u 2 d is the instantaneous total lift coefficient for the body it may be noted that d y d t u d y d t and d 2 y d t 2 u 2 d d 2 y d t 2 for single degree of freedom or sdof viv 1 2 and 5 form a coupled system of equations where coupling between the fluid and solid media is due to the dynamic no slip boundary condition as well as vortex induced lift force at the fluid solid interface the instantaneous vortex induced fluid forces drag and lift respectively are computed as 6 c d t c l t 1 1 2 ρ u 2 d γ c y l h x h y d γ where h x and h y are the components of the surface traction vector h defined as h n σ the stress tensor at a point is decomposed in its inviscid and viscous components as σ p i μ u u t here p is pressure μ is dynamic viscosity of fluid i is identity tensor and n is the local unit vector normal to the cylinder boundary γ c y l following the lead of lighthill 1986 the total lift can be decomposed into potential force and vortex force components the potential force arises out of added mass effects whereas the vortex force relates to the convective transport of vorticity the instantaneous potential force f p o t e n t i a l t is computed as 7 f p o t e n t i a l t c a m d d 2 y d t 2 c a m d u 2 d d 2 y d t 2 where c a is the potential added mass coefficient and m d is the mass of displaced fluid for the diamond cylinder c a 0 76 table 2 3 of sarpkaya 2010 and m d 1 2 ρ d 2 substituting d 2 y d t 2 fromeq 5 ineq 7 one obtains 8 f p o t e n t i a l t c a m d u 2 d c l m 2 π u 2 y d the instantaneous potential force coefficient c p o t e n t i a l t is defined as c p o t e n t i a l t f p o t e n t i a l t 1 2 ρ u 2 d the instantaneous vortex force coefficient c v o r t e x is computed from equation 3 4 of govardhan and williamson 2000 represented as 9 c v o r t e x t c l t c p o t e n t i a l t 3 the finite element formulation a stabilized space time finite element formulation employing the same order of bilinear interpolation for velocity as well as pressure is used in this work while the interpolation functions are bilinear in space they are linear in time globally these interpolation functions are continuous in space but discontinuous in time details of the space time finite element formulation are available in tezduyar et al 1992a b the stabilization parameters not shown here are defined in tezduyar et al 1992c besides the equations of fluid flow the equation of motion of the oscillator given byeq 5 is also cast in the space time formulation in the way depicted in tezduyar et al 1992b and mittal 1992 4 problem statement at impending motion the diamond cylinder is located at the mid height of a rectangular computational domain of size 54 d 20 d fig 2a the associated cartesian coordinate system is stationary i e an inertial frame of reference is employed for the present analysis free stream inlet stress free exit slip lateral boundaries and no slip cylinder surface define the boundary conditions a blockage b of 0 05 corresponding to domain width of 20 d is used distances of the upstream and downstream boundaries from the origin of the coordinate system are 24 d and 30 d respectively a non dimensional time step size t t u d of 0 02 has been used for all the computations a non uniform multi block number of mesh blocks equals five structured finite element mesh consisting of bilinear quadrilateral elements is used for domain discretization fig 2b the mesh consists of 24149 nodes and 23780 quadrilateral elements the construction of the mesh is very similar to the mesh used by sen and mittal 2011 for a square cylinder at zero incidence keeping the outer rectangular boundary of the domain stationary the mesh is reconstructed at each time step and no slip boundary condition updated continuously the mesh moving scheme is discussed in sen and mittal 2011 in their earlier studies concerning 2 dof vibrations of a square cylinder at zero incidence sen and mittal 2011 2015 2016 coupled the reduced speed and reynolds number via f n 14 39 r e relationship considering the vortex shedding frequency of a fixed square cylinder at r e 100 as reference natural frequency this equation maps the natural frequency at an arbitrary r e and also leads to a single value of reduced speed for each reynolds number in the current set of computations involving diamond cylinder u is varied independent of r e in the context of experiments in a laboratory u is varied by changing u while the values of d and f n are kept constant the same effect on u in a numerical framework as in the present work is obtained by keeping u and d fixed while varying f n 5 validation of the formulation and mesh convergence 5 1 validation of the formulation the accuracy of the predicted results has been established via comparison of the predicted results with those available in the literature to this end flow around a stationary as well as freely vibrating inclined square cylinder has been considered at r e 100 for a stationary diamond cylinder yoon et al 2010 presented in fig 19 of their paper the variation of viscous and pressure drag coefficients with r e they used a blockage of 0 01 the value of mean drag c d obtained from this figure at r e 100 is 1 7200 using identical value of blockage the value of c d obtained from the present computations for the stationary diamond cylinder at r e 100 is 1 732 this value is in close agreement with the numerically obtained value of yoon et al 2010 stated above the validation of predicted results concerning undamped viv of square and diamond cylinders of m 3 each at r e 100 has recently been discussed by us in table 2 of sourav and sen 2019 for each case the value of reduced speed was fixed to 5 for the square configuration each study employed the same blockage of 0 025 for the diamond cylinder our computations were performed using b 0 025 the value of blockage considered by zhao et al 2013 was 0 0354 the table is reproduced below as table2 as apparent from this table our predicted normalized response for the square cylinder resides within the values predicted by zhao et al 2013 and jaiman et al 2016 in particular our predicted response is almost the average of response values reported by zhao et al 2013 and jaiman et al 2016 therefore a satisfactory agreement of the predicted response data exists for both of 0 and 45 incidences 5 2 convergence of results to establish mesh insensitivity of the computed results the flow and viv at r e 100 have been computed on several meshes of varying spatial resolution at a representative reduced speed value of 3 5 a multi block structured mesh comprising of five mesh blocks each of different resolution is used for the convergence test table3 lists the key mesh parameters for two meshes m1 and m2 such that the spatial resolution of m2 is about twice finer than that of m1 the parameter n t denotes the number of nodes on the cylinder surface the results of mesh convergence test summarized in table3 indicate that the characteristic viv quantities and fluid loading do not register any noticeable variation due to mesh refinement this observation ensures that the resolution of m1 is adequate to successfully resolve the flow and viv all the results presented in this paper is based on computations on mesh m1 having 24149 nodes and 23780 bilinear quadrilateral elements in this table s t denotes the strouhal number while s t y and s t c l stand for normalized oscillation and vortex shedding frequency respectively 6 results based on stabilized space time finite element computations in two dimensions results for undamped y only viv of a rigid diamond section cylinder of m 10 are presented at r e 100 over u 1 12 range a blockage of 0 05 is used for the computations at each time step the asymmetric flow matrix is solved using gmres solver saad and schultz 1986 and the rigid body ode expressed byeq 5 is solved via numerical integration the initial part of this section discusses the r e 100 flow around a stationary diamond cylinder detailed analysis of its flow induced motion follows thereafter 6 1 flow past a stationary diamond cylinder at r e 100 the r e 100 flow past a fixed square cylinder at 45 incidence belongs to the two dimensional periodic laminar vortex shedding regime the periodicity with single frequency is evident from the sinusoidal time traces of c d and c l illustrated via fig 3a and b respectively the power spectra of drag fig 3c lift fig 3d as well as the pair of loops in the c d c l lissajou diagram fig 3e ascertain that the drag coefficient oscillates with twice the frequency of lift as is generally observed for flow around bluff obstacles besides revealing the periodic nature of flow the c d c l phase portrait depicted via fig 3e implies that the mean lift is zero from this and also from the symmetry of the c d c l profile about c l 0 one expects that the mean surface pressure will be symmetric along the upper and lower halves of the cylinder between the stagnation points a and c fig 3f and vortex shedding will be anti symmetric fig 3f affirms the symmetry of mean surface pressure c p between the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder the value of c p is maximum at the forward stagnation point a and minimum at the shoulders b and d starting from the forward stagnation point the pressure gradient is favorable until the minimum pressure point is reached the pressure gradient is adverse along the majority of rear surface between the shoulders unlike a circular cylinder and a square cylinder at zero incidence c p of the diamond section cylinder drops at the base point c this pressure drop is indicative of favorable pressure gradient near the base region the flow field depicted in terms of instantaneous vorticity fig 3g and streamlines fig 3h suggests the formation of unsteady wake due to karman mode of vortex shedding the values of characteristic flow quantities are listed in the second row of table4 in this table c d p and c d v respectively denote the time mean pressure drag and viscous drag also listed in the third and fourth rows of this table are the corresponding values for a square cylinder at zero incidence and a circular cylinder obtained by jaiman et al 2015 compared to these later two cylinder shapes the aerodynamic loading and vortex shedding is visibly quite stronger for the square cylinder at 45 incidence it may be noted that the magnitude of c l r m s is an indicator of strength of vortex shedding the data for forward stagnation pressure c p 0 and base suction coefficient c p b implies that among the three cylinder shapes the largest value of forward stagnation pressure and least value of base pressure correspond to the diamond section cylinder thus difference of c p 0 and c p b becomes maximum or alternately pressure recovery becomes minimum for this cylinder this explains the large drag of the diamond section cylinder in this table and throughout the paper the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder is denoted by the symbol s t 0 the last column of table4 indicates that the location of separation is fixed for cylinders with sharp corners and movable for cylinders with smooth contours 6 2 vortex induced vibrations of a diamond cylinder at r e 100 a flexibly mounted isolated square cylinder at 45 incidence or an isolated circular cylinder executes vortex induced vibrations and the motion does never transit to high amplitude galloping zhao et al 2014 the experimental study by nemes et al 2012 reported similarities between the viv of a circular cylinder and viv of a square cylinder with 45 incidence at high r e the investigations by barrero gil et al 2009 joly et al 2012 and sen and mittal 2015 provided values of critical reynolds numbers below which a square cylinder at zero incidence executes pure viv and does not gallop as discussed in section1 1 the lowest value of critical r e for onset of its galloping motion reported in the literature is 140 joly et al 2012 thus at r e 100 the motion of the square cylinder at zero incidence is purely viv it is found here that the viv response with 45 incidence at r e 100 is closer to the response of a circular cylinder and appreciably remote from the square cylinder at zero incidence this subsection discusses for r e 100 the features of viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence and in section6 3 comparison of viv of the aforesaid three cylinder shapes are made under identical conditions 6 2 1 synchronization response and periodicity recently kumar et al 2018b proposed a simple method to identify the branches of viv response and associated transitions that they argue to be valid even for viv at high r e this method relies solely on the frequency characteristics of an oscillator and links the transition of response branch with change in slope of the oscillation frequency curve they illustrated the ability of the proposed method by considering at low reynolds numbers the two degrees of freedom viv of a square cylinder at zero incidence circular and thick elliptic cylinders and a circular cylinder truncated at the aft the value of m was 10 for each oscillator for the square cylinder kumar et al 2018b identified two transitions or slope changes of oscillation frequency while for the rest of the oscillators number of transitions was three as discussed below the total number of transitions for viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence equals three thus the number of response branches of a square cylinder is a function of the angle of incidence as the angle of incidence rises to 45 from 0 an additional branch appears and branching pattern follows the one with those with curved contours or combination of straight and curved contours as demonstrated by kumar et al 2018b the magnitude of maximum transverse response as well as extent of lock in of each of these oscillators overshadow the ones of a square oscillator at zero incidence existence of the additional transition is indicative of wider range of synchronization the implication is that the square cylinder with 45 incidence executes viv over a wider range of lock in than the square cylinder at zero incidence following the observations of kumar et al 2018b one expects the wider range of lock in for the diamond cylinder to lead to larger amplitude oscillations than its 0 counterpart as discussed below and illustrated later in fig 19 this indeed happens the response of a square cylinder inclined at 45 to the free stream is about twice the response when its angle of incidence equals 0 the relationship of cylinder oscillation frequency as well as vortex shedding frequency with the reduced speed is depicted via fig 4 for the entire range of u both of these frequencies mostly overlap further underscoring that the motion of the cylinder is purely viv in a galloping motion these quantities diverge such that s t c l s t y as apparent from the frequency curve the magnitude of frequency ranges from 0 16 to 0 27 the initial part of the s t u curve it may be noted that s t s t c l s t y for the entire discussion in section6 2 1 sees a very slow rise of s t with u and the value of s t is approximately equal to its stationary counterpart s t 0 0 1812 from the second row of table4 this regime of a smooth s t u variation extends up to u 3 3 and signifies the first regime of desynchronization or dsi see navrose et al 2014 for a detailed nomenclature of branching of response an abrupt jump discontinuity in s t at u 3 4 and associated change of slope of the frequency curve marks a transition from dsi to the initial branch or ib the s t attains its largest value of 0 27 and this attainment also marks the onset of synchronization or lock in thus the onset of lock in becomes synonymous with commencement of ib similar to circular elliptic cylinders and unlike a square cylinder at 0 for which the onset of lock in signifies beginning of lower branch or lb it may be noted from fig 4 that the value of s t c l at the onset of lock in is slightly larger than the value of s t y the ib terminates at u 4 1 followed by the second change of slope of s t the high amplitude lower branch commences at u 4 2 and is about three times wider than the ib as evident from fig 4 in the entire ib and majority of lb the cylinder vibrates with a frequency larger than s t 0 the reduced speed with the least value of s t marks the lock out as well as final third transition in the response this happens at u 6 8 and the lb transits to the second regime of desynchronization or dsii in dsii the value of vortex shedding frequency drops below the corresponding value of s t 0 the regime of lock in includes the whole of ib as well as lb or alternately it stretches from u 3 4 to u 6 8 the average value of s t 0 is generally considered to be 0 2 over a wide range of r e it is noted that this average s t 0 value is attained at u 5 in the lower branch which happens to be the midway of the range of lock in at u 5 each of f n 1 u s t y and s t c l converge very closely to 0 2 thus the value of frequency ratio f 0 9917 or ratio of oscillation and natural frequencies approximately equals unity the regime of reduced speed around u 5 is referred to as the regime of fundamental synchronization by williamson and roshko 1988 the frequency variation illustrated via fig 4 provides ample information on the relative degree of response in individual response branches as expected closer is the s t to f n higher is the magnitude of y and vice versa accordingly response in the ib is expected to be smaller than the response in the lb the intersection of the s t and f n curves in the lb indicates a non monotonic variation of y initially rising with u and then decreasing in the lb from fig 4 one can also predict the response in dsii to exceed the response in dsi analyzing the s t u variation one can therefore have an a priori estimate of the relative response even without knowing the true y u variation with the branching of response identified above fig 5 illustrates the variation of maximum response as a function of the reduced speed the first two transitions i e dsi ib and ib lb are hysteretic in nature while these transitions are well reflected via respective jumps in y m a x the response curve fails to predict the third or lb dsii transition occurring at u 6 9 this feature is similar to that of a square cylinder at zero incidence a possible explanation of this feature is provided in section6 3 for the dsi ib transition at u 3 4 the rise in response due to jump y m a x 0 095 d and for the ib lb transition at u 4 2 the rise is much higher i e y m a x 0 222 d overall the response is smallest in dsi 0 04 d and largest in the early lb the early phase of lock in is characterized by the initial branch where s t y and s t c l both differ from f n the ib segment of response curve assumes the shape of a hump that is characterized by quasi periodicity kumar et al 2018b towards the closure of ib the viv turns periodic the maximum y in ib y m a x 0 3138 d is attained in the periodic part of ib i e at u 4 1 at u 5 corresponding to the convergence of s t y s t c l and f n the normalized maximum response y m a x d attains its peak value of 0 5878 this value is little higher than the corresponding value of response of a circular cylinder and about thrice the response of a square cylinder when both of the latter execute undamped y only viv under identical conditions discussed in section6 3 the response at the inception of dsii is of appreciable magnitude and notably quite higher than its counterpart in dsi the high amplitude response in dsii might result from the already perturbed flow in the lock in regime as obvious from the inset of fig 5a the frequency ratio is also an equally effective parameter to reflect the branch transitions table5 summarize the key events occurring at transition points and also at the attainment of peak response the periodicity or non periodicity of flow cylinder motion as a function of u can be well explained relative to the c d c l lissajou diagrams presented as insets at selected u values of 3 5 4 4 2 5 5 2 and 6 8 except for the quasi periodic regime in ib the cylinder oscillates periodically with a single dominant frequency for the whole of dsi and dsii the flow or body motion is essentially periodic with single frequency in both y and c l quasi periodicity that is generally observed close to the lock in boundaries is illustrated here for a representative u value of 3 5 belonging to ib fig 5b depicts the time trace of response that reveals quasi periodicity the structure of c d c l lissajou diagram at u 3 5 is an outcome of existence of a large number of minor peaks in both c l fig 5d and c d power spectra of y fig 5c and c l fig 5e each contain three peaks corresponding to s t 0 2548 0 1709 and 0 0885 the ratio of the frequencies i e 0 2548 0 1709 1 4909 and 0 1709 0 0885 1 9311 are irrational numbers further ascertaining the quasi periodicity the periodicity is recovered at u 4 and it prevails for the remaining range of u at u 4 the phase plot assumes the shape of figure eight and lissajou diagram of this shape continues to prevail as u is increased till 4 7 during this interval of u the c l signal deviates from the basic sinusoidal profile but hardly contains any appreciable minor peak see fig 6a for u 4 7 for u 4 8 5 5 each phase plot consists of multiple cross over points and this is a clear indication of presence of multiple minor peaks in the c l signal a close observation of the lissajou diagrams of fig 5a reveals non zero value of mean lift for u 4 2 also see fig 10 this unbalanced lift is indicative of an asymmetric wake mode of vortex formation at this u when the lift is balanced i e mean lift is zero fig 3e the most common and basic wake mode of vortex formation is anti symmetric 2s fig 3g and h in section6 2 3 it is demonstrated that the asymmetric wake mode at u 4 2 is p s for other u considered the value of mean lift is mostly zero this generally suggests for existence of anti symmetric wake mode of vortex formation anti symmetric wake modes are noted for u 4 5 and 5 2 while wake formation for u 3 5 is quite complex these are discussed in section6 2 3 the mean value of response is zero for each u barring u 4 2 at u 4 2 the mean value of y d equals 0 0124 the positive value is indicative of upward bias of cylinder motion and is also consistent with the upward bias of lift in fig 5f the oscillation frequency and response are plotted together this figure clearly establishes the superiority of s t over y in identifying the overall branching of response salient features of frequency response as well as periodicity are listed in table6 as a function of u for selected values of u pertaining to the lb fig 6 plots the time trace and power spectrum of lift along with c d c l phase diagram at u 4 7 the lift signal is an outcome of superposition of a pair of sine curves of different amplitudes and the corresponding power spectrum reveals the existence of two peaks of noticeably different power fig 6a the dominant frequency peak arises due to the high amplitude sine curve corresponding to the major peaks in the lift signal no obvious minor peak appears in the lift signal due to the weaker frequency the c d c l phase diagram comprises of two closed loops with single cross over point and assumes the shape of figure eight as u is increased to 4 8 fig 6b minor peaks become evident in the time history of c l and accordingly the weaker peak in the power spectrum turns powerful the presence of minor peaks in the time history is associated with the appearance of a pair of small loops in the phase plot and the phase portrait looses the shape of figure eight with further rise of u to 4 9 fig 6c the smaller loops in the phase portrait expand as seen from fig 6d the lift at u 5 1 is composed of three sine waves and the number of zero c l or cross over points in the phase plot increases to three the arrangement of peaks in the c l signal gets altered at u 5 3 fig 6e post the phase jump that occurs at u 5 2 discussed in section6 2 2 the alteration in c l peaks is reflected in the translation of the zero c l crossings in the phase plot at u 5 6 fig 6f the c l is again composed of two sine waves and wave pattern as well as phase plot are virtually mirror images of that at u 4 7 6 2 2 the vortex induced forces the relationship of time averaged total drag and its pressure and viscous components with the reduced speed is depicted in fig 7a the value of pressure drag overwhelmingly exceeds its viscous counterpart over the entire range of u in the regimes of decoherence the value of c d for vibrating and stationary cylinders are virtually identical a unique and unforeseen feature of drag relating to the diamond section oscillator is that the least values of drag smaller than even those of a stationary diamond section cylinder and its components are attained in the initial branch no such trend is observed in the low r e viv of either a circular cylinder or a square cylinder at zero incidence see fig 21 in section6 3 at the closure of ib u 4 1 drag is minimum and throughout the lb the vibrating cylinder generates more drag than the stationary cylinder over the entire range of u the c l r m s u variation fig 7b displays no apparent correlation with the c d u variation in contrary to the decreasing trend of c d the r m s lift in the ib registers a steady rise in vast majority of the lb the magnitude of c l r m s is low and its least value is attained at u 5 2 it has been pointed out above that at this u there is a sudden shift of phase ϕ between c l and y fig 9 the phase shift is also reflected by the altered orientation of the c l y lissajou diagrams shown as insets in fig 9 for all the branches of response sans the lower one the leading edge or forward stagnation point represents the point of maximum pressure in the early lb where the response is high the point of maximum pressure travels away from the leading edge or forward stagnation point this is the regime of high drag the closer the base pressure is to the maximum pressure or more is the pressure recovery the lesser is the drag and vice versa for comparison c p of the stationary cylinder fig 3f is reproduced as fig 8a while fig 8b plots the mean surface pressure for three representative u corresponding to the dsi u 3 1 ib u 4 1 and lb u 4 4 the pressure plots for the stationary cylinder and cylinder vibrating at u 3 1 are very similar yielding similar values of drag with respect to the c p of the stationary cylinder the drop in c p for u 4 1 near the leading edge is more than the drop near the base thus at this u pressure recovery is more than the stationary cylinder and drag is low for this case base pressure denotes the minimum surface pressure thus pressure gradient is favorable in the base region this aids in pressure recovery for u 4 4 an overall decrease in c p is noted the decrease is appreciable particularly at the cylinder shoulders thus at the rear faces of the oscillator pressure is sufficiently low leading to least recovery of pressure and the maximum value of c d for high amplitude oscillations in the lb the maximum pressure point travels away from the leading edge this shifting of maximum pressure point is noted in the regime of higher drag i e for u 4 2 5 9 6 2 3 the wake modes of vortex formation for simultaneous in line and transverse undamped viv of a square cylinder of m 3 at 45 incidence zhao et al 2013 explored the wake modes at r e 100 at u 8 corresponding to bi stable solutions they resolved the asymmetric p s mode in addition to a 2p like mode the occurrence of p s mode is linked to the value of frequency ratio based on transverse oscillations being slightly smaller than unity if the frequency ratio exceeds unity the wake mode switches to the 2p like mode they also resolved the 2s mode and showed it for u 15 the viv parameters of the present study that differ with those of zhao et al 2013 are mass ratio degree of freedom and reduced speed the current study relates to y only viv of a square cylinder of m 10 at 45 incidence the range of reduced speed considered u 1 12 is much shorter compared to the one u 1 30 employed by zhao et al 2013 in the current investigation no regime of bi stable solutions is resolved yet novel and previously unreported one sided asymmetric wake modes are identified at u 3 5 in the ib these one sided modes are designated in the present study as s and s at this reduced speed the flow is quasi periodic and the value of frequency ratio 0 8915 is smaller than unity the value of y m a x d equals 0 1680 at u 4 2 marking the transition from ib to lb the asymmetric p s mode is resolved the flow is periodic at this u and the value of frequency ratio 0 9593 slightly falls short of unity as previously noted by zhao et al 2013 in addition the cylinder executes high amplitude oscillations y m a x d 0 5362 for the remaining u the wake mode is 2s or c 2s in the foregoing paragraphs features of the key wake modes are discussed the wake mode at u 3 5 in dsi the oscillation and stationary shedding frequencies are identical and the wake vortex mode is expected to be similar to the one noted for a stationary cylinder see fig 3g and h in this branch the wake mode is basic karman or 2s in the low amplitude ib the oscillation and shedding frequencies mostly collapse but differ from the reduced natural frequency in this regime of soft lock in both s t y and s t c l significantly exceed s t 0 and one therefore expects the wake vortex mode to deviate from 2s in consistency with this anticipation a blend of wake modes is identified at u 3 5 for which the value of mean lift 0 0158 differs from zero based on the number of vortices shed in an oscillation cycle and near wake arrangement of the vortices post shedding williamson and roshko 1988 introduced the concept of wake mode of vortex formation fig 11a plots the y and c l time traces for u 3 5 as expected this figure reveals an in phase relationship between the quantities and identical time period for corresponding y and c l cycles from fig 11a it also follows that the flow roughly repeats in three successive cycles of cylinder oscillation or vortex shedding the time period of the oscillation cycle is determined corresponding to the dominant peak in the fft of response the normalized oscillation frequency of 0 2548 discussed in section6 2 1 yields a normalized time period t of oscillation cycle as 1 s t y 3 93 treating this time period to be constant for each oscillation or shedding cycle the flow field is analyzed for three consecutive cycles that amounts to a total normalized time of 11 8 fig 11b illustrates the three successive cycles of vortex shedding considered to analyze the wake mode the value of mean lift for the first second and third cycles of cylinder oscillation are 0 0726 0 2185 and 0 0422 respectively in each cycle the lift is unbalanced underscoring that the wake vortex mode departs from the basic karman mode and turns asymmetric in fig 11c normalized time instants at which the flow field has been studied for each cycle are marked for the first cycle the distribution of instantaneous vorticity at different time instants is illustrated via figs 12a through 12f while figs 12g through 12l depict the variation of instantaneous pressure on the cylinder surface as apparent from fig 12b corresponding to t 4 t 20 a clockwise cw rotating vortex sheds from the upper rear surface of the cylinder fig 12h suggests that the magnitude of c p at this instant is higher along edge cd than along edge bc this implies that vortex shedding occurs from the high pressure side along the rear surface of the cylinder also see kumar et al 2018a towards the end of the cycle i e at t 16 t 20 fig 12e a counterclockwise ccw vortex sheds from the high pressure surface here lower rear surface implying that the wake vortex mode for the first cycle is 2s however it may be noted that the size and strength of the shed vortices differ and hence the wake mode is not truly 2s but asymmetric 2s a very unique kind of vortex shedding i e shedding from only a particular side of the oscillator is noted in the second cycle fig 13 the implication is that the viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence is associated with the phenomenon of partial suppression of vortex shedding in this entire cycle only a single clockwise rotating vortex sheds from the upper rear surface of the oscillator the shedding occurs at some instant between t 4 t 20 and t 8 t 20 in the remaining of the cycle vortices from the lower rear surface while remain attached to the oscillator are seen to grow in size the one sided vortex shedding recurs in the third cycle shown in fig 14 this shedding however differs appreciably from its counterpart in the second cycle a pair of like sign here counterclockwise vortices that forms at the lower rear part of the oscillator towards the end of the second cycle sheds in the third cycle we are unaware of prior reporting of such one sided wake mode of vortex formation in the literature the vortex cores are clearly discernible from fig 14d through 14f this new mode of one sided shedding is denoted by the symbol s where two vortex cores are identified within the same envelope of vorticity this vortex pair sheds as a unit at t t post shedding the vortices combine and finally reduce to a single vortex that propagate downstream the mean surface pressure computed over sufficiently long time and illustrated in fig 15a reveals that c p along the upper and lower surfaces of the oscillator is symmetric as discussed previously the value of mean lift is small but non zero 0 0158 this is an interesting case where a non zero mean lift is associated with symmetric distribution of c p fig 15b c and d plot the distribution of mean surface pressure for three successive cycles of cylinder oscillation discussed above as already discussed the surface pressure for each cycle is asymmetric about the base point the wake mode at u 4 2 u 4 2 marks the transition from ib to lb and hence the initiation of high amplitude lb as already discussed in section6 2 1 the value of mean normalized response 0 0124 is a positive quantity implying that in an oscillation cycle the oscillator resides on the positive y side for a higher duration of time than in the negative y side the flow is periodic as evidenced from the time history of c l fig 16a fig 16a clearly demonstrates that the mean lift differs from zero as expected c l is a positive quantity similar to mean response it may also be noted that fig 16b suggests for in phase relationship between y and c l at u 4 2 and its value is 0 2824 since the mean lift is a positive quantity the value of c p along the lower half surface of the cylinder exceeds the value of c p along the upper half surface i e the upper half of the cylinder represents the suction side and the lower half the pressure side this asymmetry in c p indicates that in an oscillation cycle the number of vortices shed from the upper and lower rear surfaces must be different and hence symmetry of flow will break if will be shown below that two vortices are shed from the lower or pressure surface in contrast to one from the suction or upper rear surface a complete cycle of y and c l is illustrated in fig 16b certain time instants at which the flow and instantaneous surface pressure are analyzed are marked fig 16c plots the time averaged surface pressure distribution the c d c l lissajou diagram discussed in section6 2 1 is shown here again for reference in consistency with the existence of non zero mean lift the lissajou diagram displays asymmetry the mean surface pressure along the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder becomes asymmetric between the leading and trailing edges apart from this asymmetry certain noteworthy deviations in c p are modification of the pressure profile near the leading edge and striking shift of the locations of the maximum and minimum pressure the upper shoulder alone turns the point of minimum c p and the maximum pressure point shifts downward from the leading edge for a cycle of complete oscillation fig 16d through fig 16i depict the development of the wake vortices at t 0 the cylinder is located little above the mean position signified by y 0 and it executes downward motion during this motion the cylinder center crosses the mean position before t t 22 is reached and at t t 22 the displacement of the cylinder center is 0 0695 d both of the vortices at the rear of the oscillator are attached with the upper one about to shed the instantaneous surface pressure presented in fig 16j indicates that the maximum pressure occurs at a location along the lower edge ab well ahead of the lower shoulder as is well known the flow is attached in the forward part of a bluff body owing to favorable pressure gradient and vortex shedding occurs from its rear part here edges bc and cd the surface pressure along cd exceeds the one along bc since shedding occurs from the high pressure side of the body kumar et al 2018a the corresponding vortex here clockwise vortex on the upper edge will shed first at t 5 t 22 fig 16e the cylinder almost attains its lowest position and the clockwise vortex denoted by s sheds from the upper rear surface cd pressure along this edge still exceeds the pressure along bc at t 9 t 22 the cylinder executes upward translation and as apparent from fig 16l the surface pressure distribution undergoes noticeable alterations c p along bc now dominates over c p along cd and consequently the counterclockwise vortex at the bottom rear becomes stronger than the upper clockwise vortex fig 16f at approximately half the oscillation cycle i e at t t 13 a reversal of flow and surface pressure is noted interestingly the ccw vortex though attached appears about to split into a pair of like sign vortices the vortex splitting becomes quite apparent at a later time instant t 17 t 22 fig 16h and one cw and two ccw vortices are discernible from fig 16n it is worth noting that at the instant of vortex splitting i e t 17 t 22 the base point c reduces to the point of minimum pressure and difference of pressure between the leading edge a and trailing edge c becomes maximum at the end of the cycle flow conditions corresponding to t 0 are recovered in the entire oscillation cycle a total of three vortices one cw vortex from top and two ccw vortices from the bottom are shed implying that the wake vortex mode is p s in fig 16o the isolated vortex s and vortex pair p have been labeled this figure also shows the p s vortices formed during the previous cycle of oscillation by analyzing the p s vortices for two consecutive cycles it is found that the vortex pair p of opposite signed vortices invariably forms above the wake centerline whereas the s contributor of p s forms below the wake centerline the differences in surface pressure distribution at t 5 t 22 and 17 t 22 can be explained by analyzing the cylinder motion for a complete cycle of transverse oscillations fig 16b plots the variation of cylinder velocity or y by virtue of the no slip condition cylinder velocity in turn represents the velocity of all the fluid particles adhering to the fluid solid interface fig 16b suggests that the velocity is non zero at t 5 t 22 while it is approximately zero at t 17 t 22 because of attainment of maximum displacement considering the principle of bernoulli the instance of non zero v velocity will lead to lower value of surface pressure than the instance of zero v velocity therefore at t 17 t 22 concentration of vorticity at the shedding side will be more than the one at t 5 t 22 this explains the shedding of a single vortex in the first half cycle and shedding of a pair of vortices in the next half cycle the vortex synchronization map of williamson and roshko 1988 illustrated in fig 3a of their paper indicates that the least value of y m a x d for the occurrence of p s mode is of the order of unity for low r e williamson and roshko 1988 found that the p s mode appears at low amplitude see figure 17a of williamson and roshko 1988 for r e 275 u 6 and y m a x 0 5 d later studies concerning forced and free vibrations of a circular oscillator at low r e meneghini and bearman 1995 singh and mittal 2005 also resolved the p s mode at lower values of normalized response meneghini and bearman 1995 for flow past a circular cylinder executing forced vibrations resolved the p s mode at r e 200 for which y m a x d 0 6 later singh and mittal 2005 identified the p s mode for viv of a circular cylinder at r e 325 and above at r e 325 the value of the normalized transverse response was of the order of 0 62 in the present work concerning y only viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence the p s mode is identified at even lower value of response y m a x 0 5362 d why does the p s mode form only when u 4 2 and not at u 3 5 while c l 0 in both cases the p s mode interestingly forms only at a sole u value of 4 2 marking ib lb transition the formation of this asymmetric mode can be explained with respect to the variation of mean lift fig 10 the value of c l 0 2824 at u 4 2 differs strikingly from its value 0 at other u except u 3 5 since c l is a function of surface pressure and velocity gradient a high value of unbalanced mean lift implies considerable asymmetry in c p along the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder it also suggests that velocities of the oscillator during vortex shedding from the top and bottom rear surfaces are noticeably different already explained relative to fig 16b we may therefore conclude that for other u values because of zero or negligible value of mean lift the surface pressure along the upper and lower surface is symmetric or mildly asymmetric hence the velocity of the cylinder at the instants of shedding from the upper and lower surfaces is of comparable magnitude this prevents the generation of any noticeable asymmetry in flow at majority of the u values at u 3 5 the mean lift is slightly negative 0 0158 and yet this small unbalanced lift induces asymmetry in the flow this asymmetry however differs from p s the value of maximum normalized response at this reduced speed is 0 1680 following the available literature the p s mode forms at a normalized response of 0 5 and above it appears that owing to low amplitude viv at u 3 5 the p s mode does not form 6 2 4 the vortex force and vortex phase at u 3 5 and 4 2 the phase relationship between c v o r t e x and y d is investigated for instances with asymmetric wake modes i e u 3 5 and 4 2 for u 3 5 fig 17 depicts the temporal variation of vortex force as well as cylinder response for three successive cycles of lift these cycles are identical to those fig 11 considered to analyze the wake mode the phase between the vortex force and displacement for the first second and third cycles are 5 43 18 09 and 5 43 respectively thus the time traces are roughly in phase the average value of the vortex force for u 3 5 equals 0 0010 over a complete cycle of total lift force see fig 16b for u 4 2 fig 18a illustrates the dimensional acceleration of the cylinder while fig 18b and c respectively depict the time variation of potential and vortex forces unlike the potential force a non zero value of mean vortex force is quite apparent from fig 18c the total lift force its vortex component and the response are plotted in fig 18d similar to u 3 5 the vortex force and response for u 4 2 also maintain an approximate in phase relationship however the time averaged value of vortex force 0 2767 for u 4 2 is significantly higher than its counterpart for u 3 5 therefore even though the wake modes for u 3 5 and 4 2 differ drastically the alteration of wake mode with u is not reflected by the phase between the vortex force and response however the mean value of vortex force in these two cases exhibit noticeable difference 6 3 comparison of sdof viv characteristics of circular square and diamond cylinders the circular and square cylinders are the most studied oscillator shapes and under identical conditions display much contrasting viv features some such features for the circular and square oscillators at zero incidence were discussed in sen and mittal 2011 a comparative account of the key viv characteristics such as response lock in and fluid loading of circular and inclined square cylinders is provided below for u 1 10 for each case m 10 ζ 0 r e 100 b 0 05 and the oscillators execute transverse only translations galloping of a square cylinder of arbitrary m is induced for u 10 li et al 2019 and r e 150 or higher barrero gil et al 2009 joly et al 2012 sen and mittal 2015 for the range of input parameters considered here motion of the square cylinder is therefore purely viv the dimension d of each oscillator along the horizontal and vertical axes of symmetry is same fig 19 compares the transverse response of all three oscillator shapes to the best of the knowledge of the authors the response of an m 10 square cylinder executing undamped sdof viv at r e 100 is being presented perhaps for the first time the response curve of individual oscillators are remarkably different in construction the branching is simple for the square oscillator at zero incidence and gets complex for the circular and diamond section cylinders in the former the response is comprised of dsi lb and dsii the absence of ib for a square cylinder viv at low r e has been recently discussed in kumar et al 2018b for the circular and diamond cylinders the response comprises of dsi ib lb and dsii it may be noted that the extent of ib is the largest for the diamond cylinder with one key response branch absent the smallest extent of lock in and smallest value of maximum response is associated with the square cylinder at zero incidence a rotation of the square cylinder by 45 alters the response to such extent that the response undergoes a significant departure relative to its counterpart at zero incidence the response for 45 configuration is somewhat closer to the response of a circular cylinder the lb of circular cylinder is composed of periodic and quasi periodic components interestingly no quasi periodic component exists in the lb of square and diamond cylinders detailed comparison of the branching maximum response and periodic quasi periodic behavior is presented in table7 fig 19 provides a useful insight on the identification of lb dsii transition from response curve alone it appears that such a transition from lock in to lock out is obvious in response curve for oscillators with smooth contours variable location of separation points and not discernible for oscillators containing sharp corners and straight edges fixed location of separation points the flow past an oscillator in dsii is equivalent to flow around a stationary cylinder thus at the end of lock in lb the flow tends to reduce to the flow past a fixed cylinder consequently the separation angle also tends to decrease and be same as for the fixed cylinder for a circular cylinder with smooth contour the separation location is movable and hence it self adjusts with the lower value pertaining to dsii this self adjustment is reflected by the discontinuity in the response curve in contrast for the square cylinders the separation angle is fixed irrespective of response branch and hence non adjustable when a transition from lb to dsii takes place constancy of separation angle for such cylinders appears to be the reason for a continuous y m a x u curve in the neighborhood of lb dsii transition among the three cylinder shapes considered the largest separation angle measured form the base point is associated with the diamond cylinder whereas for the square cylinder at zero incidence value of the separation angle is the smallest however because of the presence of the gradually narrowing afterbody for the diamond and circular cylinders the streamlines close to their lateral boundaries are less deflected relative to the wake centerline in contrast for the square cylinder at zero incidence an afterbody does not exist and the streamlines diverge more relative to the wake centerline therefore width of the wake is largest for the square cylinder at zero incidence and because of narrowest afterbody and farthest separation point about base point width of wake of the diamond section cylinder is the smallest therefore interaction between the separated shear layers rows of karman vortex street is maximum for the diamond cylinder and minimum for the square cylinder at zero incidence lesser interaction between shear layers is indicative of weaker vortex shedding and hence lower values of the vortex shedding frequency luo et al 1994 and vice versa since the lift force is inherent to the vortex shedding phenomenon it is thus obvious that the lift will be largest for the diamond cylinder and smallest for the square cylinder in view of the rigid body displacement equation eq 5 we may therefore conjecture that the higher lift of a diamond cylinder is responsible for its high amplitude oscillations and conversely weaker lift for its zero incidence counterpart leads to smaller response fig 20a illustrates the variation of s t y with u for each cylinder while the variation of frequency ratio is depicted via fig 20b irrespective of the oscillator contour the branching of response is very obvious from either of these plots in view of the afterbody effect the diamond section cylinder possesses the largest value of vortex shedding frequency while the smallest vortex shedding frequency relates to the square cylinder at zero incidence the onset and termination of synchronization are marked via abrupt jump in frequency and attainment of least value of frequency the diamond oscillator with high s t y since s t c l s t y is susceptible to quick amplification in frequency and hence the lock in initiates at a lower u in contrast a delayed onset of lock in is noted for the square cylinder at zero incidence the viv of this cylinder being weak the minimum value of s t y is attained within a short interval of u leading to the narrowest extent of lock in the diamond cylinder in contrast executes strong viv and its s t y drops to the minimum after sufficiently delayed u with respect to the onset of lock in this explains the largest regime of lock in for the diamond cylinder the shedding frequency of a circular cylinder being little smaller than its diamond counterpart see table4 for stationary vortex shedding frequency s t 0 the extent of lock in of a circular cylinder is smaller than the diamond cylinder and wider than that of a square cylinder at zero incidence the mass ratio of the circular cylinder square cylinder at zero and 45 incidences is expressed as the 4 m π ρ d 2 m ρ d 2 and 2 m ρ d 2 ratio respectively if the mass ratio is held constant the value of oscillator mass is therefore largest for the square cylinder at zero incidence and smallest for the diamond cylinder for a given oscillator increasing m amounts to increasing m sen and mittal 2015 in context of viv of a square cylinder at zero incidence found that the maximum response decays with increasing m fig 4a of their paper for increasing r e i e with increasing m in the current investigation involving oscillators of same m but varying shapes identical relationship between m and maximum y is found to exist from here it appears that the magnitude of maximum response is more a function of oscillator mass than the shape of the oscillator the comparison of vortex induced drag and lift forces is presented in fig 21a and b respectively when held stationary the drag is maximum for the diamond cylinder and minimum for the circular one table4 as expected the same trend holds true for the regimes of decoherence i e dsi and dsii but the trend changes partially in the higher amplitude lower branch for u 7 in the lb c d of a circular cylinder exceeds the one from a square cylinder at zero incidence in the periodic lb c d of the circular cylinder decays linearly irrespective of cross section the mean drag is constant in dsi in the dsii the mean drag of both the square cylinders decays slowly for stationary cylinders table4 indicates that the value of c l r m s of the diamond section cylinder is the largest followed by the circular and square cylinder at zero incidence respectively this order deems valid even in the dsi and dsii regimes of the freely vibrating cylinders and also for the maximum value of c l r m s for each cross section table8 lists the maximum values of mean drag and r m s lift along with the associated reduced speed values also compared in this table are the u marking the onset and closure of lock in 7 conclusions based on stabilized space time finite element computations in two dimensions undamped flow induced vibrations of a rigid diamond cylinder of m 10 are investigated at r e 100 for reduced speed varying from 1 to 12 the oscillator executes single degree of freedom translations across the flow the diamond cylinder that is nothing but a square cylinder at 45 incidence contains straight edges and sharp corners yet displays flow and vibration features that diverge appreciably from those of the square cylinder at zero incidence its response is composed of all four of the basic constituent branches i e dsi ib lb and dsii listed by navrose et al 2014 in context of viv of circular elliptic cylinder at low r e in case of a square cylinder at zero incidence the initial branch does not exist however the response of diamond and circular cylinders differ in lb sub branching while the lb is fully periodic for the diamond oscillator existence of an additional quasi periodic lb component for a circular cylinder stretches the extent of its lb longer than that of the diamond oscillator the initial branch of the diamond cylinder commences earlier and is much stronger than its counterpart for a circular cylinder owing to the presence of gradually narrowing afterbody in a diamond cylinder interaction between its separated shear layers is much stronger than that of a square cylinder having no afterbody at all the early settling of lock in and strong vortex shedding high s t for a diamond cylinder in ib appears to be responsible for its highly diverse wake modes than a circular or zero incidence square cylinder at an r e as low as 100 strong vortex shedding from the vibrating diamond cylinder generates higher lift than its square counterpart this explains the overwhelming dominance the response of a diamond oscillator maintains over a square oscillator the dominance of shedding frequency of the diamond cylinder is responsible for its quicker at low u attainment of nearly equal f n value and delayed at high u attainment of stationary shedding frequency s t 0 thus the range of lock in is largest for the diamond cylinder for circular square and diamond cylinders having identical characteristic dimension and mass ratio the oscillator mass is largest for the square cylinder and smallest for the diamond cylinder the attainment of maximum and minimum response by the diamond cylinder and square cylinder respectively indicates that oscillator mass is more an influencing parameter for response than oscillator shape the oneness of s t y and s t c l over the entire range of u underscores the pure vortex induced motion of the diamond cylinder a close correspondence between the relative magnitude of response in its component branches and closeness of oscillation shedding frequency to f n is identified from the s t u relationship one can roughly estimate the relative branchwise response independent of the true y u variation owing to strong vortex shedding and consequent lift the magnitude of normalized peak response of the diamond cylinder closely approaches 0 6 and surpasses the peak response of a circular cylinder the maximum response is attained at u 5 at which s t c l s t y 0 1983 0 2 f n the response appears to closely influence the location of the maximum pressure point the value of the maximum pressure and base pressure the shift of location of the maximum pressure from the leading edge forward stagnation point becomes prominent first at u 4 2 marking the onset of lb this divergence continues at least up to u 5 9 the mismatch of forward stagnation and maximum pressure points is found to be associated with y m a x d being equal to or exceeding 0 5 this is a high drag regime where difference between the maximum pressure and base pressure is very high a contrasting feature of drag of the diamond cylinder is that its least value is attained in the ib for such instances the base pressure reduces to the minimum surface pressure and hence a favorable pressure gradient persists in the base region this gradient aids in recovery of pressure at the base and lowers the drag deviation of the value of mean lift from zero is noted for two discrete u values of 3 5 and 4 2 at u 3 5 the deviation is small while it is significant at u 4 2 at u 3 5 the response is low and flow repeats in three successive cycles each of these cycles are linked to asymmetry in wake mode formation in the first cycle a pair of vortices of unequal size and strength are shed this wake mode is designated as asymmetric 2s mode an one sided mode of vortex formation from the top rear surface of the cylinder is noted in the second cycle in the third cycle one sided shedding occurs from the lower surface such that a pair of like sign vortex cores coexist within same vorticity envelope highly asymmetric distribution of mean surface pressure at u 4 2 indicates strong asymmetry in wake formation the wake mode is identified as p s that forms in high amplitude motion the vortex force for u 3 5 as well as 4 2 is roughly in phase with response indicating no alteration in phase

22128,there have been only a few investigations lately to analyze the flow induced vibrations of a diamond cylinder i e a square cylinder inclined at 45 to the free stream at low and high reynolds numbers r e however for transverse vortex induced motions of diamond cylinders at low r e features of response branching mean surface pressure wake modes and fluid loading are less explored we investigate numerically at r e 100 undamped hydroelastic vortex induced vibrations of a diamond cylinder over a well resolved u range of 1 to 12 the order of magnitude of the maximum response as well as branching of response of the diamond oscillator are analogous to those of the circular cylinder and depart considerably from the ones of a square cylinder at zero incidence interestingly the mean lift from this nominally symmetric cross section deviates from zero at u values of 3 5 and 4 2 corresponding to the quasi periodic initial branch and periodic lower branch respectively at u 3 5 corresponding to low amplitude oscillations three distinct asymmetric wake modes are identified asymmetric 2s and two one sided modes of different nature the well known asymmetric p s mode is identified at u 4 2 relating to high amplitude oscillations keywords stabilized finite element diamond cylinder transverse viv branching of response one sided wake mode comparison of viv 1 introduction the phenomenon of alternate vortex shedding from a bluff obstacle is unsteady in nature and continues to alter the instantaneous pressure on the body surface this induces the time varying lift force across the main flow for a flexibly mounted object the unsteady lift becomes the driving force leading to periodic or non periodic motion of the object under such circumstances the induced translations of the body represent vortex induced vibrations viv viv is the most commonly encountered fluid structure interactions fsi problem the most important quantities of interest in the study of viv are the oscillator response and oscillation frequency in order to prevent or minimize structural failure it is of prime importance to control viv a need therefore arises to have prior information on the response and frequency data for viv of a given oscillator shape cross section while viv of a circular cylinder has been studied extensively in low and high reynolds number r e regimes much less efforts have been put forward to analyze the viv of a square cylinder at zero incidence the available studies for instance sen and mittal 2011 at low r e clearly reveal qualitative as well as quantitative differences between viv of these oscillator shapes a square cylinder at 45 incidence also referred to as diamond cylinder is a symmetric shape that when held stationary exhibit unforeseen and completely distinctive steady flow features kumar et al 2018c 2019 at very low reynolds numbers in the regime of low r e unsteady flow around stationary objects the features of fluid forcing for a square cylinder at 0 and 45 incidences reveal stark contrast sohankar et al 1998 for 45 r e 200 figure 6b of sohankar et al 1998 suggests that the mean drag c d of a diamond cylinder rises with r e whereas for the square cylinder at zero incidence it initially decays and then rises while the r m s lift c l r m s of both cylinders exhibit identical trend with r e figure 6c of sohankar et al 1998 its magnitude for the diamond cylinder dominates considerably over those of the cylinder at zero incidence for viv under identical input conditions one therefore expects appreciable deviations in fluid loading as well as response characteristics of these oscillator shapes the study of viv amounts to extracting the time variation of the mutual feedback between the oscillator or solid medium and the fluid medium experimental and computational approaches are the two primary ways of handling a viv problem in the present effort a stabilized space time finite element solver tezduyar et al 1992a b c based on partitioned or staggered approach is employed in two dimensions in partitioned approach at each time step the flow and rigid body motion are solved separately in absence of a detailed and fundamental study on transversely only viv of a diamond cylinder the present study numerically explores the problem at r e 100 let the cross stream diagonal d of the diamond section cylinder fig 2a represents its characteristic length the controlling non dimensional structural and flow parameters governing viv of a diamond cylinder are structuralparameters i mass ratio or non dimensional mass or relative density of the oscillator m is the ratio of oscillator mass per unit length m to mass of displaced fluid if ρ is the density of fluid then m 2 m ρ d 2 ii reduced speed u is the free stream speed u normalized by the natural or structural frequency f n of the oscillator as well as characteristic dimension i e u u f n d 1 f n where f n is the reduced natural frequency of the oscillator iii damping ratio or coefficient of structural damping ζ is expressed as c 2 k m where c and k respectively stand for the damping and stiffness of the oscillator system the undamped viv corresponds to ζ 0 flowparameter iv reynolds number of flow is based on free stream speed and characteristic length scale i e r e u d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the vibration characteristics are generally studied by one of the following approaches i coupling r e and u by an inverse relationship and ii varying u independent of r e following the second approach the quantities m ζ and r e are held constant in the present analysis while u is allowed to vary the parameter set used for computations is m 10 ζ 0 r e 100 and u 1 12 an account of previous investigations concerning the flow around freely vibrating rigid square cylinders at zero and other angles of incidence is provided below thereafter a brief discussion highlighting the primary objectives of the current study marks the closure of introduction in the discussion that follows reference is frequently made of wake modes the concept of wake mode of vortex formation was introduced by williamson and roshko 1988 they performed extensive forced vibration experiments on a circular cylinder in a towing tank over 300 r e 1000 the upper limit of oscillation amplitude across the flow was as high as five times the diameter of the circular cylinder they presented a vortex synchronization map in the amplitude reduced speed wavelength plane that depicts the possible wake modes and their demarcating boundaries the vortices that are shed in an oscillation cycle constitute the wake mode of vortex formation the type of wake mode relies on oscillation amplitude as well as reduced speed the most common wake modes are 2s c 2s p s 2p 2p 2s etc here s stands for a single vortex p for a vortex pair and c denotes coalescence of vortices later morse and williamson 2009 refined the vortex map further with inclusion of newly identified 2p o mode where o stands for overlap 1 1 flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder at zero incidence vortex induced vibrations of a square cylinder at a low r e 100 were perhaps studied for the first time by su et al 2007 the mass ratio of the oscillator was 10 and it executed undamped transverse only viv a stabilized finite element formulation was employed to model the viv problem results were presented for maximum response beside time traces of response and lift forces an early investigation on vortex induced motion of a square cylinder is due to amandolese and hemon 2010 they performed aeroelastic experiments for transverse only motion at high r e the key parameters used by amandolese and hemon 2010 are r e 2000 8000 m 905 and ζ 0 000828 0 000014 based on stabilized finite element computations sen and mittal 2011 presented limited results for transverse displacement in the galloping branch for r e 200 250 of response the mass ratio of the square cylinder was 10 and its motions were undamped by employing a finite element formulation he et al 2012 investigated the transverse only viv of a square cylinder at a sole reynolds number of 250 the key input parameters for their study were m 20 ζ 0 0037 f n 0 025 and u 6 20 40 and 80 for u 6 40 and 80 the wake mode was 2s the mode at u 20 deviated from 2s by employing a quasi steady model and also by performing direct numerical simulation of the equations of motion joly et al 2012 investigated the onset of galloping of a rigid square cylinder they concluded that galloping of a square cylinder occurs at a reynolds number exceeding 140 under undamped condition two degrees of freedom transverseand in line or 2 dof free hydroelastic vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 was numerically studied by sen and mittal 2011 for r e 60 250 an inverse relationship f n 14 39 r e linking the reduced natural frequency and reynolds number was used for the computations in the initial and lower branches of response they identified the 2s and c 2s modes they mistakenly interpreted the 2p 2s mode in the galloping regime as 2p this was later rectified in sen and mittal 2015 the 2 dof oscillations of an isolated square cylinder was subsequently studied by he et al 2012 based on numerical experiments they presented results using identical input parameter set as well as f n 14 39 r e relationship employed by sen and mittal 2011 they however resolved only the 2s mode of vortex formation sen and mittal 2015 extended their previous work sen and mittal 2011 to understand the link of viv and galloping with mass ratio they demonstrated that motion of the cylinder is purely viv for m 1 while for m 5 the motion is viv at low r e and galloping at high r e the wake modes resolved are 2s c 2s unstable 2s and 2p 2s the study by sen and mittal 2015 explored the dependence of wake mode structure on the magnitude of transverse response the 2p 2s mode was shown to form only above a minimum value of normalized transverse response of 0 7 further analysis of the study by sen and mittal 2015 was later performed by sen and mittal 2016 for each r e and m sen and mittal 2016 noted symmetry of drag lift lissajou diagrams about the zero lift line irrespective of the flow being periodic or quasi periodic based on this observation they concluded that the wake modes of a vibrating square cylinder at low r e must be symmetric such as 2s c 2s 2p or 2p 2s formation of asymmetric modes such as p s was thus ruled out since synchronization between transverse oscillation and vortex shedding in the galloping branch was different from 1 2 sen and mittal 2016 argued that a 2p mode cannot form in the wake of a square cylinder at zero incidence it was also shown that the unstable 2s or 3 2s and 2p 2s modes appear in the quasi periodic and periodic galloping branches respectively synchronization in these sub branches is away from and very close to 1 3 respectively through linear stability analysis as well as finite volume computations li et al 2019 investigated the mechanism leading to transverse galloping of a square cylinder for r e 200 according to them galloping does not commence below a reduced speed of 10 for r e 150 and u 40 li et al 2019 found that the cylinder motion is viv and devoid of galloping as long as the value of m is smaller than 4 for r e 250 sourav and sen 2019 recently determined the value of transition mass ratio at which the motion of an undamped square cylinder alters from viv only to one with combined viv and galloping via direct computations they found that the transition occurs at m 3 4 1 2 flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder at incidence transverse only flow induced vibrations of inclined square cylinders of low m at high r e was experimentally investigated by nemes et al 2012 and zhao et al 2014 for m 2 2 and angles of incidence between 0 and 45 nemes et al 2012 presented results for r e 2500 12500 the wake mode resolved by them for the zero incidence is 2s for an asymmetric configuration with 20 incidence the wake mode is p s at low u and 2p at relatively higher u for 45 incidence the motion is purely viv and wake modes are 2s and 2p detailed numerical results for free undamped vibrations of inclined square cylinders simultaneously along and across the flow at r e 100 were presented by zhao et al 2013 the incidence angles considered were 0 22 5 and 45 and mass ratio of the oscillator was 3 the reduced speed was varied over a wide range of 1 to 30 this study demonstrates an essential interdependence between the angle of attack and wake mode for the 0 configuration the wake mode was 2s for all u for 22 5 incidence two regimes of lock in were found at low and high u respectively the wake mode in the first regime was 2s and it was 2p in the second regime bistable vibrations were noted in the lock in regime for the 45 angle of attack during lock in a continuous switching between p s and 2p modes was found outside synchronization the mode was 2s through spectral element computations at r e 200 leontini and thompson 2013 investigated the free transverse vibrations of a diamond cylinder of m 2 for a u range of 3 to 16 they investigated the response frequency and wake modes for diamond cylinders with all corners pointed and the upper and lower corners rounded to various degrees the effects of rounding the cylinder shoulders on the wake modes were explored the rounding represented by normalized radius r c was progressively increased from 0 for sharp corners to 0 2 and results were compared with those of a circular cylinder for r c 0 15 results display close proximity to those of a circular cylinder for r c 0 15 leontini and thompson 2013 resolved the asymmetric p s mode based on the values of u and r c they classified the flow into six distinct regimes zhao et al 2014 conducted water channel experiments at high r e for three orientations same as considered by nemes et al 2012 of the transversely vibrating square cylinder symmetric configurations of 0 and 45 and an asymmetric configuration of 20 for 0 incidence they varied u from 3 to 25 and the motion was found to be dominated by transverse galloping a detailed account of synchronization type was presented and they demonstrated that only odd synchronization occurs in the galloping branch the absence of even synchronization was explained as the outcome of absence of unbalanced fluid loading to trigger galloping the wake mode identified was n 2s corresponding to 1 n synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding where n 1 3 and 5 the n 2s mode was later resolved by li et al 2019 and sourav and sen 2019 etc the response of the cylinder at 20 incidence consists of the initial branch or ib upper branch or ub and higher amplitude branch or hb reported by nemes et al 2012 earlier a complex asymmetric vortex formation was observed in the upper branch ranging between u 4 and 8 approximately that involved vortex formation shedding and dissipation no nomenclature was used to designate the corresponding wake mode in the higher branch u 8 and above two consecutive cycles of 2s mode of different time period are shed in each oscillation cycle the resulting wake mode was designated as 2 2s by zhao et al 2014 five distinct synchronization regimes of high amplitude oscillations were identified for 3 u 7 5 when the angle of incidence was raised to 45 the wake modes in this high response regime are 2s and 2p the motion is purely viv but different from that of a circular cylinder based on two dimensional finite element simulations transverse flow induced vibrations of inclined square and rectangular cylinders each of m 2 4 were investigated by cui et al 2015 at high r e for the square cylinder the values of angle of incidence were 0 22 5 and 45 whereas for the rectangular cylinder the angles of incidence were 0 45 and 90 for each case the reynolds number was defined as r e 385 u this study indicates that the flow induced vibrations of the square cylinder are dominated by galloping for zero incidence and by viv for 22 5 and 45 angles of incidence respectively goncalves et al 2015 through experiments in an ocean basin at high r e 2000 30000 investigated the response of square diamond and circular cylinders of different aspect ratios 1 2 and 3 for each cylinder the mass ratio was fixed at 1 they reported that both the in line and transverse amplitudes of a diamond cylinder surpass those of a circular cylinder followed by a square cylinder they observed the presence of galloping for a square cylinder while it was absent for diamond and circular cylinders goncalves et al 2016 later performed experiments in an ocean basin to study the effects of rounded edges on flow induced vibrations of square and diamond cylinders for each geometry the cylinder aspect ratio was 2 they observed that rounding of the corners decrease the transverse vibration amplitude they found that response of diamond cylinders with rounded edges exceed those with sharp cornered diamond cylinders the observation that viv of the diamond cylinder is similar to that of the circular cylinder while galloping is executed by the square cylinder alone was later noted by goncalves et al 2017 even over a much wider range of r e stretching from 10000 to 150000 liu et al 2016 ramirez and fernandes 2016 and zhao et al 2018 investigated at high r e the flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder at incidence in a subsequent study zhao et al 2019 experimentally explored the effect of m on transverse only vibrations of a square cylinder at 0 20 and 45 incidences for 3 u 26 the mass ratio was varied from 2 64 to 15 and reynolds number from 1000 to 12300 for the diamond cylinder increased m affected the response significantly in desynchronization regime and slightly in viv regime tamimi et al 2019 experimentally investigated the energy harvesting potential of freely vibrating square and diamond cylinders of m 1 69 at high r e 1 3 objectives of the current work the dominant structural motion under the vortex induced forces occur across the flow because of this abundant research has been performed on transverse only motion of a circular cylinder at low r e anagnostopoulos 1989 by computations at r e 106 and 115 anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 by experiments for r e 90 150 bahmani and akbari 2010 by computations for r e 80 160 as well as high r e aeroelastic experiments of feng 1968 water channel experiments by khalak and williamson 1999 for r e 3500 10000 following the discussions in section1 2 it is clear that there exist only a handful of investigations dealing with the viv phenomenon of a rigid diamond cylinder at low r e pertaining to the two dimensional laminar vortex shedding regime as is seen from table1 vast majority of the available research relate to experimental investigations at r e of the order of 1 0 3 only a pair of computational studies i e leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 for light cylinders of m 2 and 3 respectively are available in the literature that deal with viv of a diamond cylinder at low r e while leontini and thompson 2013 focussed on transverse only viv at r e 200 zhao et al 2013 dealt with simultaneous in line and cross stream vibrations at r e 100 as is well known mass ratio of an oscillator strongly influences its vibration characteristics bahmani and akbari 2010 for y only motion sen and mittal 2015 for x y motion zhao et al 2019 for y only motion in the present work a mass ratio of 10 that is quite higher than those used by leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 is considered and flow viv analyzed for transverse only motion at r e 100 therefore the m r e degree of freedom input parameter set employed in the present study is being used for the first time and hence is expected to extract novel results for viv of a diamond cylinder this indeed happens for instance the response from the present study fig 5a differs substantially from the one presented by leontini and thompson 2013 see fig 4a of their paper for r c 0 0 and zhao et al 2013 see fig 9b of their paper the normalized maximum transverse response y m a x d obtained from all three of these studies are compared in fig 1 below a stark divergence both qualitative and quantitative of the predicted response with the ones reported by leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 is well evident from this figure the resolution of u employed by leontini and thompson 2013 as well as zhao et al 2013 is also not very fine the construction of response of leontini and thompson 2013 appears incomplete in the sense that the response curve starts at u 3 where the value of response exceeds 0 3 d thus finer details of the curve close to the onset of synchronization are missing because of this incompleteness and also because of relatively higher resolution of u close to the drop in y near u 12 details of response branching are unavailable in this study such details are also unavailable in the work of zhao et al 2013 the fluid forces are not analyzed either in leontini and thompson 2013 or in zhao et al 2013 while both of these studies resolved the asymmetric p s mode details of the formation mechanism of the asymmetric mode were not analyzed the associated instantaneous or time averaged surface pressure or time mean lift force was not analyzed as well in addition the primary objective of leontini and thompson 2013 was to investigate the effects of cylinder shoulder rounding on flow and hence they considered multiple cylinder shapes with fig 1 for response in the background incompleteness of the response curve of leontini and thompson 2013 for y only motion absence of analysis of response branching fluid loading surface pressure variation and detailed analysis of the asymmetric wake mode by them sum up to a considerable research gap in y only viv of a diamond cylinder at low r e this research gap forms the primary motivation behind the current numerical investigation the research questions that are dealt with in this work are framed as follows i what are the branches of diamond cylinder response what are the u values for inter branch transition is the transition from lower branch to the second regime of desynchronization smooth as in a square cylinder or abrupt as in a circular cylinder as apparent from fig 1 this transition is abrupt for low m near u 10 for zhao et al 2013 and u 12 for leontini and thompson 2013 however a much finer resolution of u around 10 and 12 respectively could provide finer details of this transition ii the regime of viv for a square cylinder of m 10 is periodic while for a circular cylinder of identical mass ratio viv is associated with both periodicity and quasi periodicity is the viv of a diamond cylinder of m 10 fully periodic or it exhibits both periodicity and quasi periodicity iii how does the fluid loading vary with reduced speed how does the mean surface pressure influence the fluid forcing iv the p s mode is known to exist in viv of a diamond cylinder leontini and thompson 2013 zhao et al 2013 do there exist other asymmetric wake modes how do the mean lift and surface pressure vary in conjunction with asymmetric wake modes v for m 10 and same characteristic dimension how do the vibration characteristics of circular square and diamond cylinders compare why is the range of lock in largest for the diamond cylinder and narrowest for the square cylinder why is the response of the diamond cylinder much larger than that of the square cylinder in order to address the aforementioned queries the partitioned stabilized space time finite element solver of tezduyar et al 1992a b c is employed and undamped viv of a diamond cylinder of m 10 analyzed at r e 100 over u 1 12 a much finer resolution of u than used by leontini and thompson 2013 and zhao et al 2013 is used the remaining of the article is organized as follows in section2 the governing equations for incompressible fluid flow and rigid body motion are reviewed the space time finite element formulation is discussed briefly in section3 definition of the problem and finite element mesh are depicted in section4 validation of the formulation as well as mesh convergence study are addressed in section5 the main results are presented and discussed in section6 section7 closes the article with few concluding remarks 2 the governing equations of motion 2 1 the incompressible flow equations let ω t represents a time varying spatial domain where t stands for dimensional time the boundary of ω t is denoted by γ t and is assumed to be piecewise smooth the spatial coordinates are denoted by x t and temporal domain by s using vector or coordinate free notations the navier stokes equations of motion governing incompressible fluid flow is read in stress divergence form as 1 ρ u t u u f σ 0 on ω t 0 s 2 u 0 on ω t 0 s in the above strong form of conservation equations u u v f and σ are the velocity body force per unit volume and cauchy stress tensor respectively in the present study f 0 both the essential dirichlet and natural neumann type

transverse motion of a diamond cylinder the transverse translation of a rigid body in a moving viscous fluid is governed by newton s second law of motion by modeling the oscillator via a spring mass damper system its equation of motion may be cast in dimensional form as 4 m d 2 y d t 2 c d y d t k y f y for 0 s where the structural quantities m c and k are defined in section1 ineq 4 y y t denotes instantaneous transverse displacement of the oscillator measured from a fixed reference instantaneous velocity and acceleration of the oscillator are denoted by d y d t and d 2 y d t 2 respectively f y t is the instantaneous transverse fluid loading on the oscillator for c 0 or undamped viv the rigid body equation equation 4 for a square cylinder at 45 incidence reduces to the following second order ode in time after normalization 5 d 2 y d t 2 2 π u 2 y c l m for 0 s u d where the normalized response and time are defined as y y d and t t u d respectively here c l t f y t 12 ρ u 2 d is the

equations where coupling between the fluid and solid media is due to the dynamic no slip boundary condition as well as vortex induced lift force at the fluid solid interface the instantaneous vortex induced fluid forces drag and lift respectively are computed as 6 c d t c l t 1 1 2 ρ u 2 d γ c y l h x h y d γ where h x and h y are the components of the surface traction vector h defined as h n σ the stress tensor at a point is decomposed in its inviscid and viscous components as σ p i μ u u t here p is pressure μ is dynamic viscosity of fluid i is identity tensor and n is the local unit vector normal to the cylinder boundary γ c y l following the lead of lighthill 1986 the total lift can be decomposed into potential force and vortex force components the potential force arises out of added mass effects whereas the vortex force relates to the convective transport of vorticity the instantaneous potential force f p o t e n t i a l t is computed as 7 f p o t e n t i a l t c a m d d 2 y d t 2 c a m d u 2 d d 2 y d t 2 where c a is the potential added mass coefficient and m d is the mass of displaced fluid for the diamond cylinder c a 0 76 table 2 3 of sarpkaya 2010 and m d 1 2 ρ d

c l t c p o t e n t i a l t 3 the finite element formulation a stabilized space time finite element formulation employing the same order of bilinear interpolation for velocity as well as pressure is used in this work while the interpolation functions are bilinear in space they are linear in time globally these interpolation functions are continuous in space but discontinuous in time details of the space time finite element formulation are available in tezduyar et al 1992a b the stabilization parameters not shown here are defined in tezduyar et al 1992c besides the equations of fluid flow the equation of motion of the oscillator given byeq 5 is also cast in the space time formulation in the way depicted in tezduyar et al 1992b and mittal 1992 4 problem statement at impending motion the diamond cylinder is located at the mid height of a rectangular computational domain of size 54 d 20 d fig 2a the associated cartesian coordinate system is stationary i e an inertial frame of reference is employed for the present analysis free stream inlet stress free exit slip lateral boundaries and no slip cylinder surface define the boundary conditions a blockage b of 0 05 corresponding to domain width of 20 d is used distances of the upstream and downstream boundaries from the origin of the coordinate system are 24 d and 30 d respectively a non dimensional time step size t t u d of 0 02 has been used for all the computations a non uniform multi block number of mesh blocks equals five structured finite element mesh consisting of bilinear quadrilateral elements is used for domain discretization fig 2b the mesh consists of 24149 nodes and 23780 quadrilateral elements the construction of the mesh is very similar to the mesh used by sen and mittal 2011 for a square cylinder at zero incidence keeping the outer rectangular boundary of the domain stationary the mesh is reconstructed at each time step and no slip boundary condition updated continuously the mesh moving scheme is discussed in sen and mittal 2011 in their earlier studies concerning 2 dof vibrations of a square cylinder at zero incidence sen and mittal 2011 2015 2016 coupled the reduced speed and reynolds number via f n 14 39 r e relationship considering the vortex shedding frequency of a fixed square cylinder at r e 100 as reference natural frequency this equation maps the natural frequency at an arbitrary r e and also leads to a single value of reduced speed for each reynolds number in the current set of computations involving diamond cylinder u is varied independent of r e in the context of experiments in a laboratory u is varied by changing u while the values of d and f n are kept constant the same effect on u in a numerical framework as in the present work is obtained by keeping u and d fixed while varying f n 5 validation of the formulation and mesh convergence 5 1 validation of the formulation the accuracy of the predicted results has been established via comparison of the predicted results with those available in the literature to this end flow around a stationary as well as freely vibrating inclined square cylinder has been considered at r e 100 for a stationary diamond cylinder yoon et al 2010 presented in fig 19 of their paper the variation of viscous and pressure drag coefficients with r e they used a blockage of 0 01 the value of mean drag c d obtained from this figure at r e 100 is 1 7200 using identical value of blockage the value of c d obtained from the present computations for the stationary diamond cylinder at r e 100 is 1 732 this value is in close agreement with the numerically obtained value of yoon et al 2010 stated above the validation of predicted results concerning undamped viv of square and diamond cylinders of m 3 each at r e 100 has recently been discussed by us in table 2 of sourav and sen 2019 for each case the value of reduced speed was fixed to 5 for the square configuration each study employed the same blockage of 0 025 for the diamond cylinder our computations were performed using b 0 025 the value of blockage considered by zhao et al 2013 was 0 0354 the table is reproduced below as table2 as apparent from this table our predicted normalized response for the square cylinder resides within the values predicted by zhao et al 2013 and jaiman et al 2016 in particular our predicted response is almost the average of response values reported by zhao et al 2013 and jaiman et al 2016 therefore a satisfactory agreement of the predicted response data exists for both of 0 and 45 incidences 5 2 convergence of results to establish mesh insensitivity of the computed results the flow and viv at r e 100 have been computed on several meshes of varying spatial resolution at a representative reduced speed value of 3 5 a multi block structured mesh comprising of five mesh blocks each of different resolution is used for the convergence test table3 lists the key mesh parameters for two meshes m1 and m2 such that the spatial resolution of m2 is about twice finer than that of m1 the parameter n t denotes the number of nodes on the cylinder surface the results of mesh convergence test summarized in table3 indicate that the characteristic viv quantities and fluid loading do not register any noticeable variation due to mesh refinement this observation ensures that the resolution of m1 is adequate to successfully resolve the flow and viv all the results presented in this paper is based on computations on mesh m1 having 24149 nodes and 23780 bilinear quadrilateral elements in this table s t denotes the strouhal number while s t y and s t c l stand for normalized oscillation and vortex shedding frequency respectively 6 results based on stabilized space time finite element computations in two dimensions results for undamped y only viv of a rigid diamond section cylinder of m 10 are presented at r e 100 over u 1 12 range a blockage of 0 05 is used for the computations at each time step the asymmetric flow matrix is solved using gmres solver saad and schultz 1986 and the rigid body ode expressed byeq 5 is solved via numerical integration the initial part of this section discusses the r e 100 flow around a stationary diamond cylinder detailed analysis of its flow induced motion follows thereafter 6 1 flow past a stationary diamond cylinder at r e 100 the r e 100 flow past a fixed square cylinder at 45 incidence belongs to the two dimensional periodic laminar vortex shedding regime the periodicity with single frequency is evident from the sinusoidal time traces of c d and c l illustrated via fig 3a and b respectively the power spectra of drag fig 3c lift fig 3d as well as the pair of loops in the c d c l lissajou diagram fig 3e ascertain that the drag coefficient oscillates with twice the frequency of lift as is generally observed for flow around bluff obstacles besides revealing the periodic nature of flow the c d c l phase portrait depicted via fig 3e implies that the mean lift is zero from this and also from the symmetry of the c d c l profile about c l 0 one expects that the mean surface pressure will be symmetric along the upper and lower halves of the cylinder between the stagnation points a and c fig 3f and vortex shedding will be anti symmetric fig 3f affirms the symmetry of mean surface pressure c p between the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder the value of c p is maximum at the forward stagnation point a and minimum at the shoulders b and d starting from the forward stagnation point the pressure gradient is favorable until the minimum pressure point is reached the pressure gradient is adverse along the majority of rear surface between the shoulders unlike a circular cylinder and a square cylinder at zero incidence c p of the diamond section cylinder drops at the base point c this pressure drop is indicative of favorable pressure gradient near the base region the flow field depicted in terms of instantaneous vorticity fig 3g and streamlines fig 3h suggests the formation of unsteady wake due to karman mode of vortex shedding the values of characteristic flow quantities are listed in the second row of table4 in this table c d p and c d v respectively denote the time mean pressure drag and viscous drag also listed in the third and fourth rows of this table are the corresponding values for a square cylinder at zero incidence and a circular cylinder obtained by jaiman et al 2015 compared to these later two cylinder shapes the aerodynamic loading and vortex shedding is visibly quite stronger for the square cylinder at 45 incidence it may be noted that the magnitude of c l r m s is an indicator of strength of vortex shedding the data for forward stagnation pressure c p 0 and base suction coefficient c p b implies that among the three cylinder shapes the largest value of forward stagnation pressure and least value of base pressure correspond to the diamond section cylinder thus difference of c p 0 and c p b becomes maximum or alternately pressure recovery becomes minimum for this cylinder this explains the large drag of the diamond section cylinder in this table and throughout the paper the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder is denoted by the symbol s t 0 the last column of table4 indicates that the location of separation is fixed for cylinders with sharp corners and movable for cylinders with smooth contours 6 2 vortex induced vibrations of a diamond cylinder at r e 100 a flexibly mounted isolated square cylinder at 45 incidence or an isolated circular cylinder executes vortex induced vibrations and the motion does never transit to high amplitude galloping zhao et al 2014 the experimental study by nemes et al 2012 reported similarities between the viv of a circular cylinder and viv of a square cylinder with 45 incidence at high r e the investigations by barrero gil et al 2009 joly et al 2012 and sen and mittal 2015 provided values of critical reynolds numbers below which a square cylinder at zero incidence executes pure viv and does not gallop as discussed in section1 1 the lowest value of critical r e for onset of its galloping motion reported in the literature is 140 joly et al 2012 thus at r e 100 the motion of the square cylinder at zero incidence is purely viv it is found here that the viv response with 45 incidence at r e 100 is closer to the response of a circular cylinder and appreciably remote from the square cylinder at zero incidence this subsection discusses for r e 100 the features of viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence and in section6 3 comparison of viv of the aforesaid three cylinder shapes are made under identical conditions 6 2 1 synchronization response and periodicity recently kumar et al 2018b proposed a simple method to identify the branches of viv response and associated transitions that they argue to be valid even for viv at high r e this method relies solely on the frequency characteristics of an oscillator and links the transition of response branch with change in slope of the oscillation frequency curve they illustrated the ability of the proposed method by considering at low reynolds numbers the two degrees of freedom viv of a square cylinder at zero incidence circular and thick elliptic cylinders and a circular cylinder truncated at the aft the value of m was 10 for each oscillator for the square cylinder kumar et al 2018b identified two transitions or slope changes of oscillation frequency while for the rest of the oscillators number of transitions was three as discussed below the total number of transitions for viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence equals three thus the number of response branches of a square cylinder is a function of the angle of incidence as the angle of incidence rises to 45 from 0 an additional branch appears and branching pattern follows the one with those with curved contours or combination of straight and curved contours as demonstrated by kumar et al 2018b the magnitude of maximum transverse response as well as extent of lock in of each of these oscillators overshadow the ones of a square oscillator at zero incidence existence of the additional transition is indicative of wider range of synchronization the implication is that the square cylinder with 45 incidence executes viv over a wider range of lock in than the square cylinder at zero incidence following the observations of kumar et al 2018b one expects the wider range of lock in for the diamond cylinder to lead to larger amplitude oscillations than its 0 counterpart as discussed below and illustrated later in fig 19 this indeed happens the response of a square cylinder inclined at 45 to the free stream is about twice the response when its angle of incidence equals 0 the relationship of cylinder oscillation frequency as well as vortex shedding frequency with the reduced speed is depicted via fig 4 for the entire range of u both of these frequencies mostly overlap further underscoring that the motion of the cylinder is purely viv in a galloping motion these quantities diverge such that s t c l s t y as apparent from the frequency curve the magnitude of frequency ranges from 0 16 to 0 27 the initial part of the s t u curve it may be noted that s t s t c l s t y for the entire discussion in section6 2 1 sees a very slow rise of s t with u and the value of s t is approximately equal to its stationary counterpart s t 0 0 1812 from the second row of table4 this regime of a smooth s t u variation extends up to u 3 3 and signifies the first regime of desynchronization or dsi see navrose et al 2014 for a detailed nomenclature of branching of response an abrupt jump discontinuity in s t at u 3 4 and associated change of slope of the frequency curve marks a transition from dsi to the initial branch or ib the s t attains its largest value of 0 27 and this attainment also marks the onset of synchronization or lock in thus the onset of lock in becomes synonymous with commencement of ib similar to circular elliptic cylinders and unlike a square cylinder at 0 for which the onset of lock in signifies beginning of lower branch or lb it may be noted from fig 4 that the value of s t c l at the onset of lock in is slightly larger than the value of s t y the ib terminates at u 4 1 followed by the second change of slope of s t the high amplitude lower branch commences at u 4 2 and is about three times wider than the ib as evident from fig 4 in the entire ib and majority of lb the cylinder vibrates with a frequency larger than s t 0 the reduced speed with the least value of s t marks the lock out as well as final third transition in the response this happens at u 6 8 and the lb transits to the second regime of desynchronization or dsii in dsii the value of vortex shedding frequency drops below the corresponding value of s t 0 the regime of lock in includes the whole of ib as well as lb or alternately it stretches from u 3 4 to u 6 8 the average value of s t 0 is generally considered to be 0 2 over a wide range of r e it is noted that this average s t 0 value is attained at u 5 in the lower branch which happens to be the midway of the range of lock in at u 5 each of f n 1 u s t y and s t c l converge very closely to 0 2 thus the value of frequency ratio f 0 9917 or ratio of oscillation and natural frequencies approximately equals unity the regime of reduced speed around u 5 is referred to as the regime of fundamental synchronization by williamson and roshko 1988 the frequency variation illustrated via fig 4 provides ample information on the relative degree of response in individual response branches as expected closer is the s t to f n higher is the magnitude of y and vice versa accordingly response in the ib is expected to be smaller than the response in the lb the intersection of the s t and f n curves in the lb indicates a non monotonic variation of y initially rising with u and then decreasing in the lb from fig 4 one can also predict the response in dsii to exceed the response in dsi analyzing the s t u variation one can therefore have an a priori estimate of the relative response even without knowing the true y u variation with the branching of response identified above fig 5 illustrates the variation of maximum response as a function of the reduced speed the first two transitions i e dsi ib and ib lb are hysteretic in nature while these transitions are well reflected via respective jumps in y m a x the response curve fails to predict the third or lb dsii transition occurring at u 6 9 this feature is similar to that of a square cylinder at zero incidence a possible explanation of this feature is provided in section6 3 for the dsi ib transition at u 3 4 the rise in response due to jump y m a x 0 095 d and for the ib lb transition at u 4 2 the rise is much higher i e y m a x 0 222 d overall the response is smallest in dsi 0 04 d and largest in the early lb the early phase of lock in is characterized by the initial branch where s t y and s t c l both differ from f n the ib segment of response curve assumes the shape of a hump that is characterized by quasi periodicity kumar et al 2018b towards the closure of ib the viv turns periodic the maximum y in ib y m a x 0 3138 d is attained in the periodic part of ib i e at u 4 1 at u 5 corresponding to the convergence of s t y s t c l and f n the normalized maximum response y m a x d attains its peak value of 0 5878 this value is little higher than the corresponding value of response of a circular cylinder and about thrice the response of a square cylinder when both of the latter execute undamped y only viv under identical conditions discussed in section6 3 the response at the inception of dsii is of appreciable magnitude and notably quite higher than its counterpart in dsi the high amplitude response in dsii might result from the already perturbed flow in the lock in regime as obvious from the inset of fig 5a the frequency ratio is also an equally effective parameter to reflect the branch transitions table5 summarize the key events occurring at transition points and also at the attainment of peak response the periodicity or non periodicity of flow cylinder motion as a function of u can be well explained relative to the c d c l lissajou diagrams presented as insets at selected u values of 3 5 4 4 2 5 5 2 and 6 8 except for the quasi periodic regime in ib the cylinder oscillates periodically with a single dominant frequency for the whole of dsi and dsii the flow or body motion is essentially periodic with single frequency in both y and c l quasi periodicity that is generally observed close to the lock in boundaries is illustrated here for a representative u value of 3 5 belonging to ib fig 5b depicts the time trace of response that reveals quasi periodicity the structure of c d c l lissajou diagram at u 3 5 is an outcome of existence of a large number of minor peaks in both c l fig 5d and c d power spectra of y fig 5c and c l fig 5e each contain three peaks corresponding to s t 0 2548 0 1709 and 0 0885 the ratio of the frequencies i e 0 2548 0 1709 1 4909 and 0 1709 0 0885 1 9311 are irrational numbers further ascertaining the quasi periodicity the periodicity is recovered at u 4 and it prevails for the remaining range of u at u 4 the phase plot assumes the shape of figure eight and lissajou diagram of this shape continues to prevail as u is increased till 4 7 during this interval of u the c l signal deviates from the basic sinusoidal profile but hardly contains any appreciable minor peak see fig 6a for u 4 7 for u 4 8 5 5 each phase plot consists of multiple cross over points and this is a clear indication of presence of multiple minor peaks in the c l signal a close observation of the lissajou diagrams of fig 5a reveals non zero value of mean lift for u 4 2 also see fig 10 this unbalanced lift is indicative of an asymmetric wake mode of vortex formation at this u when the lift is balanced i e mean lift is zero fig 3e the most common and basic wake mode of vortex formation is anti symmetric 2s fig 3g and h in section6 2 3 it is demonstrated that the asymmetric wake mode at u 4 2 is p s for other u considered the value of mean lift is mostly zero this generally suggests for existence of anti symmetric wake mode of vortex formation anti symmetric wake modes are noted for u 4 5 and 5 2 while wake formation for u 3 5 is quite complex these are discussed in section6 2 3 the mean value of response is zero for each u barring u 4 2 at u 4 2 the mean value of y d equals 0 0124 the positive value is indicative of upward bias of cylinder motion and is also consistent with the upward bias of lift in fig 5f the oscillation frequency and response are plotted together this figure clearly establishes the superiority of s t over y in identifying the overall branching of response salient features of frequency response as well as periodicity are listed in table6 as a function of u for selected values of u pertaining to the lb fig 6 plots the time trace and power spectrum of lift along with c d c l phase diagram at u 4 7 the lift signal is an outcome of superposition of a pair of sine curves of different amplitudes and the corresponding power spectrum reveals the existence of two peaks of noticeably different power fig 6a the dominant frequency peak arises due to the high amplitude sine curve corresponding to the major peaks in the lift signal no obvious minor peak appears in the lift signal due to the weaker frequency the c d c l phase diagram comprises of two closed loops with single cross over point and assumes the shape of figure eight as u is increased to 4 8 fig 6b minor peaks become evident in the time history of c l and accordingly the weaker peak in the power spectrum turns powerful the presence of minor peaks in the time history is associated with the appearance of a pair of small loops in the phase plot and the phase portrait looses the shape of figure eight with further rise of u to 4 9 fig 6c the smaller loops in the phase portrait expand as seen from fig 6d the lift at u 5 1 is composed of three sine waves and the number of zero c l or cross over points in the phase plot increases to three the arrangement of peaks in the c l signal gets altered at u 5 3 fig 6e post the phase jump that occurs at u 5 2 discussed in section6 2 2 the alteration in c l peaks is reflected in the translation of the zero c l crossings in the phase plot at u 5 6 fig 6f the c l is again composed of two sine waves and wave pattern as well as phase plot are virtually mirror images of that at u 4 7 6 2 2 the vortex induced forces the relationship of time averaged total drag and its pressure and viscous components with the reduced speed is depicted in fig 7a the value of pressure drag overwhelmingly exceeds its viscous counterpart over the entire range of u in the regimes of decoherence the value of c d for vibrating and stationary cylinders are virtually identical a unique and unforeseen feature of drag relating to the diamond section oscillator is that the least values of drag smaller than even those of a stationary diamond section cylinder and its components are attained in the initial branch no such trend is observed in the low r e viv of either a circular cylinder or a square cylinder at zero incidence see fig 21 in section6 3 at the closure of ib u 4 1 drag is minimum and throughout the lb the vibrating cylinder generates more drag than the stationary cylinder over the entire range of u the c l r m s u variation fig 7b displays no apparent correlation with the c d u variation in contrary to the decreasing trend of c d the r m s lift in the ib registers a steady rise in vast majority of the lb the magnitude of c l r m s is low and its least value is attained at u 5 2 it has been pointed out above that at this u there is a sudden shift of phase ϕ between c l and y fig 9 the phase shift is also reflected by the altered orientation of the c l y lissajou diagrams shown as insets in fig 9 for all the branches of response sans the lower one the leading edge or forward stagnation point represents the point of maximum pressure in the early lb where the response is high the point of maximum pressure travels away from the leading edge or forward stagnation point this is the regime of high drag the closer the base pressure is to the maximum pressure or more is the pressure recovery the lesser is the drag and vice versa for comparison c p of the stationary cylinder fig 3f is reproduced as fig 8a while fig 8b plots the mean surface pressure for three representative u corresponding to the dsi u 3 1 ib u 4 1 and lb u 4 4 the pressure plots for the stationary cylinder and cylinder vibrating at u 3 1 are very similar yielding similar values of drag with respect to the c p of the stationary cylinder the drop in c p for u 4 1 near the leading edge is more than the drop near the base thus at this u pressure recovery is more than the stationary cylinder and drag is low for this case base pressure denotes the minimum surface pressure thus pressure gradient is favorable in the base region this aids in pressure recovery for u 4 4 an overall decrease in c p is noted the decrease is appreciable particularly at the cylinder shoulders thus at the rear faces of the oscillator pressure is sufficiently low leading to least recovery of pressure and the maximum value of c d for high amplitude oscillations in the lb the maximum pressure point travels away from the leading edge this shifting of maximum pressure point is noted in the regime of higher drag i e for u 4 2 5 9 6 2 3 the wake modes of vortex formation for simultaneous in line and transverse undamped viv of a square cylinder of m 3 at 45 incidence zhao et al 2013 explored the wake modes at r e 100 at u 8 corresponding to bi stable solutions they resolved the asymmetric p s mode in addition to a 2p like mode the occurrence of p s mode is linked to the value of frequency ratio based on transverse oscillations being slightly smaller than unity if the frequency ratio exceeds unity the wake mode switches to the 2p like mode they also resolved the 2s mode and showed it for u 15 the viv parameters of the present study that differ with those of zhao et al 2013 are mass ratio degree of freedom and reduced speed the current study relates to y only viv of a square cylinder of m 10 at 45 incidence the range of reduced speed considered u 1 12 is much shorter compared to the one u 1 30 employed by zhao et al 2013 in the current investigation no regime of bi stable solutions is resolved yet novel and previously unreported one sided asymmetric wake modes are identified at u 3 5 in the ib these one sided modes are designated in the present study as s and s at this reduced speed the flow is quasi periodic and the value of frequency ratio 0 8915 is smaller than unity the value of y m a x d equals 0 1680 at u 4 2 marking the transition from ib to lb the asymmetric p s mode is resolved the flow is periodic at this u and the value of frequency ratio 0 9593 slightly falls short of unity as previously noted by zhao et al 2013 in addition the cylinder executes high amplitude oscillations y m a x d 0 5362 for the remaining u the wake mode is 2s or c 2s in the foregoing paragraphs features of the key wake modes are discussed the wake mode at u 3 5 in dsi the oscillation and stationary shedding frequencies are identical and the wake vortex mode is expected to be similar to the one noted for a stationary cylinder see fig 3g and h in this branch the wake mode is basic karman or 2s in the low amplitude ib the oscillation and shedding frequencies mostly collapse but differ from the reduced natural frequency in this regime of soft lock in both s t y and s t c l significantly exceed s t 0 and one therefore expects the wake vortex mode to deviate from 2s in consistency with this anticipation a blend of wake modes is identified at u 3 5 for which the value of mean lift 0 0158 differs from zero based on the number of vortices shed in an oscillation cycle and near wake arrangement of the vortices post shedding williamson and roshko 1988 introduced the concept of wake mode of vortex formation fig 11a plots the y and c l time traces for u 3 5 as expected this figure reveals an in phase relationship between the quantities and identical time period for corresponding y and c l cycles from fig 11a it also follows that the flow roughly repeats in three successive cycles of cylinder oscillation or vortex shedding the time period of the oscillation cycle is determined corresponding to the dominant peak in the fft of response the normalized oscillation frequency of 0 2548 discussed in section6 2 1 yields a normalized time period t of oscillation cycle as 1 s t y 3 93 treating this time period to be constant for each oscillation or shedding cycle the flow field is analyzed for three consecutive cycles that amounts to a total normalized time of 11 8 fig 11b illustrates the three successive cycles of vortex shedding considered to analyze the wake mode the value of mean lift for the first second and third cycles of cylinder oscillation are 0 0726 0 2185 and 0 0422 respectively in each cycle the lift is unbalanced underscoring that the wake vortex mode departs from the basic karman mode and turns asymmetric in fig 11c normalized time instants at which the flow field has been studied for each cycle are marked for the first cycle the distribution of instantaneous vorticity at different time instants is illustrated via figs 12a through 12f while figs 12g through 12l depict the variation of instantaneous pressure on the cylinder surface as apparent from fig 12b corresponding to t 4 t 20 a clockwise cw rotating vortex sheds from the upper rear surface of the cylinder fig 12h suggests that the magnitude of c p at this instant is higher along edge cd than along edge bc this implies that vortex shedding occurs from the high pressure side along the rear surface of the cylinder also see kumar et al 2018a towards the end of the cycle i e at t 16 t 20 fig 12e a counterclockwise ccw vortex sheds from the high pressure surface here lower rear surface implying that the wake vortex mode for the first cycle is 2s however it may be noted that the size and strength of the shed vortices differ and hence the wake mode is not truly 2s but asymmetric 2s a very unique kind of vortex shedding i e shedding from only a particular side of the oscillator is noted in the second cycle fig 13 the implication is that the viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence is associated with the phenomenon of partial suppression of vortex shedding in this entire cycle only a single clockwise rotating vortex sheds from the upper rear surface of the oscillator the shedding occurs at some instant between t 4 t 20 and t 8 t 20 in the remaining of the cycle vortices from the lower rear surface while remain attached to the oscillator are seen to grow in size the one sided vortex shedding recurs in the third cycle shown in fig 14 this shedding however differs appreciably from its counterpart in the second cycle a pair of like sign here counterclockwise vortices that forms at the lower rear part of the oscillator towards the end of the second cycle sheds in the third cycle we are unaware of prior reporting of such one sided wake mode of vortex formation in the literature the vortex cores are clearly discernible from fig 14d through 14f this new mode of one sided shedding is denoted by the symbol s where two vortex cores are identified within the same envelope of vorticity this vortex pair sheds as a unit at t t post shedding the vortices combine and finally reduce to a single vortex that propagate downstream the mean surface pressure computed over sufficiently long time and illustrated in fig 15a reveals that c p along the upper and lower surfaces of the oscillator is symmetric as discussed previously the value of mean lift is small but non zero 0 0158 this is an interesting case where a non zero mean lift is associated with symmetric distribution of c p fig 15b c and d plot the distribution of mean surface pressure for three successive cycles of cylinder oscillation discussed above as already discussed the surface pressure for each cycle is asymmetric about the base point the wake mode at u 4 2 u 4 2 marks the transition from ib to lb and hence the initiation of high amplitude lb as already discussed in section6 2 1 the value of mean normalized response 0 0124 is a positive quantity implying that in an oscillation cycle the oscillator resides on the positive y side for a higher duration of time than in the negative y side the flow is periodic as evidenced from the time history of c l fig 16a fig 16a clearly demonstrates that the mean lift differs from zero as expected c l is a positive quantity similar to mean response it may also be noted that fig 16b suggests for in phase relationship between y and c l at u 4 2 and its value is 0 2824 since the mean lift is a positive quantity the value of c p along the lower half surface of the cylinder exceeds the value of c p along the upper half surface i e the upper half of the cylinder represents the suction side and the lower half the pressure side this asymmetry in c p indicates that in an oscillation cycle the number of vortices shed from the upper and lower rear surfaces must be different and hence symmetry of flow will break if will be shown below that two vortices are shed from the lower or pressure surface in contrast to one from the suction or upper rear surface a complete cycle of y and c l is illustrated in fig 16b certain time instants at which the flow and instantaneous surface pressure are analyzed are marked fig 16c plots the time averaged surface pressure distribution the c d c l lissajou diagram discussed in section6 2 1 is shown here again for reference in consistency with the existence of non zero mean lift the lissajou diagram displays asymmetry the mean surface pressure along the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder becomes asymmetric between the leading and trailing edges apart from this asymmetry certain noteworthy deviations in c p are modification of the pressure profile near the leading edge and striking shift of the locations of the maximum and minimum pressure the upper shoulder alone turns the point of minimum c p and the maximum pressure point shifts downward from the leading edge for a cycle of complete oscillation fig 16d through fig 16i depict the development of the wake vortices at t 0 the cylinder is located little above the mean position signified by y 0 and it executes downward motion during this motion the cylinder center crosses the mean position before t t 22 is reached and at t t 22 the displacement of the cylinder center is 0 0695 d both of the vortices at the rear of the oscillator are attached with the upper one about to shed the instantaneous surface pressure presented in fig 16j indicates that the maximum pressure occurs at a location along the lower edge ab well ahead of the lower shoulder as is well known the flow is attached in the forward part of a bluff body owing to favorable pressure gradient and vortex shedding occurs from its rear part here edges bc and cd the surface pressure along cd exceeds the one along bc since shedding occurs from the high pressure side of the body kumar et al 2018a the corresponding vortex here clockwise vortex on the upper edge will shed first at t 5 t 22 fig 16e the cylinder almost attains its lowest position and the clockwise vortex denoted by s sheds from the upper rear surface cd pressure along this edge still exceeds the pressure along bc at t 9 t 22 the cylinder executes upward translation and as apparent from fig 16l the surface pressure distribution undergoes noticeable alterations c p along bc now dominates over c p along cd and consequently the counterclockwise vortex at the bottom rear becomes stronger than the upper clockwise vortex fig 16f at approximately half the oscillation cycle i e at t t 13 a reversal of flow and surface pressure is noted interestingly the ccw vortex though attached appears about to split into a pair of like sign vortices the vortex splitting becomes quite apparent at a later time instant t 17 t 22 fig 16h and one cw and two ccw vortices are discernible from fig 16n it is worth noting that at the instant of vortex splitting i e t 17 t 22 the base point c reduces to the point of minimum pressure and difference of pressure between the leading edge a and trailing edge c becomes maximum at the end of the cycle flow conditions corresponding to t 0 are recovered in the entire oscillation cycle a total of three vortices one cw vortex from top and two ccw vortices from the bottom are shed implying that the wake vortex mode is p s in fig 16o the isolated vortex s and vortex pair p have been labeled this figure also shows the p s vortices formed during the previous cycle of oscillation by analyzing the p s vortices for two consecutive cycles it is found that the vortex pair p of opposite signed vortices invariably forms above the wake centerline whereas the s contributor of p s forms below the wake centerline the differences in surface pressure distribution at t 5 t 22 and 17 t 22 can be explained by analyzing the cylinder motion for a complete cycle of transverse oscillations fig 16b plots the variation of cylinder velocity or y by virtue of the no slip condition cylinder velocity in turn represents the velocity of all the fluid particles adhering to the fluid solid interface fig 16b suggests that the velocity is non zero at t 5 t 22 while it is approximately zero at t 17 t 22 because of attainment of maximum displacement considering the principle of bernoulli the instance of non zero v velocity will lead to lower value of surface pressure than the instance of zero v velocity therefore at t 17 t 22 concentration of vorticity at the shedding side will be more than the one at t 5 t 22 this explains the shedding of a single vortex in the first half cycle and shedding of a pair of vortices in the next half cycle the vortex synchronization map of williamson and roshko 1988 illustrated in fig 3a of their paper indicates that the least value of y m a x d for the occurrence of p s mode is of the order of unity for low r e williamson and roshko 1988 found that the p s mode appears at low amplitude see figure 17a of williamson and roshko 1988 for r e 275 u 6 and y m a x 0 5 d later studies concerning forced and free vibrations of a circular oscillator at low r e meneghini and bearman 1995 singh and mittal 2005 also resolved the p s mode at lower values of normalized response meneghini and bearman 1995 for flow past a circular cylinder executing forced vibrations resolved the p s mode at r e 200 for which y m a x d 0 6 later singh and mittal 2005 identified the p s mode for viv of a circular cylinder at r e 325 and above at r e 325 the value of the normalized transverse response was of the order of 0 62 in the present work concerning y only viv of a square cylinder at 45 incidence the p s mode is identified at even lower value of response y m a x 0 5362 d why does the p s mode form only when u 4 2 and not at u 3 5 while c l 0 in both cases the p s mode interestingly forms only at a sole u value of 4 2 marking ib lb transition the formation of this asymmetric mode can be explained with respect to the variation of mean lift fig 10 the value of c l 0 2824 at u 4 2 differs strikingly from its value 0 at other u except u 3 5 since c l is a function of surface pressure and velocity gradient a high value of unbalanced mean lift implies considerable asymmetry in c p along the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder it also suggests that velocities of the oscillator during vortex shedding from the top and bottom rear surfaces are noticeably different already explained relative to fig 16b we may therefore conclude that for other u values because of zero or negligible value of mean lift the surface pressure along the upper and lower surface is symmetric or mildly asymmetric hence the velocity of the cylinder at the instants of shedding from the upper and lower surfaces is of comparable magnitude this prevents the generation of any noticeable asymmetry in flow at majority of the u values at u 3 5 the mean lift is slightly negative 0 0158 and yet this small unbalanced lift induces asymmetry in the flow this asymmetry however differs from p s the value of maximum normalized response at this reduced speed is 0 1680 following the available literature the p s mode forms at a normalized response of 0 5 and above it appears that owing to low amplitude viv at u 3 5 the p s mode does not form 6 2 4 the vortex force and vortex phase at u 3 5 and 4 2 the phase relationship between c v o r t e x and y d is investigated for instances with asymmetric wake modes i e u 3 5 and 4 2 for u 3 5 fig 17 depicts the temporal variation of vortex force as well as cylinder response for three successive cycles of lift these cycles are identical to those fig 11 considered to analyze the wake mode the phase between the vortex force and displacement for the first second and third cycles are 5 43 18 09 and 5 43 respectively thus the time traces are roughly in phase the average value of the vortex force for u 3 5 equals 0 0010 over a complete cycle of total lift force see fig 16b for u 4 2 fig 18a illustrates the dimensional acceleration of the cylinder while fig 18b and c respectively depict the time variation of potential and vortex forces unlike the potential force a non zero value of mean vortex force is quite apparent from fig 18c the total lift force its vortex component and the response are plotted in fig 18d similar to u 3 5 the vortex force and response for u 4 2 also maintain an approximate in phase relationship however the time averaged value of vortex force 0 2767 for u 4 2 is significantly higher than its counterpart for u 3 5 therefore even though the wake modes for u 3 5 and 4 2 differ drastically the alteration of wake mode with u is not reflected by the phase between the vortex force and response however the mean value of vortex force in these two cases exhibit noticeable difference 6 3 comparison of sdof viv characteristics of circular square and diamond cylinders the circular and square cylinders are the most studied oscillator shapes and under identical conditions display much contrasting viv features some such features for the circular and square oscillators at zero incidence were discussed in sen and mittal 2011 a comparative account of the key viv characteristics such as response lock in and fluid loading of circular and inclined square cylinders is provided below for u 1 10 for each case m 10 ζ 0 r e 100 b 0 05 and the oscillators execute transverse only translations galloping of a square cylinder of arbitrary m is induced for u 10 li et al 2019 and r e 150 or higher barrero gil et al 2009 joly et al 2012 sen and mittal 2015 for the range of input parameters considered here motion of the square cylinder is therefore purely viv the dimension d of each oscillator along the horizontal and vertical axes of symmetry is same fig 19 compares the transverse response of all three oscillator shapes to the best of the knowledge of the authors the response of an m 10 square cylinder executing undamped sdof viv at r e 100 is being presented perhaps for the first time the response curve of individual oscillators are remarkably different in construction the branching is simple for the square oscillator at zero incidence and gets complex for the circular and diamond section cylinders in the former the response is comprised of dsi lb and dsii the absence of ib for a square cylinder viv at low r e has been recently discussed in kumar et al 2018b for the circular and diamond cylinders the response comprises of dsi ib lb and dsii it may be noted that the extent of ib is the largest for the diamond cylinder with one key response branch absent the smallest extent of lock in and smallest value of maximum response is associated with the square cylinder at zero incidence a rotation of the square cylinder by 45 alters the response to such extent that the response undergoes a significant departure relative to its counterpart at zero incidence the response for 45 configuration is somewhat closer to the response of a circular cylinder the lb of circular cylinder is composed of periodic and quasi periodic components interestingly no quasi periodic component exists in the lb of square and diamond cylinders detailed comparison of the branching maximum response and periodic quasi periodic behavior is presented in table7 fig 19 provides a useful insight on the identification of lb dsii transition from response curve alone it appears that such a transition from lock in to lock out is obvious in response curve for oscillators with smooth contours variable location of separation points and not discernible for oscillators containing sharp corners and straight edges fixed location of separation points the flow past an oscillator in dsii is equivalent to flow around a stationary cylinder thus at the end of lock in lb the flow tends to reduce to the flow past a fixed cylinder consequently the separation angle also tends to decrease and be same as for the fixed cylinder for a circular cylinder with smooth contour the separation location is movable and hence it self adjusts with the lower value pertaining to dsii this self adjustment is reflected by the discontinuity in the response curve in contrast for the square cylinders the separation angle is fixed irrespective of response branch and hence non adjustable when a transition from lb to dsii takes place constancy of separation angle for such cylinders appears to be the reason for a continuous y m a x u curve in the neighborhood of lb dsii transition among the three cylinder shapes considered the largest separation angle measured form the base point is associated with the diamond cylinder whereas for the square cylinder at zero incidence value of the separation angle is the smallest however because of the presence of the gradually narrowing afterbody for the diamond and circular cylinders the streamlines close to their lateral boundaries are less deflected relative to the wake centerline in contrast for the square cylinder at zero incidence an afterbody does not exist and the streamlines diverge more relative to the wake centerline therefore width of the wake is largest for the square cylinder at zero incidence and because of narrowest afterbody and farthest separation point about base point width of wake of the diamond section cylinder is the smallest therefore interaction between the separated shear layers rows of karman vortex street is maximum for the diamond cylinder and minimum for the square cylinder at zero incidence lesser interaction between shear layers is indicative of weaker vortex shedding and hence lower values of the vortex shedding frequency luo et al 1994 and vice versa since the lift force is inherent to the vortex shedding phenomenon it is thus obvious that the lift will be largest for the diamond cylinder and smallest for the square cylinder in view of the rigid body displacement equation eq 5 we may therefore conjecture that the higher lift of a diamond cylinder is responsible for its high amplitude oscillations and conversely weaker lift for its zero incidence counterpart leads to smaller response fig 20a illustrates the variation of s t y with u for each cylinder while the variation of frequency ratio is depicted via fig 20b irrespective of the oscillator contour the branching of response is very obvious from either of these plots in view of the afterbody effect the diamond section cylinder possesses the largest value of vortex shedding frequency while the smallest vortex shedding frequency relates to the square cylinder at zero incidence the onset and termination of synchronization are marked via abrupt jump in frequency and attainment of least value of frequency the diamond oscillator with high s t y since s t c l s t y is susceptible to quick amplification in frequency and hence the lock in initiates at a lower u in contrast a delayed onset of lock in is noted for the square cylinder at zero incidence the viv of this cylinder being weak the minimum value of s t y is attained within a short interval of u leading to the narrowest extent of lock in the diamond cylinder in contrast executes strong viv and its s t y drops to the minimum after sufficiently delayed u with respect to the onset of lock in this explains the largest regime of lock in for the diamond cylinder the shedding frequency of a circular cylinder being little smaller than its diamond counterpart see table4 for stationary vortex shedding frequency s t 0 the extent of lock in of a circular cylinder is smaller than the diamond cylinder and wider than that of a square cylinder at zero incidence the mass ratio of the circular cylinder square cylinder at zero and 45 incidences is expressed as the 4 m π ρ d 2 m ρ d 2 and 2 m ρ d 2 ratio respectively if the mass ratio is held constant the value of oscillator mass is therefore largest for the square cylinder at zero incidence and smallest for the diamond cylinder for a given oscillator increasing m amounts to increasing m sen and mittal 2015 in context of viv of a square cylinder at zero incidence found that the maximum response decays with increasing m fig 4a of their paper for increasing r e i e with increasing m in the current investigation involving oscillators of same m but varying shapes identical relationship between m and maximum y is found to exist from here it appears that the magnitude of maximum response is more a function of oscillator mass than the shape of the oscillator the comparison of vortex induced drag and lift forces is presented in fig 21a and b respectively when held stationary the drag is maximum for the diamond cylinder and minimum for the circular one table4 as expected the same trend holds true for the regimes of decoherence i e dsi and dsii but the trend changes partially in the higher amplitude lower branch for u 7 in the lb c d of a circular cylinder exceeds the one from a square cylinder at zero incidence in the periodic lb c d of the circular cylinder decays linearly irrespective of cross section the mean drag is constant in dsi in the dsii the mean drag of both the square cylinders decays slowly for stationary cylinders table4 indicates that the value of c l r m s of the diamond section cylinder is the largest followed by the circular and square cylinder at zero incidence respectively this order deems valid even in the dsi and dsii regimes of the freely vibrating cylinders and also for the maximum value of c l r m s for each cross section table8 lists the maximum values of mean drag and r m s lift along with the associated reduced speed values also compared in this table are the u marking the onset and closure of lock in 7 conclusions based on stabilized space time finite element computations in two dimensions undamped flow induced vibrations of a rigid diamond cylinder of m 10 are investigated at r e 100 for reduced speed varying from 1 to 12 the oscillator executes single degree of freedom translations across the flow the diamond cylinder that is nothing but a square cylinder at 45 incidence contains straight edges and sharp corners yet displays flow and vibration features that diverge appreciably from those of the square cylinder at zero incidence its response is composed of all four of the basic constituent branches i e dsi ib lb and dsii listed by navrose et al 2014 in context of viv of circular elliptic cylinder at low r e in case of a square cylinder at zero incidence the initial branch does not exist however the response of diamond and circular cylinders differ in lb sub branching while the lb is fully periodic for the diamond oscillator existence of an additional quasi periodic lb component for a circular cylinder stretches the extent of its lb longer than that of the diamond oscillator the initial branch of the diamond cylinder commences earlier and is much stronger than its counterpart for a circular cylinder owing to the presence of gradually narrowing afterbody in a diamond cylinder interaction between its separated shear layers is much stronger than that of a square cylinder having no afterbody at all the early settling of lock in and strong vortex shedding high s t for a diamond cylinder in ib appears to be responsible for its highly diverse wake modes than a circular or zero incidence square cylinder at an r e as low as 100 strong vortex shedding from the vibrating diamond cylinder generates higher lift than its square counterpart this explains the overwhelming dominance the response of a diamond oscillator maintains over a square oscillator the dominance of shedding frequency of the diamond cylinder is responsible for its quicker at low u attainment of nearly equal f n value and delayed at high u attainment of stationary shedding frequency s t 0 thus the range of lock in is largest for the diamond cylinder for circular square and diamond cylinders having identical characteristic dimension and mass ratio the oscillator mass is largest for the square cylinder and smallest for the diamond cylinder the attainment of maximum and minimum response by the diamond cylinder and square cylinder respectively indicates that oscillator mass is more an influencing parameter for response than oscillator shape the oneness of s t y and s t c l over the entire range of u underscores the pure vortex induced motion of the diamond cylinder a close correspondence between the relative magnitude of response in its component branches and closeness of oscillation shedding frequency to f n is identified from the s t u relationship one can roughly estimate the relative branchwise response independent of the true y u variation owing to strong vortex shedding and consequent lift the magnitude of normalized peak response of the diamond cylinder closely approaches 0 6 and surpasses the peak response of a circular cylinder the maximum response is attained at u 5 at which s t c l s t y 0 1983 0 2 f n the response appears to closely influence the location of the maximum pressure point the value of the maximum pressure and base pressure the shift of location of the maximum pressure from the leading edge forward stagnation point becomes prominent first at u 4 2 marking the onset of lb this divergence continues at least up to u 5 9 the mismatch of forward stagnation and maximum pressure points is found to be associated with y m a x d being equal to or exceeding 0 5 this is a high drag regime where difference between the maximum pressure and base pressure is very high a contrasting feature of drag of the diamond cylinder is that its least value is attained in the ib for such instances the base pressure reduces to the minimum surface pressure and hence a favorable pressure gradient persists in the base region this gradient aids in recovery of pressure at the base and lowers the drag deviation of the value of mean lift from zero is noted for two discrete u values of 3 5 and 4 2 at u 3 5 the deviation is small while it is significant at u 4 2 at u 3 5 the response is low and flow repeats in three successive cycles each of these cycles are linked to asymmetry in wake mode formation in the first cycle a pair of vortices of unequal size and strength are shed this wake mode is designated as asymmetric 2s mode an one sided mode of vortex formation from the top rear surface of the cylinder is noted in the second cycle in the third cycle one sided shedding occurs from the lower surface such that a pair of like sign vortex cores coexist within same vorticity envelope highly asymmetric distribution of mean surface pressure at u 4 2 indicates strong asymmetry in wake formation the wake mode is identified as p s that forms in high amplitude motion the vortex force for u 3 5 as well as 4 2 is roughly in phase with response indicating no alteration in phase

22129,in setting a safe route for a ship one of the problems to face is represented by excessive roll motions deriving from resonance phenomena in adverse weather conditions an effective prediction of the roll motion amplification is related to a proper mathematical modelling of the ship motions linear models may result to be inadequate in case of large roll motions where non linear effects dominate this paper investigates the roll response resonance in irregular waves the developed method aims at demonstrating the influence of the non linear immersed hull geometry as already acknowledged in literature for regular seas a 6 dof non linear model is applied for generating the time histories of ship roll motions in irregular waves these are fed into an optimization routine able of finding the linear system focusing at its natural roll frequency that better approximates the non linear one at a certain mean roll amplitude the outcomes of this research are meant to support the estimation of roll resonance period accounting for non linearities of immersed hull geometry allowing for a more reliable solution of weather routing problems keywords ship dynamics non linear resonance 1 introduction the expansion of the global economy is facilitated by ocean going ships ship routing and ship scheduling are major determinants of the world fleet productivity the quantity of published research on ship routing and scheduling and related topics has almost doubled in the recent years christiansen et al 2013 decision support tools based on weather routing are of current interest concerning ship safety during navigation lin et al 2013 maki et al 2011 vettor and guedes soares 2016 expert sailors have gained experience about the best action to take at sea nevertheless the possibility of planning and following an optimal and safe route supported by dedicated tools is a valuable aid acanfora et al 2018 krata and szlapczynska 2018 moreover reliable and consolidated methods are expected to operate autonomously in the future aawa 2016 decisions regarding the ship route are usually made according to the encountered sea conditions krata and szłapczyńska 2012 perera and soares 2017 one of the main concern is the avoidance of synchronous and parametric roll resonance acanfora et al 2017a krata and szlapczynska 2018 these two dangerous phenomena involving excessive motions and loads on the ship acanfora et al 2017b are caused by encountered wave periods equal to the natural roll period of the ship and half of it respectively belenky et al 2006 it is well acknowledged that linear numerical methods are not suited for modelling parametric roll resonance moreover they might lead to inaccurate predictions of synchronous roll resonance as well acanfora and matusiak 2014 generally the resonance frequency might depend on the amplitude of the oscillations this non linear phenomenon has been observed both numerically and experimentally based on regular sea investigations falzarano and mulk 1994 francescutto and contento 1999 concerning an isolated body in open seas in case of a linear system with small damping the resonance or natural frequency is identified as the maximum value in the response amplitude operator rao corresponding also to a 90 value of the response phase operator in ship dynamics rao effectively identifies a transfer function as known experimentally the same frequency can be identified as the one corresponding to the free response of the system when displaced from the equilibrium position and let free not subjected to external forces the present paper deals with the non linear dynamics of ships so the concept of linear superposition of frequency contents and all inherent implications are no more valid in a rigorous sense however in the paper non linear ship motion responses computed in the time domain will be analysed in terms of equivalent linear systems providing pseudo raos whose maximum values will be interpreted as non linear resonances the paper builds on the trends that the resonance frequencies show as a function of the output and input level weather routing tools that implement the linear approach based on the equality of natural roll period of the ship tn with the peak period of the encountered wave spectrum tp could lead to inaccurate predictions of dangerous scenarios actually it is recommended to consider as critical all synchronous roll cases characterized by an encounter wave period te within a range close to the natural roll period of the ship imo 2007 in bennedict et al 2006 this range is assumed as 0 8 tn te 1 1 while in krata and wawrzynski 2017 the authors select the critical range corresponding to resonance periods based on constant roll amplitude applications wawrzyński 2018 wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b in ship rolling sources of nonlinearity are in principle identified in all the dynamic terms of the motion equations inertial dissipative and elastic the latter two have been analysed in bulian and francescutto 2013 krüger and kluwe 2008 wawrzyński and krata 2016b while in wawrzynski and krata 2016a a method was provided for estimating the ship resonance frequency at large roll amplitudes depending on an effective i e non linear variation of the restoring actions the same approach has been used in wawrzyński 2018 for studying bi stability and bifurcation phenomena based on 1 dof modelling for regular waves in wawrzynski and krata 2016a the roll amplitudes at different frequencies obtained for several amplitudes of the exciting roll moment are shown it is pointed out that for large amplitude roll motions induced by large input wave amplitudes one should be careful in defining a single invariant resonance period of a ship the issue of a shift of the resonance frequency of the roll response is well acknowledged and covered for regular sea modelling but a comprehensive study addressing the problem in irregular waves is still missing in acanfora et al 2017a it is observed that large synchronous and parametric roll motions in irregular waves occur at a resonance frequency coherent with the method presented in wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b rather than with the natural roll frequency of the ship corresponding to gm based imo recommended method based on the constant invariant stiffness of the linear model in those references the resonance frequency is related to the constant roll amplitude induced by a regular wave i e is referred to a response characteristic coherently with a non linear analysis of the phenomenon a characteristic of the system depends on the response however in irregular sea the roll response does not have a constant amplitude it follows that a reference value for the oscillations might be of difficult definition irregular seas in time domain simulations are generated by linear superposition of a set of regular waves whose amplitudes and frequencies depend on a theoretical wave spectrum however different irregular wave trains could be obtained by the same theoretical amplitude spectrum and lead to different ship non linear responses acanfora and rizzuto 2019 with different energy contents in other words the behaviour of the non linear ship system depends not only on the input wave amplitude spectrum but also on the phase spectrum therefore an interpretation of ship resonance is provided also in terms of input characteristics focusing on the phase spectrum in this paper equivalent linear transfer functions are derived from the analysis of time histories regarding irregular wave trains and the corresponding simulations of roll motions for two vessels a containership and a ro ro pax ship the frequency corresponding to the peak of the derived rao is considered as roll resonance frequency and the dependence of such frequency is studied with reference to parameters identifying both the input wave train and the output roll motion this procedure is applied systematically to a wide range of irregular sea states for the above mentioned hulls particularly prone to large roll motions the present study is meant to develop previous investigations limited to regular wave trains francescutto and contento 1999 wawrzyński 2018 wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b the original aspect of this research is the identification of trends of the resonance roll period in irregular waves that is currently missing in the technical literature in this paper a 6 dof blended non linear model is used for generating roll motions from irregular sea state realizations in time domain this choice allows a more general modelling of ship dynamics for irregular waves it is considered quite unnatural to derive non linear damping coefficients from roll decay experiments and insert these into numerical simulations in which large motions and couplings are attained neves 2016 moreover in wawrzynski and krata 2016a it is stated that an alteration of the roll damping coefficient causes very limited influence on the resonance frequency when the same rolling amplitude is presumed considering in addition that the focus of this research is about the effects of the non linearities of hull geometry on ship resonance period viscous roll damping is disregarded indeed this assumption facilitates the generation of large amplitude roll motions for the same reason the analysis is limited to beam wave scenarios the next sections introduce the procedure followed in this paper in the first part the numerical simulation model for generating ship dynamics in irregular sea is described then the optimization problem and the solving algorithm are presented before feeding the optimization routine the roll response is filtered by means of empirical model decomposition in the following a brief description of this technique and the motivations for its utilization are provided the analyses are carried out on two hulls whose data are available in acanfora et al 2017a kukkanen 2012 the outcomes regarding the roll resonance periods are discussed and compared with the critical range as proposed in literature bennedict et al 2006 krata and wawrzynski 2017 an additional calculation is carried out to show the influence of the spectrum of the phases on the development of resonance phenomena finally conclusions are drawn 2 calculation of the resonance frequency of a ship in irregular sea 2 1 non linear numerical model for the simulations the 6 dof non linear model utilized for generating the time histories of the ship response in irregular waves is based on a so called blended or hybrid method bulian and francescutto 2013 matusiak 2013 the convolution integral technique is applied for the use in the time domain of the radiation forces estimated in frequency by an application of the potential theory faltinsen 1990 viscous damping is disregarded non linearities regard mainly the froude krylov and the restoring forces and moments estimated on the effective wetted surface these represent the non linear stiffness parameter of the ship model whose effects on the resonance frequency are under investigation detailed descriptions about the 6 dof model can be found in matusiak 2013 acanfora and rizzuto 2019 it is worth underlining that this non linear method does not implement the gz curve for modelling restoring actions since the restoring forces are directly modelled by hydrostatic pressure integration on the hull discretized by means of panels the data collected from each numerical simulation are the time histories of the wave encountered by the ship at the center of gravity i e the origin of the body fixed reference frame and the corresponding 6 dof ship motions focusing on roll motions differently from wawrzynski and krata 2016a the aim is a more realistic modelling of ship dynamics allowing cross couplings that are suppressed by 1 dof roll model the choice of using a numerical model rather than experimental tests makes available a wider set of data accounting for several combinations of sea state and allowing for longer simulation time 2 2 system identification the rationale behind the proposed identification procedure is to derive the parameters of the optimal equivalent second order linearized system able to describe the relationship between the input wave and the resulting ship rolling motion an equivalent linear ship response model is sought where all non linearities are removed the natural frequency of the linearized system is obtained in correspondence to the maximum value of the rao to this aim a preliminary processing of the roll numerical signals by the well known empirical mode decomposition is performed this sub section is organized as follows the reasons for the use of the empirical mode decomposition are highlighted and its fundamentals are briefly introduced later the optimization routine for obtaining the linear system is explained 2 2 1 empirical mode decomposition in brief empirical mode decomposition emd is an adaptive time space analysis method suitable for processing series in the time domain feldman 2009 rato et al 2008 it can be compared to other widely recognized methods in the relevant literature like fourier transforms and wavelet decomposition the authors believe that in respect to the other mentioned methods emd exhibits significant advantages due to its inherent ability to tackle non stationary and non linear signals like the case under investigation acanfora and rizzuto 2019 as far as the current application is concerned the use of emd is aimed at filtering and processing data directly in the time domain in other words the authors propose to derive the dominant mode by exploiting the sifting process which is the core of the empirical mode decomposition procedure this filtering allows the regularization of the roll signal and the consequent improvement of the computation burden for the optimization procedure as well known in the specific literature emd permits to represent a certain signal in terms of a sum of intrinsic mode functions exhibiting a time behaviour close to the elementary harmonic ones in other words the assigned signal y t can be decomposed in the following way 1 y t k a k t c o s 0 t ω k τ d τ where ak t and ωk t are the instantaneous amplitude and the angular radian frequency respectively both ak t and ωk t are always positive and slowly changing along the time the filtered roll signal yf t corresponds to the first intrinsic mode function imf1 i e the result of first sifting process of the signal y t see fig 7 this is supported by the observation that in the current applications the highest energy content is associated with the first mode 2 2 2 optimization routine the objective of the optimization routine is to find the transfer function g jω in frequency domain which is able to reproduce the relationship between a known input x jω and a known output yf jω which are the irregular wave x t and the filtered roll signal yf t expressed in frequency domain respectively once the filtered signal yf t is achieved the optimization can be fed the aim is to search for parameters of the transfer function 2 g j ω k ω n 2 ω 2 2 j ζ ωω n ω n 2 k ω 2 ω n 2 2 ζ j ω ω n 1 where k ζ and ωn are the gain the damping and the natural frequency of the linear system respectively the parameter estimations are carried out by minimizing the following objective function 3 f g j ω x j ω y f j ω 2 where 3 expresses the norm of the discrepancy between the filtered output and the reconstructed signal by means of a proper second order transfer function the minimization of the objective function 3 is analytically performed by employing the technique reported in cheres and eydelzon 2000 actually by a suitable change of variables the nonlinear minimization can be converted in a linear estimator problem providing the optimal values of interest since the focus of the current paper is the resonance angular frequency of the roll signal the only parameter collected from the optimization routine is ωn it is assumed that the resonance period of the linearized system is tr 2π ωn a sequence illustrating the procedures explained in the section is provided in fig 1 3 case study the above procedure is carried out on two different hulls a ro ro pax ship and a containership respectively named in the following seatech d and c11 respectively kukkanen 2012 silva et al 2010 exposed to irregular beam waves the main particulars of the two hulls are reported in table 1 for the purpose of the present computations the c11 hull is assumed with a vertical coordinate of the center of gravity vcg 15 34 m this value actually differs from the reference full loading condition of this containership but this change allows for a natural roll period within a realistic range of wave periods the change is deemed necessary to facilitate the onset of large roll motions in beam waves the natural roll period tn and the metacentric height gm0 of the two vessels at equilibrium are derived from numerically simulated roll decay tests and inclining tests respectively it is worth reminding that neither tn nor gm0 are used as input variable in the simulations and these numerical tests pinpoint their effective values a sample of the simulated roll decay for seatech d vessel is presented in fig 2 for fn 0 and in fig 3 for fn 0 15 showing the time history on the left hand side and the fft analysis on the right hand side respectively the same info for the c11 hull are arranged in fig 4 for fn 0 15 only looking at figs 2 and 3 effects of the ship speed on damping modelled by convolution integral of radiation damping in potential flow cummins 1962 are clearly visible in the amplitudes of the decaying motion the increase in fn however modifies the natural roll period of the ship of less than 0 05 s for the purpose of the study this contribution is disregarded and it is assumed that the roll period of the ship is the same at both investigated speeds i e fn 0 and fn 0 15 the simulated inclining test consists in the application of an external heeling moment mh to the hull initially in still water in the equilibrium position i e at zero heel once the new equilibrium is found the heel angle φ is read and collected the heeling moment divided by the hull displacement identifies the stability arm gz for small angles as known the metacentric height is obtained as derivative this technique works up to the maximum lever the remaining points are taken from hydrostatic calculations the gz curves for both hulls are shown in fig 5 it is also possible to note that the righting arms at large angles are underestimated by the line with slope gm0 for the c11 hull while they are overestimated for the seatech d the data concerning seatech d in irregular beam waves used in input to the developed method correspond to irregular waves in a range between hs 2 5 m 8 5 m and tz 4 5 s 15 5 s at zero speed i e froude number fn 0 and in a range hs 2 5 m 9 5 m and tz 9 5 s 13 5 s at fn 0 15 they are modelled by n 30 wave components and jonswap spectrum is assumed the roll motions are obtained by 6 dof simulations of 2 h with a sample period of 0 35 s the roll time histories regarding c11 are obtained by 6 dof simulations in irregular beam waves with fn 0 15 in a range of hs 4 5 m 12 5 m and tz 10 5 s 16 5 s a number n 30 wave components and a jonswap spectrum are used simulations last 1 h with a sample time of 0 25 s in both cases the largest simulated hs is taken equal to the ship freeboard at the static waterline for the c11 hull the data regarding fn 0 were disregarded since during the simulations the ship often capsized prior developing stable large roll motions for all simulations the jonswap discrete spectra are defined by sample angular frequencies that are randomly chosen and unevenly spaced this is usually done to enforce the generation of non repeatable wave trains from a given wave spectrum acanfora and rizzuto 2019 matusiak 2013 3 1 calculation of the resonance period by quasi static approach the approach for the calculation of the resonance roll period tr that has been developed and validated assuming regular sea in wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b is briefly described and applied hereby we refer to this method as a quasi static one since in evaluating the roll period it only replaces the metacentric height gm0 with an equivalent stiffness value gmeq 4 t r φ a c 0 gm eq φ a in 4 gmeq φa denotes the equivalent value of the transverse metacentric height of the ship for a specified rolling amplitude φa the equivalent metacentric height is calculated as follows based on both the restoring and the dynamic levers 5 gm eq φ a 0 φ a gz φ d φ φ a 2 gz φ a 2 φ a the constant c0 contained in 4 depends on the roll radius of inertia of the ship including added mass contribution indeed c0 can be estimated at the initial equilibrium as see table 1 6 c 0 t n gm 0 fig 6 shows the resonance periods tr for the c11 and seatech d hulls by applying 4 6 as function of the constant amplitude φa the two curves clearly show peculiar shapes and trends of the periods at different amplitudes the range of variation of the periods is of almost 2 s for both hulls 4 results in this section the results obtained from the computations on the two hulls are presented the resonance roll periods tr obtained by the developed method are compared with the rolling periods estimated by quasi static approach as function of constant roll amplitudes since the aim is to compare responses to irregular seas with constant amplitude waves the problem of associating a reference roll amplitude to the response to irregular waves arises one of the drawbacks of the analysis in wawrzynski and krata 2016a is due to the fact the non linearity in the roll response is observed by only changing the input wave amplitude as single wave components are fed in input to the system the impact of the phases between components is not evaluated to tackle this problem a further analysis is carried out referring the resonance frequencies to the input wave train characterized in terms of amplitudes and phases more specifically an additional investigation is carried out comparing the resonance frequency results for irregular waves obtained by the same amplitude spectrum but different phase spectra 4 1 identification of reference roll amplitude despite the emd technique includes a regularization of the roll signal still it does not produce a pure regular outcome an example of application of emd on a simulated roll signal performed in matlab can be found in fig 7 for the c11 hull tz 13 5 s hs 10 0 m the first intrinsic mode function imf1 of each simulated roll signal is fed in input to the method presented in section 3 for the estimation of tr the filtered signal improves the performance of the optimization procedure reducing odd outcomes however when dealing with the analysis of a reference value of roll motions the problem still needs attention the aim is to derive a single roll amplitude representative of the irregular one to be associated with the corresponding tr several approaches were considered and investigated among these the root mean square rms values of the peaks of the absolute signal was examined fig 8 shows the absolute value of the filtered signal yf t φf t for yf t see fig 7 together with the corresponding peaks marked by red dots it is possible to observe how the rms of the peaks rmsφf yellow line falls quite far from the largest ones indeed since also smaller peaks are included in the calculation of rms value this might lead to underestimate the reference amplitude in other words we are assuming that smaller amplitude components have a weaker contribution and should not be associated with tr in order to limit the influence of smaller roll peaks the significant value of φf t is estimated i e the average of one third highest value of the peaks φf1 3 commonly used for the definition of significant wave height hs the purple line in fig 8 shows how φf1 3 places above rmsφf and thus less far from the maximum peaks following the same line of thought i e aiming at reference values closer to the maximum peaks the average of one tenth third highest value of the peaks φf1 10 is calculated and shown in fig 8 green line based on these considerations and on the obtained results shown in the following sub section φ1 3 and φ1 10 values are therefore identified as possible reference roll amplitudes 4 2 obtained results and comparisons on the basis of what above for each ship the average of one third highest value and the average of one tenth highest value of the absolute roll peaks were computed from the filtered roll signal i e first intrinsic mode function imf1 see fig 7 and associated to tr the analysis provides couples of tr φ1 3 or alternatively tr φ1 10 that once plotted show a scattered behaviour in fig 9 the resonance periods obtained for the seatech d hull in irregular beam waves at zero speed are shown on the left hand side they are plotted as function of φ1 3 conversely on the right hand side as function of φ1 10 a parabolic data fitting is carried out by 2nd order polynomial for both cases one could note that the obtained results fairly match the reference curve obtained by the quasi static method up to 40 indeed the choice of φ1 10 for approximating φa seems to provide a better agreement than φ1 3 the majority of the obtained points accumulates for small φ1 10 and φ1 3 values because several cases are characterized by moderate wave amplitudes together with encounter wave periods far from ship resonance thus not triggering large roll responses this explains the reason for concentrating the range of tz to cases closer to resonance and the range of hs to the highest waves respectively in the remaining applications in fig 10 the couples of points tr φ1 3 and tr φ1 10 referring to the case fn 0 15 are properly added on top of the results shown in fig 9 the quadratic data fittings result in curves almost overlapping the ones corresponding to fn 0 the main difference stands in the maximum attainable values of φ1 10 and φ1 3 affected by the increase in damping in fig 11 results for the c11 hull are shown for fn 0 15 also in this case the quadratic data fitting finely matches the trend of the quasi static method for this ship more moderate values φ1 10 and φ1 3 are obtained from the numerical simulations limiting the comparison up to 30 it is worth underlining that the two hulls chosen for the study are characterized by opposite trends of the resonance period up to 35 for c11 it decreases with the roll amplitude conversely for seatech it generally increases this behaviour is well drawn by the presented outcomes 4 3 influence of sea spectrum characteristics on ship dynamics close to resonance in the preceding section the results obtained for irregular seas in terms of roll resonance frequency have been interpreted as function of the roll amplitude following the same approach outlined in wawrzynski and krata 2016a for regular waves in this section the same results are interpreted in terms of input sea spectra i e both amplitude and phase spectra the time histories of the input wave are all generated by a linear model in line with the linear properties of the equivalent raos used to derive the resonance frequency to the scope the resonance period results shown in fig 9 i e tr for seatech d at fn 0 are arranged as function of hs and tz nominal values in fig 12 the results correspond to the irregular wave trains generated by theoretical jonswap spectra discretized by n 30 regular wave components with hs ranging between 2 5 m 8 5 m and with a limited number of tz it is possible to observe that the resonance period remains almost constant up to hs 7 m for all investigated tz values instead for hs 7 m there are different estimations of tr based on the tz value of the wave train that generated it the largest variation can be observed for tz around 10 5 s 11 5 s the corresponding theoretical peak periods of the wave spectra tp 1 286tz lloyd 1998 fall within the roll resonance period range it is worth underlying that based on the implemented technique the tz of the simulated wave train the symbol means values calculated from the time history increases of at least 0 5 s from the nominal tz value in the present case this means that the nominal tz values 10 5 s and 11 5 s inputted to the theoretical spectrum return wave trains characterized respectively by a simulated tz around 11 0 s and 12 0 s and thus to tp of 14 2 s and 15 4 s more details about the wave train generation from the theoretical spectrum can be found in acanfora and rizzuto 2019 for the remaining tz values the differences in the obtained tr values reduce especially moving far from 10 5 s 11 5 s due to the non linearities contained in the time histories of the roll response used in the analysis the equivalent raos and the inherent positions of their maximum the resonance frequency are dependent not only on the amplitude spectra of the input sea but also on the phase spectra to show the influence of the phase spectrum of the irregular waves on ship dynamics and resonance behaviour several wave trains are generated based on the same theoretical wave amplitude spectrum but with different phase spectra this analysis was limited to sea states with tz 9 5 s rather close to the resonance range and different hs values 2 5 4 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 m results are arranged in fig 13 it can be noted that larger effects on resonance period are mainly caused by differences in the amplitude spectra however for large hs values also differences in the phase spectra based on the same amplitude spectrum contribute to modify ship dynamics thus increasing the gap in the estimated tr for the amplitude spectrum having hs 8 5 m a peculiar behaviour is observed the tr results obtained by several phase spectra bifurcate on two different values that are tr 14 5 s and tr 15 9 s however the significant roll outcomes corresponding to each case do not show any bifurcation and they accumulate around the same values see fig 14 notwithstanding this the φ1 3 and φ1 10 referring to tr 15 9 s are slight larger than the other ones these outcomes suggest that the time histories might exhibit two different resonance behaviours especially when roll amplitudes become considerably large since the developed technique allows identifying only one resonance period the dominant one seems to be selected depending on the adopted phase spectrum 5 discussions the developed method can be considered a quite efficient tool for estimating the resonance frequency of a non linear system it does not require a complex computational algorithm such those based on volterra series carassale and kareem 2010 and it allows for the estimation of resonance frequency by analysing simulation cases in the whole range of exciting periods alternatively the resonance frequency could be easily obtained by means of the spectral analysis of the roll signal in resonance cases but such technique would not be effective in all other cases the ships analysed in the present study have been chosen because hull data are available in literature and the accuracy of the 6 dof simulated data was already discussed in previous works acanfora et al 2017a acanfora and rizzuto 2019 despite these ships have in the current loading conditions a range of variation of resonance periods limited to only a few seconds they have been useful in testing the developed method indeed the two vessels feature different trends of gm vs roll angle see fig 5 and consequently different trends of tr vs roll angle as derived by a quasi static approach see fig 6 results of the developed method in the case of irregular waves resemble the outcomes of the reference approach provided the non linear resonance period is plotted vs large characteristic values of the roll amplitude distributions such as φ1 3 or φ1 10 this means that the quasi static variation in gmeq representing the stiffness term is governed by the highest roll angles of the irregular sea response in these cases the non linear resonance frequencies match quite well the trends expected on the hypothesis in reference see figs 9 11 even though it can be observed that the points tr φ1 3 and tr φ1 10 do not lie exactly on the reference curves but show a somewhat scattered behaviour in the whole roll amplitude range a possible explanation of this scattered behaviour might be ascribed to the choice of the wave components that are used for the generation of the irregular wave trains in the developed technique if the discretization of the wave spectrum becomes too coarse around the spectrum peak shifts in the calculated resonance period could be induced by minimal variations in the spectral shape another source of uncertainty could be due to the fact that in the simulations of the ship dynamics in irregular waves also cross couplings between different motions are modelled indeed large variations in sway and yaw might affect the time history of the roll response in presence of low frequency manoeuvring motions see acanfora and rizzuto 2019 the emd filtering should be of help in mitigating these effects but may be not enough a further analysis was carried out investigating the dependency of the non linear roll resonance period on the severity of the input sea this is done by plotting tr vs hs for a limited number of results of seatech d at fn 0 this plot see fig 12 shows increasing values of tr for hs greater than 7 m depending also on the zero crossing periods tz in a non linear system the response governed by the amplitude spectrum of the input might be also affected by the phase spectrum of the input this phenomenon becomes particularly relevant for large wave amplitudes and wave periods close to resonance as shown in fig 13 and in fig 14 6 conclusions the present paper rises the problem of the non linear modifications of the roll resonance period in irregular seas the variation can be studied in relation to the roll amplitude or to the input wave characteristics in both cases uncertainties arise but a better adherence to the physics of the phenomenon is achieved in the models in respect to a linear approximation with a constant resonance period the study has been carried out on two different hulls and the comparison of the results with a reference method supports the evidence that the resonance roll frequency of a ship exhibits non linear features therefore this paper points out two important aspects of resonance phenomenon that are relevant for a proper planning of ship route 1 the resonance period in irregular sea is ruled by the roll amplitude in a similar manner as for the regular sea it modifies based on the shape of the gz curve 2 the change in resonance period becomes relevant for increasing values of hs irregular seas with moderate wave amplitudes are less sensitive to non linear resonance conversely when non linear resonance is expected it is affected by several input parameters such as the amplitude spectrum and the phase spectrum of the irregular sea these outcomes bring out the need of carefully considering the parameters to be adopted for a reliable identification of safe operational conditions especially in view of autonomous navigation analysis based on the fixed value of resonance period i e based on the natural roll frequency could not predict dangerous scenarios characterized by very large roll motions where significant modifications in the resonance behaviour could happen this is relevant for all ships that feature a peculiar gz curve leading to a wide range of variation in resonance periods therefore it is suggested that studies involving resonance period as a critical threshold should instead account for a proper range of resonance periods selected for the specific case declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
22129,in setting a safe route for a ship one of the problems to face is represented by excessive roll motions deriving from resonance phenomena in adverse weather conditions an effective prediction of the roll motion amplification is related to a proper mathematical modelling of the ship motions linear models may result to be inadequate in case of large roll motions where non linear effects dominate this paper investigates the roll response resonance in irregular waves the developed method aims at demonstrating the influence of the non linear immersed hull geometry as already acknowledged in literature for regular seas a 6 dof non linear model is applied for generating the time histories of ship roll motions in irregular waves these are fed into an optimization routine able of finding the linear system focusing at its natural roll frequency that better approximates the non linear one at a certain mean roll amplitude the outcomes of this research are meant to support the estimation of roll resonance period accounting for non linearities of immersed hull geometry allowing for a more reliable solution of weather routing problems keywords ship dynamics non linear resonance 1 introduction the expansion of the global economy is facilitated by ocean going ships ship routing and ship scheduling are major determinants of the world fleet productivity the quantity of published research on ship routing and scheduling and related topics has almost doubled in the recent years christiansen et al 2013 decision support tools based on weather routing are of current interest concerning ship safety during navigation lin et al 2013 maki et al 2011 vettor and guedes soares 2016 expert sailors have gained experience about the best action to take at sea nevertheless the possibility of planning and following an optimal and safe route supported by dedicated tools is a valuable aid acanfora et al 2018 krata and szlapczynska 2018 moreover reliable and consolidated methods are expected to operate autonomously in the future aawa 2016 decisions regarding the ship route are usually made according to the encountered sea conditions krata and szłapczyńska 2012 perera and soares 2017 one of the main concern is the avoidance of synchronous and parametric roll resonance acanfora et al 2017a krata and szlapczynska 2018 these two dangerous phenomena involving excessive motions and loads on the ship acanfora et al 2017b are caused by encountered wave periods equal to the natural roll period of the ship and half of it respectively belenky et al 2006 it is well acknowledged that linear numerical methods are not suited for modelling parametric roll resonance moreover they might lead to inaccurate predictions of synchronous roll resonance as well acanfora and matusiak 2014 generally the resonance frequency might depend on the amplitude of the oscillations this non linear phenomenon has been observed both numerically and experimentally based on regular sea investigations falzarano and mulk 1994 francescutto and contento 1999 concerning an isolated body in open seas in case of a linear system with small damping the resonance or natural frequency is identified as the maximum value in the response amplitude operator rao corresponding also to a 90 value of the response phase operator in ship dynamics rao effectively identifies a transfer function as known experimentally the same frequency can be identified as the one corresponding to the free response of the system when displaced from the equilibrium position and let free not subjected to external forces the present paper deals with the non linear dynamics of ships so the concept of linear superposition of frequency contents and all inherent implications are no more valid in a rigorous sense however in the paper non linear ship motion responses computed in the time domain will be analysed in terms of equivalent linear systems providing pseudo raos whose maximum values will be interpreted as non linear resonances the paper builds on the trends that the resonance frequencies show as a function of the output and input level weather routing tools that implement the linear approach based on the equality of natural roll period of the ship tn with the peak period of the encountered wave spectrum tp could lead to inaccurate predictions of dangerous scenarios actually it is recommended to consider as critical all synchronous roll cases characterized by an encounter wave period te within a range close to the natural roll period of the ship imo 2007 in bennedict et al 2006 this range is assumed as 0 8 tn te 1 1 while in krata and wawrzynski 2017 the authors select the critical range corresponding to resonance periods based on constant roll amplitude applications wawrzyński 2018 wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b in ship rolling sources of nonlinearity are in principle identified in all the dynamic terms of the motion equations inertial dissipative and elastic the latter two have been analysed in bulian and francescutto 2013 krüger and kluwe 2008 wawrzyński and krata 2016b while in wawrzynski and krata 2016a a method was provided for estimating the ship resonance frequency at large roll amplitudes depending on an effective i e non linear variation of the restoring actions the same approach has been used in wawrzyński 2018 for studying bi stability and bifurcation phenomena based on 1 dof modelling for regular waves in wawrzynski and krata 2016a the roll amplitudes at different frequencies obtained for several amplitudes of the exciting roll moment are shown it is pointed out that for large amplitude roll motions induced by large input wave amplitudes one should be careful in defining a single invariant resonance period of a ship the issue of a shift of the resonance frequency of the roll response is well acknowledged and covered for regular sea modelling but a comprehensive study addressing the problem in irregular waves is still missing in acanfora et al 2017a it is observed that large synchronous and parametric roll motions in irregular waves occur at a resonance frequency coherent with the method presented in wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b rather than with the natural roll frequency of the ship corresponding to gm based imo recommended method based on the constant invariant stiffness of the linear model in those references the resonance frequency is related to the constant roll amplitude induced by a regular wave i e is referred to a response characteristic coherently with a non linear analysis of the phenomenon a characteristic of the system depends on the response however in irregular sea the roll response does not have a constant amplitude it follows that a reference value for the oscillations might be of difficult definition irregular seas in time domain simulations are generated by linear superposition of a set of regular waves whose amplitudes and frequencies depend on a theoretical wave spectrum however different irregular wave trains could be obtained by the same theoretical amplitude spectrum and lead to different ship non linear responses acanfora and rizzuto 2019 with different energy contents in other words the behaviour of the non linear ship system depends not only on the input wave amplitude spectrum but also on the phase spectrum therefore an interpretation of ship resonance is provided also in terms of input characteristics focusing on the phase spectrum in this paper equivalent linear transfer functions are derived from the analysis of time histories regarding irregular wave trains and the corresponding simulations of roll motions for two vessels a containership and a ro ro pax ship the frequency corresponding to the peak of the derived rao is considered as roll resonance frequency and the dependence of such frequency is studied with reference to parameters identifying both the input wave train and the output roll motion this procedure is applied systematically to a wide range of irregular sea states for the above mentioned hulls particularly prone to large roll motions the present study is meant to develop previous investigations limited to regular wave trains francescutto and contento 1999 wawrzyński 2018 wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b the original aspect of this research is the identification of trends of the resonance roll period in irregular waves that is currently missing in the technical literature in this paper a 6 dof blended non linear model is used for generating roll motions from irregular sea state realizations in time domain this choice allows a more general modelling of ship dynamics for irregular waves it is considered quite unnatural to derive non linear damping coefficients from roll decay experiments and insert these into numerical simulations in which large motions and couplings are attained neves 2016 moreover in wawrzynski and krata 2016a it is stated that an alteration of the roll damping coefficient causes very limited influence on the resonance frequency when the same rolling amplitude is presumed considering in addition that the focus of this research is about the effects of the non linearities of hull geometry on ship resonance period viscous roll damping is disregarded indeed this assumption facilitates the generation of large amplitude roll motions for the same reason the analysis is limited to beam wave scenarios the next sections introduce the procedure followed in this paper in the first part the numerical simulation model for generating ship dynamics in irregular sea is described then the optimization problem and the solving algorithm are presented before feeding the optimization routine the roll response is filtered by means of empirical model decomposition in the following a brief description of this technique and the motivations for its utilization are provided the analyses are carried out on two hulls whose data are available in acanfora et al 2017a kukkanen 2012 the outcomes regarding the roll resonance periods are discussed and compared with the critical range as proposed in literature bennedict et al 2006 krata and wawrzynski 2017 an additional calculation is carried out to show the influence of the spectrum of the phases on the development of resonance phenomena finally conclusions are drawn 2 calculation of the resonance frequency of a ship in irregular sea 2 1 non linear numerical model for the simulations the 6 dof non linear model utilized for generating the time histories of the ship response in irregular waves is based on a so called blended or hybrid method bulian and francescutto 2013 matusiak 2013 the convolution integral technique is applied for the use in the time domain of the radiation forces estimated in frequency by an application of the potential theory faltinsen 1990 viscous damping is disregarded non linearities regard mainly the froude krylov and the restoring forces and moments estimated on the effective wetted surface these represent the non linear stiffness parameter of the ship model whose effects on the resonance frequency are under investigation detailed descriptions about the 6 dof model can be found in matusiak 2013 acanfora and rizzuto 2019 it is worth underlining that this non linear method does not implement the gz curve for modelling restoring actions since the restoring forces are directly modelled by hydrostatic pressure integration on the hull discretized by means of panels the data collected from each numerical simulation are the time histories of the wave encountered by the ship at the center of gravity i e the origin of the body fixed reference frame and the corresponding 6 dof ship motions focusing on roll motions differently from wawrzynski and krata 2016a the aim is a more realistic modelling of ship dynamics allowing cross couplings that are suppressed by 1 dof roll model the choice of using a numerical model rather than experimental tests makes available a wider set of data accounting for several combinations of sea state and allowing for longer simulation time 2 2 system identification the rationale behind the proposed identification procedure is to derive the parameters of the optimal equivalent second order linearized system able to describe the relationship between the input wave and the resulting ship rolling motion an equivalent linear ship response model is sought where all non linearities are removed the natural frequency of the linearized system is obtained in correspondence to the maximum value of the rao to this aim a preliminary processing of the roll numerical signals by the well known empirical mode decomposition is performed this sub section is organized as follows the reasons for the use of the empirical mode decomposition are highlighted and its fundamentals are briefly introduced later the optimization routine for obtaining the linear system is explained 2 2 1 empirical mode decomposition in brief empirical mode decomposition emd is an adaptive time space analysis method suitable for processing series in the time domain feldman 2009 rato et al 2008 it can be compared to other widely recognized methods in the relevant literature like fourier transforms and wavelet decomposition the authors believe that in respect to the other mentioned methods emd exhibits significant advantages due to its inherent ability to tackle non stationary and non linear signals like the case under investigation acanfora and rizzuto 2019 as far as the current application is concerned the use of emd is aimed at filtering and processing data directly in the time domain in other words the authors propose to derive the dominant mode by exploiting the sifting process which is the core of the empirical mode decomposition procedure this filtering allows the regularization of the roll signal and the consequent improvement of the computation burden for the optimization procedure as well known in the specific literature emd permits to represent a certain signal in terms of a sum of intrinsic mode functions exhibiting a time behaviour close to the elementary harmonic ones in other words the assigned signal y t can be decomposed in the following way 1 y t k a k t c o s 0 t ω k τ d τ where ak t and ωk t are the instantaneous amplitude and the angular radian frequency respectively both ak t and ωk t are always positive and slowly changing along the time the filtered roll signal yf t corresponds to the first intrinsic mode function imf1 i e the result of first sifting process of the signal y t see fig 7 this is supported by the observation that in the current applications the highest energy content is associated with the first mode 2 2 2 optimization routine the objective of the optimization routine is to find the transfer function g jω in frequency domain which is able to reproduce the relationship between a known input x jω and a known output yf jω which are the irregular wave x t and the filtered roll signal yf t expressed in frequency domain respectively once the filtered signal yf t is achieved the optimization can be fed the aim is to search for parameters of the transfer function 2 g j ω k ω n 2 ω 2 2 j ζ ωω n ω n 2 k ω 2 ω n 2 2 ζ j ω ω n 1 where k ζ and ωn are the gain the damping and the natural frequency of the linear system respectively the parameter estimations are carried out by minimizing the following objective function 3 f g j ω x j ω y f j ω 2 where 3 expresses the norm of the discrepancy between the filtered output and the reconstructed signal by means of a proper second order transfer function the minimization of the objective function 3 is analytically performed by employing the technique reported in cheres and eydelzon 2000 actually by a suitable change of variables the nonlinear minimization can be converted in a linear estimator problem providing the optimal values of interest since the focus of the current paper is the resonance angular frequency of the roll signal the only parameter collected from the optimization routine is ωn it is assumed that the resonance period of the linearized system is tr 2π ωn a sequence illustrating the procedures explained in the section is provided in fig 1 3 case study the above procedure is carried out on two different hulls a ro ro pax ship and a containership respectively named in the following seatech d and c11 respectively kukkanen 2012 silva et al 2010 exposed to irregular beam waves the main particulars of the two hulls are reported in table 1 for the purpose of the present computations the c11 hull is assumed with a vertical coordinate of the center of gravity vcg 15 34 m this value actually differs from the reference full loading condition of this containership but this change allows for a natural roll period within a realistic range of wave periods the change is deemed necessary to facilitate the onset of large roll motions in beam waves the natural roll period tn and the metacentric height gm0 of the two vessels at equilibrium are derived from numerically simulated roll decay tests and inclining tests respectively it is worth reminding that neither tn nor gm0 are used as input variable in the simulations and these numerical tests pinpoint their effective values a sample of the simulated roll decay for seatech d vessel is presented in fig 2 for fn 0 and in fig 3 for fn 0 15 showing the time history on the left hand side and the fft analysis on the right hand side respectively the same info for the c11 hull are arranged in fig 4 for fn 0 15 only looking at figs 2 and 3 effects of the ship speed on damping modelled by convolution integral of radiation damping in potential flow cummins 1962 are clearly visible in the amplitudes of the decaying motion the increase in fn however modifies the natural roll period of the ship of less than 0 05 s for the purpose of the study this contribution is disregarded and it is assumed that the roll period of the ship is the same at both investigated speeds i e fn 0 and fn 0 15 the simulated inclining test consists in the application of an external heeling moment mh to the hull initially in still water in the equilibrium position i e at zero heel once the new equilibrium is found the heel angle φ is read and collected the heeling moment divided by the hull displacement identifies the stability arm gz for small angles as known the metacentric height is obtained as derivative this technique works up to the maximum lever the remaining points are taken from hydrostatic calculations the gz curves for both hulls are shown in fig 5 it is also possible to note that the righting arms at large angles are underestimated by the line with slope gm0 for the c11 hull while they are overestimated for the seatech d the data concerning seatech d in irregular beam waves used in input to the developed method correspond to irregular waves in a range between hs 2 5 m 8 5 m and tz 4 5 s 15 5 s at zero speed i e froude number fn 0 and in a range hs 2 5 m 9 5 m and tz 9 5 s 13 5 s at fn 0 15 they are modelled by n 30 wave components and jonswap spectrum is assumed the roll motions are obtained by 6 dof simulations of 2 h with a sample period of 0 35 s the roll time histories regarding c11 are obtained by 6 dof simulations in irregular beam waves with fn 0 15 in a range of hs 4 5 m 12 5 m and tz 10 5 s 16 5 s a number n 30 wave components and a jonswap spectrum are used simulations last 1 h with a sample time of 0 25 s in both cases the largest simulated hs is taken equal to the ship freeboard at the static waterline for the c11 hull the data regarding fn 0 were disregarded since during the simulations the ship often capsized prior developing stable large roll motions for all simulations the jonswap discrete spectra are defined by sample angular frequencies that are randomly chosen and unevenly spaced this is usually done to enforce the generation of non repeatable wave trains from a given wave spectrum acanfora and rizzuto 2019 matusiak 2013 3 1 calculation of the resonance period by quasi static approach the approach for the calculation of the resonance roll period tr that has been developed and validated assuming regular sea in wawrzynski and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b is briefly described and applied hereby we refer to this method as a quasi static one since in evaluating the roll period it only replaces the metacentric height gm0 with an equivalent stiffness value gmeq 4 t r φ a c 0 gm eq φ a in 4 gmeq φa denotes the equivalent value of the transverse metacentric height of the ship for a specified rolling amplitude φa the equivalent metacentric height is calculated as follows based on both the restoring and the dynamic levers 5 gm eq φ a 0 φ a gz φ d φ φ a 2 gz φ a 2 φ a the constant c0 contained in 4 depends on the roll radius of inertia of the ship including added mass contribution indeed c0 can be estimated at the initial equilibrium as see table 1 6 c 0 t n gm 0 fig 6 shows the resonance periods tr for the c11 and seatech d hulls by applying 4 6 as function of the constant amplitude φa the two curves clearly show peculiar shapes and trends of the periods at different amplitudes the range of variation of the periods is of almost 2 s for both hulls 4 results in this section the results obtained from the computations on the two hulls are presented the resonance roll periods tr obtained by the developed method are compared with the rolling periods estimated by quasi static approach as function of constant roll amplitudes since the aim is to compare responses to irregular seas with constant amplitude waves the problem of associating a reference roll amplitude to the response to irregular waves arises one of the drawbacks of the analysis in wawrzynski and krata 2016a is due to the fact the non linearity in the roll response is observed by only changing the input wave amplitude as single wave components are fed in input to the system the impact of the phases between components is not evaluated to tackle this problem a further analysis is carried out referring the resonance frequencies to the input wave train characterized in terms of amplitudes and phases more specifically an additional investigation is carried out comparing the resonance frequency results for irregular waves obtained by the same amplitude spectrum but different phase spectra 4 1 identification of reference roll amplitude despite the emd technique includes a regularization of the roll signal still it does not produce a pure regular outcome an example of application of emd on a simulated roll signal performed in matlab can be found in fig 7 for the c11 hull tz 13 5 s hs 10 0 m the first intrinsic mode function imf1 of each simulated roll signal is fed in input to the method presented in section 3 for the estimation of tr the filtered signal improves the performance of the optimization procedure reducing odd outcomes however when dealing with the analysis of a reference value of roll motions the problem still needs attention the aim is to derive a single roll amplitude representative of the irregular one to be associated with the corresponding tr several approaches were considered and investigated among these the root mean square rms values of the peaks of the absolute signal was examined fig 8 shows the absolute value of the filtered signal yf t φf t for yf t see fig 7 together with the corresponding peaks marked by red dots it is possible to observe how the rms of the peaks rmsφf yellow line falls quite far from the largest ones indeed since also smaller peaks are included in the calculation of rms value this might lead to underestimate the reference amplitude in other words we are assuming that smaller amplitude components have a weaker contribution and should not be associated with tr in order to limit the influence of smaller roll peaks the significant value of φf t is estimated i e the average of one third highest value of the peaks φf1 3 commonly used for the definition of significant wave height hs the purple line in fig 8 shows how φf1 3 places above rmsφf and thus less far from the maximum peaks following the same line of thought i e aiming at reference values closer to the maximum peaks the average of one tenth third highest value of the peaks φf1 10 is calculated and shown in fig 8 green line based on these considerations and on the obtained results shown in the following sub section φ1 3 and φ1 10 values are therefore identified as possible reference roll amplitudes 4 2 obtained results and comparisons on the basis of what above for each ship the average of one third highest value and the average of one tenth highest value of the absolute roll peaks were computed from the filtered roll signal i e first intrinsic mode function imf1 see fig 7 and associated to tr the analysis provides couples of tr φ1 3 or alternatively tr φ1 10 that once plotted show a scattered behaviour in fig 9 the resonance periods obtained for the seatech d hull in irregular beam waves at zero speed are shown on the left hand side they are plotted as function of φ1 3 conversely on the right hand side as function of φ1 10 a parabolic data fitting is carried out by 2nd order polynomial for both cases one could note that the obtained results fairly match the reference curve obtained by the quasi static method up to 40 indeed the choice of φ1 10 for approximating φa seems to provide a better agreement than φ1 3 the majority of the obtained points accumulates for small φ1 10 and φ1 3 values because several cases are characterized by moderate wave amplitudes together with encounter wave periods far from ship resonance thus not triggering large roll responses this explains the reason for concentrating the range of tz to cases closer to resonance and the range of hs to the highest waves respectively in the remaining applications in fig 10 the couples of points tr φ1 3 and tr φ1 10 referring to the case fn 0 15 are properly added on top of the results shown in fig 9 the quadratic data fittings result in curves almost overlapping the ones corresponding to fn 0 the main difference stands in the maximum attainable values of φ1 10 and φ1 3 affected by the increase in damping in fig 11 results for the c11 hull are shown for fn 0 15 also in this case the quadratic data fitting finely matches the trend of the quasi static method for this ship more moderate values φ1 10 and φ1 3 are obtained from the numerical simulations limiting the comparison up to 30 it is worth underlining that the two hulls chosen for the study are characterized by opposite trends of the resonance period up to 35 for c11 it decreases with the roll amplitude conversely for seatech it generally increases this behaviour is well drawn by the presented outcomes 4 3 influence of sea spectrum characteristics on ship dynamics close to resonance in the preceding section the results obtained for irregular seas in terms of roll resonance frequency have been interpreted as function of the roll amplitude following the same approach outlined in wawrzynski and krata 2016a for regular waves in this section the same results are interpreted in terms of input sea spectra i e both amplitude and phase spectra the time histories of the input wave are all generated by a linear model in line with the linear properties of the equivalent raos used to derive the resonance frequency to the scope the resonance period results shown in fig 9 i e tr for seatech d at fn 0 are arranged as function of hs and tz nominal values in fig 12 the results correspond to the irregular wave trains generated by theoretical jonswap spectra discretized by n 30 regular wave components with hs ranging between 2 5 m 8 5 m and with a limited number of tz it is possible to observe that the resonance period remains almost constant up to hs 7 m for all investigated tz values instead for hs 7 m there are different estimations of tr based on the tz value of the wave train that generated it the largest variation can be observed for tz around 10 5 s 11 5 s the corresponding theoretical peak periods of the wave spectra tp 1 286tz lloyd 1998 fall within the roll resonance period range it is worth underlying that based on the implemented technique the tz of the simulated wave train the symbol means values calculated from the time history increases of at least 0 5 s from the nominal tz value in the present case this means that the nominal tz values 10 5 s and 11 5 s inputted to the theoretical spectrum return wave trains characterized respectively by a simulated tz around 11 0 s and 12 0 s and thus to tp of 14 2 s and 15 4 s more details about the wave train generation from the theoretical spectrum can be found in acanfora and rizzuto 2019 for the remaining tz values the differences in the obtained tr values reduce especially moving far from 10 5 s 11 5 s due to the non linearities contained in the time histories of the roll response used in the analysis the equivalent raos and the inherent positions of their maximum the resonance frequency are dependent not only on the amplitude spectra of the input sea but also on the phase spectra to show the influence of the phase spectrum of the irregular waves on ship dynamics and resonance behaviour several wave trains are generated based on the same theoretical wave amplitude spectrum but with different phase spectra this analysis was limited to sea states with tz 9 5 s rather close to the resonance range and different hs values 2 5 4 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 m results are arranged in fig 13 it can be noted that larger effects on resonance period are mainly caused by differences in the amplitude spectra however for large hs values also differences in the phase spectra based on the same amplitude spectrum contribute to modify ship dynamics thus increasing the gap in the estimated tr for the amplitude spectrum having hs 8 5 m a peculiar behaviour is observed the tr results obtained by several phase spectra bifurcate on two different values that are tr 14 5 s and tr 15 9 s however the significant roll outcomes corresponding to each case do not show any bifurcation and they accumulate around the same values see fig 14 notwithstanding this the φ1 3 and φ1 10 referring to tr 15 9 s are slight larger than the other ones these outcomes suggest that the time histories might exhibit two different resonance behaviours especially when roll amplitudes become considerably large since the developed technique allows identifying only one resonance period the dominant one seems to be selected depending on the adopted phase spectrum 5 discussions the developed method can be considered a quite efficient tool for estimating the resonance frequency of a non linear system it does not require a complex computational algorithm such those based on volterra series carassale and kareem 2010 and it allows for the estimation of resonance frequency by analysing simulation cases in the whole range of exciting periods alternatively the resonance frequency could be easily obtained by means of the spectral analysis of the roll signal in resonance cases but such technique would not be effective in all other cases the ships analysed in the present study have been chosen because hull data are available in literature and the accuracy of the 6 dof simulated data was already discussed in previous works acanfora et al 2017a acanfora and rizzuto 2019 despite these ships have in the current loading conditions a range of variation of resonance periods limited to only a few seconds they have been useful in testing the developed method indeed the two vessels feature different trends of gm vs roll angle see fig 5 and consequently different trends of tr vs roll angle as derived by a quasi static approach see fig 6 results of the developed method in the case of irregular waves resemble the outcomes of the reference approach provided the non linear resonance period is plotted vs large characteristic values of the roll amplitude distributions such as φ1 3 or φ1 10 this means that the quasi static variation in gmeq representing the stiffness term is governed by the highest roll angles of the irregular sea response in these cases the non linear resonance frequencies match quite well the trends expected on the hypothesis in reference see figs 9 11 even though it can be observed that the points tr φ1 3 and tr φ1 10 do not lie exactly on the reference curves but show a somewhat scattered behaviour in the whole roll amplitude range a possible explanation of this scattered behaviour might be ascribed to the choice of the wave components that are used for the generation of the irregular wave trains in the developed technique if the discretization of the wave spectrum becomes too coarse around the spectrum peak shifts in the calculated resonance period could be induced by minimal variations in the spectral shape another source of uncertainty could be due to the fact that in the simulations of the ship dynamics in irregular waves also cross couplings between different motions are modelled indeed large variations in sway and yaw might affect the time history of the roll response in presence of low frequency manoeuvring motions see acanfora and rizzuto 2019 the emd filtering should be of help in mitigating these effects but may be not enough a further analysis was carried out investigating the dependency of the non linear roll resonance period on the severity of the input sea this is done by plotting tr vs hs for a limited number of results of seatech d at fn 0 this plot see fig 12 shows increasing values of tr for hs greater than 7 m depending also on the zero crossing periods tz in a non linear system the response governed by the amplitude spectrum of the input might be also affected by the phase spectrum of the input this phenomenon becomes particularly relevant for large wave amplitudes and wave periods close to resonance as shown in fig 13 and in fig 14 6 conclusions the present paper rises the problem of the non linear modifications of the roll resonance period in irregular seas the variation can be studied in relation to the roll amplitude or to the input wave characteristics in both cases uncertainties arise but a better adherence to the physics of the phenomenon is achieved in the models in respect to a linear approximation with a constant resonance period the study has been carried out on two different hulls and the comparison of the results with a reference method supports the evidence that the resonance roll frequency of a ship exhibits non linear features therefore this paper points out two important aspects of resonance phenomenon that are relevant for a proper planning of ship route 1 the resonance period in irregular sea is ruled by the roll amplitude in a similar manner as for the regular sea it modifies based on the shape of the gz curve 2 the change in resonance period becomes relevant for increasing values of hs irregular seas with moderate wave amplitudes are less sensitive to non linear resonance conversely when non linear resonance is expected it is affected by several input parameters such as the amplitude spectrum and the phase spectrum of the irregular sea these outcomes bring out the need of carefully considering the parameters to be adopted for a reliable identification of safe operational conditions especially in view of autonomous navigation analysis based on the fixed value of resonance period i e based on the natural roll frequency could not predict dangerous scenarios characterized by very large roll motions where significant modifications in the resonance behaviour could happen this is relevant for all ships that feature a peculiar gz curve leading to a wide range of variation in resonance periods therefore it is suggested that studies involving resonance period as a critical threshold should instead account for a proper range of resonance periods selected for the specific case declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
