20220,this paper examines the hydroelastic response of a monopile structure supporting an offshore wind turbine a new numerical simulation tool is presented coupling a nonlinear potential flow solver to a structural model based on modal superposition the hydrodynamic solver is based on the weak scatterer ws approach and assumes small perturbations of the incident flow a finite element method fem solver is used to compute the modal parameters which are then superposed to compute the dynamics of the system in time domain small deformations are assumed in the coupling the two theories are tightly coupled in time domain the theory of the coupling is fully described in the paper the new coupled solver ws cn fem is then applied to the case of a large diameter monopile results are compared to simulations using the morison equation to compute the hydrodynamic loads and a beam element fem model to compute the response of the structure and to experimental measurements made on a monopile based offshore wind turbine model the physical model has froude scaled geometry and natural frequencies which allows an accurate validation of the hydroelastic numerical models including realistic flexible modes of the structure and wave structure interaction the results of ws cn fem show a good agreement with the experimental measurements and in particular on the first and second mudline bending moments harmonics in a series of regular waves of various wave steepness graphical abstract keywords hydroelastic coupling nonlinear hydrodynamics weak scatterer approximation offshore wind turbine foundation 1 introduction the size of offshore wind turbines is increasing and now reaching over 200 m in rotor diameter similarly the size and weight of the foundations either bottom fixed or floating are also increasing hydroelastic analysis may hence become essential to estimate internal loads in the platforms and foundations as for any other very large structure at sea the challenge shall be overcome for both bottom fixed and floating wind turbines for hydrodynamically slender structures e g jacket foundations some monopiles or spar platforms morison s equation faltinsen 1990 can be applied these solvers are easy to implement and can be coupled with e g a finite element solver for straightforward hydroelastic analysis inducing a relatively low simulation cost the undisturbed incident waves used in these models can include fully nonlinear wave kinematics such as the rienecker fenton model for regular waves rienecker and fenton 1981 or a high order spectral hos model for irregular sea states ducrozet et al 2014 for larger geometries when viscous effects are negligible potential flow theory should be used these solvers require a mesh of the wet body surface and a hydroelastic coupled analysis is not straightforward a one way coupling is usually used to design large floating structures dnv 2018 considering the hydrodynamic loads computed on a rigid body and thereafter applied on a finite element mesh to compute the internal loads the mitigation of the hydrodynamic loads induced by the structure deformation is hence not included in the analysis for floating wind turbines numerous numerical simulation tools have been recently developed robertson et al 2014 mostly coupling offshore design tools including various hydrodynamic solvers to aero elastic solvers used to design wind turbines they often model a flexible wind turbine tower and rotor supported by a rigid platform this form of rigid flexible coupling ignores the flexible modes of the platforms the main alternatives which have been explored up to now to analyse floating wind turbines platforms flexibility use either linear potential flow theory or morison s equation 1 the platform can be simulated using a boundary element method bem and modelled as a number of interacting bodies linked with each other using beam finite elements guignier et al 2016 2 hydrodynamic pressures computed by a bem on a single rigid body can be projected on flexible platform sections for calculation of the deformation luan et al 2017 3 flexible modes can be included in the linear potential flow solver bem and integrated in time domain with the servo aero elastic model borg et al 2016 4 morison s equation can be used on a rigid or flexible platform formed of slender members xu et al 2019 for both bottom fixed and floating wind turbine foundations including nonlinear hydrodynamics can be important for the estimation of fatigue loading or ultimate design loads where waves kinematics and induced loads are very nonlinear schløer et al 2016 for hydrodynamically slender structures morison s equation allows the inclusion of nonlinear wave kinematics for example compared to simulations using linear wave kinematics simulations of a semi submersible with nonlinear wave kinematics resulted in approximately 25 larger extreme mooring line tensions xu et al 2019 for increasing structure diameter however near field diffraction which is not captured by morison s equation become more significant although first order solutions such as the maccamy fuchs equation exist combining near field diffraction effects with nonlinear waves remains challenging these challenges were studied in connection with the ringing response of gravity based platforms and tension leg platforms for oil and gas developments faltinsen et al 1995 stansberg 1997 grue and huseby 2002 hydroelastic analysis of such large volume platforms often consider higher order loads applied as point loads on a simplified approximation of the structure such as a single degree of freedom system tromans et al 2006 or distributed on a multi degree of freedom model gaidai and krokstad 2014 without modelling the effect of the structure s deformations on the hydrodynamic loads high order diffraction loads acting on bottom fixed cylindrical foundations in intermediate water depth can also be computed analytically using kristiansen and faltinsen s kf extension of the fnv model faltinsen et al 1995 kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 but it is applicable to simple geometries and assumes long waves relative to the structure the kf model has been shown to overestimate the third order forces for steep waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 both the kf model and rainey s model tend to overpredict the first mode response of a fully flexible monopile in irregular waves compared to experimental results suja thauvin et al 2020 fully non linear potential flow models have also been developed ferrant 1998 ferrant et al 2003 but they suffer from important numerical instabilities alternatively weakly non linear potential flow models such as the weak scatterer approach have been used to compute the ringing response of a bottom hinged rigid monopile structure in focused waves zhang and teng 2021 nonlinear coupled models have been developed for ships including forward speed kim and kim 2014 lee et al 2020 showing good performance this paper presents a similar model that has been developed for offshore floating wind turbines ws cn fem a weakly nonlinear potential flow solver based on the weak scatterer theory ws cn has been developed in centrale nantes letournel et al 2018 chauvigné 2016 wuillaume 2019 it has been recently coupled to a low order finite element solver based on euler bernoulli beam model which assumes small deformations of slender beams the developed solver is first tested and validated on the case of bottom fixed wind turbines in this paper before being tested for floating structures in future works the paper presents the theory behind the non linear hydroelastic coupling ws cn fem it presents the weak scatterer approach the structural model and the tight coupling between the two through an explicit coupled equation system coupled simulations of a representative monopile supported offshore wind turbine are then performed and compared to experimental measurements performed on a scaled large diameter flexible monopile bachynski et al 2020 in regular waves simulations from sima sintef 2021a using morison s equation and nonlinear wave kinematics are also presented in the comparison 2 hydroelastic weak scatterer theory based solver the nonlinear potential flow solver ws cn has been developed at centrale nantes since 2011 it initially was developed to model underwater wave energy converters letournel et al 2018 and it has been lately improved to account for free surface piercing chauvigné 2016 and interacting bodies wuillaume 2019 ws cn has now been coupled to a structural solver to solve the hydroelastic coupling on offshore wind turbines substructures the new coupling is called ws cn fem 2 1 structure model the euler bernoulli beam theory which assumes small deformations has been implemented in a new solver called beampy the finite elements are linearized and the stiffness and mass matrices k and m of the system are computed at the initial position and kept constant throughout the simulations the hydrodynamic solver requires an explicit scheme for solving the equation of motion which necessitates time steps shorter than the shortest natural period in the structure model in order to lower the cpu cost of the simulations the equation of motion is therefore solved using modal superposition a sufficient number of modes needs to be considered for an accurate modelling of the dynamics and high order modes are ignored in order to lengthen the integration time step while keeping the simulations stable a preliminary convergence study is hence performed to define the needed number of modes in the analysis before simulating the response of the structure in time domain a modal analysis is performed if the system is floating a linear stiffness corresponding to hydrostatic and mooring stiffness is added to constrain all rigid degrees of freedom in this modal analysis hydrodynamic added mass is ignored the modal matrix ψ has the shape n n o d e s n m o d e s and gives the structural mode shapes for the considered system in time domain the hydrodynamic added mass is accounted for in the hydrodynamic forces calculation a convergence analysis is firstly performed in time domain in order to define a sufficient number of modes allowing to accurately represent the structural dynamics in the water this is detailed in section 2 3 rayleigh damping is used to define the structural damping matrix as the linear combination of mass and stiffness matrices c μ m λ k in time domain the equation of motion takes the form given in eq 1 where y is the modal response amplitude f h the vector of hydrodynamic forces and f e x t the vector of other external forces 1 ψ t m ψ y ψ t c ψ y ψ t k ψ y ψ t f h f e x t where the position vector x is obtained from the amplitudes of the modal responses y as written in eq 2 2 x ψ y the procedure used for simulations with ws cn fem is described in fig 1 2 2 flow model let us consider a body undergoing motions in a fluid domain its motions are decomposed into rigid and flexible motions i e structural deformations in this fluid structure coupling the fluid problem is linearized around the surface of the rigid body at its instantaneous position disregarding structural deformation the instantaneous position is defined by the superposition of the rigid modes neglecting the flexible modes of the structure presented in section 2 1 the cylindrical fluid domain d is presented in fig 2 it is delimited by the side numerical tank walls s w the seabed s d the free surface s f s and the wet body surface s b the fluid domain d 0 is then delimited by s w s d s f s and the wet surface of the rigid body s b 0 for a bottom fixed foundation s b 0 corresponds to the surface of the body at rest the euler bernoulli theory assumes small linear deformations hence the wet surface of the body equals the wet surface of the associated rigid body 3 s b s b 0 the weak scatterer theory assumes an inviscid incompressible and irrotational flow the laplace equation is then written for the velocity potential 4 δ ϕ 0 the velocity potential ϕ and the free surface elevation η are decomposed into an incident undisturbed and a perturbed or scattered quantity the weak scatterer approach assumes that the perturbed quantity is small compared to the incident wave as in eq 5 the incident quantities can be computed using either airy linear wave theory or fully non linear rienecker fenton wave theory rienecker and fenton 1981 5 ϕ ϕ i ϕ p η η i η p with ϕ p o ϕ i η p o η i the far field condition 6 writes that the perturbed quantities are negligible when far from the body 6 ϕ p r 0 η p r 0 the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are written at the incident and undisturbed free surface elevation η i using a taylor expansion letournel et al 2018 the wet body surface is defined as the surface of the body below η i the exact intersection of the body mesh with the undisturbed free surface is hence calculated at each time step in the solver the slip boundary condition of the velocity potential is written on s b 0 accounting for the velocities induced by the deformations on the other domain boundaries a slip condition is written for the perturbed potential ϕ p on the side walls s w and on the full potential ϕ for the seabed s d a numerical absorbing beach is used on the outer area of the free surface s f s to avoid any reflection of the scattered wave the boundary conditions on the potential are written in eq 7 7 η t ϕ z ϕ η on s f s at z η i ϕ t g η 1 2 ϕ ϕ on s f s at z η i ϕ p n ϕ i n v n on the body wet surface s b 0 ϕ p n 0 on the numerical tank walls s w ϕ p n ϕ i n on the seabed s d v and n are respectively the velocity of a wet body mesh node and the normal vector at this node on s b 0 oriented outward from the body all terms of order o ϕ p 2 o η p 2 and o ϕ p η p are ignored the second green identity is written for the linearized fluid domain d 0 on its boundary s 0 for the perturbation potential ϕ p that satisfies the laplace equation and the rankine source green s function g at all points m 0 of s 0 it takes the form given in eq 8 8 ω m ϕ p m s 0 ϕ p m g n m p d s s 0 g m p ϕ p n m d s 0 ω m is explicitly written in eq 9 it can be interpreted as the solid angle of the surface s seen from the point m 9 ω m s 0 g n m p d s the fluid domain boundaries are discretized with triangular panels wuillaume 2019 except for the flat seabed on which a symmetry condition is applied the first boundary value problem bvp1 in eq 8 can be written as a linear system written in a matrix format in eq 10 10 g ϕ p h ϕ n p the vectors ϕ and ϕ n p respectively take the discrete values of ϕ p and ϕ n p ϕ p n on the domain mesh nodes g and h are called influence coefficients matrices and represent the influence of every node on every other node of the domain mesh this linear system of equations is solved to compute the flow state using a generalized minimal residual gmres solver the calculation of the hydrodynamic loads implies a fluid structure coupling detailed in section 2 3 the first developments of this hydrodynamic solver have been validated on rigid fixed and floating bodies immersed and surface piercing letournel 2014 chauvigné 2016 wuillaume 2019 the following theory has been developed and implemented to extend the capabilities of the solver to flexible bodies with small deformations 2 3 fluid structure coupling the hydrodynamic force vector is calculated by integration of the hydrodynamic pressure on the linearized wet surface of the hull s b 11 f h s b 0 p h n d s p h is the hydrodynamic pressure computed by the ws cn solver according to the bernoulli lagrange formula and to the weak scatterer hypothesis given in eq 5 p h shall be calculated as written in eq 12 12 p h ρ ϕ i t ϕ p t 1 2 ϕ i ϕ i ϕ i ϕ p g z in eq 12 the term ϕ p t is unknown the hydrodynamic force is then decomposed as in eq 13 where f 0 h is the integration of the known part of the pressure 13 f h f 0 h ρ s b 0 ϕ p t n d s solving the equation of motion 1 hence involves calculating both the modal acceleration y and the derivative of the scattered velocity potential with respect to time ϕ p t at the same time this coupled problem could be solved using an iteration process between the structure and fluid domains which would induce a very high cpu cost instead an implicit boundary method is used letournel et al 2018 writing a second boundary value problem to compute ϕ p t the second green identity links ϕ p t to its normal gradient 2 ϕ p n t on the wet hull surface similarly to eq 8 14 ω m ϕ p m t s 0 ϕ p p t g m p n d s s 0 2 ϕ p p n t g m p d s 0 this problem is solved using the boundary conditions given in eq 15 which are derived from the boundary conditions of the first problem given in eq 7 the conditions on the free surface are not detailed here 15 2 ϕ p t n 2 ϕ i t n on s d 2 ϕ p t n 0 on s w 2 ϕ p n t 2 ϕ i n t x m n q on s b 0 x m is the acceleration of a point m on the body wet surface calculated from y and q is a convection term that is calculated analytically letournel et al 2018 the second boundary value problem 14 the boundary condition on the wet surface 15 and the equation of motion 1 are written in a single linear system given in eq 16 it is solved at each time step using a gmres solver to compute ϕ p t and y 16 g ϕ p h ϕ n p ψ t m ψ y ψ t l ϕ p s b ψ t c ψ y ψ t k ψ y ψ t f 0 w s c f e x t ϕ n p s b 0 d ψ y ϕ n i s b 0 b q the influence coefficients matrices g and h are the same as in the first boundary value problem given in eq 10 the matrix l represents the integration of the time derivative of the scattered velocity potential ϕ p over s b 0 l is calculated based on the geometry of the body mesh only the matrix d and the vector b enable calculation of the mesh nodes accelerations as a function of the accelerations of the structural mesh nodes d and b are calculated as functions of the geometry of the body mesh and its velocity known at this step of the calculation the matrices l and d and vector b are computed based on the projection of the hydrodynamic and structural mesh on one another using standard euler bernoulli beam theory shape functions fig 3 represents the hydrodynamic mesh nodes p j corresponding to one beam element defined between the nodes m i 1 and m i 2 the coefficients of l d and b are computed analytically the vector q contains the discrete convection terms q seen in eq 15 this coupling is solved in the time domain and integrated using a 4th order runge kutta rk4 explicit integration as introduced in section 2 1 the structure response needs to be represented by a sufficient number of modes generally imposing a smaller time step than that of the hydrodynamic solver the objective is then to keep a good compromise between cpu cost and accuracy on the hydrodynamic time step with a smaller time step for the structural dynamics the chosen solution involves a secondary integration scheme for the structure to stably advance its dynamics in time this second rk4 scheme is synchronized with the primary rk4 scheme used to integrate the coupled system of eqs 16 starting from the coupled solution at a given time step it integrates the equation of motion of the structure using the computed hydrodynamic loads as a constant force until the next synchronous time step where the system 16 is solved this hybrid integration scheme has been verified and validated a demonstration is presented in appendix a 3 verification and validation 3 1 case study and experiments the study considers the dtu 10 mw wind turbine bak et al 2013 on a 9 m diameter monopile foundation velarde and bachynski 2017 subjected to different regular wave systems the ws cn fem coupling is compared to both a beam element finite element solver combined with morison s equation implemented in sima sintef 2021a and experimental measurements made on an offshore wind turbine model in hydroelastic similarity the numerical models of the studied wind turbine are based on a model of the model approach scaled up to full scaled in order to optimize the comparison with the experiments the aim of this case study is not to prove a better accuracy with a potential flow solver than with a morison based solver but to validate the theory presented in section 2 on the case of a bottom fixed structure before an application to offshore floating wind turbines wind induced loads and current induced loads are not considered in the analysis 3 1 1 experimental set up the experiments were performed by sintef ocean and ntnu in the small towing tank of ntnu in trondheim with a froude scaling factor of 50 bachynski et al 2020 as part of the was xl project sintef 2021b fig 4 presents the layout of the tank the waves are generated with a piston type wavemaker due to the short size of the tank the experiments could not completely avoid wake reflexion on the beach and dampers hence a wave reflection of approximately 4 is expected to be present in most presented results kristiansen et al 2017 in the following all quantities are given at full scale the monopile model is mounted on a rigid foundation below the seabed the wind turbine and the monopile are formed of a flexible backbone providing modal frequency similarity surrounded by a cylinder respecting froude similarity the water depth is 27 m and the tower top reaches 144 15 m above the seabed the total mass of the model without the rotor nacelle assembly rna is 2 652 1 0 6 kg and its centre of gravity is at 34 25 m above the seabed a mass of 9 55 1 0 5 kg representing the rna is added at the tower top in order to obtain a good agreement on the 1st fore aft bending mode frequency with the base case wind turbine fig 5 represents the wind turbine and foundation model the model is equipped with strain gauges at z 28 45 m just below the mudline 25 55 m 16 2 m and 0 m at the waterline 5 accelerometers are installed at z 2 7 m 13 5 m 50 m 90 m and 124 45 m we use the mudline bending moment calculated using strain gauges and the accelerations measured at the top of the rna at 118 4 m above the waterline as reference measurements to validate the models following euler bernoulli beam theory the bending moment around the y axis written m y is calculated at a given point from the external strain measurement ε following eq 17 where e is the young modulus i y y the second moment of area for the beam section and r is the distance from the exterior where the strain ε is measured to the beam axis 17 m y e i y y r ε static pullout tests carried out by hanging known masses connected to a pulley attached to the model at one of two known locations are used to calibrate the transformation from strain to bending moment and show excellent agreement with euler bernoulli beam theory the experimental set up is described by bachynski et al 2020 the positions of the strain gauges and accelerometers are marked as m y and a c c respectively in fig 5 a section view is also provided showing the backbone with the cylinder around it the surrounding cylindrical sections do not alter the bending stiffness of the backbone and the small gap between each cylinder section prevents the sections from being in contact when the structure deforms the mass and inertia of the cylinder sections is included in the numerical models and contributes to the desired mode shapes and frequencies the two first bending modes in the xoz plane have periods of t 1 3 97 s and t 2 0 656 s respectively the damping in the numerical models is calibrated based on experimental decay tests 3 1 2 nonlinear hydroelastic model the developed nonlinear hydroelastic coupling ws cn fem is used to analyse the considered case study as presented previously the boundaries of the fluid domain are meshed including the free surface and the outer boundaries a convergence analysis has been performed in the first place on both the time step length and on the mesh dimensions domain diameter and cells size the convergence analyses is not presented in this paper however the calculation parameters are given as follows 1 the time step used in the hydrodynamic solver is 0 1 s and the time step in the structural solver is 5 1 0 4 s 2 the fluid domain has a diameter equal to 3 wavelengths with an absorption beach of one wavelength on the outer boundaries 3 the mesh cell size is 0 7 m on the body boundaries and approximately 10 of the wavelength on the outer boundary the fluid domain mesh for a wave period of 6 s with 4600 nodes is presented in fig 6 a smoothing algorithm is applied every 5 time steps to the solution of the potential on the free surface in order to avoid numerical instability the input waves are computed using the fully non linear rienecker fenton wave model rienecker and fenton 1981 3 1 3 morison fem model ws cn fem is first compared to the numerical simulation tool sima sintef 2021a which for this study uses finite elements to model the structure response and a morison based hydrodynamic solver to compute the hydrodynamic loads for the sake of comparison against ws cn fem sima computes the loads with a drag coefficient c d 0 and the added mass coefficient c a is defined according to the analytical solution to the linear potential flow theory for a diffracting cylinder from maccamy and fuchs 1954 for each regular wave the loads are applied to the beam model euler bernoulli using stokes 2nd order wave kinematics the hydrodynamic loads are integrated up to the incident 2nd order wave elevation level and the velocity potential is extrapolated above the mean sea level z 0 using a linear extrapolation 3 1 4 load cases first decay tests are performed on the dry monopile and on the wet monopile in the wave tank a series of regular waves are then tested in the wave tank including several wave periods t 6 s 8 s and 10 s with various steepness defined by the ratio between wave height and wavelength following h λ 1 40 1 30 and 1 22 the considered regular waves are presented in table 1 the regular waves are also plotted in blue in fig 7 where the validity of wave force models is presented chakrabarti 1987 as a function of 1 the k r number such as k r π d λ where d is the cylinder diameter and λ the wavelength 2 the wave height to cylinder diameter ratio h d ratio similar to the keulegan carpenter number the diffraction region bottom right hand corner of fig 7 mostly refers to the linear potential flow theory as one can see most regular waves are outside the diffraction region which is expected for a monopile foundation the added mass coefficient used in sima calculated based on the maccamy and fuchs solution is also given in table 1 for each load case 3 2 modal analysis and decay tests decay tests were performed on the model outside and in the water and the corresponding acceleration measurements were used to identify the natural frequencies mode shapes and damping the 1st and 2nd fore aft bending mode frequencies and shapes are compared with the eigenvalue analysis from the numerical models as shown in fig 1 in the ws cn fem solver modal analysis is only carried out for the dry structure the 1st and 2nd dry modes shapes measured and calculated using sima and the structural solver of ws cn fem beampy are plotted in fig 8 the agreement between numerical models and experiments is very good for the wet case a time domain decay test simulation is performed using the non linear coupling previously presented the wet natural frequencies are then found from the decay simulation the observed and computed modes frequencies both dry and wet are given in table 2 the agreement between measurements and models is very satisfactory the 1st and 2nt mode periods computed by ws cn fem are slightly smaller than the measured ones with respectively 2 9 and 0 45 relative difference the mudline bending moment time series is presented in fig 9 comparing the measurements with the simulations from ws cn fem and sima a difference in the first mode period between ws cn fem and the experiments is observed the amplitude of the response shows a very good agreement between simulations and experiments 3 3 regular waves the model is studied in the regular wave conditions presented in section 3 1 4 the input waves in the numerical simulations are based on experimental measurements without the model using a wave probe located at the model s position w11 not represented in fig 4 the free surface elevation is plotted in fig 10 for the three investigated values of wave steepness h λ 1 40 1 30 and 1 22 and for the wave periods t 6 8 and 10 s the curves represent the free surface elevation in ws cn fem sima and the measurements at the model s position without the model and just next to the model at w8 in fig 4 with the model in place there is very good agreement between the undisturbed measured wave and the simulations the difference between the measurement at w8 and the empty tank measurement at w11 is mainly due to the wave diffraction on the cylinder it is particularly visible in fig 10 a when t 6 s and h λ 1 22 the computed and measured mudline bending moments are plotted in fig 11 for each wave at t 6 s fig 11 a the k r number is 0 5 and the keulegan carpenter number kc is sufficiently low so that the wave conditions are appropriate for application of the potential flow theory see fig 7 the agreement is very good except at h λ 1 22 where the two simulation tools tend to underestimate the amplitude of the response compared to the experiments this is discussed further with the harmonic analysis the mudline bending moment obtained in the t 8 s period regular wave is plotted in fig 11 b the response is large and it contains an important double frequency oscillation compared to responses at other wave periods the 2nd order hydrodynamic loads excite the first fore aft bending mode of the structure given in table 2 at a period of 3 9 s the accuracy on this case is poorer the response at the resonance period is very sensitive to the structural damping hence any uncertainty in the structural damping may induce large errors in the coupled models at t 10 s fig 11 c the k r number is lower and the morison based numerical model sima should be more appropriate to compute the hydrodynamic loads however the non linear potential flow model shows a very good agreement with the experiments and with sima the two first harmonics in the steady state mudline bending moment series are plotted in fig 12 the measurements are shown in grey indicating as well their uncertainty see appendix b when t 6 s fig 12 a the agreement between ws cn fem and the experiments is very good below 4 relative difference which is expected for the current values of k r and kc except for the first harmonic of the case at h λ 1 22 where the response is much larger in the experiments several factors may contribute to this underestimation of the response for t 6 s the diffraction due to the cylinder that is observed in the tank may result in the reflection of diffracted waves the large difference between the measured wave with and without the model w8 vs w11 in fig 11 suggests that reflections or diffraction may be more important for this case leading to larger loads in the experimental measurements additionally the underestimation of the ws cn fem solver in that case may be the result of the weak scatterer approximation which assumes a small perturbation on the incident flow potential and free surface elevation particularly the weak scatterer approach has been shown to poorly represent the run up on a free surface piercing cylinder chauvigné 2016 for the other cases t 8 s and 10 s the agreement is good on the first harmonic with a relative difference between ws cn fem and the experiments below 2 fig 12 b also shows that when the first fore aft bending mode is excited at t 8 s sima tends to over estimate the amplitude of the 2nd harmonic which is consistent with expectations horn et al 2016 krokstad et al 1998 and the potential flow solver ws cn fem seems to underestimates it the double frequency harmonic is almost 30 smaller in ws cn fem than in the experiments for the steepest case at t 8 s and sima overestimates it by 24 in that case the kc number can be too high and the k r number too low for a valid applicability of the potential flow theory see fig 7 the uncertainty of the measurements is also much larger at the resonance because of the large elastic effects and the strong dependence of the response on the damping at t 10 s fig 12 c the 2nd bending moment harmonic is slightly overestimated by the two numerical models ws cn fem and sima overestimate the double frequency harmonic by 15 and 7 respectively the relative difference seems to decrease when the wave steepness increases hence the numerical models should be compared with experiments in steeper waves to better understand the reasons for these differences the non linear potential flow solver seems to correctly capture the hydroelastic effects at this wave period despite the large kc number and the viscous effects that might occur when the waves become large on the experimental model the viscous effects may be substantial and would be overestimated because of scale effects the scale factor is 1 50 and the reynolds number on the model is lower than at full scale when using froude similarity the response at higher order harmonics is also studied with the non linear coupling ws cn fem while the sima simulations employ a 2nd order stokes wave model 3rd order effects are however visible in the bending moment from sima as it is calculated by integration of the wave loads on the wetted surface up to the 2nd order free surface elevation the 3rd order bending moment computed by sima is hence only partial the triple frequency harmonics are plotted for all cases in fig 13 one can see that the calculation of ws cn fem is close to the experiments the maximum steepness of the studied waves is not very large h λ 1 22 hence the 3rd order loads are small and the resulting 3rd bending moment harmonic is only 2 of the 1st bending moment harmonic for the case t 10 s despite the small amplitude ws cn fem is in good agreement with the experimental measurements for instance when t 10 s and h λ 1 22 it underestimates the bending moment by 30 but it is very near the measurement uncertainty zone 4 conclusion in this paper a new hydroelastic model is studied for application to the modelling of large offshore structures it includes a nonlinear hydrodynamic potential flow solver based on the weak scatterer approach tightly coupled to a structural model based on the euler bernoulli beam theory the weakly non linear hydrodynamic solver computes the hydrodynamic loads including the influence of the elastic response of the structure this coupling is explicitly written in a coupled system of equations and solved in time domain using a 4th order runge kutta integrator for now only regular waves can be included in the hydrodynamic analysis a fully nonlinear wave model is employed based on the rienecker and fenton theory rienecker and fenton 1981 this hydroelastic model is applied to the case of a large diameter monopile supporting an offshore wind turbine the simulations results are compared with 1 experimental measurements made on a flexible 1 50 froude scaled model which includes the wind turbine tower and an rna mass and damper and which respects froude scaled modal frequencies 2 simulations results from sima which here uses a morison based hydrodynamic model with 2nd order wave kinematics and neglects the viscous drag effects the load cases include a series of regular waves with various steepnesses and periods in particular relatively small waves periods are considered 6 8 and 10 s in order to respect the applicability of the potential flow theory for sufficiently large k r numbers the observed agreement is good except for the steepest wave at t 6 s for which the measurements were perturbed by strong reflection on the wave tank walls at 8 s wave period the 2nd order wave loads excite the first bending mode of the monopile resulting in large oscillations at double frequency while ws cn fem underestimates their amplitude sima overestimates it the nonlinear potential flow method has also been shown to be accurate on the third harmonics but steeper waves with larger high order effects should still be investigated for now the applicability of this potential flow based hydroelastic model should be limited to relatively small kc numbers and large k r numbers where the diffraction remains dominant compared to viscous effects in the flow but the agreement with the experiments at t 10 s is very satisfactory even in the steepest case where the kc number is large and where viscous effects should be non negligible application to larger wave periods should still however be investigated this method is not proven to be more efficient than a morison based hydroelastic solver for this type of application analysis of a monopile but it is a first validation step of the model before the extension of the modelling capability to the hydroelastic response of floating wind turbine platforms for which the non linear

a hybrid rk4 integration schemes for stability and accuracy reasons the structural solver which uses an rk4 scheme needs a much smaller time step than that of the hydrodynamic solver the time step of the latter needs to be reasonably large to limit the computational cost as explained in section 2 3 the integration of the structural response has been embedded in the hydrodynamic integration the coupled equations are solved together at each synchronous time step and the hydrodynamic force is then kept constant for a number of sub steps in the structure response before the next synchronous hydro elastic time step to demonstrate the accuracy of this integration scheme simulations have been made on the same system in mechanically forced oscillations no water is here considered for simplicity reasons a 500 kn sinusoidal force is applied at a 5 s period at the rna in the x direction a ramp of 5 s is used at the start of the simulation the reference case does not use any sub time step and does a direct integration of the response of the structure using an implicit newmark β integration with a time step of 0 001 s with γ 0 5 and β 0 25 the three other cases use an rk4 scheme using the same time step of 0 001 s and 12 modes to compute the response of the structure and respectively update the force at the rna every 10 50 and 100 time steps the computed responses are plotted in fig 14 and have a very satisfactory agreement appendix b uncertainty estimation in regular waves the error bars in figs 12 and 13 indicate the estimated uncertainty in the experimental results based on a combination of random uncertainty assessed using 5 repetitions of the regular waves with steepness 1 30 and standard uncertainty the contributions to standard uncertainty include the model dimensions 0 5 mm in the outer diameter 0 1 mm for the inner core mass distribution 10 locally water depth 7 mm in model scale wave elevation 3 damping level ranging from 1 to 1 3 of critical for the first mode and the measurement uncertainty in the strain gauges 0 4 on the total measurement except for the measurement uncertainty in the strain gauges other contributions to the standard uncertainty were propagated to the bending moment components numerically using the sima model following a similar procedure that used by bachynski et al 2017 the wave elevation is the largest contributor to the uncertainty in the first harmonic moment for higher harmonics the uncertainty in the strain gauges is also important for resonant responses the uncertainties in the mass and damping dominate 
20220,this paper examines the hydroelastic response of a monopile structure supporting an offshore wind turbine a new numerical simulation tool is presented coupling a nonlinear potential flow solver to a structural model based on modal superposition the hydrodynamic solver is based on the weak scatterer ws approach and assumes small perturbations of the incident flow a finite element method fem solver is used to compute the modal parameters which are then superposed to compute the dynamics of the system in time domain small deformations are assumed in the coupling the two theories are tightly coupled in time domain the theory of the coupling is fully described in the paper the new coupled solver ws cn fem is then applied to the case of a large diameter monopile results are compared to simulations using the morison equation to compute the hydrodynamic loads and a beam element fem model to compute the response of the structure and to experimental measurements made on a monopile based offshore wind turbine model the physical model has froude scaled geometry and natural frequencies which allows an accurate validation of the hydroelastic numerical models including realistic flexible modes of the structure and wave structure interaction the results of ws cn fem show a good agreement with the experimental measurements and in particular on the first and second mudline bending moments harmonics in a series of regular waves of various wave steepness graphical abstract keywords hydroelastic coupling nonlinear hydrodynamics weak scatterer approximation offshore wind turbine foundation 1 introduction the size of offshore wind turbines is increasing and now reaching over 200 m in rotor diameter similarly the size and weight of the foundations either bottom fixed or floating are also increasing hydroelastic analysis may hence become essential to estimate internal loads in the platforms and foundations as for any other very large structure at sea the challenge shall be overcome for both bottom fixed and floating wind turbines for hydrodynamically slender structures e g jacket foundations some monopiles or spar platforms morison s equation faltinsen 1990 can be applied these solvers are easy to implement and can be coupled with e g a finite element solver for straightforward hydroelastic analysis inducing a relatively low simulation cost the undisturbed incident waves used in these models can include fully nonlinear wave kinematics such as the rienecker fenton model for regular waves rienecker and fenton 1981 or a high order spectral hos model for irregular sea states ducrozet et al 2014 for larger geometries when viscous effects are negligible potential flow theory should be used these solvers require a mesh of the wet body surface and a hydroelastic coupled analysis is not straightforward a one way coupling is usually used to design large floating structures dnv 2018 considering the hydrodynamic loads computed on a rigid body and thereafter applied on a finite element mesh to compute the internal loads the mitigation of the hydrodynamic loads induced by the structure deformation is hence not included in the analysis for floating wind turbines numerous numerical simulation tools have been recently developed robertson et al 2014 mostly coupling offshore design tools including various hydrodynamic solvers to aero elastic solvers used to design wind turbines they often model a flexible wind turbine tower and rotor supported by a rigid platform this form of rigid flexible coupling ignores the flexible modes of the platforms the main alternatives which have been explored up to now to analyse floating wind turbines platforms flexibility use either linear potential flow theory or morison s equation 1 the platform can be simulated using a boundary element method bem and modelled as a number of interacting bodies linked with each other using beam finite elements guignier et al 2016 2 hydrodynamic pressures computed by a bem on a single rigid body can be projected on flexible platform sections for calculation of the deformation luan et al 2017 3 flexible modes can be included in the linear potential flow solver bem and integrated in time domain with the servo aero elastic model borg et al 2016 4 morison s equation can be used on a rigid or flexible platform formed of slender members xu et al 2019 for both bottom fixed and floating wind turbine foundations including nonlinear hydrodynamics can be important for the estimation of fatigue loading or ultimate design loads where waves kinematics and induced loads are very nonlinear schløer et al 2016 for hydrodynamically slender structures morison s equation allows the inclusion of nonlinear wave kinematics for example compared to simulations using linear wave kinematics simulations of a semi submersible with nonlinear wave kinematics resulted in approximately 25 larger extreme mooring line tensions xu et al 2019 for increasing structure diameter however near field diffraction which is not captured by morison s equation become more significant although first order solutions such as the maccamy fuchs equation exist combining near field diffraction effects with nonlinear waves remains challenging these challenges were studied in connection with the ringing response of gravity based platforms and tension leg platforms for oil and gas developments faltinsen et al 1995 stansberg 1997 grue and huseby 2002 hydroelastic analysis of such large volume platforms often consider higher order loads applied as point loads on a simplified approximation of the structure such as a single degree of freedom system tromans et al 2006 or distributed on a multi degree of freedom model gaidai and krokstad 2014 without modelling the effect of the structure s deformations on the hydrodynamic loads high order diffraction loads acting on bottom fixed cylindrical foundations in intermediate water depth can also be computed analytically using kristiansen and faltinsen s kf extension of the fnv model faltinsen et al 1995 kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 but it is applicable to simple geometries and assumes long waves relative to the structure the kf model has been shown to overestimate the third order forces for steep waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 both the kf model and rainey s model tend to overpredict the first mode response of a fully flexible monopile in irregular waves compared to experimental results suja thauvin et al 2020 fully non linear potential flow models have also been developed ferrant 1998 ferrant et al 2003 but they suffer from important numerical instabilities alternatively weakly non linear potential flow models such as the weak scatterer approach have been used to compute the ringing response of a bottom hinged rigid monopile structure in focused waves zhang and teng 2021 nonlinear coupled models have been developed for ships including forward speed kim and kim 2014 lee et al 2020 showing good performance this paper presents a similar model that has been developed for offshore floating wind turbines ws cn fem a weakly nonlinear potential flow solver based on the weak scatterer theory ws cn has been developed in centrale nantes letournel et al 2018 chauvigné 2016 wuillaume 2019 it has been recently coupled to a low order finite element solver based on euler bernoulli beam model which assumes small deformations of slender beams the developed solver is first tested and validated on the case of bottom fixed wind turbines in this paper before being tested for floating structures in future works the paper presents the theory behind the non linear hydroelastic coupling ws cn fem it presents the weak scatterer approach the structural model and the tight coupling between the two through an explicit coupled equation system coupled simulations of a representative monopile supported offshore wind turbine are then performed and compared to experimental measurements performed on a scaled large diameter flexible monopile bachynski et al 2020 in regular waves simulations from sima sintef 2021a using morison s equation and nonlinear wave kinematics are also presented in the comparison 2 hydroelastic weak scatterer theory based solver the nonlinear potential flow solver ws cn has been developed at centrale nantes since 2011 it initially was developed to model underwater wave energy converters letournel et al 2018 and it has been lately improved to account for free surface piercing chauvigné 2016 and interacting bodies wuillaume 2019 ws cn has now been coupled to a structural solver to solve the hydroelastic coupling on offshore wind turbines substructures the new coupling is called ws cn fem 2 1 structure model the euler bernoulli beam theory which assumes small deformations has been implemented in a new solver called beampy the finite elements are linearized and the stiffness and mass matrices k and m of the system are computed at the initial position and kept constant throughout the simulations the hydrodynamic solver requires an explicit scheme for solving the equation of motion which necessitates time steps shorter than the shortest natural period in the structure model in order to lower the cpu cost of the simulations the equation of motion is therefore solved using modal superposition a sufficient number of modes needs to be considered for an accurate modelling of the dynamics and high order modes are ignored in order to lengthen the integration time step while keeping the simulations stable a preliminary convergence study is hence performed to define the needed number of modes in the analysis before simulating the response of the structure in time domain a modal analysis is performed if the system is floating a linear stiffness corresponding to hydrostatic and mooring stiffness is added to constrain all rigid degrees of freedom in this modal analysis hydrodynamic added mass is ignored the modal matrix ψ has the shape n n o d e s n m o d e s and gives the structural mode shapes for the considered system in time domain the hydrodynamic added mass is accounted for in the hydrodynamic forces calculation a convergence analysis is firstly performed in time domain in order to define a sufficient number of modes allowing to accurately represent the structural dynamics in the water this is detailed in section 2 3 rayleigh damping is used to define the structural damping matrix as the linear combination of mass and stiffness matrices c μ m λ k in time domain the equation of motion takes the form given in eq 1 where y is the modal response amplitude f h the vector of hydrodynamic forces and f e x t the vector of other external forces 1 ψ t m ψ y ψ t c ψ y ψ t k ψ y ψ t f h f e x t where the position vector x is obtained from the amplitudes of the modal responses y as written in eq 2 2 x ψ y the procedure used for simulations with ws cn fem is described in fig 1 2 2 flow model let us consider a body undergoing motions in a fluid domain its motions are decomposed into rigid and flexible motions i e structural deformations in this fluid structure coupling the fluid problem is linearized around the surface of the rigid body at its instantaneous position disregarding structural deformation the instantaneous position is defined by the superposition of the rigid modes neglecting the flexible modes of the structure presented in section 2 1 the cylindrical fluid domain d is presented in fig 2 it is delimited by the side numerical tank walls s w the seabed s d the free surface s f s and the wet body surface s b the fluid domain d 0 is then delimited by s w s d s f s and the wet surface of the rigid body s b 0 for a bottom fixed foundation s b 0 corresponds to the surface of the body at rest the euler bernoulli theory assumes small linear deformations hence the wet surface of the body equals the wet surface of the associated rigid body 3 s b s b 0 the weak scatterer theory assumes an inviscid incompressible and irrotational flow the laplace equation is then written for the velocity potential 4 δ ϕ 0 the velocity potential ϕ and the free surface elevation η are decomposed into an incident undisturbed and a perturbed or scattered quantity the weak scatterer approach assumes that the perturbed quantity is small compared to the incident wave as in eq 5 the incident quantities can be computed using either airy linear wave theory or fully non linear rienecker fenton wave theory rienecker and fenton 1981 5 ϕ ϕ i ϕ p η η i η p with ϕ p o ϕ i η p o η i the far field condition 6 writes that the perturbed quantities are negligible when far from the body 6 ϕ p r 0 η p r 0 the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are written at the incident and undisturbed free surface elevation η i using a taylor expansion letournel et al 2018 the wet body surface is defined as the surface of the body below η i the exact intersection of the body mesh with the undisturbed free surface is hence calculated at each time step in the solver the slip boundary condition of the velocity potential is written on s b 0 accounting for the velocities induced by the deformations on the other domain boundaries a slip condition is written for the perturbed potential ϕ p on the side walls s w and on the full potential ϕ for the seabed s d a numerical absorbing beach is used on the outer area of the free surface s f s to avoid any reflection of the scattered wave the boundary conditions on the potential are written in eq 7 7 η t ϕ z ϕ η on s f s at z η i ϕ t g η 1 2 ϕ ϕ on s f s at z η i ϕ p n ϕ i n v n on the body wet surface s b 0 ϕ p n 0 on the numerical tank walls s w ϕ p n ϕ i n on the seabed s d v and n are respectively the velocity of a wet body mesh node and the normal vector at this node on s b 0 oriented outward from the body all terms of order o ϕ p 2 o η p 2 and o ϕ p η p are ignored the second green identity is written for the linearized fluid domain d 0 on its boundary s 0 for the perturbation potential ϕ p that satisfies the laplace equation and the rankine source green s function g at all points m 0 of s 0 it takes the form given in eq 8 8 ω m ϕ p m s 0 ϕ p m g n m p d s s 0 g m p ϕ p n m d s 0 ω m is explicitly written in eq 9 it can be interpreted as the solid angle of the surface s seen from the point m 9 ω m s 0 g n m p d s the fluid domain boundaries are discretized with triangular panels wuillaume 2019 except for the flat seabed on which a symmetry condition is applied the first boundary value problem bvp1 in eq 8 can be written as a linear system written in a matrix format in eq 10 10 g ϕ p h ϕ n p the vectors ϕ and ϕ n p respectively take the discrete values of ϕ p and ϕ n p ϕ p n on the domain mesh nodes g and h are called influence coefficients matrices and represent the influence of every node on every other node of the domain mesh this linear system of equations is solved to compute the flow state using a generalized minimal residual gmres solver the calculation of the hydrodynamic loads implies a fluid structure coupling detailed in section 2 3 the first developments of this hydrodynamic solver have been validated on rigid fixed and floating bodies immersed and surface piercing letournel 2014 chauvigné 2016 wuillaume 2019 the following theory has been developed and implemented to extend the capabilities of the solver to flexible bodies with small deformations 2 3 fluid structure coupling the hydrodynamic force vector is calculated by integration of the hydrodynamic pressure on the linearized wet surface of the hull s b 11 f h s b 0 p h n d s p h is the hydrodynamic pressure computed by the ws cn solver according to the bernoulli lagrange formula and to the weak scatterer hypothesis given in eq 5 p h shall be calculated as written in eq 12 12 p h ρ ϕ i t ϕ p t 1 2 ϕ i ϕ i ϕ i ϕ p g z in eq 12 the term ϕ p t is unknown the hydrodynamic force is then decomposed as in eq 13 where f 0 h is the integration of the known part of the pressure 13 f h f 0 h ρ s b 0 ϕ p t n d s solving the equation of motion 1 hence involves calculating both the modal acceleration y and the derivative of the scattered velocity potential with respect to time ϕ p t at the same time this coupled problem could be solved using an iteration process between the structure and fluid domains which would induce a very high cpu cost instead an implicit boundary method is used letournel et al 2018 writing a second boundary value problem to compute ϕ p t the second green identity links ϕ p t to its normal gradient 2 ϕ p n t on the wet hull surface similarly to eq 8 14 ω m ϕ p m t s 0 ϕ p p t g m p n d s s 0 2 ϕ p p n t g m p d s 0 this problem is solved using the boundary conditions given in eq 15 which are derived from the boundary conditions of the first problem given in eq 7 the conditions on the free surface are not detailed here 15 2 ϕ p t n 2 ϕ i t n on s d 2 ϕ p t n 0 on s w 2 ϕ p n t 2 ϕ i n t x m n q on s b 0 x m is the acceleration of a point m on the body wet surface calculated from y and q is a convection term that is calculated analytically letournel et al 2018 the second boundary value problem 14 the boundary condition on the wet surface 15 and the equation of motion 1 are written in a single linear system given in eq 16 it is solved at each time step using a gmres solver to compute ϕ p t and y 16 g ϕ p h ϕ n p ψ t m ψ y ψ t l ϕ p s b ψ t c ψ y ψ t k ψ y ψ t f 0 w s c f e x t ϕ n p s b 0 d ψ y ϕ n i s b 0 b q the influence coefficients matrices g and h are the same as in the first boundary value problem given in eq 10 the matrix l represents the integration of the time derivative of the scattered velocity potential ϕ p over s b 0 l is calculated based on the geometry of the body mesh only the matrix d and the vector b enable calculation of the mesh nodes accelerations as a function of the accelerations of the structural mesh nodes d and b are calculated as functions of the geometry of the body mesh and its velocity known at this step of the calculation the matrices l and d and vector b are computed based on the projection of the hydrodynamic and structural mesh on one another using standard euler bernoulli beam theory shape functions fig 3 represents the hydrodynamic mesh nodes p j corresponding to one beam element defined between the nodes m i 1 and m i 2 the coefficients of l d and b are computed analytically the vector q contains the discrete convection terms q seen in eq 15 this coupling is solved in the time domain and integrated using a 4th order runge kutta rk4 explicit integration as introduced in section 2 1 the structure response needs to be represented by a sufficient number of modes generally imposing a smaller time step than that of the hydrodynamic solver the objective is then to keep a good compromise between cpu cost and accuracy on the hydrodynamic time step with a smaller time step for the structural dynamics the chosen solution involves a secondary integration scheme for the structure to stably advance its dynamics in time this second rk4 scheme is synchronized with the primary rk4 scheme used to integrate the coupled system of eqs 16 starting from the coupled solution at a given time step it integrates the equation of motion of the structure using the computed hydrodynamic loads as a constant force until the next synchronous time step where the system 16 is solved this hybrid integration scheme has been verified and validated a demonstration is presented in appendix a 3 verification and validation 3 1 case study and experiments the study considers the dtu 10 mw wind turbine bak et al 2013 on a 9 m diameter monopile foundation velarde and bachynski 2017 subjected to different regular wave systems the ws cn fem coupling is compared to both a beam element finite element solver combined with morison s equation implemented in sima sintef 2021a and experimental measurements made on an offshore wind turbine model in hydroelastic similarity the numerical models of the studied wind turbine are based on a model of the model approach scaled up to full scaled in order to optimize the comparison with the experiments the aim of this case study is not to prove a better accuracy with a potential flow solver than with a morison based solver but to validate the theory presented in section 2 on the case of a bottom fixed structure before an application to offshore floating wind turbines wind induced loads and current induced loads are not considered in the analysis 3 1 1 experimental set up the experiments were performed by sintef ocean and ntnu in the small towing tank of ntnu in trondheim with a froude scaling factor of 50 bachynski et al 2020 as part of the was xl project sintef 2021b fig 4 presents the layout of the tank the waves are generated with a piston type wavemaker due to the short size of the tank the experiments could not completely avoid wake reflexion on the beach and dampers hence a wave reflection of approximately 4 is expected to be present in most presented results kristiansen et al 2017 in the following all quantities are given at full scale the monopile model is mounted on a rigid foundation below the seabed the wind turbine and the monopile are formed of a flexible backbone providing modal frequency similarity surrounded by a cylinder respecting froude similarity the water depth is 27 m and the tower top reaches 144 15 m above the seabed the total mass of the model without the rotor nacelle assembly rna is 2 652 1 0 6 kg and its centre of gravity is at 34 25 m above the seabed a mass of 9 55 1 0 5 kg representing the rna is added at the tower top in order to obtain a good agreement on the 1st fore aft bending mode frequency with the base case wind turbine fig 5 represents the wind turbine and foundation model the model is equipped with strain gauges at z 28 45 m just below the mudline 25 55 m 16 2 m and 0 m at the waterline 5 accelerometers are installed at z 2 7 m 13 5 m 50 m 90 m and 124 45 m we use the mudline bending moment calculated using strain gauges and the accelerations measured at the top of the rna at 118 4 m above the waterline as reference measurements to validate the models following euler bernoulli beam theory the bending moment around the y axis written m y is calculated at a given point from the external strain measurement ε following eq 17 where e is the young modulus i y y the second moment of area for the beam section and r is the distance from the exterior where the strain ε is measured to the beam axis 17 m y e i y y r ε static pullout tests carried out by hanging known masses connected to a pulley attached to the model at one of two known locations are used to calibrate the transformation from strain to bending moment and show excellent agreement with euler bernoulli beam theory the experimental set up is described by bachynski et al 2020 the positions of the strain gauges and accelerometers are marked as m y and a c c respectively in fig 5 a section view is also provided showing the backbone with the cylinder around it the surrounding cylindrical sections do not alter the bending stiffness of the backbone and the small gap between each cylinder section prevents the sections from being in contact when the structure deforms the mass and inertia of the cylinder sections is included in the numerical models and contributes to the desired mode shapes and frequencies the two first bending modes in the xoz plane have periods of t 1 3 97 s and t 2 0 656 s respectively the damping in the numerical models is calibrated based on experimental decay tests 3 1 2 nonlinear hydroelastic model the developed nonlinear hydroelastic coupling ws cn fem is used to analyse the considered case study as presented previously the boundaries of the fluid domain are meshed including the free surface and the outer boundaries a convergence analysis has been performed in the first place on both the time step length and on the mesh dimensions domain diameter and cells size the convergence analyses is not presented in this paper however the calculation parameters are given as follows 1 the time step used in the hydrodynamic solver is 0 1 s and the time step in the structural solver is 5 1 0 4 s 2 the fluid domain has a diameter equal to 3 wavelengths with an absorption beach of one wavelength on the outer boundaries 3 the mesh cell size is 0 7 m on the body boundaries and approximately 10 of the wavelength on the outer boundary the fluid domain mesh for a wave period of 6 s with 4600 nodes is presented in fig 6 a smoothing algorithm is applied every 5 time steps to the solution of the potential on the free surface in order to avoid numerical instability the input waves are computed using the fully non linear rienecker fenton wave model rienecker and fenton 1981 3 1 3 morison fem model ws cn fem is first compared to the numerical simulation tool sima sintef 2021a which for this study uses finite elements to model the structure response and a morison based hydrodynamic solver to compute the hydrodynamic loads for the sake of comparison against ws cn fem sima computes the loads with a drag coefficient c d 0 and the added mass coefficient c a is defined according to the analytical solution to the linear potential flow theory for a diffracting cylinder from maccamy and fuchs 1954 for each regular wave the loads are applied to the beam model euler bernoulli using stokes 2nd order wave kinematics the hydrodynamic loads are integrated up to the incident 2nd order wave elevation level and the velocity potential is extrapolated above the mean sea level z 0 using a linear extrapolation 3 1 4 load cases first decay tests are performed on the dry monopile and on the wet monopile in the wave tank a series of regular waves are then tested in the wave tank including several wave periods t 6 s 8 s and 10 s with various steepness defined by the ratio between wave height and wavelength following h λ 1 40 1 30 and 1 22 the considered regular waves are presented in table 1 the regular waves are also plotted in blue in fig 7 where the validity of wave force models is presented chakrabarti 1987 as a function of 1 the k r number such as k r π d λ where d is the cylinder diameter and λ the wavelength 2 the wave height to cylinder diameter ratio h d ratio similar to the keulegan carpenter number the diffraction region bottom right hand corner of fig 7 mostly refers to the linear potential flow theory as one can see most regular waves are outside the diffraction region which is expected for a monopile foundation the added mass coefficient used in sima calculated based on the maccamy and fuchs solution is also given in table 1 for each load case 3 2 modal analysis and decay tests decay tests were performed on the model outside and in the water and the corresponding acceleration measurements were used to identify the natural frequencies mode shapes and damping the 1st and 2nd fore aft bending mode frequencies and shapes are compared with the eigenvalue analysis from the numerical models as shown in fig 1 in the ws cn fem solver modal analysis is only carried out for the dry structure the 1st and 2nd dry modes shapes measured and calculated using sima and the structural solver of ws cn fem beampy are plotted in fig 8 the agreement between numerical models and experiments is very good for the wet case a time domain decay test simulation is performed using the non linear coupling previously presented the wet natural frequencies are then found from the decay simulation the observed and computed modes frequencies both dry and wet are given in table 2 the agreement between measurements and models is very satisfactory the 1st and 2nt mode periods computed by ws cn fem are slightly smaller than the measured ones with respectively 2 9 and 0 45 relative difference the mudline bending moment time series is presented in fig 9 comparing the measurements with the simulations from ws cn fem and sima a difference in the first mode period between ws cn fem and the experiments is observed the amplitude of the response shows a very good agreement between simulations and experiments 3 3 regular waves the model is studied in the regular wave conditions presented in section 3 1 4 the input waves in the numerical simulations are based on experimental measurements without the model using a wave probe located at the model s position w11 not represented in fig 4 the free surface elevation is plotted in fig 10 for the three investigated values of wave steepness h λ 1 40 1 30 and 1 22 and for the wave periods t 6 8 and 10 s the curves represent the free surface elevation in ws cn fem sima and the measurements at the model s position without the model and just next to the model at w8 in fig 4 with the model in place there is very good agreement between the undisturbed measured wave and the simulations the difference between the measurement at w8 and the empty tank measurement at w11 is mainly due to the wave diffraction on the cylinder it is particularly visible in fig 10 a when t 6 s and h λ 1 22 the computed and measured mudline bending moments are plotted in fig 11 for each wave at t 6 s fig 11 a the k r number is 0 5 and the keulegan carpenter number kc is sufficiently low so that the wave conditions are appropriate for application of the potential flow theory see fig 7 the agreement is very good except at h λ 1 22 where the two simulation tools tend to underestimate the amplitude of the response compared to the experiments this is discussed further with the harmonic analysis the mudline bending moment obtained in the t 8 s period regular wave is plotted in fig 11 b the response is large and it contains an important double frequency oscillation compared to responses at other wave periods the 2nd order hydrodynamic loads excite the first fore aft bending mode of the structure given in table 2 at a period of 3 9 s the accuracy on this case is poorer the response at the resonance period is very sensitive to the structural damping hence any uncertainty in the structural damping may induce large errors in the coupled models at t 10 s fig 11 c the k r number is lower and the morison based numerical model sima should be more appropriate to compute the hydrodynamic loads however the non linear potential flow model shows a very good agreement with the experiments and with sima the two first harmonics in the steady state mudline bending moment series are plotted in fig 12 the measurements are shown in grey indicating as well their uncertainty see appendix b when t 6 s fig 12 a the agreement between ws cn fem and the experiments is very good below 4 relative difference which is expected for the current values of k r and kc except for the first harmonic of the case at h λ 1 22 where the response is much larger in the experiments several factors may contribute to this underestimation of the response for t 6 s the diffraction due to the cylinder that is observed in the tank may result in the reflection of diffracted waves the large difference between the measured wave with and without the model w8 vs w11 in fig 11 suggests that reflections or diffraction may be more important for this case leading to larger loads in the experimental measurements additionally the underestimation of the ws cn fem solver in that case may be the result of the weak scatterer approximation which assumes a small perturbation on the incident flow potential and free surface elevation particularly the weak scatterer approach has been shown to poorly represent the run up on a free surface piercing cylinder chauvigné 2016 for the other cases t 8 s and 10 s the agreement is good on the first harmonic with a relative difference between ws cn fem and the experiments below 2 fig 12 b also shows that when the first fore aft bending mode is excited at t 8 s sima tends to over estimate the amplitude of the 2nd harmonic which is consistent with expectations horn et al 2016 krokstad et al 1998 and the potential flow solver ws cn fem seems to underestimates it the double frequency harmonic is almost 30 smaller in ws cn fem than in the experiments for the steepest case at t 8 s and sima overestimates it by 24 in that case the kc number can be too high and the k r number too low for a valid applicability of the potential flow theory see fig 7 the uncertainty of the measurements is also much larger at the resonance because of the large elastic effects and the strong dependence of the response on the damping at t 10 s fig 12 c the 2nd bending moment harmonic is slightly overestimated by the two numerical models ws cn fem and sima overestimate the double frequency harmonic by 15 and 7 respectively the relative difference seems to decrease when the wave steepness increases hence the numerical models should be compared with experiments in steeper waves to better understand the reasons for these differences the non linear potential flow solver seems to correctly capture the hydroelastic effects at this wave period despite the large kc number and the viscous effects that might occur when the waves become large on the experimental model the viscous effects may be substantial and would be overestimated because of scale effects the scale factor is 1 50 and the reynolds number on the model is lower than at full scale when using froude similarity the response at higher order harmonics is also studied with the non linear coupling ws cn fem while the sima simulations employ a 2nd order stokes wave model 3rd order effects are however visible in the bending moment from sima as it is calculated by integration of the wave loads on the wetted surface up to the 2nd order free surface elevation the 3rd order bending moment computed by sima is hence only partial the triple frequency harmonics are plotted for all cases in fig 13 one can see that the calculation of ws cn fem is close to the experiments the maximum steepness of the studied waves is not very large h λ 1 22 hence the 3rd order loads are small and the resulting 3rd bending moment harmonic is only 2 of the 1st bending moment harmonic for the case t 10 s despite the small amplitude ws cn fem is in good agreement with the experimental measurements for instance when t 10 s and h λ 1 22 it underestimates the bending moment by 30 but it is very near the measurement uncertainty zone 4 conclusion in this paper a new hydroelastic model is studied for application to the modelling of large offshore structures it includes a nonlinear hydrodynamic potential flow solver based on the weak scatterer approach tightly coupled to a structural model based on the euler bernoulli beam theory the weakly non linear hydrodynamic solver computes the hydrodynamic loads including the influence of the elastic response of the structure this coupling is explicitly written in a coupled system of equations and solved in time domain using a 4th order runge kutta integrator for now only regular waves can be included in the hydrodynamic analysis a fully nonlinear wave model is employed based on the rienecker and fenton theory rienecker and fenton 1981 this hydroelastic model is applied to the case of a large diameter monopile supporting an offshore wind turbine the simulations results are compared with 1 experimental measurements made on a flexible 1 50 froude scaled model which includes the wind turbine tower and an rna mass and damper and which respects froude scaled modal frequencies 2 simulations results from sima which here uses a morison based hydrodynamic model with 2nd order wave kinematics and neglects the viscous drag effects the load cases include a series of regular waves with various steepnesses and periods in particular relatively small waves periods are considered 6 8 and 10 s in order to respect the applicability of the potential flow theory for sufficiently large k r numbers the observed agreement is good except for the steepest wave at t 6 s for which the measurements were perturbed by strong reflection on the wave tank walls at 8 s wave period the 2nd order wave loads excite the first bending mode of the monopile resulting in large oscillations at double frequency while ws cn fem underestimates their amplitude sima overestimates it the nonlinear potential flow method has also been shown to be accurate on the third harmonics but steeper waves with larger high order effects should still be investigated for now the applicability of this potential flow based hydroelastic model should be limited to relatively small kc numbers and large k r numbers where the diffraction remains dominant compared to viscous effects in the flow but the agreement with the experiments at t 10 s is very satisfactory even in the steepest case where the kc number is large and where viscous effects should be non negligible application to larger wave periods should still however be investigated this method is not proven to be more efficient than a morison based hydroelastic solver for this type of application analysis of a monopile but it is a first validation step of the model before the extension of the modelling capability to the hydroelastic response of floating wind turbine platforms for which the non linear loads could play an important role it should then account for large rigid body motions of the platforms in addition to the hydroelastic effects credit authorship contribution statement v leroy

a hybrid rk4 integration schemes for stability and accuracy reasons the structural solver which uses an rk4 scheme needs a much smaller time step than that of the hydrodynamic solver the time step of the latter needs to be reasonably large to limit the computational cost as explained in section 2 3 the integration of the structural response has been embedded in the hydrodynamic integration the coupled equations are solved together at each synchronous time step and the hydrodynamic force is then kept constant for a number of sub steps in the structure response before the next synchronous hydro elastic time step to demonstrate the accuracy of this integration scheme simulations have been made on the same system in mechanically forced oscillations no water is here considered for simplicity reasons a 500 kn sinusoidal force is applied at a 5 s period at the rna in the x direction a ramp of 5 s is used at the start of the simulation the reference case does not use any sub time step and does a direct integration of the response of the structure using an implicit newmark β integration with a time step of 0 001 s with γ 0 5 and β 0 25 the three other cases use an rk4 scheme using the same time step of 0 001 s and 12 modes to compute the response of the structure and respectively update the force at the rna every 10 50 and 100 time steps the computed responses are plotted in fig 14 and have a very satisfactory agreement appendix b uncertainty estimation in regular waves the error bars in figs 12 and 13 indicate the estimated uncertainty in the experimental results based on a combination of random uncertainty assessed using 5 repetitions of the regular waves with steepness 1 30 and standard uncertainty the contributions to standard uncertainty include the model dimensions 0 5 mm in the outer diameter 0 1 mm for the inner core mass distribution 10 locally water depth 7 mm in model scale wave elevation 3 damping level ranging from 1 to 1 3 of critical for the first mode and the measurement uncertainty in the strain gauges 0 4 on the total measurement except for the measurement uncertainty in the strain gauges other contributions to the standard uncertainty were propagated to the bending moment components numerically using the sima model following a similar procedure that used by bachynski et al 2017 the wave elevation is the largest contributor to the uncertainty in the first harmonic moment for higher harmonics the uncertainty in the strain gauges is also important for resonant responses the uncertainties in the mass and damping dominate 
20221,the sediments on the natural seabed are generally non uniform particles the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles has always been a key problem in the ocean engineering in this paper the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles by considering the additional mass force is studied by means of mechanical analysis and comparative verification firstly the mechanical model of non uniform sediment particles is established in consideration of the seepage force cohesion and the additional mass force caused by non uniformity combined with the randomness of the position of non uniform particles on the bed surface and the relative exposure degree of non uniform particles a systematic and comprehensive formula of the additional mass force is proposed the mechanical equilibrium equations of critical incipient motion of the non uniform sediment particles are established and the critical incipient flow velocity of sediment particles under sliding instability and rolling instability are derived then the accuracy and validity of the proposed formulas are verified by comparison with the results of flume test field measurement and other formulas finally the influence factors of the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles are analyzed and the change laws of influence factors are obtained the results show that 1 the incipient motion form of sediments on the natural seabed is generally the rolling instability 2 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles decreases first and then increases with particle diameter 3 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles increases with the dry bulk density 4 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles decreases with the increase of hydraulic gradient and relative exposure degree keywords non uniform sediments additional mass force relative exposure degree incipient flow velocity 1 introduction the incipient motion of sediment particles is an important basic research in ocean engineering such as coastal erosion evolution of beach sediment near port siltation of harbor basin and channel local scour of coastal buildings and so on bakhtyar et al 2009 homaei et al 2020 studies on the incipient motion of sediment particles can be traced back to the 17th century egiazaroff 1965 the earlier research mainly focused on larger uniform particles with negligible cohesion however the particles on natural seabed are non uniformed therefore the research on the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles is crucial to the theoretical analysis and engineering practice many achievements have been made on the incipient motion of uniform and non uniform particles at home and abroad there are mainly three research methods the first is the shields diagram shields 1936 the shields diagram is a mature method for the incipient motion of uniform particles the second is the empirical formula of the incipient motion of particles established from the experimental data hossein et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 the third is mechanical mechanism analysis by analyzing the force on particles during incipient motion the equilibrium equation and physical equation are established and the incipient wave height formula or the incipient flow velocity formula of particles is obtained at the end of last century and the beginning of this century a large number of scholars in china studied the incipient motion and transport mechanism of sediment particles tang 1963 han 1996 dou 1999 and cai 2019 expounded the motion mechanism from the characteristics of the incipient motion of uniform particle and deduced the incipient flow velocity formula of uniform particles under rolling instability compared with uniform particles the incipient motion of non uniform particles needs to solve the hiding exposure effects between particles caused by the difference of particle diameter and the random of particle positions kramer 1935 chen and xie 1988 leng and wang 1994 subhasish 1999 liu et al 2000 wu et al 2014 the hiding exposure effects means that the diameter of incipient motion particle is separated with the increase of water flow fine particles are difficult to move due to the hiding effect and coarse particles are easy to move due to the exposure effect it can be seen from the existing research that the additional mass force can be used to reflect the hiding exposure effects between particles qin 1994 yang et al 2002 mao et al 2011 li et al 2020 besides the effective gravity the lifting force and the drag force the additional mass force should also be considered when analyzing the incipient motion of non uniform particles the additional mass force are influenced by particle diameter the particle position on the bed surface and the relative position between particles the formulas of additional mass force in the existing research are usually established by analyzing the particle exposure degree which takes the relative position of particles into account but does not give comprehensive expression to the hiding exposure effects hence the formula of additional mass force needs to be further improved moreover the incipient motion of non uniform particles is also affected by the seepage force and the cohesive force between them which are rarely involved in the existing research liu et al 2011 myrhaug et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and are also be complemented in this paper as seen above the incipient motion of sediment has been studied extensively in fluvial dynamics and its critical conditions can be respectively considered from critical shear stress or critical flow velocity the critical shear stress of incipient motion can be calculated by the critical flow velocity of incipient motion the critical flow velocity of incipient particle motion is determined by the force condition of particles which is related to the particle diameter the particle position on the bed surface and the relative position between particles these three aspects correspond to cohesion seepage force and additional mass force respectively by far the force analysis of sediment particles tends to focus on a certain force there are few studies on comprehensive consideration of multiple forces and there is even no perfect calculation formula for the additional mass force reflecting the non uniformity of particles therefore the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles on the seabed is studied from the perspective of mechanical analysis in the paper the mechanical model of sediment particles is established in consideration of the seepage force the cohesion between particles and the additional mass force meanwhile the calculation formula of the additional mass force is proposed and the incipient flow velocity formula of non uniform sediment particles is derived the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed formulas are verified by comparison with the existing formula of flow velocity of incipient motion flume test and field measurement results finally the influence laws of key parameters and forces on the flow velocity of incipient motion are analyzed 2 determination of incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles compared with uniform particles the incipient motion of non uniform particles has three characteristics multistage non constancy and relative exposure effect the multistage of incipient motion of non uniform particles is divided into four stages particles static stage fine particles starting and coarse particles static stage medium particles partial starting and all starting stage the non constancy refers to the two trends of particle diameter composition in the third stage of incipient particle motion one is that with the incipient motion and loss of fine particles the size of static particle becomes larger resulting in the coarsening of particle diameter the other is that the fine particles flow and supplement into the coarse particles with waves resulting in the fining of particle diameter and the enhancement of sediment carrying capacity of waves the coarsening and fining of particle diameter alternate with the action of waves the relative exposure effect is that the difficulty of incipient particle motion is affected by the masking and exposure of particles the main motion modes of non uniform particles are sliding and rolling taking a single particle as the research object the force condition of sliding and rolling instability of particle is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles is mainly affected by its effective gravity of particle the cohesion between particles the seepage force the uplift force the drag force and the additional mass force 2 1 force on non uniform particles in fig 1 the forces to maintain the stability of particles are effective gravity and cohesion effective gravity is the gravity of particles under water and its formula is 1 g a g γ s γ d i 3 where a g π 6 γ s and γ are the weight of particles and water respectively and d i is the calculated particle diameter there is cohesion force between particles which is related to physical and chemical properties of particles and mainly affected by the particle diameter and the dense state between particles for coarse particle the cohesion is far less than the gravity and it can reach the dense state immediately after settlement so the cohesion of coarse particle is always ignored for fine particle the magnitude of the gravity and the cohesion is not much different and usually it takes some time to reach the dense state so the cohesion of fine particle should be considered the formula of cohesion between particles is as follows dou et al 2001 2 f u α c a u ρ w ε 0 d i γ 0 γ 0 2 5 where a u π 2 α c is a coefficient which can be obtained from α c α c β w where β w d d 1 0 75 α c is a constant coefficient that is α c β w β w d 0 15 m m when d 0 15 m m β w 1 ε 0 is the comprehensive cohesion parameter and taken as 1 75 cm3 s2 for general sediment liu et al 2017 γ 0 is the dry bulk density of sediment and can be determined by fig 2 pu et al 2016 j is particle axial ratio γ 0 is the stable dry bulk density of sediment and its calculation formula is γ 0 0 68 γ d d n where d 1 m m n 0 08 0 014 d d 25 and is generally taken as 0 1 0 2 d 25 means that 25 of the particles in the sediment particle gradation are smaller than this particle diameter in fig 1 the forces that promote the incipient particle motion are uplift force drag force and seepage force the uplift force is caused by the difference of flow velocity at the top and bottom of the particle in water and its formula is as follows 3 f l c l a l d i 2 ρ w u 0 2 2 where a l π 4 c l is the coefficient of uplift force and usually taken as 0 1 μ 0 is the instantaneous flow velocity acting on the particle the drag force is caused by the friction between the flow and the particles and the pressure difference between the front and back of the particle and its formula is expressed as follows 4 f d c d a d d i 2 ρ w u 0 2 2 where a d π 4 c d is the coefficient of drag force and usually taken as 0 4 the seepage force is the force of the seepage flow between particles acting on the particle and its formula is 5 f p c s a p j d i 3 where a p π 6 c s is the shape coefficient of seepage force and generally taken as 1 165 jia et al 2013 and j ρ g i i is the hydraulic gradient i 0 2 2 additional mass force the additional mass force is the force produced by the interaction between non uniform particles the earliest research on the additional mass force began with qin 1980 qin 1980 considered the additional mass force as resistance and approximately assumed that the additional resistance was proportional to the average shear resistance of the mixed sand the formula of additional resistance was obtained however qin 1980 only considered the effect of particle coarsening and regarded the additional force as resistance which could not fully reflect the concealing revealing effect of particles zhang 1992 refined the action mode of additional mass force on the basis of qin when d d m it is a motive force when d d m it is a resistance the calculation formula of additional mass force was obtained which partly considered the masking and exposure effect of particles but the correctness of the definition of additional force as resistance or motive force remained to be verified li et al 1999 proposed the concept of relative exposure degree and obtained that the additional mass force was a function of relative exposure degree bed sand composition and coarsening and fining factors of bed sand that is r f η p m he also assumed that the additional mass force was approximately proportional to the average shear resistance of the mixed sand and obtained the formula of the additional force chen et al 2013 obtained an additional mass force similar to that of li et al 1999 but the relative exposure degree was not considered he et al 2002 thought that there were individual and group effect among particles with the masking and exposure effect therefore the individual particle in the group are subject to the additional mass force f m and the formula of the additional mass force is obtained by integrating the particle diameter the typical additional mass force formulas are summarized in table 1 a formula of additional force is obtained in this paper by comprehensively considering the particle diameter the particle position on the bed surface and the relative position between particles which is expressed as follows 6 f m k γ s γ m α d i 2 d m d i ζ where d i and d m are the research diameter and mean diameter k is the coefficient of additional force k 0 81 d i d m 0 54 α is the area coefficient and taken as π 6 m is the compactness coefficient of the mixture particles m 0 75 0 65 2 η which is related to the degree of non uniformity η d 60 d 10 soil is non uniformed when η 5 the value of m is shown in fig 3 and generally taken as 0 7 for non uniform particles and is coefficient of relative exposure degree when the particle is located on the seabed surface it is generally taken as 0 1 and increases gradually with the deepening of the particle position 2 3 incipient flow velocity formulas of non uniform particles 1 incipient flow velocity of sliding instability when the motion mode of particles is sliding the equilibrium equation can be obtained from fig 1 7 f d f p cos α f u f m g f p sin α f l tan φ f p cos α the instantaneous bottom velocity of sliding instability of non uniform particles is got based on eq 1 6 8 u 0 8 f u f m g f p sin α tan φ f p cos α c d c l tan φ π d 2 ρ w the relationship between the instantaneous bottom velocity and frictional velocity is shown as follows 9 u 0 u 5 75 log 30 2 χ y k s where χ is a function of k s δ for non uniform particles χ 1 k s is the bed surface roughness which is equal to the particle diameter for non uniform particles the coarser particle diameter is often taken as the roughness size kamphuis 1974 bayazit 1976 y is the distance from u to the bed surface and the velocity at y d 90 is used in the paper substituting above parameters into eq 9 can get 10 u u 0 5 75 log 12 08 0 16 u 0 the relationship between the critical incipient flow velocity and frictional flow velocity is shown as follows 11 v 6 5 u h d 1 4 lg h d the critical incipient flow velocity of sliding instability of particle can be obtained as follows 12 v h 1 04 h d 1 4 lg h d

substituting eq 10 eq 14 into eq 11 the formula of the critical incipient flow velocity of rolling instability of particle is obtained as follows 15 v 1 04 h d 1 4 lg h d 8 f m g f u f p sin α l x f p cos α l y π d 2 ρ w c d l y c l l x 3 formula verification to verify the accuracy and validity of eq 12 and eq 15 proposed in this paper the calculation results of these two formulas are comparative analysis with experimental results and other formulas 3 1 comparison with experimental results the results of the formula proposed in this paper are compared with the flume test and the field measurement respectively 1 comparison with flume test the experimental data of non uniform coarse sand and gravel from wuhan university leng 1993 is selected to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed formula the experiment is carried out in a circular variable slope flume with 10 m long and 0 5 m wide several kinds of natural yangtze river sand with continuous graduation fixed lower limit of 0 05 mm and upper limit of 25 12 mm are selected to form a bed with a thickness of about 10 cm some colored sand particles are put into a certain area in the middle line of the test section as the observation target of particle starting test one group of representative data the original test parameters are shown in table 2 is taken and the test data is substituted into the exiting formulas of critical incipient flow velocity of non uniform particle the calculation results are shown in fig 4 it can be obtained from fig 4 the incipient flow velocity of sliding instability of particles is much smaller than that of rolling instability and the experimental results of wuhan university accounting for 40 60 of the particle rolling starting velocity and 50 70 of the experimental results while the critical incipient flow velocity of rolling instability compares well with experimental results when d i d m 1 290 the calculation results of the formula presented in this paper are slightly larger than the flume test results of wuhan university and the deviation is within 5 when d i d m 1 290 the results are slightly smaller than the flume test results and the deviation is about 20 in general the calculation results of the formula proposed in this paper are closer to the flume test results of wuhan university than other formulas which fully proves the accuracy of the formula proposed in this paper 2 comparison with the field measurement the experimental data of incipient flow velocity of fine sediment in yongjiang estuary yang et al 2018 is compared with the calculation results of the formula of incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles proposed in this paper the comparison results are shown in fig 5 it can be obtained from fig 5 the sliding incipient flow velocity of particles is still low accounting for about 50 of the measured result and the rolling incipient flow velocity and the rolling incipient flow velocity of particles is comparatively consistent with the measured results there is a gap between the calculated velocity and the measured velocity in deeper water areas the reason for this phenomenon is that the difference of dry bulk density of non uniform sediment particles with the same median particle diameter is large in the range of field measurement according to pu et al 2016 when the particle diameter is 0 010 mm 0 028 mm the dry bulk density ranges from 500 kg m3 to 1500 kg m3 nevertheless the dry bulk density calculated in this paper is a fixed value so it is difficult to obtain accurate values it can be seen through the above comparison the main motion mode of natural sediment particles is rolling the calculation formula of critical incipient flow velocity of rolling instability of particle proposed in this paper is more accurate for coarse particles than fine particles this is due to the fact that the variation range of dry bulk density of non uniform fine particles is large and the formula can only take a fixed value according to experience 3 2 comparison with typical formulas to facilitate the analysis and comparison the formulas are non dimensionalized at first that is the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is divided by that of uniform particles and then the results are analyzed contrastively the representative formulas selected in this paper are shown in table 3 the results calculated according to the formula in table 3 are shown in fig 6 it can be obtained from fig 6 the trend of the proposed formula is consistent with that of the existing formulas the value of v v j gradually decreases with the increase of d i d m which reflects the influence of the relative exposure degree between non uniform particles on the critical incipient flow velocity when d i d m 1 that is the particles are the finer particles in the non uniform particles the critical incipient flow velocity of particles is larger than that of the equivalent size of uniformed particles otherwise when d i d m 1 the critical incipient flow velocity of the particles is smaller than that of the equivalent size of uniformed particles 4 analysis of influence factors on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles it can be seen from eq 12 and eq 15 that the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is affected by the force acting on particles through the analysis of the calculation formula of the force it can be concluded that the basic parameters involved are as follows particle diameter dry bulk density hydraulic gradient and relative exposure degree the influence of which are analyzed on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles 4 1 parameter selection according to fig 7 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles first decreases and then increases with particle diameter and the minimum value is obtained when the particle diameter is between 0 1 mm and 0 4 mm more generally when the particle diameter is less than 0 2 mm the incipient flow velocity decreases with the particle diameter when the particle diameter is greater than 0 4 mm the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles increases with the particle diameter therefore the turning area should be included in the parameter selection and the selected parameters are shown in table 4 4 2 influence of the particle diameter on the incipient flow velocity the change of particle diameter has an effect on all forces on sediment in order to research the influence of the particle diameter on the incipient flow velocity under the condition of keeping other influencing factors unchanged i e h 2 5 i 0 5 ξ 0 2 the range of particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm and the range of dry bulk density is set as 1 1 103 kg m3 1 3 103 kg m3 then the relation curves of the incipient flow velocity with the particle diameter are shown in fig 8 it can be obtained from fig 8 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles first decreases and then increases with the increase of particle diameter and the minimum value is obtained when the particle diameter is between 0 2 mm 0 4 mm which is consistent with the exiting research results meanwhile when the particle diameter is smaller than 0 2 mm the dry bulk density has a great influence on the flow velocity and when the particle diameter is larger than 0 4 mm the dry bulk density has little influence on the flow velocity 4 3 influence of the dry bulk density on the incipient flow velocity the dry bulk density of particles affects the incipient flow velocity of particles by influencing the cohesion according to fig 8 the cohesion between coarser particles can be ignored therefore the finer particles is taken as the research object for analysis the particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm 0 04 mm and 0 05 mm and the range of dry bulk density 103 kg m3 of non uniform particles is set as 0 7 1 2 0 8 1 4 0 9 1 5 1 0 1 4 and 1 1 1 5 respectively firstly the variation of the cohesion with the dry bulk density of particles is analyzed as shown in fig 9 it can be obtained from fig 9 the cohesion increases with the increase of the dry bulk density and the increasing rate increases with the increase of particle diameter when the particle diameter is 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm 0 04 mm and 0 05 mm the increasing rate is 9 0627 35 78 71 788 71 31 and 109 837 respectively then the influence of dry bulk density on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is analyzed as shown in fig 10 it can be obtained from fig 10 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles increases linearly with the increase of dry bulk density when the particle diameter is 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm 0 04 mm and 0 05 mm the increase slopes of the incipient flow velocity is 1 2766 1 0628 0 9545 0 8705 and 0 8268 respectively and the slope decreases with the increase of particle diameter from fig 1 the cohesion is to maintain the stability of particles the larger the cohesion the larger the incipient flow velocity required 4 4 influence of the hydraulic gradient on the incipient flow velocity the influence of hydraulic gradient on incipient flow velocity is reflected by seepage force therefore the influence of hydraulic gradient on seepage force is studied firstly in this paper under the condition of keeping other influencing factors unchanged i e h 2 5 γ 0 1 5 ξ 0 2 the range of particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm and the range of hydraulic gradient is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm the variation of seepage force with hydraulic gradient is shown in fig 11 it can be obtained from fig 11 the seepage force increases with the increase of hydraulic gradient and the increasing rate increases with the increase of particle diameter comparing fig 11 b with fig 9 the seepage force of fine particles is much smaller than the cohesion the difference is more than two orders of magnitude that is the influence of seepage force on coarse particles is much greater than that on fine particles hence this paper only studies the influence of seepage force on the incipient flow velocity of coarse particles that is the influence of hydraulic gradient on the incipient flow velocity of coarse particles the influence of different hydraulic gradient on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is shown in fig 12 it can be obtained from fig 12 the incipient flow velocity decreases with the increase of hydraulic gradient and the decreasing rate increases with the increase of particle diameter in this paper the angle between the seepage force and the seabed surface is less than 90 which means the seepage force becomes a driving force so as the hydraulic gradient increases the seepage force increases gradually and causing the incipient flow velocity of particles decreases 4 5 influence of the relative exposure degree on the incipient flow velocity the influence of relative exposure degree on incipient flow velocity is reflected by the additional mass force under the condition of keeping other influencing factors unchanged i e h 2 5 γ 0 1 5 i 0 5 the range of particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm assuming that the particles are located on the surface layer subsurface layer and below of the bed surface the relative exposure is respectively set as 0 2 0 6 1 0 1 4 1 8 and 2 2 the variation of the additional mass force with relative exposure degree is shown in fig 13 it can be obtained from fig 13 for coarse and fine particles the additional mass force increases with the increase of relative exposure degree the variation of incipient flow velocity with the relative exposure degree is shown in fig 14 it can be obtained from fig 14 for fine particles the incipient flow velocity has almost no change with relative exposure for coarse particles the incipient flow velocity decreases with the increase of relative exposure degree and the effect of relative exposure degree on the incipient flow velocity of coarse particles is greater than that of fine particles comparing fig 13 a with fig 9 the effect of cohesion for fine particles is much greater than that of the additional mass force compared with the river sediment transport the non uniformity of sediment has more influence on the pebble bed which is consistent with the results in this paper 4 6 discussions of the acting force as can be seen from fig 9 when the particle diameter is small the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles decreases with the increase of particle diameter and the dry bulk density has an effect on the incipient flow velocity when the particle diameter is large the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles increases with the increase of particle diameter and the dry bulk density has no effect on the incipient flow velocity this indicates that the forces affecting the incipient flow velocity are different with range of particle diameter for fine particles it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 a and 13 a that when effective gravity drag force and uplift force are not taken into account the cohesion between fine particles is the largest and the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is mainly affected by the cohesion for coarse particles the cohesion between particles is not taken into account compared with figs 11 b and fig 13 b the difference between the seepage force and the additional mass force is not significant at the beginning and then the seepage force is greater than the additional mass force with the increase of particle size therefore for coarse particles when effective gravity drag force and uplift force are not taken into account the seepage force has the greatest influence on the incipient flow velocity the variation of forces acting on particles with particle size is shown in fig 15 it can be obtained from fig 15 1 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles is affected by the effective gravity of particles the cohesion between particles the seepage force the uplift force the drag force and the additional mass force which all increase with the increase of particle diameter among them the increasing rate of effective gravity and drag force increases significantly with the increase of particle diameter the increasing rate of seepage force and additional mass force begins to increase significantly when the particle diameter is greater than 0 3 mm and the increase rate of cohesion force gradually flattens with the increase of particle diameter 2 when the particle diameter is less than 0 3 mm the cohesion which hinders the incipient motion of particles and the drag force which promotes the incipient motion of particles are much larger than other forces the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is mainly affected by these two forces and the increasing rate of cohesion is lower than that of the drag force therefore the velocity required for the incipient motion of particles decreases with the increase of the particle diameter when the particle diameter is larger than 0 3 mm the growth rate of the gravity which hinders the incipient motion of particles and the seepage force which promotes incipient motion of particles begin to increase significantly compared with other forces but the value of the seepage force is smaller than the value of the gravity so the incipient flow velocity required for incipient motion of particles gradually increases 5 conclusions in this paper the mechanical analysis of natural seabed sediment particles is carried out and the formula of the additional mass force is confirmed in consideration of the position randomness on the bed surface and the relative exposure degree of non uniform particles the formulas of incipient flow velocity under sliding instability and rolling instability of seabed sediment are proposed the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed formulas are verified by comparison with the results of flume test field measurement and other formulas finally the influencing factors of incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles are analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the incipient motion mode of non uniform sediment particles is generally rolling instability 2 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles first decreases and then increases with the particle diameter the minimum incipient flow velocity is obtained when particle diameter is between 0 1 mm 0 4 mm 3 for fine particles the cohesion of particles and the incipient flow velocity increases with the dry bulk density 4 the seepage force increases with the hydraulic gradient while the incipient flow velocity decreases with the hydraulic gradient the additional mass force increases with the relative exposure degree while the incipient flow velocity decreases with the relative exposure degree 5 the value and the increasing rate of the acting force are related to the particle diameter when the particle diameter is less than 0 3 mm the values of cohesion force and drag force are larger the increasing rate of drag force is higher than that of cohesion force and the incipient flow velocity is mainly affected by these two forces when the particle diameter is more than 0 3 mm the increasing rates of gravity and seepage force become more obvious and the increasing rate of seepage force is lower than that of gravity the incipient flow velocity of particles is mainly affected by gravity seepage force and drag force data availability statement all data models and codes that support the findings of this study are

20221,the sediments on the natural seabed are generally non uniform particles the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles has always been a key problem in the ocean engineering in this paper the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles by considering the additional mass force is studied by means of mechanical analysis and comparative verification firstly the mechanical model of non uniform sediment particles is established in consideration of the seepage force cohesion and the additional mass force caused by non uniformity combined with the randomness of the position of non uniform particles on the bed surface and the relative exposure degree of non uniform particles a systematic and comprehensive formula of the additional mass force is proposed the mechanical equilibrium equations of critical incipient motion of the non uniform sediment particles are established and the critical incipient flow velocity of sediment particles under sliding instability and rolling instability are derived then the accuracy and validity of the proposed formulas are verified by comparison with the results of flume test field measurement and other formulas finally the influence factors of the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles are analyzed and the change laws of influence factors are obtained the results show that 1 the incipient motion form of sediments on the natural seabed is generally the rolling instability 2 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles decreases first and then increases with particle diameter 3 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles increases with the dry bulk density 4 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles decreases with the increase of hydraulic gradient and relative exposure degree keywords non uniform sediments additional mass force relative exposure degree incipient flow velocity 1 introduction the incipient motion of sediment particles is an important basic research in ocean engineering such as coastal erosion evolution of beach sediment near port siltation of harbor basin and channel local scour of coastal buildings and so on bakhtyar et al 2009 homaei et al 2020 studies on the incipient motion of sediment particles can be traced back to the 17th century egiazaroff 1965 the earlier research mainly focused on larger uniform particles with negligible cohesion however the particles on natural seabed are non uniformed therefore the research on the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles is crucial to the theoretical analysis and engineering practice many achievements have been made on the incipient motion of uniform and non uniform particles at home and abroad there are mainly three research methods the first is the shields diagram shields 1936 the shields diagram is a mature method for the incipient motion of uniform particles the second is the empirical formula of the incipient motion of particles established from the experimental data hossein et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 the third is mechanical mechanism analysis by analyzing the force on particles during incipient motion the equilibrium equation and physical equation are established and the incipient wave height formula or the incipient flow velocity formula of particles is obtained at the end of last century and the beginning of this century a large number of scholars in china studied the incipient motion and transport mechanism of sediment particles tang 1963 han 1996 dou 1999 and cai 2019 expounded the motion mechanism from the characteristics of the incipient motion of uniform particle and deduced the incipient flow velocity formula of uniform particles under rolling instability compared with uniform particles the incipient motion of non uniform particles needs to solve the hiding exposure effects between particles caused by the difference of particle diameter and the random of particle positions kramer 1935 chen and xie 1988 leng and wang 1994 subhasish 1999 liu et al 2000 wu et al 2014 the hiding exposure effects means that the diameter of incipient motion particle is separated with the increase of water flow fine particles are difficult to move due to the hiding effect and coarse particles are easy to move due to the exposure effect it can be seen from the existing research that the additional mass force can be used to reflect the hiding exposure effects between particles qin 1994 yang et al 2002 mao et al 2011 li et al 2020 besides the effective gravity the lifting force and the drag force the additional mass force should also be considered when analyzing the incipient motion of non uniform particles the additional mass force are influenced by particle diameter the particle position on the bed surface and the relative position between particles the formulas of additional mass force in the existing research are usually established by analyzing the particle exposure degree which takes the relative position of particles into account but does not give comprehensive expression to the hiding exposure effects hence the formula of additional mass force needs to be further improved moreover the incipient motion of non uniform particles is also affected by the seepage force and the cohesive force between them which are rarely involved in the existing research liu et al 2011 myrhaug et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and are also be complemented in this paper as seen above the incipient motion of sediment has been studied extensively in fluvial dynamics and its critical conditions can be respectively considered from critical shear stress or critical flow velocity the critical shear stress of incipient motion can be calculated by the critical flow velocity of incipient motion the critical flow velocity of incipient particle motion is determined by the force condition of particles which is related to the particle diameter the particle position on the bed surface and the relative position between particles these three aspects correspond to cohesion seepage force and additional mass force respectively by far the force analysis of sediment particles tends to focus on a certain force there are few studies on comprehensive consideration of multiple forces and there is even no perfect calculation formula for the additional mass force reflecting the non uniformity of particles therefore the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles on the seabed is studied from the perspective of mechanical analysis in the paper the mechanical model of sediment particles is established in consideration of the seepage force the cohesion between particles and the additional mass force meanwhile the calculation formula of the additional mass force is proposed and the incipient flow velocity formula of non uniform sediment particles is derived the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed formulas are verified by comparison with the existing formula of flow velocity of incipient motion flume test and field measurement results finally the influence laws of key parameters and forces on the flow velocity of incipient motion are analyzed 2 determination of incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles compared with uniform particles the incipient motion of non uniform particles has three characteristics multistage non constancy and relative exposure effect the multistage of incipient motion of non uniform particles is divided into four stages particles static stage fine particles starting and coarse particles static stage medium particles partial starting and all starting stage the non constancy refers to the two trends of particle diameter composition in the third stage of incipient particle motion one is that with the incipient motion and loss of fine particles the size of static particle becomes larger resulting in the coarsening of particle diameter the other is that the fine particles flow and supplement into the coarse particles with waves resulting in the fining of particle diameter and the enhancement of sediment carrying capacity of waves the coarsening and fining of particle diameter alternate with the action of waves the relative exposure effect is that the difficulty of incipient particle motion is affected by the masking and exposure of particles the main motion modes of non uniform particles are sliding and rolling taking a single particle as the research object the force condition of sliding and rolling instability of particle is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the incipient motion of non uniform sediment particles is mainly affected by its effective gravity of particle the cohesion between particles the seepage force the uplift force the drag force and the additional mass force 2 1 force on non uniform particles in fig 1 the forces to maintain the stability of particles are effective gravity and cohesion effective gravity is the gravity of particles under water and its formula is 1 g a g γ s γ d i 3 where a g π 6 γ s and γ are the weight of particles and water respectively and d i is the calculated particle diameter there is cohesion force between particles which is related to physical and chemical properties of particles and mainly affected by the particle diameter and the dense state between particles for coarse particle the cohesion is far less than the gravity and it can reach the dense state immediately after settlement so the cohesion of coarse particle is always ignored for fine particle the magnitude of the gravity and the cohesion is not much different and usually it takes some time to reach the dense state so the cohesion of fine particle should be considered the formula of cohesion between particles is as follows dou et al 2001 2 f u α c a u ρ w ε 0 d i γ 0 γ 0 2 5 where a u π 2 α c is a coefficient which can be obtained from α c α c β w where β w d d 1 0 75 α c is a constant coefficient that is α c β w β w d 0 15 m m when d 0 15 m m β w 1 ε 0 is the comprehensive cohesion parameter and taken as 1 75 cm3 s2 for general sediment liu et al 2017 γ 0 is the dry bulk density of sediment and can be determined by fig 2 pu et al 2016 j is particle axial ratio γ 0 is the stable dry bulk density of sediment and its calculation formula is γ 0 0 68 γ d d n where d 1 m m n 0 08 0 014 d d 25 and is generally taken as 0 1 0 2 d 25 means that 25 of the particles in the sediment particle gradation are smaller than this particle diameter in fig 1 the forces that promote the incipient particle motion are uplift force drag force and seepage force the uplift force is caused by the difference of flow velocity at the top and bottom of the particle in water and its formula is as follows 3 f l c l a l d i 2 ρ w u 0 2 2 where a l π 4 c l is the coefficient of uplift force and usually taken as 0 1 μ 0 is the instantaneous flow velocity acting on the particle the drag force is caused by the friction between the flow and the particles and the pressure difference between the front and back of the particle and its formula is expressed as follows 4 f d c d a d d i 2 ρ w u 0 2 2 where a d π 4 c d is the coefficient of drag force and usually taken as 0 4 the seepage force is the force of the seepage flow between particles acting on the particle and its formula is 5 f p c s a p j d i 3 where a p π 6 c s is the shape coefficient of seepage force and generally taken as 1 165 jia et al 2013 and j ρ g i i is the hydraulic gradient i 0 2 2 additional mass force the additional mass force is the force produced by the interaction between non uniform particles the earliest research on the additional mass force began with qin 1980 qin 1980 considered the additional mass force as resistance and approximately assumed that the additional resistance was proportional to the average shear resistance of the mixed sand the formula of additional resistance was obtained however qin 1980 only considered the effect of particle coarsening and regarded the additional force as resistance which could not fully reflect the concealing revealing effect of particles zhang 1992 refined the action mode of additional mass force on the basis of qin when d d m it is a motive force when d d m it is a resistance the calculation formula of additional mass force was obtained which partly considered the masking and exposure effect of particles but the correctness of the definition of additional force as resistance or motive force remained to be verified li et al 1999 proposed the concept of relative exposure degree and obtained that the additional mass force was a function of relative exposure degree bed sand composition and coarsening and fining factors of bed sand that is r f η p m he also assumed that the additional mass force was approximately proportional to the average shear resistance of the mixed sand and obtained the formula of the additional force chen et al 2013 obtained an additional mass force similar to that of li et al 1999 but the relative exposure degree was not considered he et al 2002 thought that there were individual and group effect among particles with the masking and exposure effect therefore the individual particle in the group are subject to the additional mass force f m and the formula of the additional mass force is obtained by integrating the particle diameter the typical additional mass force formulas are summarized in table 1 a formula of additional force is obtained in this paper by comprehensively considering the particle diameter the particle position on the bed surface and the relative position between particles which is expressed as follows 6 f m k γ s γ m α d i 2 d m d i ζ where d i and d m are the research diameter and mean diameter k is the coefficient of additional force k 0 81 d i d m 0 54 α is the area coefficient and taken as π 6 m is the compactness coefficient of the mixture particles m 0 75 0 65 2 η which is related to the degree of non uniformity η d 60 d 10 soil is non uniformed when η 5 the value of m is shown in fig 3 and generally taken as 0 7 for non uniform particles and is coefficient of relative exposure degree when the particle is located on the seabed surface it is generally taken as 0 1 and increases gradually with the deepening of the particle position 2 3 incipient flow velocity formulas of non uniform particles 1 incipient flow velocity of sliding instability when the motion mode of particles is sliding the equilibrium equation can be obtained from fig 1 7 f d f p cos α f u f m g f p sin α f l tan φ f p cos α the instantaneous bottom velocity of sliding instability of non uniform particles is got based on eq 1 6 8 u 0 8 f u f m g f p sin α tan φ f p cos α c d c l tan φ π d 2 ρ w the relationship between the instantaneous bottom velocity and frictional velocity is shown as follows 9 u 0 u 5 75 log 30 2 χ y k s where χ is a function of k s δ for non uniform particles χ 1 k s is the bed surface roughness which is equal to the particle diameter for non uniform particles the coarser particle diameter is often taken as the roughness size kamphuis 1974 bayazit 1976 y is the distance from u to the bed surface and the velocity at y d 90 is used in the paper substituting above parameters into eq 9 can get 10 u u 0 5 75 log 12 08 0 16 u 0 the relationship between the critical incipient flow velocity and frictional flow velocity is shown as follows 11 v 6 5 u h d 1 4 lg h d the critical incipient flow velocity of sliding instability of particle can be obtained as follows 12 v h 1 04 h d 1 4 lg h d 8 f u f m g f p sin α tan φ f p cos α c d c l tan π d 2 ρ w 2 incipient flow velocity of rolling instability when the motion mode of particles is rolling the moment balance equation of particle

substituting eq 10 eq 14 into eq 11 the formula of the critical incipient flow velocity of rolling instability of particle is obtained as follows 15 v 1 04 h d 1 4 lg h d 8 f m g f u f p sin α l x f p cos α l y π d 2 ρ w c d l y c l l x 3 formula verification to verify the accuracy and validity of eq 12 and eq 15 proposed in this paper the calculation results of these two formulas are comparative analysis with experimental results and other formulas 3 1 comparison with experimental results the results of the formula proposed in this paper are compared with the flume test and the field measurement respectively 1 comparison with flume test the experimental data of non uniform coarse sand and gravel from wuhan university leng 1993 is selected to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed formula the experiment is carried out in a circular variable slope flume with 10 m long and 0 5 m wide several kinds of natural yangtze river sand with continuous graduation fixed lower limit of 0 05 mm and upper limit of 25 12 mm are selected to form a bed with a thickness of about 10 cm some colored sand particles are put into a certain area in the middle line of the test section as the observation target of particle starting test one group of representative data the original test parameters are shown in table 2 is taken and the test data is substituted into the exiting formulas of critical incipient flow velocity of non uniform particle the calculation results are shown in fig 4 it can be obtained from fig 4 the incipient flow velocity of sliding instability of particles is much smaller than that of rolling instability and the experimental results of wuhan university accounting for 40 60 of the particle rolling starting velocity and 50 70 of the experimental results while the critical incipient flow velocity of rolling instability compares well with experimental results when d i d m 1 290 the calculation results of the formula presented in this paper are slightly larger than the flume test results of wuhan university and the deviation is within 5 when d i d m 1 290 the results are slightly smaller than the flume test results and the deviation is about 20 in general the calculation results of the formula proposed in this paper are closer to the flume test results of wuhan university than other formulas which fully proves the accuracy of the formula proposed in this paper 2 comparison with the field measurement the experimental data of incipient flow velocity of fine sediment in yongjiang estuary yang et al 2018 is compared with the calculation results of the formula of incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles proposed in this paper the comparison results are shown in fig 5 it can be obtained from fig 5 the sliding incipient flow velocity of particles is still low accounting for about 50 of the measured result and the rolling incipient flow velocity and the rolling incipient flow velocity of particles is comparatively consistent with the measured results there is a gap between the calculated velocity and the measured velocity in deeper water areas the reason for this phenomenon is that the difference of dry bulk density of non uniform sediment particles with the same median particle diameter is large in the range of field measurement according to pu et al 2016 when the particle diameter is 0 010 mm 0 028 mm the dry bulk density ranges from 500 kg m3 to 1500 kg m3 nevertheless the dry bulk density calculated in this paper is a fixed value so it is difficult to obtain accurate values it can be seen through the above comparison the main motion mode of natural sediment particles is rolling the calculation formula of critical incipient flow velocity of rolling instability of particle proposed in this paper is more accurate for coarse particles than fine particles this is due to the fact that the variation range of dry bulk density of non uniform fine particles is large and the formula can only take a fixed value according to experience 3 2 comparison with typical formulas to facilitate the analysis and comparison the formulas are non dimensionalized at first that is the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is divided by that of uniform particles and then the results are analyzed contrastively the representative formulas selected in this paper are shown in table 3 the results calculated according to the formula in table 3 are shown in fig 6 it can be obtained from fig 6 the trend of the proposed formula is consistent with that of the existing formulas the value of v v j gradually decreases with the increase of d i d m which reflects the influence of the relative exposure degree between non uniform particles on the critical incipient flow velocity when d i d m 1 that is the particles are the finer particles in the non uniform particles the critical incipient flow velocity of particles is larger than that of the equivalent size of uniformed particles otherwise when d i d m 1 the critical incipient flow velocity of the particles is smaller than that of the equivalent size of uniformed particles 4 analysis of influence factors on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles it can be seen from eq 12 and eq 15 that the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is affected by the force acting on particles through the analysis of the calculation formula of the force it can be concluded that the basic parameters involved are as follows particle diameter dry bulk density hydraulic gradient and relative exposure degree the influence of which are analyzed on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles 4 1 parameter selection according to fig 7 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles first decreases and then increases with particle diameter and the minimum value is obtained when the particle diameter is between 0 1 mm and 0 4 mm more generally when the particle diameter is less than 0 2 mm the incipient flow velocity decreases with the particle diameter when the particle diameter is greater than 0 4 mm the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles increases with the particle diameter therefore the turning area should be included in the parameter selection and the selected parameters are shown in table 4 4 2 influence of the particle diameter on the incipient flow velocity the change of particle diameter has an effect on all forces on sediment in order to research the influence of the particle diameter on the incipient flow velocity under the condition of keeping other influencing factors unchanged i e h 2 5 i 0 5 ξ 0 2 the range of particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm and the range of dry bulk density is set as 1 1 103 kg m3 1 3 103 kg m3 then the relation curves of the incipient flow velocity with the particle diameter are shown in fig 8 it can be obtained from fig 8 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles first decreases and then increases with the increase of particle diameter and the minimum value is obtained when the particle diameter is between 0 2 mm 0 4 mm which is consistent with the exiting research results meanwhile when the particle diameter is smaller than 0 2 mm the dry bulk density has a great influence on the flow velocity and when the particle diameter is larger than 0 4 mm the dry bulk density has little influence on the flow velocity 4 3 influence of the dry bulk density on the incipient flow velocity the dry bulk density of particles affects the incipient flow velocity of particles by influencing the cohesion according to fig 8 the cohesion between coarser particles can be ignored therefore the finer particles is taken as the research object for analysis the particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm 0 04 mm and 0 05 mm and the range of dry bulk density 103 kg m3 of non uniform particles is set as 0 7 1 2 0 8 1 4 0 9 1 5 1 0 1 4 and 1 1 1 5 respectively firstly the variation of the cohesion with the dry bulk density of particles is analyzed as shown in fig 9 it can be obtained from fig 9 the cohesion increases with the increase of the dry bulk density and the increasing rate increases with the increase of particle diameter when the particle diameter is 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm 0 04 mm and 0 05 mm the increasing rate is 9 0627 35 78 71 788 71 31 and 109 837 respectively then the influence of dry bulk density on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is analyzed as shown in fig 10 it can be obtained from fig 10 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles increases linearly with the increase of dry bulk density when the particle diameter is 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm 0 04 mm and 0 05 mm the increase slopes of the incipient flow velocity is 1 2766 1 0628 0 9545 0 8705 and 0 8268 respectively and the slope decreases with the increase of particle diameter from fig 1 the cohesion is to maintain the stability of particles the larger the cohesion the larger the incipient flow velocity required 4 4 influence of the hydraulic gradient on the incipient flow velocity the influence of hydraulic gradient on incipient flow velocity is reflected by seepage force therefore the influence of hydraulic gradient on seepage force is studied firstly in this paper under the condition of keeping other influencing factors unchanged i e h 2 5 γ 0 1 5 ξ 0 2 the range of particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm and the range of hydraulic gradient is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm the variation of seepage force with hydraulic gradient is shown in fig 11 it can be obtained from fig 11 the seepage force increases with the increase of hydraulic gradient and the increasing rate increases with the increase of particle diameter comparing fig 11 b with fig 9 the seepage force of fine particles is much smaller than the cohesion the difference is more than two orders of magnitude that is the influence of seepage force on coarse particles is much greater than that on fine particles hence this paper only studies the influence of seepage force on the incipient flow velocity of coarse particles that is the influence of hydraulic gradient on the incipient flow velocity of coarse particles the influence of different hydraulic gradient on the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is shown in fig 12 it can be obtained from fig 12 the incipient flow velocity decreases with the increase of hydraulic gradient and the decreasing rate increases with the increase of particle diameter in this paper the angle between the seepage force and the seabed surface is less than 90 which means the seepage force becomes a driving force so as the hydraulic gradient increases the seepage force increases gradually and causing the incipient flow velocity of particles decreases 4 5 influence of the relative exposure degree on the incipient flow velocity the influence of relative exposure degree on incipient flow velocity is reflected by the additional mass force under the condition of keeping other influencing factors unchanged i e h 2 5 γ 0 1 5 i 0 5 the range of particle diameter is set as 0 01 mm 1 0 mm assuming that the particles are located on the surface layer subsurface layer and below of the bed surface the relative exposure is respectively set as 0 2 0 6 1 0 1 4 1 8 and 2 2 the variation of the additional mass force with relative exposure degree is shown in fig 13 it can be obtained from fig 13 for coarse and fine particles the additional mass force increases with the increase of relative exposure degree the variation of incipient flow velocity with the relative exposure degree is shown in fig 14 it can be obtained from fig 14 for fine particles the incipient flow velocity has almost no change with relative exposure for coarse particles the incipient flow velocity decreases with the increase of relative exposure degree and the effect of relative exposure degree on the incipient flow velocity of coarse particles is greater than that of fine particles comparing fig 13 a with fig 9 the effect of cohesion for fine particles is much greater than that of the additional mass force compared with the river sediment transport the non uniformity of sediment has more influence on the pebble bed which is consistent with the results in this paper 4 6 discussions of the acting force as can be seen from fig 9 when the particle diameter is small the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles decreases with the increase of particle diameter and the dry bulk density has an effect on the incipient flow velocity when the particle diameter is large the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles increases with the increase of particle diameter and the dry bulk density has no effect on the incipient flow velocity this indicates that the forces affecting the incipient flow velocity are different with range of particle diameter for fine particles it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 a and 13 a that when effective gravity drag force and uplift force are not taken into account the cohesion between fine particles is the largest and the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is mainly affected by the cohesion for coarse particles the cohesion between particles is not taken into account compared with figs 11 b and fig 13 b the difference between the seepage force and the additional mass force is not significant at the beginning and then the seepage force is greater than the additional mass force with the increase of particle size therefore for coarse particles when effective gravity drag force and uplift force are not taken into account the seepage force has the greatest influence on the incipient flow velocity the variation of forces acting on particles with particle size is shown in fig 15 it can be obtained from fig 15 1 the incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles is affected by the effective gravity of particles the cohesion between particles the seepage force the uplift force the drag force and the additional mass force which all increase with the increase of particle diameter among them the increasing rate of effective gravity and drag force increases significantly with the increase of particle diameter the increasing rate of seepage force and additional mass force begins to increase significantly when the particle diameter is greater than 0 3 mm and the increase rate of cohesion force gradually flattens with the increase of particle diameter 2 when the particle diameter is less than 0 3 mm the cohesion which hinders the incipient motion of particles and the drag force which promotes the incipient motion of particles are much larger than other forces the incipient flow velocity of non uniform particles is mainly affected by these two forces and the increasing rate of cohesion is lower than that of the drag force therefore the velocity required for the incipient motion of particles decreases with the increase of the particle diameter when the particle diameter is larger than 0 3 mm the growth rate of the gravity which hinders the incipient motion of particles and the seepage force which promotes incipient motion of particles begin to increase significantly compared with other forces but the value of the seepage force is smaller than the value of the gravity so the incipient flow velocity required for incipient motion of particles gradually increases 5 conclusions in this paper the mechanical analysis of natural seabed sediment particles is carried out and the formula of the additional mass force is confirmed in consideration of the position randomness on the bed surface and the relative exposure degree of non uniform particles the formulas of incipient flow velocity under sliding instability and rolling instability of seabed sediment are proposed the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed formulas are verified by comparison with the results of flume test field measurement and other formulas finally the influencing factors of incipient flow velocity of non uniform sediment particles are analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the incipient motion mode of non uniform sediment particles is generally rolling instability 2 the incipient flow velocity of sediment particles first decreases and then increases with the particle diameter the minimum incipient flow velocity is obtained when particle diameter is between 0 1 mm 0 4 mm 3 for fine particles the cohesion of particles and the incipient flow velocity increases with the dry bulk density 4 the seepage force increases with the hydraulic gradient while the incipient flow velocity decreases with the hydraulic gradient the additional mass force increases with the relative exposure degree while the incipient flow velocity decreases with the relative exposure degree 5 the value and the increasing rate of the acting force are related to the particle diameter when the particle diameter is less than 0 3 mm the values of cohesion force and drag force are larger the increasing rate of drag force is higher than that of cohesion force and the incipient flow velocity is mainly affected by these two forces when the particle diameter is more than 0 3 mm the increasing rates of gravity and seepage force become more obvious and the increasing rate of seepage force is lower than that of gravity the incipient flow velocity of particles is mainly affected by gravity seepage force and drag force data availability statement all data models and codes that support the findings of this study are

the mooring load in the other line increased greatly however the net cage system reached a new force equilibrium within a few seconds the mooring line tension ratios between the failed and intact states observed in this study were between 1 5 and 2 0 in addition to the strong mooring tension response a significant yaw rotation of the floating collar of the net cage system was also observed but the motion stopped within a second after the failure occurred in addition a comparison of mooring forces between the experiment and numerical simulations exhibited good agreement for current velocities less than 25 cm s the simulated results showed that after the failure of one upstream line the mooring load in selected lateral mooring lines increased substantially and the net volume change showed a sharp peak at the time of failure moreover when the cage system regained balance after failure the net cage volume returned to its pre failure value finally the reduction in the safety

simulation 1 introduction marine cage cultures have become an important part of the fishing industry in many countries fao 2020 including taiwan where the industry has developed greatly over the past two decades however failures of mooring lines that are usually made of synthetic fibers such as nylon continue to be a problem when a mooring line fails the floating collar may collide with each other and the netting structure may become entangled see fig 1 this type of accidents may result in considerable economic losses therefore studying mooring line failures in cage aquacultures is essential for understanding this type of events in recent decades the hydrodynamic characteristics of marine net cage systems were extensively investigated via laboratory experiments numerical simulations and field measurements lader et al 2003 developed a super element approach for modeling the hydrodynamic forces acting on a 3d net structure exposed to waves and currents lader and enerhaug 2005 conducted

bi et al 2018 effects of farmed fish he et al 2018 bi et al 2020 and fatigue assessment of mooring systems hou et al 2018 2020 in contrast research on the failure of mooring solutions utilized in the net cage systems remains rare in an effort to remedy this yang et al 2020 developed a time domain numerical model to simulate the failure of the mooring system of a four point mooring cage at a scale ratio of 1 30 subjected to regular wave and current conditions the results showed that the mooring line tension in the surviving anchors increased greatly and that the tension ratio between failed and intact states increased with increasing wave height and current velocity but decreased with the decrease in the wave period following failure the net cage system rapidly reached a new force equilibrium state within a few wave periods tang et al 2020 explored the hydrodynamic response of the net cage system to irregular waves and currents after mooring failure the results revealed that after losing one upstream anchor both the maximum tension in the surviving upstream anchor and the net cage drift displacements increased greatly substantial changes in the power spectrum of the mooring tension could be observed in both the wave and lower frequency bands however the aforementioned studies focused on numerical simulations thus laboratory experiments are required to verify their observations in this study a net cage model with an eight point mooring system was placed in a water flume that can generate water currents two load cells were installed on the two upstream mooring lines a device equipped with a pneumatic cylinder and a blade was designed to cut one of the upstream mooring lines to simulate its failure the model was tested in both intact and failed states of its mooring in order to measure how the mooring forces were affected by the current additionally the experimental results were used for the validation of a time domain numerical model this

provided a discussion of aspects such as safety factor sf before and after failure effect of mooring line failure on surviving lines and net volume changes finally in section 6 conclusions and suggestions are presented 2 physical model tests the experiment was carried out in the tainan hydraulics laboratory of the national cheng kung university in taiwan the wave tank available there is equipped with a wind generator piston wave generator and circulating current pump and can generate wind waves and currents both simultaneously and separately it is 50 m long 7 m wide and 1 2 m deep because this study was concerned with fish farms located in sheltered areas only water currents were simulated 2 1 experimental setup the net cage model adopted in this study is shown in figs 2 and 3 while table 1 lists its specifications its full scale prototype had a 30 m diameter inner floating collar and 12 5 m deep net installed in water of a constant water depth of 20 m in this model froude scaling with geometric similarity was adopted while the model did not intend to represent a specific full scale site assuming a model scale of 1 25 the corresponding full scale values are also given in table 1 for reference huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 existing laboratory experiments on net cage systems usually utilize four point mooring systems e g huang et al 2007 however because the wave tank used in this study was large enough the net cage system was equipped with an eight point mooring fixed the bottom of the tank the physical model consisted of a floating collar cylinder net and tube sinker that were attached to the bottom of the net two upstream mooring lines were deployed through two pulleys connected to two load cells fixed to a plate laid on the tank wall both load cells were the lt6 5 type manufactured by the ssk company of japan whose reproducibility was 0 2 fs linearity 0 2 fs temperature characteristic 0 05 ro c output voltage 10 v input and output resistance 500 ω and operating temperature range between 15 c and 75 c the maximum force recorded during the test was 49 05 n three acoustic doppler velocimeters advs manufactured by the nortek company of norway were installed on the front of the net cage model in order to simultaneously measure the inflow velocity the three advs were evenly spaced at 100 cm intervals with the mean value of their measurements taken as the inflow velocity the mooring line cutting device is shown in fig 4 this device was primarily composed of a blade and a pneumatic cylinder that provided cutting power by means of an air compressor in this experiment the mooring line was cut by manually pressing a button 10 s after the beginning of the experimental procedure 2 2 experimental procedure the flowchart of experimental procedure is shown in fig 5 initially the no load offset readings of the load cells and advs were recorded next it was necessary to check the pre tension of the two mooring lines using the measurements of two load cells and adjust the difference between them to less than 5 this was done to ensure that the forces in the mooring system were symmetrical then the water current velocity was increased to the predetermined value and 30 min was allowed to elapse for the flow field to stabilize the following steps comprised the main part of the experiment step 1 was to collect measurements from the load cells and advs of the mooring system in the intact condition for 60 s then in step 2 the mooring line cutting test was conducted recording started and after 10 s the button was pressed to cut the mooring line linked to load cell 1 the test data were then checked and if found to be in order the current generator was stopped 3 numerical simulations the numerical simulations adopted a model developed specifically for this study which is briefly introduced below 3 1 forces acting on net cage system the hydrodynamic force exerted on the object was approximated by the morison equation as the sum of the drag force f d and inertia force f i drag force f d is usually formulated as follows 1 f d t c d 1 2 ρ w a v r t v r t where ρ w is the sea water density a is the projected area of the object perpendicular to the flow direction v r t v t ẋ t is the relative velocity between the instantaneous flow velocity v t and the moving object velocity ẋ t c d is the drag coefficient and t is time on the other hand inertia force f i can be divided into the froude krylov force and the added mass effect 2 f i t ρ w v d v t d t k m ρ w v d v r t d t where v is the volume of the water displaced by the object and k m is the added mass coefficient by including other external forces such as buoyancy f b gravitational force f w and tension force f t acting on the mooring lines and net the equation of motion for each element of the net cage system can be expressed as follows 3 m k m ρ w v x 1 2 c d ρ w a v x v x c m ρ w v d v d t f b f w f t where m is the mass of the element and ẋ and ẍ are the velocity and acceleration corresponding to its central displacement x respectively note that the inertia coefficient c m is related to k m as c m 1 k m the details regarding the external force modelling for the cage components fish net floating collar mooring line buoy and tube sinker can be found in huang et al 2006 2007 3 2 forces acting on fish net as shown in fig 6 the fish net was divided into a large number of small elements each containing many mesh twines the tension buoyancy and gravity forces acting on element j are the sum of forces exerted on the twines within the element the drag and lift forces were exerted on the element in the model the forces acting on element j were assumed to be evenly distributed among nodes n 1 n 2 n 3 and n 4 following løland 1993 the drag and lift forces acting on element j were expressed as follows 4 f d j 1 2 ρ w c d β a j v r 2 e v r 5 f l j 1 2 ρ w c l β a j v r 2 e l coefficients c d β and c l β depend on angle β as follows 6 c d β 0 04 0 04 0 33 s n 6 54 s n 2 4 88 s n 3 cos β 7 c l β 0 05 s n 2 3 s n 2 1 76 s n 3 sin 2 β where β is the angle between the direction normal to the net element and the relative flow velocity direction the latter defined by unit vector e v r v r v r see fig 6 in fig 6 v r is the relative velocity vector at the center of element e l is the vector in the direction of lift force vector and e n is the vector normal to element j parameter s n is the solidity ratio which is defined as the ratio between the area covered by the twines in the screen and the total area of the screen for knotless net it is given as follows 8 s n 2 d λ d λ 2 where d is the twine diameter and λ is a half of mesh size after entering the net cage the fluid particle velocity will retard a little bit this phenomenon is known as the shielding effect and the velocity reduction coefficient of 0 85 is adopted for the rear part of nets 3 3 simulation of net cage system motion although hydroelasticity is important in the analysis of gravity type fish cages a modal analysis conducted by li et al 2013 revealed that rigid body motions dominate the horizontal motions of a floating collar thus both flexural deformations and rigid body motions should be considered for the vertical direction although the deformations in this direction are limited to lower modes only in this study hydroelasticity was considered to be negligible for the floating collar and tube sinker both of which were treated as rigid bodies in the net cage system all components of a net cage system can be divided into two categories namely deformable and rigid the deformable parts include fish nets and mooring lines whereas the rigid parts include a non deformable floating collar and tube sinker in this study each of the deformable components comprised several elements and nodes with numbers assigned as shown in fig 7 for each element the external forces were computed and the resultant force was evenly distributed among the corresponding nodes thus each node contained the lumped mass of all neighboring elements and their corresponding forces its equation of motion can be expressed as follows 9 j 1 n e m j x i j 1 n e f d j f i j f b j f w j f t j where subscript i denotes node number j 1 n e denotes all neighboring elements associated with node i and n e represents the total number of neighboring elements the rigid components of the net cage system included the floating collar and tube sinker these components did not deform under the action of external forces hence the distance between any two points at any time remained constant their motion in a three dimensional space can be resolved into translations and rotations of the reference frame attached to each component three translational motions surge sway and heave and three rotational motions roll pitch and yaw constituted their six degrees of freedom following d souza and garg 1984 the equations of motion for the three translations can be expressed as follows 10 x g y g ω 3 z g ω 2 1 m g i 1 n f x i y g z g ω 1 x g ω 3 1 m g i 1 n f y i z g x g ω 2 y g ω 1 1 m g i 1 n f z i and those for the three rotational motions known as euler s equations of motion are given as follows 11 ω 1 1 i 1 i 3 i 2 ω 2 ω 3 1 i 1 i 1 n m 1 i ω 2 1 i 2 i 1 i 3 ω 3 ω 1 1 i 2 i 1 n m 2 i ω 3 1 i 3 i 2 i 1 ω 1 ω 2 1 i 3 i 1 n m 3 i where subscripts 1 2 and 3 and x y and z correspond to the body coordinate system and global coordinate system respectively x g y g z g are the coordinates of the center of gravity ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 are the angular velocities along the principal axes m g is the body mass f xi f yi f zi and m 1i m 2i m 3i are the components of the resultant forces and moments acting at the lumped mass node i n is the number of nodes in the body and i 1 i 2 i 3 are the principal moments of inertia of the rigid body for the floating collar and tube sinker i 1 0 5m g r 2 i 2 0 5m g r 2 and i 3 m g r 2 where r is the radius of the rigid body solving the above systems of differential equations using the fourth order runge kutta method the position of each node and the mass center of the rigid parts can be obtained at each small time step furthermore by computing the distance between two neighboring nodes the tension force of the deformable parts can be estimated and used in the next time step calculations 3 4 evaluation of the net cage volume according to xu and qin 2020 there are four approximation approaches to estimate the net cage volume within a current these are 1 the scalar triple product method huang et al 2006 2 the divergence method huang et al 2007 3 the signed volume method zhang and chen 2001 and 4 the polygon method decew et al 2013 klebert et al 2015 the first three methods are used to estimate the net cage volume when it has a flat bottom net the final approach is used to determine the net cage volume when it has a cone shaped bottom net in this study we applied the divergence method to estimate the net cage volume 12 f d s f n d a where a is the surface area of the enclosed volume n is a unit normal vector of the planar element fig 8 shows the detailed application of this equation where the net cage has been divided into n elements herein f is a position vector as long as it makes f 1 then the integration at the left hand side of the equation becomes 13 i 1 n f i n i δ a i where is the net cage volume and δ a i is the area of triangular planar element i 3 5 simulation of mooring line failure in this study the net cage system was divided into 844 elements and 791 nodes and the time step adopted for numerical integration was 0 0001 s in the numerical model all anchors were considered as fixed nodes to simulate the motion of the net cage system in the intact state a predetermined time of 10 s after the beginning of the simulation was set as the moment at which failure occurred such as the breakage of a mooring line or dragging of an anchor to simulate failure anchor 1 was changed to a free node and allowed to move freely according to the equations of motion 4 results 4 1 process of mooring line failure in this section we use the case of the flow velocity of 14 5 cm s as an example to describe the process of mooring line failure the changes in mooring tension in load cells 1 and 2 were shown for 40 s in both numerical simulations and the experiment as shown in fig 9 the experimental results reveal that when the mooring line broke the tension in load cell 1 dropped immediately while the tension in load cell 2 simultaneously increased rapidly and then plateaued it can be observed that the initial tension in load cells 1 and 2 differed although the pre tension difference at rest was less than 5 this difference could result from non uniformity of the flow field and asymmetricity of the mooring system both influences were difficult to fully ascertain in the experiment the numerical results of the sudden drop in tension in load cell 1 and the mean value of tension in load cell 2 after the failure were close to those observed in the experiment however the strong tension peak after 11 s observed in the simulation was not present in the experiment because the flow field in the numerical model was perfectly uniform the initial tensions in load cells 1 and 2 were very close to each other and the tension response after failure was relatively stable fig 10 shows still images of the net cage with a cut mooring line extracted from a video recording made with a smartphone fig 10 a shows the instant when the mooring line was cut fig 10 b d are still images extracted 1 2 and 3 s later respectively in fig 10 a and b a significant yaw rotation can be observed from the shift of position p0 to position p1 refer to the edge of the black handrail at the same time the front buoy drifted from b0 to b1 due to losing the support of anchor 1 the displacement of the other buoys was relatively small fig 10 b d show that the difference in yaw rotation was very small and the front buoy drifted from b1 to b3 these observations show that the net cage system with the broken mooring line took 1 s to reach a new force equilibrium this was close to the simulated results shown in fig 11 in which the yaw rotation reached a plateau after 1 s with its angular velocity also dramatically changing during the same time period similar results were also reported in yang et al 2020 however further experiments on the net cage motions are necessary to better understand the dynamic behavior of the net cage system when a mooring line failure occurs the deformations of the net seen in the still images in fig 10 appear to be significant however it should be noted that they were actually exacerbated by refraction and the shooting angle adopted for more accurate visualization of the deformations of the net they should be observed form the side as was commonly done in similar studies lader and enerhaug 2005 huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 dong et al 2021 4 2 influence of single mooring line failure on mooring load in this section we examine closely the mooring load changes within a short period of time to elicit further details the mooring line failure was observed for six different current velocities from 11 3 to 30 8 cm s 0 565 1 54 m s in full scale and the results between 7 and 16 s were analyzed fig 12 shows that the duration of response to mooring line failure at various current velocities was practically confined to a 2 s time interval and then a new force equilibrium was reached additionally by comparing the tension response before and after the failure it became obvious that in all cases the tension response fluctuated strongly after failure occurred this could be due to the mooring system asymmetry fig 13 shows a comparison of the mooring tension in load cell 2 in the intact and failed states observed in the experiment and the numerical simulations the comparison demonstrates a good agreement for the current velocities lower than 25 cm s at higher current velocities the numerical model clearly overestimated the mooring tension especially in the failed state this discrepancy could be caused by the non uniformity of the flow field in the wave tank which increased with the current speed as shown in fig 14 the standard deviation of current velocity grew with increasing velocity which could result in less uniform flow at higher current velocities the turbulence intensity the ratio of the standard deviation of the velocity to the average velocity was close to 0 1 in all cases besides the velocity reduction inside the net cage may also be a possible source that caused the numerical model to overestimate the mooring tension although the velocity at the back of the net was reduced by 15 in the numerical model an experimental investigation by dong et al 2021 showed that the velocity reduction rate can be increased by more than 15 and it increased with increasing incoming velocity 5 discussion 5 1 tension ratio and safety factor in general the tension ratio between the failed and intact states is a convenient way of describing the effect of mooring line failure on the mooring load fig 15 shows that in the experiment the tension ratio was between 1 5 and 2 0 for practical engineering applications it is important to introduce a sf to prevent unexpected situations from jeopardizing the integrity of net cage systems in this study the sf was defined as the ratio between the design mooring line tension and experimentally measured tension the specified tension is usually determined as the maximum value of the mooring line tension in the intact state therefore we assumed a design factor of 2 0 and the maximum tension as that measured when the current velocity was 30 8 cm s 1 54 m s at full scale in order to meet the requirement stipulated in guidelines for moorings published by the dnv 0032 nd denton 2013 an sf of at least 2 0 is required for quasi static estimations under stable conditions fig 16 shows that in both states the sf decreased as the current velocity increased however in the failed state the sf was reduced to less than 2 0 when the current velocity reached 20 cm s this implies that the design tension did not satisfy the safety requirement when the mooring line broke thus a design factor 2 0 may not be sufficient to prevent certain unexpected situations from arising in the accidental limit state 5 2 influence of single mooring line failure on surviving lines in this section the numerical simulations of mooring loads in anchors 2 5 6 7 and 8 see fig 3 for anchor numbers in the intact and failed states are discussed as shown in fig 17 in the intact state due to the mooring system symmetry the tensions in anchors 5 and 7 were similar as were the tensions in anchors 6 and 8 after the failure of anchor 1 the tension in anchor 2 increased markedly as expected however it was surprising that both tensions in anchors 6 and 7 exceeded the maximum tension observed in the intact state in anchor 2 this behavior deserves to be further explored in future studies 5 3 influence of mooring line failure on net volume changes since the net deformations were not analyzed in the experiment numerical simulations became the only way to explore them in the following discussion the volume reduction coefficient was adopted to describe the deformations which is defined as the percentage ratio of deformed volume to the undeformed volume huang et al 2006 it thus also quantifies the remaining percentage volume of the net cage fig 18 shows a comparison of time histories of the volume reduction coefficients of the net cage exposed to the current velocities of 20 cm s 30 cm s and 40 cm s in the intact and failed states the results show that at the time of failure 10 s the volume reduction coefficient increased sharply due to the net being distorted by the yaw motions of the floating collar and the tube sinker however it returned to a value close to that of the intact state within 5 s the intensity of this response was positively correlated with the current velocity fig 19 shows snapshots of the net cage displacements and deformations in the steady state condition t 50 s in the intact and failed states at the three aforementioned current velocities it can be seen that after the failure of anchor 1 although the mooring system became asymmetric the appearance of the net was identical to the intact state fig 20 displays a comparison of the volume reduction coefficient during the steady state period from 20 to 50 s in the intact and failed states the results show that the volume reduction coefficient after the mooring line failure did not differ from the intact state 6 conclusions and suggestions in this study we performed a water flume experiment on an eight point mooring net cage model in order to investigate the mooring forces in both intact and failed states when subjected to various current velocities and arrived at the following main conclusions the mooring loads in the remaining mooring lines after one line failed increased by 1 5 2 0 times the net cage system reached a new force equilibrium within a few seconds after the failure the comparison of experimental observations and numerical simulations demonstrated a good agreement between the two but only at lower current speeds less than 25 cm s which may be due to the non uniformity of the flow field at higher current velocities the simulation results showed that after the failure of one upstream mooring line the mooring load on selected lateral mooring lines increased significantly and the net volume of the cage was also changing dramatically within 5 s after the failure however the deformations returned to the same as in the intact state when the cage system regained balance after the failure finally for accidental limit states the conventional design factor of 2 0 may not be sufficient to prevent unexpected situations from occurring in order to better understand the mooring line failure accidents it is recommended to incorporate the combined effects of wind waves and currents in future studies the tensions in the lateral mooring lines the movement of the floating collar and the tube sinker and the net volume changes should also be concurrently investigated credit authorship contribution statement hung jie tang conceptualization methodology software validation investigation writing review editing visualization project

20222,this study investigates the impact of a mooring line failure on an aquaculture net cage through a laboratory experiment and numerical simulations an eight point mooring net cage model with two

equipped with a wind generator piston wave generator and circulating current pump and can generate wind waves and currents both simultaneously and separately it is 50 m long 7 m wide and 1 2 m deep because this study was concerned with fish farms located in sheltered areas only water currents were simulated 2 1 experimental setup the net cage model adopted in this study is shown in figs 2 and 3 while table 1 lists its specifications its full scale prototype had a 30 m diameter inner floating collar and 12 5 m deep net installed in water of a constant water depth of 20 m in this model froude scaling with geometric similarity was adopted while the model did not intend to represent a specific full scale site assuming a model scale of 1 25 the corresponding full scale values are also given in table 1 for reference huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 existing laboratory experiments on net cage systems usually utilize four point mooring systems e g huang et al 2007 however because the wave tank used in this study was large enough the net cage system was equipped with an eight point mooring fixed the bottom of the tank the physical model consisted of a floating collar cylinder net and tube sinker that were attached to the bottom of the net two upstream mooring lines were deployed through two pulleys connected to two load cells fixed to a plate laid on the tank wall both load cells were the lt6 5 type manufactured by the ssk company of japan whose reproducibility was 0 2 fs linearity 0 2 fs temperature characteristic 0 05 ro c output voltage 10 v input and output resistance 500 ω and operating temperature range between 15 c and 75 c the maximum force recorded during the test was 49 05 n three acoustic doppler velocimeters advs manufactured by the nortek company of norway were installed on the front of the net cage model in order to simultaneously measure the inflow velocity the three advs were evenly spaced at 100 cm intervals with the mean value of their measurements taken as the inflow velocity the mooring line cutting device is shown in fig 4 this device was primarily composed of a blade and a pneumatic cylinder that provided cutting power by means of an air compressor in this experiment the mooring line was cut by manually pressing a button 10 s after the beginning of the experimental procedure 2 2 experimental procedure the flowchart of experimental procedure is shown in fig 5 initially the no load offset readings of the load cells and advs were recorded next it was necessary to check the pre tension of the two mooring lines using the measurements of two load cells and adjust the difference between them to less than 5 this was done to ensure that the forces in the mooring system were symmetrical then the water current velocity was increased to the predetermined value and 30 min was allowed to elapse for the flow field to stabilize the following steps comprised the main part of the experiment step 1 was to collect measurements from the load cells and advs of the mooring system in the intact condition for 60 s then in step 2 the mooring line cutting test was conducted recording started and after 10 s the button was pressed to cut the mooring line linked to load cell 1 the test data were then checked and if found to be in order the current generator was stopped 3 numerical simulations the numerical simulations adopted a model developed specifically for this study which is briefly introduced below 3 1 forces acting on net cage system the hydrodynamic force exerted on the object was approximated by the morison equation as the sum of the drag force f d and inertia force f i drag force f d is usually formulated as follows 1 f d t c d 1 2 ρ w a v r t v r t where ρ w is the sea water density a is the projected area of the object perpendicular to the flow direction v r t v t ẋ t is the relative velocity between the instantaneous flow velocity v t and the moving object velocity ẋ t c d is the drag coefficient and t is time on the other hand inertia force f i can be divided into the froude krylov force and the added mass effect 2 f i t ρ w v d v t d t k m ρ w v d v r t d t where v is the volume of the water displaced by the object and k m is the added mass coefficient by including other external forces such as buoyancy f b gravitational force f w and tension force f t acting on the mooring lines and net the equation of motion for each element of the net cage system can be expressed as follows 3 m k m ρ w v x 1 2 c d ρ w a v x v x c m ρ w v d v d t f b f w f t where m is the mass of the element and ẋ and ẍ are the velocity and acceleration corresponding to its central displacement x respectively note that the inertia coefficient c m is related to k m as c m 1 k m the details regarding the external force modelling for the cage components fish net floating collar mooring line buoy and tube sinker can be found in huang et al 2006 2007 3 2 forces acting on fish net as shown in fig 6 the fish net was divided into a large number of small elements each containing many mesh twines the tension buoyancy and gravity forces acting on element j are the sum of forces exerted on the twines within the element the drag and lift forces were exerted on the element in the model the forces acting on element j were assumed to be evenly distributed among nodes n 1 n 2 n 3 and n 4 following løland 1993 the drag and lift forces acting on element j were expressed as follows 4 f d j 1 2 ρ w c d β a j v r 2 e v r 5 f l j 1 2 ρ w c l β a j v r 2 e l coefficients c d β and c l β depend on angle β as follows 6 c d β 0 04 0 04 0 33 s n 6 54 s n 2 4 88 s n 3 cos β 7 c l β 0 05 s n 2 3 s n 2 1 76 s n 3 sin 2 β where β is the angle between the direction normal to the net element and the relative flow velocity direction the latter defined by unit vector e v r v r v r see fig 6 in fig 6 v r is the relative velocity vector at the center of element e l is the vector in the direction of lift force vector and e n is the vector normal to element j parameter s n is the solidity ratio which is defined as the ratio between the area covered by the twines in the screen and the total area of the screen for knotless net it is given as follows 8 s n 2 d λ d λ 2 where d is the twine diameter and λ is a half of mesh size after entering the net cage the fluid particle velocity will retard a little bit this phenomenon is known as the shielding effect and the velocity reduction coefficient of 0 85 is adopted for the rear part of nets 3 3 simulation of net cage system motion although hydroelasticity is important in the analysis of gravity type fish cages a modal analysis conducted by li et al 2013 revealed that rigid body motions dominate the horizontal motions of a floating collar thus both flexural deformations and rigid body motions should be considered for the vertical direction although the deformations in this direction are limited to lower modes only in this study hydroelasticity was considered to be negligible for the floating collar and tube sinker both of which were treated as rigid bodies in the net cage system all components of a net cage system can be divided into two categories namely deformable and rigid the deformable parts include fish nets and mooring lines whereas the rigid parts include a non deformable floating collar and tube sinker in this study each of the deformable components comprised several elements and nodes with numbers assigned as shown in fig 7 for each element the external forces were computed and the resultant force was evenly distributed among the corresponding nodes thus each node contained the lumped mass of all neighboring elements and their corresponding forces its equation of motion can be expressed as follows 9 j 1 n e m j x i j 1 n e f d j f i j f b j f w j f t j where subscript i denotes node number j 1 n e denotes all neighboring elements associated with node i and n e represents the total number of neighboring elements the rigid components of the net cage system included the floating collar and tube sinker these components did not deform under the action of external forces hence the distance between any two points at any time remained constant their motion in a three dimensional space can be resolved into translations and rotations of the reference frame attached to each component three translational motions surge sway and heave and three rotational motions roll pitch and yaw constituted their six degrees of freedom following d souza and garg 1984 the equations of motion for the three translations can be expressed as follows 10 x g y g ω 3 z g ω 2 1 m g i 1 n f x i y g z g ω 1 x g ω 3 1 m g i 1 n f y i z g x g ω 2 y g ω 1 1 m g i 1 n f z i and those for the three rotational motions known as euler s equations of motion are given as follows 11 ω 1 1 i 1 i 3 i 2 ω 2 ω 3 1 i 1 i 1 n m 1 i ω 2 1 i 2 i 1 i 3 ω 3 ω 1 1 i 2 i 1 n m 2 i ω 3 1 i 3 i 2 i 1 ω 1 ω 2 1 i 3 i 1 n m 3 i where subscripts 1 2 and 3 and x y and z correspond to the body coordinate system and global coordinate system respectively x g y g z g are the coordinates of the center of gravity ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 are the angular velocities along the principal axes m g is the body mass f xi f yi f zi and m 1i m 2i m 3i are the components of the resultant forces and moments acting at the lumped mass node i n is the number of nodes in the body and i 1 i 2 i 3 are the principal moments of inertia of the rigid body for the floating collar and tube sinker i 1 0 5m g r 2 i 2 0 5m g r 2 and i 3 m g r 2 where r is the radius of the rigid body solving the above systems of differential equations using the fourth order runge kutta method the position of each node and the mass center of the rigid parts can be obtained at each small time step furthermore by computing the distance between two neighboring nodes the tension force of the deformable parts can be estimated and used in the next time step calculations 3 4 evaluation of the net cage volume according to xu and qin 2020 there are four approximation approaches to estimate the net cage volume within a current these are 1 the scalar triple product method huang et al 2006 2 the divergence method huang et al 2007 3 the signed volume method zhang and chen 2001 and 4 the polygon method decew et al 2013 klebert et al 2015 the first three methods are used to estimate the net cage volume when it has a flat bottom net the final approach is used to determine the net cage volume when it has a cone shaped bottom net in this study we applied the divergence method to estimate the net cage volume 12 f d s f n d a where a is the surface area of the enclosed volume n is a unit normal vector of the planar element fig 8 shows the detailed application of this equation where the net cage has been divided into n elements herein f is a position vector as long as it makes f 1 then the integration at the left hand side of the equation becomes 13 i 1 n f i n i δ a i where is the net cage volume and δ a i is the area of triangular planar element i 3 5 simulation of mooring line failure in this study the net cage system was divided into 844 elements and 791 nodes and the time step adopted for numerical integration was 0 0001 s in the numerical model all anchors were considered as fixed nodes to simulate the motion of the net cage system in the intact state a predetermined time of 10 s after the beginning of the simulation was set as the moment at which failure occurred such as the breakage of a mooring line or dragging of an anchor to simulate failure anchor 1 was changed to a free node and allowed to move freely according to the equations of motion 4 results 4 1 process of mooring line failure in this section we use the case of the flow velocity of 14 5 cm s as an example to describe the process of mooring line failure the changes in mooring tension in load cells 1 and 2 were shown for 40 s in both numerical simulations and the experiment as shown in fig 9 the experimental results reveal that when the mooring line broke the tension in load cell 1 dropped immediately while the tension in load cell 2 simultaneously increased rapidly and then plateaued it can be observed that the initial tension in load cells 1 and 2 differed although the pre tension difference at rest was less than 5 this difference could result from non uniformity of the flow field and asymmetricity of the mooring system both influences were difficult to fully ascertain in the experiment the numerical results of the sudden drop in tension in load cell 1 and the mean value of tension in load cell 2 after the failure were close to those observed in the experiment however the strong tension peak after 11 s observed in the simulation was not present in the experiment because the flow field in the numerical model was perfectly uniform the initial tensions in load cells 1 and 2 were very close to each other and the tension response after failure was relatively stable fig 10 shows still images of the net cage with a cut mooring line extracted from a video recording made with a smartphone fig 10 a shows the instant when the mooring line was cut fig 10 b d are still images extracted 1 2 and 3 s later respectively in fig 10 a and b a significant yaw rotation can be observed from the shift of position p0 to position p1 refer to the edge of the black handrail at the same time the front buoy drifted from b0 to b1 due to losing the support of anchor 1 the displacement of the other buoys was relatively small fig 10 b d show that the difference in yaw rotation was very small and the front buoy drifted from b1 to b3 these observations show that the net cage system with the broken mooring line took 1 s to reach a new force equilibrium this was close to the simulated results shown in fig 11 in which the yaw rotation reached a plateau after 1 s with its angular velocity also dramatically changing during the same time period similar results were also reported in yang et al 2020 however further experiments on the net cage motions are necessary to better understand the dynamic behavior of the net cage system when a mooring line failure occurs the deformations of the net seen in the still images in fig 10 appear to be significant however it should be noted that they were actually exacerbated by refraction and the shooting angle adopted for more accurate visualization of the deformations of the net they should be observed form the side as was commonly done in similar studies lader and enerhaug 2005 huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 dong et al 2021 4 2 influence of single mooring line failure on mooring load in this section we examine closely the mooring load changes within a short period of time to elicit further details the mooring line failure was observed for six different current velocities from 11 3 to 30 8 cm s 0 565 1 54 m s in full scale and the results between 7 and 16 s were analyzed fig 12 shows that the duration of response to mooring line failure at various current velocities was practically confined to a 2 s time interval and then a new force equilibrium was reached additionally by comparing the tension response before and after the failure it became obvious that in all cases the tension response fluctuated strongly after failure occurred this could be due to the mooring system asymmetry fig 13 shows a comparison of the mooring tension in load cell 2 in the intact and failed states observed in the experiment and the numerical simulations the comparison demonstrates a good agreement for the current velocities lower than 25 cm s at higher current velocities the numerical model clearly overestimated the mooring tension especially in the failed state this discrepancy could be caused by the non uniformity of the flow field in the wave tank which increased with the current speed as shown in fig 14 the standard deviation of current velocity grew with increasing velocity which could result in less uniform flow at higher current velocities the turbulence intensity the ratio of the standard deviation of the velocity to the average velocity was close to 0 1 in all cases besides the velocity reduction inside the net cage may also be a possible source that caused the numerical model to overestimate the mooring tension although the velocity at the back of the net was reduced by 15 in the numerical model an experimental investigation by dong et al 2021 showed that the velocity reduction rate can be increased by more than 15 and it increased with increasing incoming velocity 5 discussion 5 1 tension ratio and safety factor in general the tension ratio between the failed and intact states is a convenient way of describing the effect of mooring line failure on the mooring load fig 15 shows that in the experiment the tension ratio was between 1 5 and 2 0 for practical engineering applications it is important to introduce a sf to prevent unexpected situations from jeopardizing the integrity of net cage systems in this study the sf was defined as the ratio between the design mooring line tension and experimentally measured tension the specified tension is usually determined as the maximum value of the mooring line tension in the intact state therefore we assumed a design factor of 2 0 and the maximum tension as that measured when the current velocity was 30 8 cm s 1 54 m s at full scale in order to meet the requirement stipulated in guidelines for moorings published by the dnv 0032 nd denton 2013 an sf of at least 2 0 is required for quasi static estimations under stable conditions fig 16 shows that in both states the sf decreased as the current velocity increased however in the failed state the sf was reduced to less than 2 0 when the current velocity reached 20 cm s this implies that the design tension did not satisfy the safety requirement when the mooring line broke thus a design factor 2 0 may not be sufficient to prevent certain unexpected situations from arising in the accidental limit state 5 2 influence of single mooring line failure on surviving lines in this section the numerical simulations of mooring loads in anchors 2 5 6 7 and 8 see fig 3 for anchor numbers in the intact and failed states are discussed as shown in fig 17 in the intact state due to the mooring system symmetry the tensions in anchors 5 and 7 were similar as were the tensions in anchors 6 and 8 after the failure of anchor 1 the tension in anchor 2 increased markedly as expected however it was surprising that both tensions in anchors 6 and 7 exceeded the maximum tension observed in the intact state in anchor 2 this behavior deserves to be further explored in future studies 5 3 influence of mooring line failure on net volume changes since the net deformations were not analyzed in the experiment numerical simulations became the only way to explore them in the following discussion the volume reduction coefficient was adopted to describe the deformations which is defined as the percentage ratio of deformed volume to the undeformed volume huang et al 2006 it thus also quantifies the remaining percentage volume of the net cage fig 18 shows a comparison of time histories of the volume reduction coefficients of the net cage exposed to the current velocities of 20 cm s 30 cm s and 40 cm s in the intact and failed states the results show that at the time of failure 10 s the volume reduction coefficient increased sharply due to the net being distorted by the yaw motions of the floating collar and the tube sinker however it returned to a value close to that of the intact state within 5 s the intensity of this response was positively correlated with the current velocity fig 19 shows snapshots of the net cage displacements and deformations in the steady state condition t 50 s in the intact and failed states at the three aforementioned current velocities it can be seen that after the failure of anchor 1 although the mooring system became asymmetric the appearance of the net was identical to the intact state fig 20 displays a comparison of the volume reduction coefficient during the steady state period from 20 to 50 s in the intact and failed states the results show that the volume reduction coefficient after the mooring line failure did not differ from the intact state 6 conclusions and suggestions in this study we performed a water flume experiment on an eight point mooring net cage model in order to investigate the mooring forces in both intact and failed states when subjected to various current velocities and arrived at the following main conclusions the mooring loads in the remaining mooring lines after one line failed increased by 1 5 2 0 times the net cage system reached a new force equilibrium within a few seconds after the failure the comparison of experimental observations and numerical simulations demonstrated a good agreement between the two but only at lower current speeds less than 25 cm s which may be due to the non uniformity of the flow field at higher current velocities the simulation results showed that after the failure of one upstream mooring line the mooring load on selected lateral mooring lines increased significantly and the net volume of the cage was also changing dramatically within 5 s after the failure however the deformations returned to the same as in the intact state when the cage system regained balance after the failure finally for accidental limit states the conventional design factor of 2 0 may not be sufficient to prevent unexpected situations from occurring in order to better understand the mooring line failure accidents it is recommended to incorporate the combined effects of wind waves and currents in future studies the tensions in the lateral mooring lines the movement of the floating collar and the tube sinker and the net volume changes should also be concurrently investigated credit authorship contribution statement hung jie tang conceptualization methodology software validation investigation writing review editing visualization project

20223,this paper addresses an active fault tolerant control aftc based on time delay control tdc and nonlinear disturbance observer for wind turbines exposed to pitch system sensor and actuator faults uncertainties and exogenous disturbances the developed adaptive tdc uses time delay estimation tde to estimate parametric uncertainties and provides an appealing model free structure tde is also applied as an online fault estimation algorithm then an adaptive robust control is designed for tdc using a combination of adaptive sliding mode with novel adaptation laws and a nonlinear disturbance observer ndo through estimating the exogenous disturbances the control gain of discontinuous term of sliding mode control law is kept small which in turn results in reduced chattering thus the proposed structure provides smooth control signals and can isolate and accommodate the effect of faults stability analysis is conducted based on lyapunov theory to verify the validity of the proposed structure the controller is implemented in fast environment simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed controller in the presence of different faults as well as uncertainties and turbulent wind field compared to two existing methods gain schedule pi gspi and nonlinear pi n pi control schemes keywords wind turbine pitch angle control fault tolerant control fast time delay control tdc lyapunov theory 1 introduction global energy demand is on the rise so does concern for environmental issues as a promising solution sustainable energy has captured special attention particularly wind energy which possesses outstanding characteristics such as availability and low cost azizi et al 2019 so it is not surprising that by the end of 2020 the total capacity for wind energy globally has reached around 743 gw demonstrating a 14 percent increase compared to 2019 lee and zhao 2021 wind turbines as the main wind energy conversion system have a complex and nonlinear dynamics and work in uncertain environments under large turbulent winds and centrifugal gravitational and gyroscopic loads wright and fingersh 2008 relying on several rotating and non rotating components and sensors in addition to working in harsh environments make them prone to faults and failures leading to low reliability to prevent unpredicted failures maintenance schedules are planned which not only increase cost but also reduce the power generation due to required downtime habibi et al 2019 these challenges have been the motivation behind numerous researches in the realm of wind turbines from nominal control to fault detection and fault tolerant control the control objectives of wind turbines are decided according to wind speed for the speeds lower than cut in value the wind turbine is not put into operation at the speeds higher that cut out value the wind turbine is pitched to feather or braked to prevent structural damage the power generation takes place between these two limits and this operational region is classified into two parts in partial load region which covers the range of wind speeds between cut in and rated speed the main control objective is to maximize wind turbine power capture to this end the generator speed is adjusted to track the optimal power coefficient full load region starts from the rated wind speed and ends at cut out speed at this region the pitch angle is controlled to maintain the rotor speed at its rated value this also minimizes the load stress on drivetrain shaft as the aerodynamic forces on the blades are larger than those generating nominal power this paper considers wind turbine operation in full load region where the pitch system is activated to control power capture and mitigate harmful structural loads habibi et al 2019 vidal et al 2015 hydraulic pitch systems are widely employed in wind turbines thanks to their rapid response frequency large torque and convenient centralization however in real applications faults in sensors and hydraulic actuators are inevitable pressure drop in hydraulic system pump wear and high air content in oil are some of the most frequent faults in the hydraulic system which slow down the system dynamics deteriorate the pitching performance cause fluctuations on the generator speed and power and make the turbine unstable odgaard et al 2013 fault detection and isolation fdi and fault tolerant control ftc are effective methods that improve reliability lower the maintenance cost reduce downtime prevent catastrophic failures and yet despite the presence of faults preserve system performance at a desired level ftc approaches are generally categorized into two groups passive pftc and active aftc pftc schemes have fixed control structures designed to be robust against uncertainties and faults while aftc approaches use the fault information from fault detection fd unit and reconfigure or redesign the controller accordingly so that acceptable performance and stability of the system can be retained yu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 not relying on fault detection the pftc approaches demonstrate fast response but limited robustness time delay control tdc is a robust nonlinear control scheme that can deal with large parameter variations and disturbances thus it is an effective approach for fault tolerant control by using time delayed state variables and control input tdc estimates the function representing the uncertainty effects and cancels unknown dynamics and unexpected disturbances youcef toumi and ito 1990 tdc encompasses two main parts time delay estimation tde and a robust controller and provides simple efficient and model free control scheme suitable for many practical applications baek et al 2019 pi et al 2020 cho et al 2016 it also offers reasonable computation cost easy implementation and parameter tuning possibility baek et al 2019 further improvements have been made by integrating tdc with sliding mode controller kali et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sliding mode control smc is a robust nonlinear control technique which is widely employed in uncertain systems its systematic design high stability and consistent performance in the presence of model uncertainties parameter variations and exogenous disturbances have made it a suitable choice for ftc design however the conventional smc suffers from four main drawbacks i its linear sliding surface does not guarantee a finite time convergence ii despite its good transient performance in normal condition its performance degrades in the presence of fast varying disturbances or faults iii its discontinuous control law generates chattering which may excite un modeled high frequency dynamics iv its design requires a priori knowledge of the upper bounds of uncertainties disturbances and faults since in many cases these bounds are unknown the switching gains are chosen to be large enough to cover a wide range of perturbations and this further aggravates chattering various solutions have been put forward to address these shortcomings to solve the convergence rate drawback of smc terminal sliding mode control tsmc scheme was proposed man et al 1994 however it suffers from two problems i low convergence rate when the system state is far away from the equilibrium point ii singularity problem these were solved in fast terminal smc ftsmc yuman 2002 and nonsingular terminal smc ntsmc feng et al 2002 the transient response of smc is enhanced by employing integral smc ismc or pid based smc pid smc lee et al 2017 cui et al 2017 parra vega et al 2003 the chattering problem can be ameliorated by using boundary layer setting yin and xiao 2017 incremona et al 2017 low pass filtering lee and utkin 2007 high order smc di gennaro et al 2014 dehkordi et al 2017 fractional calculus noshirvani et al 2019 ullah et al 2017 or disturbance observer zhang et al 2016 adaptive smc is an effective approach to eliminate the perturbation bound requirement by adjusting the gain magnitude with respect to uncertainties and faults which also alleviates chattering shtessel et al 2012 hu et al 2017 various approaches have been proposed to solve fault detection and fault tolerant control problem of wind turbines in azizi et al 2019 an aftc was designed to control rotor speed and power of a wind turbine in the presence of actuator faults and uncertainties the control scheme was an smc with an integral surface and an adaptive gain termed as adaptive output feedback sliding mode controller the integral sliding surface and the control law are shaped by an output feedback and a full order compensator with the latter attenuating the faults and disturbances in noshirvani et al 2019 an aftc was proposed which combines the robustness properties of fractional order terminal sliding mode control with the accurate estimation of virtual actuators for fault detection a bank of modified unscented kalman filters was employed and it was shown that the presented controller possesses finite time stability and alleviates chattering in lan et al 2018 an aftc scheme was introduced to compensate the pitch actuator faults and recover the nominal pitch dynamics this scheme incorporates a traditional proportional integral controller as a baseline system to achieve nominal pitch performance along with a fault compensator to eliminate the actuator fault effects in shi and patton 2015 an observer based aftc was proposed for a nonlinear large rotor wind turbine which utilizes the industrial pi controller for nominal performance and an extended state observer for estimating the system states and fault signals through a linear parameter varying lpv descriptor system context using linear matrix inequality lmi an aftc method entailing a robust estimation and compensation for wind turbine actuator and sensor faults was proposed by wang et al 2017 their proposed control method comprises two parts an active disturbance rejection control method and a descriptor sliding mode observer to validate the results the controller was implemented in fast environment to the best of authors knowledge none of the published papers in the realm of wind turbine control have studied the effects of pitch actuator faults such as hydraulic leakage pump wear and high air content in oil for collective pitch angle control based on a nonlinear model so this paper proposes a novel aftc based on adaptive time delay control and nonlinear disturbance observer for wind turbine pitch system to nullify the effects of actuator and sensor faults uncertainties and exogenous disturbances the key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 a new aftc control scheme is proposed based on tdc which adaptively produces the control signal to compensate the effect of actuator and sensor faults parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances simultaneously 2 faults and parametric uncertainties are accommodated through tdc and adaptive control schemes and exogenous disturbances are attenuated using nonlinear disturbance observer this strategy further reduces the discontinuous control gain of smc and alleviates the chattering of the control signal even more 3 the adaptive control law affects both continuous and discontinuous terms at the same time therefore both of these terms contribute to disturbance attenuation and this prevents choosing high values for discontinuous control gain the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the problem by defining the wind turbine model and introducing the system faults that will be considered in this study section 3 presents the adaptive control strategy and section 4 describes the proposed aftc based on tdc on the grounds of comparison two existing control schemes gspi and n pi controllers are introduced in section 5 and the simulation results for these controllers as well as the proposed controller are illustrated in section 6 a brief discussion is included in section 7 and the paper is concluded in section 8 2 problem statement 2 1 wind turbine model the powertrain of wind turbines comprises three main components namely the rotor blades gear box and generator wind energy develops aerodynamic forces on the blades resulting in the following aerodynamic torque on the rotor 1 τ r 1 2 π ρ r 3 u 2 c q λ β λ ω r r v where ρ r ω r and u represent air density rotor radius and angular velocity and wind speed respectively moreover c q denotes the torque coefficient and generally is defined as a two dimensional map which depends on pitch angle of the blade β and the tip speed ratio λ the aerodynamic power captured by the blades is defined as 2 p r 1 2 π ρ r 2 u 3 c p ω r β u where c p symbolizes the power coefficient defined by 3 c p 0 22 116 λ t 0 4 β 5 e 12 5 λ t 4 λ t 1 λ 0 08 β 0 035 β 3 1 obviously following equation holds for torque and power coefficients 5 c p λ β λ c q λ β power coefficient for the under studied wind turbine is presented in fig 1 through regulating β the pitch system controls the amount of wind energy captured by the turbine for hydraulic pitch control systems each actuator is considered as a linear second order system with the following transfer function 6 β β r ω n 2 s 2 2 ζ ω n ω n 2 where β r ζ and ω n show the reference pitch angle damping ratio and natural frequency respectively the mechanical part of drivetrain system can be modeled as a nonlinear two mass spring damper system as shown in fig 2 its dynamic model can be represented by the following state space equations esbensen and sloth 2009 7 ω r 1 j r p r ω r β u ω r ω r d s ω g d s n g θ k s ω g 1 j g ω r d s n g ω g d s n g 2 θ k s n g t g θ ω r ω g n g in which θ shows torsional angle the definition of other parameters and their corresponding values for the reference turbine are listed in table 1 defining the state and the input vectors as 8 x ω r ω g θ β β t u β r the nonlinear dynamic model of the wind turbine in affine form is expressed as 9 x f x x g u where f x x represents the nonlinear term in wind turbine model and g is the coefficient of control input 2 2 problem formulation it can be proved that there exists a diffeomorphism transformation so that the wind turbine system given in eq 9 is equivalent to the system in its normal form with stable zero dynamics this means that taking time derivative of e ω r ω r guarantees that the wind turbine system is stable and non singular over its entire operating points kumar and stol 2010 thomsen 2006 thus the second order derivative of rotor speed dynamics is written as 10 d 2 x 1 d t 2 l f x l g x u where 11 l f x f 1 x 1 f 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 f 1 x 3 f 3 f 1 x 4 f 4 f 1 x 5 f 5 f 1 u u l g x f 1 x 5 g 5 2 3 fault model generally depending on their time profile faults are categorized into incipient and abrupt types incipient faults occur slowly and grow gradually while abrupt faults happen suddenly and unexpectedly in spite of the fact that the abrupt faults are mostly easy to detect they have the potential to impose severe effects on the system chaaban et al 2014 from severity point of view faults can be divided into extreme or non extreme for extreme faults immediate actions like off grid procedures or shutdown are taken on the other hand for non extreme cases ftc strategies can be applied to maintain the turbine performance at an acceptable level li et al 2018 studies reveal that a great portion of failures are minor and also the most prevalent failures occur in pitch hydraulic system carroll et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 3 the hydraulic pitch system mainly comprises a pump some valves and a blade pitch motion mechanism a controller takes the error signal between the actual and reference rotor speed and transmits the control signal to a servo valve that controls the actuator position pitch system faults have various causes whether in control or in hydraulic subsystem sensor faults occur in control subsystem while pump wear hydraulic leakage and high air content in oil are common faults affecting the hydraulic subsystem pitch sensor bias and gain degrades the performance of the controller so that the system is unable to follow the desired input in extreme cases when the pitch sensor completely fails the blades are feathered bias in generator speed sensor also causes the pitch angle to deviate from its desired value or the actuator experience runaway high air content in oil can lead to slow pitch control action causing fluctuations in generator speed and power and loss of system stability lan et al 2018 moreover incorrect pitch angle generates asymmetrical forces on the blades and intensifies structural loading of its platform hydraulic leakage can be divided into external and internal the external leakage happens at either side of the actuator but the internal one takes place between the two hydraulic cylinder chambers high internal leakage causes the actuator lose its ability to apply effective load and external leakage may lead to a sluggish response an and sepehri 2005 2 3 1 pitch sensor fault the bias fault is prevalent in wind turbines and can be introduce to the system as a result of pitch sensor malfunction or inaccurate system calibration sensor fault is categorized as incipient and can be distinguished from the rate of biased signal and its range esbensen and sloth 2009 biased output deteriorates the closed loop system performance and affects the pitch angle measurement in the presence of bias fault the dynamic model of the pitch actuator eq 6 changes to the following equation 12 β 2 ζ ω n β t ω n 2 β t β b t ω n 2 β r t t d in which subscripts b r and d stand for bias reference and delay the measured signal is written as 13 β m k β k β b k v n k where v n is measurement noise 2 3 2 pitch actuator faults the main faults of the hydraulic pitch actuators are pump wear hydraulic leakage and high air content in oil these faults affect the system dynamics differently and their influence is reflected in natural frequency ω n and damping ratio ζ of the pitch system the numerical values of the actuator dynamic parameters for the reference wind turbine model are summarized in table 2 pump wear as an incipient fault pump wear happens at slow rate and causes low pump pressure it changes the dynamics of pitch system as follows 14 β 2 ζ t ω n β t ω n 2 t β t ω n 2 t β r t t d ζ t 1 υ p w t ζ υ p w t ζ p w ω n t 1 υ p w t ω n υ p w t ω n p w where 0 υ p w t 1 shows the level of wear zero value indicates the normal condition while its upper bound corresponds to 75 pump pressure hydraulic leakage hydraulic leakage is also an incipient fault but happens faster than pump wear and causes up to 50 pressure drop this fault varies the system parameters as follows 15 ζ t 1 υ h l t ζ υ h l t ζ h l ω n t 1 υ h l t ω n υ h l t ω n h l where 0 υ h l t 1 in normal operation υ h l 0 and when the hydraulic pressure experiences 50 loss υ h l 1 under too low hydraulic pressure the system is unable to move the blades and therefore the actuator sticks in its current position resulting in blade seize high air content in oil high air content in oil is another incipient fault whose effect on system is described as below 16 ζ t 1 υ h a t ζ υ h a t ζ h a ω n t 1 υ h a t ω n υ h a t ω n h a unlike the previous faults high air content in oil can disappear so υ h a can take negative values too zero and one values for υ h a show 7 and 15 air content respectively if the hydraulic leakage persists the pitch actuators may become uncontrollable to prevent this situation it should be detected before the hydraulic pressure drops to 50 of its nominal value 3 adaptive robust control strategy in this section a disturbance observer based asmc scheme is designed to compensate the effects of faults parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances the proposed asmc is implemented to adjust the control signals according to faults and uncertainties without overestimating the control gains the adaptive characteristic of the controller allows to choose smaller discontinuous control gain leading to alleviated chattering by employing a nonlinear disturbance observer the continuous term further decreases which results in enhanced robustness against larger faults and uncertainties 3 1 design of disturbance observer based adaptive smc based controller if the tracking error of rotor speed is defined as ω r ω r the nonsingular fast integral type terminal sliding nfits surface is specified as 17 s e c 1 e c 2 0 t e e q e l r d t where c 1 and c 2 are constant parameters for the controller to have nonsingular property q l r in which l and r are chosen odd integers satisfying 1 l r 2 the smc based control law drives the sliding variable to reach the sliding surface and then ensures that it remains in the vicinity of the surface the law embodies a continuous component that stabilizes the nominal system and a discontinuous term which compensates the effect of uncertainties and disturbances 18 u u e q u r e where u e q and u r e represent equivalent and discontinuous control terms to derive the equivalent control law the first derivative of the sliding surface with respect to time is equalized to zero this yields the continuous control law as 19 s e c 1 e c 2 e e q e l r 0 u e q l ˆ g 1 l f c 1 e c 2 e e q e l r as stated earlier this control law does not compensate for the effect of disturbances thus if substituted in eq 10 the following error dynamics is obtained which regardless of its value the tracking error cannot converge to zero 20 e c 1 e c 2 e e q e l r d 0 to overcome this challenge a discontinuous term u r e is added and the overall control law is rewritten as 21 u l ˆ g 1 l ˆ f c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r d ˆ γ 1 s γ 2 sgn s where l ˆ g l ˆ f and d ˆ represent the estimation of l g l f and disturbances d and γ 1 and γ 2 are positive constant parameters to be able to handle the effect of unknown exogenous disturbances it is necessary for the γ 2 to be chosen bigger than their upper bound this high gain value increases the amount of discontinuous term and thereby aggravating chattering to solve this problem a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed 3 2 nonlinear disturbance observer ndo assumption 1 unknown exogenous disturbances have an upper bound and its time derivative is bounded in order to estimate this disturbance a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed as chen et al 2016 22 z κ z κ κ ω r l f l g u d ˆ z κ ω r where z and κ represent the internal state of the observer and the observer gain κ 0 the disturbance estimation error is defined as 23 d d d ˆ using eq 10 and eq 22 the time derivative of eq 23 can be expressed as d d d ˆ z κ ω r κ d ˆ κ ω r κ κ ω r l f l g u κ l f l g u d 24 κ d lemma 1 according to assumption 1 for the positive observer gain the disturbance estimation calculated from eq 22 can asymptotically follow the actual disturbance chen 2003 it can be inferred from this lemma that by choosing a positive value for the observer gain the unknown exogenous disturbances can be estimated successfully and asymptotical stability of the estimation error dynamics is achieved furthermore by choosing higher values for the observer gain the convergence rate of the error dynamics can be increased defining γ ˆ l ˆ f l ˆ g and χ ˆ l ˆ g the control law eq 21 can be rewritten as follows u χ ˆ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r d ˆ γ 1 s m γ 2 sgn s m γ ˆ γ ˆ s α sat s s m χ ˆ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r d ˆ γ 1 s m γ 2 sgn s m s m 25 sat s s g n s i f s α s α i f s α in which α is a small positive value representing the boundary layer thickness according to the adaptation laws when the sliding variable is within the boundary layer the adaptation response will be halted which prevents the overestimation of the uncertain parameters and mitigates the chattering remark 1 it is clear from the proposed control law eq 25 that both the continuous and discontinuous control terms are affected by the adaptive control parameter χ ˆ thus after a fault appears in the system both control terms contribute to its accommodation this moderates the role of the discontinuous term thereby alleviating the probable chattering 3 3 assumption 2 the estimation error of the exogenous disturbance is bounded and ε s u p t 0 d theorem 1 considering a nonsingular fast integral type terminal sliding surface eq 17 the nonlinear disturbance observer eq 22 and the designed adaptive control law eq 25 for the wind turbine asymptotical stability can be achieved despite unknown external disturbances and parametric uncertainties if the discontinuous gain is chosen γ 2 η ε proof a positive definite lyapunov function is chosen as follows v 1 2 s m t s m χ 1 χ 2

simplified as 30 v σ m s m hence the standard reachability condition slotine 1984 edwards and shtessel 2016 edwards and spurgeon 1998 will be satisfied after a finite time interval and by applying the proposed adaptive control scheme and nonlinear disturbance observer stability of the closed loop wind turbine system in the presence of unknown exogenous disturbance uncertainties and faults can be guaranteed 4 active fault tolerant control based on tdc in this section an aftc based on tdc is developed to actively compensate the effect of faults tdc uses time delay estimation technique to cancel out uncertainties and exogenous disturbances so that a simple model can be obtained then by injecting the desired error dynamics tdc controls the system to track the desired trajectory cho et al 2016 in aftc scheme the tde can be employed as the fault detection module based on which the controller is reconfigured to nullify the effect of faults 4 1 fault detection based on tde tde method is a simple yet robust technique that can estimate a nonlinear function through time delay information independent from a priori knowledge about bounded unknown input using time delayed state variables and control inputs it estimates current states of the system cho et al 2020 wind turbine model in the presence of uncertainties and faults can be written as eq 31 31 x f x x g u δ x x u φ x x u for sufficiently small time delay value both uncertainty and fault terms δ and φ can be regarded as continuous or piecewise continuous functions with the following approximation δ x x u t δ x x u t τ 32 φ x x u t φ x x u t τ therefore the approximation for δ and φ are considered as δ ˆ x x u t δ x x u t τ 33 φ ˆ x x u t φ x x u t τ by adding these two approximate functions and replacing their equivalent values from eq 9 the following tde is obtained δ ˆ x x u t φ ˆ x x u t δ x x u t τ φ x x u t τ x t τ f t τ g u t τ 34 r t d e this tde acts as a robust fd observer which can effectively detect and isolate the faults in the presence of uncertainties it is noteworthy that the fd system not only must be sensitive against any type of fault but also must be robust against uncertainties to ensure this property a threshold should be chosen so that when t τ then φ x x u 0 and r t d e δ x x u 35 δ z t h r e s h o l d this implies that system is in normal condition and the residual r t d e is always smaller than z t h r e s h o l d properly choosing z t h r e s h o l d guarantees the robustness of fd system it should be noted that when the residual r t d e overshoots its corresponding threshold the fault is detected and isolated 4 2 aftc design when besides the exogenous disturbance a fault occurs in the system the controller performance degrades considerably aftc is an effective approach to address this problem and maintain the desired performance of the controller in the presence of faults in this part an aftc is proposed based on the combination of nfitsm and tde it is assumed that the uncertainties and faults can be lumped in the following form 36 δ x x u φ x x u r t d e υ where υ is the tde error then the rotor speed dynamics in the presence of faults and uncertainties can be rewritten as 37 d 2 x 1 d t 2 l f l g u r t d e υ where r t d e represents the effect of tde on rotor speed dynamics assumption 3 the tde error has an upper bound υ υ which seems to be realistic if τ is sufficiently small time derivative of the sliding surface eq 17 is rewritten as 38 s l f l g u r t d e υ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r the control law for the aftc is obtained as u u e q u r e u t d e 39 u t d e r t d e χ 1 χ ˆ theorem 2 considering a defined sliding surface eq 17 the nonlinear disturbance observer eq 22 and the designed aftc law eq 39 for the wind turbine asymptotical stability can be achieved despite unknown exogenous disturbances uncertainties and actuator faults if the discontinuous gain is chosen as γ 2 η υ ε where υ denotes the upper bound of tde error proof the following positive definite lyapunov function is considered v 1 2 s m t s m χ 1 χ 2 χ 1 γ 2 d 2 1 2 s m t s m χ 1 χ ˆ χ 2 χ 1 γ ˆ γ 2 d 2 v s m χ 1 γ χ 1 γ ˆ χ 1 χ ˆ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e

t 0 t s m d τ v 0 as v 0 is bounded and v t is decreasing and bounded we conclude that lim t 0 t φ t d τ v 0 based on barbalat s lemma ding and li 2017 khalil 2002 43 lim t φ t 0 which means that s m 0 when t then asymptotical stability of the system under the proposed control law will be guaranteed which completes the proof remark 1 fault estimation also can be determined from the following equality 44 δ x x u φ x x u x t f t g u t it should be noted that in order to detect and isolate the actuator faults this fault estimation can be taken into account remark 2 in general pftc offers fast response compared to aftc since it does not rely on fault detection process however the proposed aftc can potentially compensate the fault impact without any delay which is achieved by the robust fd system capable of reducing the time delay between the fault occurrence and accommodation remark 3 tde algorithm in this paper can compensate not only the uncertainties in healthy and normal conditions but also the influence of both uncertainties and faults in faulty conditions remark 4 in this paper sensor and actuator faults parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are simultaneously considered in the dynamic model of the wind turbine the proposed nonlinear disturbance observer ndo attenuates unknown exogenous disturbances when the system experiences a fault or a rapid varying disturbance ndo might not provide an accurate transient observation in this case the adaptive control scheme guarantees the system performance and robustness by affecting both continuous and discontinuous terms at the same time this prevents choosing high values for discontinuous gain and alleviates chattering to a high degree 5 benchmark controllers for better evaluation of the proposed controller two other controllers are briefly described in this section and their results for the wind turbine is compared to the proposed controller in simulation section more details about these controllers can be found in ren et al 2016 5 1 gain scheduled pi controller for a nonlinear system with time varying disturbances like wind turbine the linear pi controller is inefficient this is due to the fact that this controller is optimized for one operating point and as the working condition deviates from its normal point the controller performance degrades considerably gain scheduled pi gspi controller is an applicable solution to handle this problem and is widely applied to control wind turbines bianchi et al 2008 it compensates the variation of aerodynamic sensitivity to the pitch angle gspi controller employs an uncertainty estimation to schedule the controller gains and switches between them this requires a complex estimation of the real time disturbances as they are highly time varying various gspi control schemes have been designed based on pitch angle switching billy muhando et al 2007 muhando et al 2011 van et al 2015 the gspi control law is written as 45 u g s p i k β k p k i s x 1 ω r where k p and k i are proportional and integral gains and k β represent the scheduled gain the total gain of the system k β is obtained from muhando et al 2011 46 k β k p i d p s d β where d p s d β is the aerodynamic sensitivity of the system and k p i is the gain scheduling constant which is calculated from 47 k p i 1 3 β 0 β 15 1 0 β 30 3 β 30 5 2 nonlinear pi controller the control input for the wind turbine system can be defined as ren et al 2016 u 1 b 0 v ψ ˆ x b 0 l g x 0 48 ψ x l f x l g x b 0 u where ψ x was estimated by extended order states and perturbation observer espo in ren et al 2016 the feedback linearization control law is designed as a pi controller written in the following form 49 v k p k i s e according to ren et al 2016 the n pi control law is considered as 50 u 1 b 0 k p k i s e 1 b 0 ψ ˆ x here the control law is able to compensate for the effect of nonlinearities and disturbances and unlike the gspi requires just one pair of control gains more information regarding stability analysis of the n pi is presented in ref ren et al 2016 6 simulation results to verify the validity of the proposed controller a set of simulations is performed for both healthy and faulty conditions the controller which was designed based on the simplified two mass model of wind turbines is implemented on a sophisticated model in fast fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence simulator an effective tool for wind turbine control verification as states in fast user guide the pitch actuator dynamics are not included in this model which means that the blades can follow the reference pitch angle without any time delay to compensate for this paucity an additional actuator dynamic block is added to the existing model for the sake of brevity exclusively the result from fast simulation is presented in this paper the turbine is exposed to four different wind profiles generated in turbsim with 18 and 21 m s mean speed and 5 and 15 turbulence intensity to emulate measurement noise a gaussian noise with zero mean and given standard deviation is added to the output depending on the sensor type and measurement difficulty the standard deviation of noise varies three different actuator faults including hydraulic leakage high air content in oil and pump wear are imposed to the system for faulty condition and their effects on the controller performance is studied separately the pitch system step response to each fault is presented in fig 4 effect of faults are simulated by modifying the natural frequency and damping ratio of the pitch actuator dynamics optimal control gains are obtained by applying harmony search algorithm hsa the objective function of this optimization is chosen as the sum of integral time absolute error itae of rotor speed and control input rate for more conformity with reality and to improve optimization procedure hsa has been linked to fast and optimal parameters are calculated as presented in table 3 i t a e 0 t e t d t 51 o b j i t a e u as mentioned in the last section the simulations are also performed for the system with two other controllers gspi muhando et al 2011 and n pi ren et al 2016 and their results are compared to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under the influence of each controller the rms of error of rotor speed for the wind turbine pitch control system exposed to a variety of wind profiles and faults are illustrated in fig 5 it is obvious from the results that the effect of three faults on each controller is the same however different controllers react differently when the faults occur the atdc and n pi demonstrate higher level of accuracy compared to the gspi with the former s error remaining in the vicinity of zero the applied external disturbance is d 1 5 sin 2 π t to evaluate the performance of the controller in terms of rotor velocity and structural accelerations the normalized integral absolute error is chosen as the performance index j ω t 1 t 0 t ω r τ ω r d τ j a s s t 1 t 0 t a s i d e t o s i d e d τ 52 j a f a t 1 t 0 t a f o r e a f t d τ as depicted in fig 6 the calculated indices for three controllers experience an increase when faults occur however the proposed atdc demonstrates a negligible rise in three indices which comes from its accurate nature and robust performance in nullifying the effects of faults to provide a clearer comparison the mean value of these indices is determined and presented in table 4 for more detailed evaluation of control performance generator power and velocity as well as rotor velocity for the two superior controllers namely atdc and n pi are presented in fig 7 even though the tracking is achieved by both of them atdc results show very small fluctuations and this trend is retained even after fault occurrence the evaluation of fault detection system is performed by studying the residuals determined based on tde according to fig 8 when the system experiences a fault the residuals exceed their predefined values whereas in the presence of turbulent wind field they remain within the thresholds this means that fault detection and isolation are performed properly and precisely the life time of each wind turbine component is influenced by the fatigue loads acting on them which is highly affected by the control structure for this reason the critical loadings applied to the main components are studied the blade root out of plane and flap wise moments in time domain and frequency domain are plotted in fig 9 the moments time series encompasses many load cycles with the combination of excitation and natural frequencies regarding the moments in frequency domain it is clear that gspi signal encompasses a large bound of frequencies which shows the impulsive nature of the signal for n pi and atdc however the frequency bound is narrower comparing these signals it can be inferred that the area under the atdc curve which represents rms of the signal is smaller therefore it experiences less fluctuations and is more preferable 7 discussion wind turbines work in turbulent wind fields and their efficiency is highly sensitive to actuator faults ftc is an effective tool that compensates or nullifies faults impact thus it can prevent costly downtime for maintenance or repair and ensure safe and reliable operation most of the presented ftc based strategies were focused on alleviating the effect of faults without considering the exogenous disturbances that influence the system performance in real applications to address this issue composite structures using combination of adaptive control strategy and extended state perturbation observer or disturbance observer based sliding mode control have been proposed however the computational complexity of these structures degrades their effectiveness in real time implementation in this study a new composite structure was proposed which uses tdc to attenuate fault effects and a specific adaptive control strategy integrating smc and ndo that ensures high robustness and rejects the disturbance effects subsequently this structure was implemented on a wind turbine system with various faults and the effectiveness of this structure was presented in comparison with two other relevant controllers in a nutshell lower computational complexity and high accuracy are the superiority of the proposed ftc compared with the others according to table 5 the real time and cpu time of implementation for the proposed controller as anticipated is less than the others and this confirms its capability for real time applications moreover performance indices presented in fig 6 and table 4 reveal that under the influence of turbulent wind and sensor and actuator faults atdc demonstrates better performance compared to the other controllers indeed after faults occur in the system the trend of rotor speed index for atdc remained constant while for two other controllers it increased significantly the overriding issue resides in the robustness and accuracy of the proposed composite ftc which comes from the advantages of tde and ndo another interesting point of the proposed structure is the ability to detect faults out of external disturbances on the contrary most of the existing control methods consider disturbances and faults as a lumped term and estimate their effects simultaneously ren et al 2016 this approach cannot yield accurate results especially for real applications since these two phenomena are intrinsically different 8 conclusion in this paper an adaptive time delay control atdc based active fault tolerant control aftc was proposed for the wind turbine pitch system against uncertainties exogenous disturbances and sensor and actuator faults the developed atdc uses time delay estimation tde to estimate uncertainties and provide a model free easy to implement structure then an adaptive robust control was designed for atdc by combining the adaptive technique with nonsingular fast integral type terminal sliding mode nfitsm control scheme the adverse effect of exogenous disturbances was alleviated using a nonlinear observer next an effective control command was generated using aftc based atdc which can nullify the influence of faults and uncertainties as well as exogenous disturbances through the proposed structure chattering which comes from the discontinuous control term was mitigated and faults were isolated and accommodated a set of simulations was performed in fast fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence environment for both healthy and faulty conditions in the presence of turbulent wind field and sensor and actuator faults then the performance of the proposed controller was compared with two other controllers a gspi muhando et al 2011 control and an n pi ren et al 2016 control schemes the results confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller as a future work to enhance the performance of the proposed structure in terms of convergence rate and accuracy dynamic sliding mode control can be applied and an extended state observer can be implemented to estimate all uncertainties and disturbances the switching gain in the sliding mode based control can be adaptively updated by a new adaptive law without any dependency on uncertainty information credit authorship

20223,this paper addresses an active fault tolerant control aftc based on time delay control tdc and nonlinear disturbance observer for wind turbines exposed to pitch system sensor and actuator faults uncertainties and exogenous disturbances the developed adaptive tdc uses time delay estimation tde to estimate parametric uncertainties and provides an appealing model free structure tde is also applied as an online fault estimation algorithm then an adaptive robust control is designed for tdc using a combination of adaptive sliding mode with novel adaptation laws and a nonlinear disturbance observer ndo through estimating the exogenous disturbances the control gain of discontinuous term of sliding mode control law is kept small which in turn results in reduced chattering thus the proposed structure provides smooth control signals and can isolate and accommodate the effect of faults stability analysis is conducted based on lyapunov theory to verify the validity of the proposed structure the controller is implemented in fast environment simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed controller in the presence of different faults as well as uncertainties and

control tdc lyapunov theory 1 introduction global energy demand is on the rise so does concern for environmental issues as a promising solution sustainable energy has captured special attention particularly wind energy which possesses outstanding characteristics such as availability and low cost azizi et al 2019 so it is not surprising that by the end of 2020 the total capacity for wind energy globally has reached around 743 gw demonstrating a 14 percent increase compared to 2019 lee and zhao 2021 wind turbines as the main wind energy conversion system have a complex and nonlinear dynamics and work in uncertain environments under large turbulent winds and centrifugal gravitational and gyroscopic loads wright and fingersh 2008 relying on several rotating and non rotating components and sensors in addition to working in harsh environments make them prone to faults and failures leading to low reliability to prevent unpredicted failures maintenance schedules are planned which not only increase cost but also reduce the power generation due to required downtime habibi et al 2019 these challenges have been the motivation behind numerous researches in the realm of wind turbines from nominal control to fault detection and fault tolerant control the control objectives of wind turbines are decided according to wind speed for the speeds lower than cut in value the wind turbine is not put into operation at the speeds higher that cut out value the wind turbine is pitched to feather or braked to prevent structural damage the power generation takes place between these two limits and this operational region is classified into two parts in partial load region which covers the range of wind speeds between cut in and rated speed the main control objective is to maximize wind turbine power capture to this end the generator speed is adjusted to track the optimal power coefficient full load region starts from the rated wind speed and ends at cut out speed at this region the pitch angle is controlled to maintain the rotor speed at its rated value this also minimizes the load stress on drivetrain shaft as the aerodynamic forces on the blades are larger than those generating nominal power this paper considers wind turbine operation in full load region where the pitch system is activated to control power capture and mitigate harmful structural loads habibi et al 2019 vidal et al 2015 hydraulic pitch systems are widely employed in wind turbines thanks to their rapid response frequency large torque and convenient centralization however in real applications faults in sensors and hydraulic actuators are inevitable pressure drop in hydraulic system pump wear and high air content in oil are some of the most frequent faults in the hydraulic system which slow down the system dynamics deteriorate the pitching performance cause fluctuations on the generator speed and power and make the turbine unstable odgaard et al 2013 fault detection and isolation fdi and fault tolerant control ftc are effective methods that improve reliability lower the maintenance cost reduce downtime prevent catastrophic failures and yet despite the presence of faults preserve system performance at a desired level ftc approaches are generally categorized into two groups passive pftc and active aftc pftc schemes have fixed control structures designed to be robust against uncertainties and faults while aftc approaches use the fault information from fault detection fd unit and reconfigure or redesign the controller accordingly so that acceptable performance and stability of the system can be retained yu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 not relying on fault detection the pftc approaches demonstrate fast response but limited robustness time delay control tdc is a robust nonlinear control scheme that can deal with large parameter variations and disturbances thus it is an effective approach for fault tolerant control by using time delayed state variables and control input tdc estimates the function representing the uncertainty effects and cancels unknown dynamics and unexpected disturbances youcef toumi and ito 1990 tdc encompasses two main parts time delay estimation tde and a robust controller and provides simple efficient and model free control scheme suitable for many practical applications baek et al 2019 pi et al 2020 cho et al 2016 it also offers reasonable computation cost easy implementation and parameter tuning possibility baek et al 2019 further improvements have been made by integrating tdc with sliding mode controller kali et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sliding mode control smc is a robust nonlinear control technique which is widely employed in uncertain systems its systematic design high stability and consistent performance in the presence of model uncertainties parameter variations and exogenous disturbances have made it a suitable choice for ftc design however the conventional smc suffers from four main drawbacks i its linear sliding surface does not guarantee a finite time convergence ii despite its good transient performance in normal condition its performance degrades in the presence of fast varying disturbances or faults iii its discontinuous control law generates chattering which may excite un modeled high frequency dynamics iv its design requires a priori knowledge of the upper bounds of uncertainties disturbances and faults since in many cases these bounds are unknown the switching gains are chosen to be large enough to cover a wide range of perturbations and this further aggravates chattering various solutions have been put forward to address these shortcomings to solve the convergence rate drawback of smc terminal sliding mode control tsmc scheme was proposed man et al 1994 however it suffers from two problems i low convergence rate when the system state is far away from the equilibrium point ii singularity problem these were solved in fast terminal smc ftsmc yuman 2002 and nonsingular terminal smc ntsmc feng et al 2002 the transient response of smc is enhanced by employing integral smc ismc or pid based smc pid smc lee et al 2017 cui et al 2017 parra vega et al 2003 the chattering problem can be ameliorated by using boundary layer setting yin and xiao 2017 incremona et al 2017 low pass filtering lee and utkin 2007 high order smc di gennaro et al 2014 dehkordi et al 2017 fractional calculus noshirvani et al 2019 ullah et al 2017 or disturbance observer zhang et al 2016 adaptive smc is an effective approach to eliminate the perturbation bound requirement by adjusting the gain magnitude with respect to uncertainties and faults which also alleviates chattering shtessel et al 2012 hu et al 2017 various approaches have been proposed to solve fault detection and fault tolerant control problem of wind turbines in azizi et al 2019 an aftc was designed to control rotor speed and power of a wind turbine in the presence of actuator faults and uncertainties the control scheme was an smc with an integral surface and an adaptive gain termed as adaptive output feedback sliding mode controller the integral sliding surface and the control law are shaped by an output feedback and a full order compensator with the latter attenuating the faults and disturbances in noshirvani et al 2019 an aftc was proposed which combines the robustness properties of fractional order terminal sliding mode control with the accurate estimation of virtual actuators for fault detection a bank of modified unscented kalman filters was employed and it was shown that the presented controller possesses finite time stability and alleviates chattering in lan et al 2018 an aftc scheme was introduced to compensate the pitch actuator faults and recover the nominal pitch dynamics this scheme incorporates a traditional proportional integral controller as a baseline system to achieve nominal pitch performance along with a fault compensator to eliminate the actuator fault effects in shi and patton 2015 an observer based aftc was proposed for a nonlinear large rotor wind turbine which utilizes the industrial pi controller for nominal performance and an extended state observer for estimating the system states and fault signals through a linear parameter varying lpv descriptor system context using linear matrix inequality lmi an aftc method entailing a robust estimation and compensation for wind turbine actuator and sensor faults was proposed by wang et al 2017 their proposed control method comprises two parts an active disturbance rejection control method and a descriptor sliding mode observer to validate the results the controller was implemented in fast environment to the best of authors knowledge none of the published papers in the realm of wind turbine control have studied the effects of pitch actuator faults such as hydraulic leakage pump wear and high air content in oil for collective pitch angle control based on a nonlinear model so this paper proposes a novel aftc based on adaptive time delay control and nonlinear disturbance observer for wind turbine pitch system to nullify the effects of actuator and sensor faults uncertainties and exogenous disturbances the key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 a new aftc control scheme is proposed based on tdc which adaptively produces the control signal to compensate the effect of actuator and sensor faults parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances simultaneously 2 faults and parametric uncertainties are accommodated through tdc and adaptive control schemes and exogenous disturbances are attenuated using nonlinear disturbance observer this strategy further reduces the discontinuous control gain of smc and alleviates the chattering of the control signal even more 3 the adaptive control law affects both continuous and discontinuous terms at the same time therefore both of these terms contribute to disturbance attenuation and this prevents choosing high values for discontinuous control gain the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the problem by defining the wind turbine model and introducing the system faults that will be considered in this study section 3 presents the adaptive control strategy and section 4 describes the proposed aftc based on tdc on the grounds of comparison two existing control schemes gspi and n pi controllers are introduced in section 5 and the simulation results for these controllers as well as the proposed controller are illustrated in section 6 a brief discussion is included in section 7 and the paper is concluded in section 8 2 problem statement 2 1 wind turbine model the powertrain of wind turbines comprises three main components namely the rotor blades gear box and generator wind energy develops aerodynamic forces on the blades resulting in the following aerodynamic torque on the rotor 1 τ r 1 2 π ρ r 3 u 2 c q λ β λ ω r r v where ρ r ω r and u represent air density rotor radius and angular velocity and wind speed respectively moreover c q denotes the torque coefficient and generally is defined as a two dimensional map which depends on pitch angle of the blade β and the tip speed ratio λ the aerodynamic power captured by the blades is defined as 2 p r 1 2 π ρ r 2 u 3 c p ω r β u where c p symbolizes the power coefficient defined by 3 c p 0 22 116 λ t 0 4 β 5 e 12 5 λ t 4 λ t 1 λ 0 08 β 0 035 β 3 1 obviously following equation holds for torque and power coefficients 5 c p λ β λ c q λ β power coefficient for the under studied wind turbine is presented in fig 1 through regulating β the pitch system controls the amount of wind energy captured by the turbine for hydraulic pitch control systems each actuator is considered as a linear second order system with the following transfer function 6 β β r ω n 2 s 2 2 ζ ω n ω n 2 where β r ζ and ω n show the reference pitch angle damping ratio and natural frequency respectively the mechanical part of drivetrain system can be modeled as a nonlinear two mass spring damper system as shown in fig 2 its dynamic model can be represented by the following state space equations esbensen and sloth 2009 7 ω r 1 j r p r ω r β u ω r ω r d s ω g d s n g θ k s ω g 1 j g ω r d s n g ω g d s n g 2 θ k s n g t g θ ω r ω g n g in which θ shows torsional angle the definition of other parameters and their corresponding values for the reference turbine are listed in table 1 defining the state and the input vectors as 8 x ω r ω g θ β β t u β r the nonlinear dynamic model of the wind turbine in affine form is expressed as 9 x f x x g u where f x x represents the nonlinear term in wind turbine model and g is the coefficient of control input 2 2 problem formulation it can be proved that there exists a diffeomorphism transformation so that the wind turbine system given in eq 9 is equivalent to the system in its normal form with stable zero dynamics this means that taking time derivative of e ω r ω r guarantees that the wind turbine system is stable and non singular over its entire operating points kumar and stol 2010 thomsen 2006 thus the second order derivative of rotor speed dynamics is written as 10 d 2 x 1 d t 2 l f x l g x u where 11 l f x f 1 x 1 f 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 f 1 x 3 f 3 f 1 x 4 f 4 f 1 x 5 f 5 f 1 u u l g x f 1 x 5 g 5 2 3 fault model generally depending on their time profile faults are categorized into incipient and abrupt types incipient faults occur slowly and grow gradually while abrupt faults happen suddenly and unexpectedly in spite of the fact that the abrupt faults are mostly easy to detect they have the potential to impose severe effects on the system chaaban et al 2014 from severity point of view faults can be divided into extreme or non extreme for extreme faults immediate actions like off grid procedures or shutdown are taken on the other hand for non extreme cases ftc strategies can be applied to maintain the turbine performance at an acceptable level li et al 2018 studies reveal that a great portion of failures are minor and also the most prevalent failures occur in pitch hydraulic system carroll et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 3 the hydraulic pitch system mainly comprises a pump some valves and a blade pitch motion mechanism a controller takes the error signal between the actual and reference rotor speed and transmits the control signal to a servo valve that controls the actuator position pitch system faults have various causes whether in control or in hydraulic subsystem sensor faults occur in control subsystem while pump wear hydraulic leakage and high air content in oil are common faults affecting the hydraulic subsystem pitch sensor bias and gain degrades the performance of the controller so that the system is unable to follow the desired input in extreme cases when the pitch sensor completely fails the blades are feathered bias in generator speed sensor also causes the pitch angle to deviate from its desired value or the actuator experience runaway high air content in oil can lead to slow pitch control action causing fluctuations in generator speed and power and loss of system stability lan et al 2018 moreover incorrect pitch angle generates asymmetrical forces on the blades and intensifies structural loading of its platform hydraulic leakage can be divided into external and internal the external leakage happens at either side of the actuator but the internal one takes place between the two hydraulic cylinder chambers high internal leakage causes the actuator lose its ability to apply effective load and external leakage may lead to a sluggish response an and sepehri 2005 2 3 1 pitch sensor fault the bias fault is prevalent in wind turbines and can be introduce to the system as a result of pitch sensor malfunction or inaccurate system calibration sensor fault is categorized as incipient and can be distinguished from the rate of biased signal and its range esbensen and sloth 2009 biased output deteriorates the closed loop system performance and affects the pitch angle measurement in the presence of bias fault the dynamic model of the pitch actuator eq 6 changes to the following equation 12 β 2 ζ ω n β t ω n 2 β t β b t ω n 2 β r t t d in which subscripts b r and d stand for bias reference and delay the measured signal is written as 13 β m k β k β b k v n k where v n is measurement noise 2 3 2 pitch actuator faults the main faults of the hydraulic pitch actuators are pump wear hydraulic leakage and high air content in oil these faults affect the system dynamics differently and their influence is reflected in natural frequency ω n and damping ratio ζ of the pitch system the numerical values of the actuator dynamic parameters for the reference wind turbine model are summarized in table 2 pump wear as an incipient fault pump wear happens at slow rate and causes low pump pressure it changes the dynamics of pitch system as follows 14 β 2 ζ t ω n β t ω n 2 t β t ω n 2 t β r t t d ζ t 1 υ p w t ζ υ p w t ζ p w ω n t 1 υ p w t ω n υ p w t ω n p w where 0 υ p w t 1 shows the level of wear zero value indicates the normal condition while its upper bound corresponds to 75 pump pressure hydraulic leakage hydraulic leakage is also an incipient fault but happens faster than pump wear and causes up to 50 pressure drop this fault varies the system parameters as follows 15 ζ t 1 υ h l t ζ υ h l t ζ h l ω n t 1 υ h l t ω n υ h l t ω n h l where 0 υ h l t 1 in normal operation υ h l 0 and when the hydraulic pressure experiences 50 loss υ h l 1 under too low hydraulic pressure the system is unable to move the blades and therefore the actuator sticks in its current position resulting in blade seize high air content in oil high air content in oil is another incipient fault whose effect on system is described as below 16 ζ t 1 υ h a t ζ υ h a t ζ h a ω n t 1 υ h a t ω n υ h a t ω n h a unlike the previous faults high air content in oil can disappear so υ h a can take negative values too zero and one values for υ h a show 7 and 15 air content respectively if the hydraulic leakage persists the pitch actuators may become uncontrollable to prevent this situation it should be detected before the hydraulic pressure drops to 50 of its nominal value 3 adaptive robust control strategy in this section a disturbance observer based asmc scheme is designed to compensate the effects of faults parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances the proposed asmc is implemented to adjust the control signals according to faults and uncertainties without overestimating the control gains the adaptive characteristic of the controller allows to choose smaller discontinuous control gain leading to alleviated chattering by employing a nonlinear disturbance observer the continuous term further decreases which results in enhanced robustness against larger faults and uncertainties 3 1 design of disturbance observer based adaptive smc based controller if the tracking error of rotor speed is defined as ω r ω r the nonsingular fast integral type terminal sliding nfits surface is specified as 17 s e c 1 e c 2 0 t e e q e l r d t where c 1 and c 2 are constant parameters for the controller to have nonsingular property q l r in which l and r are chosen odd integers satisfying 1 l r 2 the smc based control law drives the sliding variable to reach the sliding surface and then ensures that it remains in the vicinity of the surface the law embodies a continuous component that stabilizes the nominal system and a discontinuous term which compensates the effect of uncertainties and disturbances 18 u u e q u r e where u e q and u r e represent equivalent and discontinuous control terms to derive the equivalent control law the first derivative of the sliding surface with respect to time is equalized to zero this yields the continuous control law as 19 s e c 1 e c 2 e e q e l r 0 u e q l ˆ g 1 l f c 1 e c 2 e e q e l r as stated earlier this control law does not compensate for the effect of disturbances thus if substituted in eq 10 the following error dynamics is obtained which regardless of its value the tracking error cannot converge to zero 20 e c 1 e c 2 e e q e l r d 0 to overcome this challenge a discontinuous term u r e is added and the overall control law is rewritten as 21 u l ˆ g 1 l ˆ f c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r d ˆ γ 1 s γ 2 sgn s where l ˆ g l ˆ f and d ˆ represent the estimation of l g l f and disturbances d and γ 1 and γ 2 are positive constant parameters to be able to handle the effect of unknown exogenous disturbances it is necessary for the γ 2 to be chosen bigger than their upper bound this high gain value increases the amount of discontinuous term and thereby aggravating chattering to solve this problem a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed 3 2 nonlinear disturbance observer ndo assumption 1 unknown exogenous disturbances have an upper bound and its time derivative is bounded in order to estimate this disturbance a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed as chen et al 2016 22 z κ z κ κ ω r l f l g u d ˆ z κ ω r where z and κ represent the internal state of the observer and the observer gain κ 0 the disturbance estimation error is defined as 23 d d d ˆ using eq 10 and eq 22 the time derivative of eq 23 can be expressed as d d d ˆ z κ ω r κ d ˆ κ ω r κ κ ω r l f l g u κ l f l g u d 24 κ d lemma 1 according to assumption 1 for the positive observer gain the disturbance estimation calculated from eq 22 can asymptotically follow the actual disturbance chen 2003 it can be inferred from this lemma that by choosing a positive value for the observer gain the unknown exogenous disturbances can be estimated successfully and asymptotical stability of the estimation error dynamics is achieved furthermore by choosing higher values for the observer gain the convergence rate of the error dynamics can be increased defining γ ˆ l ˆ f l ˆ g and χ ˆ l ˆ g the control law eq 21 can be rewritten as follows u χ ˆ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r d ˆ γ 1 s m γ 2 sgn s m γ ˆ γ ˆ s α sat s s m χ ˆ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r d ˆ γ 1 s m γ 2 sgn s m s m 25 sat s s g n s i f s α s α i f s α in which α is a small positive value representing the boundary layer thickness according to the adaptation laws when the sliding variable is within the boundary layer the adaptation response will be halted which prevents the overestimation of the uncertain parameters and mitigates the chattering remark 1 it is clear from the proposed control law eq 25 that both the continuous and discontinuous control terms are affected by the adaptive control parameter χ ˆ thus after a fault appears in the system both control terms contribute to its accommodation this moderates the role of the discontinuous term thereby alleviating the probable chattering 3 3 assumption 2 the estimation error of the exogenous disturbance is bounded and ε s u p t 0 d theorem 1 considering a nonsingular fast integral type terminal sliding surface eq 17 the nonlinear disturbance observer eq 22 and the designed adaptive control law eq 25 for the wind turbine asymptotical stability can be achieved despite unknown external disturbances and parametric uncertainties if the discontinuous gain is chosen γ 2 η ε proof a positive definite lyapunov function is chosen as follows v 1 2 s m t s m χ 1 χ 2

the adaptation laws into eq 27 yields 28 v s m t γ 1 s m s m t γ 2 sgn s m s m t d κ d 2 according to the facts that s m s m s m 2 s m sgn s m s m nojavanzadeh and badamchizadeh 2016 and γ 2 η ε where ε s u p t 0 d then v γ 1 s m 2 η s m κ d 2 29 γ 1 s m 2 s m η κ d 2 s m since the switching gain η can be chosen such that η κ d 2 s m σ m in which σ m is a positive arbitrary constant eq 29 is simplified as 30 v σ m s m hence the standard reachability condition slotine 1984 edwards and shtessel 2016 edwards and spurgeon 1998 will be satisfied after a finite time interval and by applying the proposed adaptive control scheme and nonlinear disturbance observer stability of the closed loop wind turbine system in the presence of unknown exogenous disturbance uncertainties and faults can be guaranteed 4 active fault tolerant control based on tdc in this section an aftc based on tdc is developed to actively compensate the effect of faults tdc uses time delay estimation technique to cancel out uncertainties and exogenous disturbances so that a simple model can be obtained then by injecting the desired error dynamics tdc controls the system to track the desired trajectory cho et al 2016 in aftc scheme the tde can be employed as the fault detection module based on which the controller is reconfigured to nullify the effect of faults 4 1 fault detection based on tde tde method is a simple yet robust technique that can estimate a nonlinear function through time delay information independent from a priori knowledge about bounded unknown input using time delayed state variables and control inputs it estimates current states of the system cho et al 2020 wind turbine model in the presence of uncertainties and faults can be written as eq 31 31 x f x x g u δ x x u φ x x u for sufficiently small time delay value both uncertainty and fault terms δ and φ can be regarded as continuous or piecewise continuous functions with the following approximation δ x x u t δ x x u t τ 32 φ x x u t φ x x u t τ therefore the approximation for δ and φ are considered as δ ˆ x x u t δ x x u t τ 33 φ ˆ x x u t φ x x u t τ by adding these two approximate functions and replacing their equivalent values from eq 9 the following tde is obtained δ ˆ x x u t φ ˆ x x u t δ x x u t τ φ x x u t τ x t τ f t τ g u t τ 34 r t d e this tde acts as a robust fd observer which can effectively detect and isolate the faults in the presence of uncertainties it is noteworthy that the fd system not only must be sensitive against any type of fault but also must be robust against uncertainties to ensure this property a threshold should be chosen so that when t τ then φ x x u 0 and r t d e δ x x u 35 δ z t h r e s h o l d this implies that system is in normal condition and the residual r t d e is always smaller than z t h r e s h o l d properly choosing z t h r e s h o l d guarantees the robustness of fd system it should be noted that when the residual r t d e overshoots its corresponding threshold the fault is detected and isolated 4 2 aftc design when besides the exogenous disturbance a fault occurs in the system the controller performance degrades considerably aftc is an effective approach to address this problem and maintain the desired performance of the controller in the presence of faults in this part an aftc is proposed based on the combination of nfitsm and tde it is assumed that the uncertainties and faults can be lumped in the following form 36 δ x x u φ x x u r t d e υ where υ is the tde error then the rotor speed dynamics in the presence of faults and uncertainties can be rewritten as 37 d 2 x 1 d t 2 l f l g u r t d e υ where r t d e represents the effect of tde on rotor speed dynamics assumption 3 the tde error has an upper bound υ υ which seems to be realistic if τ is sufficiently small time derivative of the sliding surface eq 17 is rewritten as 38 s l f l g u r t d e υ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e l r the control law for the aftc is obtained as u u e q u r e u t d e 39 u t d e r t d e χ 1 χ ˆ theorem 2 considering a defined sliding surface eq 17 the nonlinear disturbance observer eq 22 and the designed aftc law eq 39 for the wind turbine asymptotical stability can be achieved despite unknown exogenous disturbances uncertainties and actuator faults if the discontinuous gain is chosen as γ 2 η υ ε where υ denotes the upper bound of tde error proof the following positive definite lyapunov function is considered v 1 2 s m t s m χ 1 χ 2 χ 1 γ 2 d 2 1 2 s m t s m χ 1 χ ˆ χ 2 χ 1 γ ˆ γ 2 d 2 v s m χ 1 γ χ 1 γ ˆ χ 1 χ ˆ c 1 e c 2 e e φ e

t 0 t s m d τ v 0 as v 0 is bounded and v t is decreasing and bounded we conclude that lim t 0 t φ t d τ v 0 based on barbalat s lemma ding and li 2017 khalil 2002 43 lim t φ t 0 which means that s m 0 when t then asymptotical stability of the system under the proposed control law will be guaranteed which completes the proof remark 1 fault estimation also can be determined from the following equality 44 δ x x u φ x x u x t f t g u t it should be noted that in order to detect and isolate the actuator faults this fault estimation can be taken into account remark 2 in general pftc offers fast response compared to aftc since it does not rely on fault detection process however the proposed aftc can potentially compensate the fault impact without any delay which is achieved by the robust fd system capable of reducing the time delay between the fault occurrence and accommodation remark 3 tde algorithm in this paper can compensate not only the uncertainties in healthy and normal conditions but also the influence of both uncertainties and faults in faulty conditions remark 4 in this paper sensor and actuator faults parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are simultaneously considered in the dynamic model of the wind turbine the proposed nonlinear disturbance observer ndo attenuates unknown exogenous disturbances when the system experiences a fault or a rapid varying disturbance ndo might not provide an accurate transient observation in this case the adaptive control scheme guarantees the system performance and robustness by affecting both continuous and discontinuous terms at the same time this prevents choosing high values for discontinuous gain and alleviates chattering to a high degree 5 benchmark controllers for better evaluation of the proposed controller two other controllers are briefly described in this section and their results for the wind turbine is compared to the proposed controller in simulation section more details about these controllers can be found in ren et al 2016 5 1 gain scheduled pi controller for a nonlinear system with time varying disturbances like wind turbine the linear pi controller is inefficient this is due to the fact that this controller is optimized for one operating point and as the working condition deviates from its normal point the controller performance degrades considerably gain scheduled pi gspi controller is an applicable solution to handle this problem and is widely applied to control wind turbines bianchi et al 2008 it compensates the variation of aerodynamic sensitivity to the pitch angle gspi controller employs an uncertainty estimation to schedule the controller gains and switches between them this requires a complex estimation of the real time disturbances as they are highly time varying various gspi control schemes have been designed based on pitch angle switching billy muhando et al 2007 muhando et al 2011 van et al 2015 the gspi control law is written as 45 u g s p i k β k p k i s x 1 ω r where k p and k i are proportional and integral gains and k β represent the scheduled gain the total gain of the system k β is obtained from muhando et al 2011 46 k β k p i d p s d β where d p s d β is the aerodynamic sensitivity of the system and k p i is the gain scheduling constant which is calculated from 47 k p i 1 3 β 0 β 15 1 0 β 30 3 β 30 5 2 nonlinear pi controller the control input for the wind turbine system can be defined as ren et al 2016 u 1 b 0 v ψ ˆ x b 0 l g x 0 48 ψ x l f x l g x b 0 u where ψ x was estimated by extended order states and perturbation observer espo in ren et al 2016 the feedback linearization control law is designed as a pi controller written in the following form 49 v k p k i s e according to ren et al 2016 the n pi control law is considered as 50 u 1 b 0 k p k i s e 1 b 0 ψ ˆ x here the control law is able to compensate for the effect of nonlinearities and disturbances and unlike the gspi requires just one pair of control gains more information regarding stability analysis of the n pi is presented in ref ren et al 2016 6 simulation results to verify the validity of the proposed controller a set of simulations is performed for both healthy and faulty conditions the controller which was designed based on the simplified two mass model of wind turbines is implemented on a sophisticated model in fast fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence simulator an effective tool for wind turbine control verification as states in fast user guide the pitch actuator dynamics are not included in this model which means that the blades can follow the reference pitch angle without any time delay to compensate for this paucity an additional actuator dynamic block is added to the existing model for the sake of brevity exclusively the result from fast simulation is presented in this paper the turbine is exposed to four different wind profiles generated in turbsim with 18 and 21 m s mean speed and 5 and 15 turbulence intensity to emulate measurement noise a gaussian noise with zero mean and given standard deviation is added to the output depending on the sensor type and measurement difficulty the standard deviation of noise varies three different actuator faults including hydraulic leakage high air content in oil and pump wear are imposed to the system for faulty condition and their effects on the controller performance is studied separately the pitch system step response to each fault is presented in fig 4 effect of faults are simulated by modifying the natural frequency and damping ratio of the pitch actuator dynamics optimal control gains are obtained by applying harmony search algorithm hsa the objective function of this optimization is chosen as the sum of integral time absolute error itae of rotor speed and control input rate for more conformity with reality and to improve optimization procedure hsa has been linked to fast and optimal parameters are calculated as presented in table 3 i t a e 0 t e t d t 51 o b j i t a e u as mentioned in the last section the simulations are also performed for the system with two other controllers gspi muhando et al 2011 and n pi ren et al 2016 and their results are compared to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under the influence of each controller the rms of error of rotor speed for the wind turbine pitch control system exposed to a variety of wind profiles and faults are illustrated in fig 5 it is obvious from the results that the effect of three faults on each controller is the same however different controllers react differently when the faults occur the atdc and n pi demonstrate higher level of accuracy compared to the gspi with the former s error remaining in the vicinity of zero the applied external disturbance is d 1 5 sin 2 π t to evaluate the performance of the controller in terms of rotor velocity and structural accelerations the normalized integral absolute error is chosen as the performance index j ω t 1 t 0 t ω r τ ω r d τ j a s s t 1 t 0 t a s i d e t o s i d e d τ 52 j a f a t 1 t 0 t a f o r e a f t d τ as depicted in fig 6 the calculated indices for three controllers experience an increase when faults occur however the proposed atdc demonstrates a negligible rise in three indices which comes from its accurate nature and robust performance in nullifying the effects of faults to provide a clearer comparison the mean value of these indices is determined and presented in table 4 for more detailed evaluation of control performance generator power and velocity as well as rotor velocity for the two superior controllers namely atdc and n pi are presented in fig 7 even though the tracking is achieved by both of them atdc results show very small fluctuations and this trend is retained even after fault occurrence the evaluation of fault detection system is performed by studying the residuals determined based on tde according to fig 8 when the system experiences a fault the residuals exceed their predefined values whereas in the presence of turbulent wind field they remain within the thresholds this means that fault detection and isolation are performed properly and precisely the life time of each wind turbine component is influenced by the fatigue loads acting on them which is highly affected by the control structure for this reason the critical loadings applied to the main components are studied the blade root out of plane and flap wise moments in time domain and frequency domain are plotted in fig 9 the moments time series encompasses many load cycles with the combination of excitation and natural frequencies regarding the moments in frequency domain it is clear that gspi signal encompasses a large bound of frequencies which shows the impulsive nature of the signal for n pi and atdc however the frequency bound is narrower comparing these signals it can be inferred that the area under the atdc curve which represents rms of the signal is smaller therefore it experiences less fluctuations and is more preferable 7 discussion wind turbines work in turbulent wind fields and their efficiency is highly sensitive to actuator faults ftc is an effective tool that compensates or nullifies faults impact thus it can prevent costly downtime for maintenance or repair and ensure safe and reliable operation most of the presented ftc based strategies were focused on alleviating the effect of faults without considering the exogenous disturbances that influence the system performance in real applications to address this issue composite structures using combination of adaptive control strategy and extended state perturbation observer or disturbance observer based sliding mode control have been proposed however the computational complexity of these structures degrades their effectiveness in real time implementation in this study a new composite structure was proposed which uses tdc to attenuate fault effects and a specific adaptive control strategy integrating smc and ndo that ensures high robustness and rejects the disturbance effects subsequently this structure was implemented on a wind turbine system with various faults and the effectiveness of this structure was presented in comparison with two other relevant controllers in a nutshell lower computational complexity and high accuracy are the superiority of the proposed ftc compared with the others according to table 5 the real time and cpu time of implementation for the proposed controller as anticipated is less than the others and this confirms its capability for real time applications moreover performance indices presented in fig 6 and table 4 reveal that under the influence of turbulent wind and sensor and actuator faults atdc demonstrates better performance compared to the other controllers indeed after faults occur in the system the trend of rotor speed index for atdc remained constant while for two other controllers it increased significantly the overriding issue resides in the robustness and accuracy of the proposed composite ftc which comes from the advantages of tde and ndo another interesting point of the proposed structure is the ability to detect faults out of external disturbances on the contrary most of the existing control methods consider disturbances and faults as a lumped term and estimate their effects simultaneously ren et al 2016 this approach cannot yield accurate results especially for real applications since these two phenomena are intrinsically different 8 conclusion in this paper an adaptive time delay control atdc based active fault tolerant control aftc was proposed for the wind turbine pitch system against uncertainties exogenous disturbances and sensor and actuator faults the developed atdc uses time delay estimation tde to estimate uncertainties and provide a model free easy to implement structure then an adaptive robust control was designed for atdc by combining the adaptive technique with nonsingular fast integral type terminal sliding mode nfitsm control scheme the adverse effect of exogenous disturbances was alleviated using a nonlinear observer next an effective control command was generated using aftc based atdc which can nullify the influence of faults and uncertainties as well as exogenous disturbances through the proposed structure chattering which comes from the discontinuous control term was mitigated and faults were isolated and accommodated a set of simulations was performed in fast fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence environment for both healthy and faulty conditions in the presence of turbulent wind field and sensor and actuator faults then the performance of the proposed controller was compared with two other controllers a gspi muhando et al 2011 control and an n pi ren et al 2016 control schemes the results confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller as a future work to enhance the performance of the proposed structure in terms of convergence rate and accuracy dynamic sliding mode control can be applied and an extended state observer can be implemented to estimate all uncertainties and disturbances the switching gain in the sliding mode based control can be adaptively updated by a new adaptive law without any dependency on uncertainty information credit authorship

20224,the underwater glider platform is equipped with a mass block adjustment system which can directly control the roll angle and pitch angle through mass block adjustment and indirectly control the heading angle through the coupling of profile motion as the underwater glider energy and space limitations drive the low power and low frequency control it will inevitably lead to the underwater glider attitude adjustment process is subject to the delay problem of mass motion state signal feedback the delay time and the nonlinear and coupling characteristics fused together more likely to cause the instability of the control system in this paper the time delay problem in the attitude control of underwater glider is summarized as a class of nonlinear stability problems with time delay parameters the hopf bifurcation phenomenon caused by the time delay parameter is discussed and the critical time delay conditions for hopf bifurcation generation are given the effect of the time delay parameter on the bifurcation direction and the stability of the periodic solution is analyzed using the central flow pattern method finally the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulation which provides a theoretical basis for the platform stability control and drive system design of the underwater glider keywords underwater glider mass regulation system stability analysis hopf bifurcation time delay system wen qing zhang liang long da qin dong sun lin zhang wu hong guo 1 introduction with the development of marine science and technology at home and abroad the use of underwater gliders auvs and other underwater unmanned aerial vehicles to observe the marine environment and investigate marine resources has become a common trend xu and xiao 2007 there are great differences between underwater gliders and auvs in terms of navigation attitude adjustment in general auvs use forward or lateral thrusters for speed adjustment and rudders for heading control xiong 2008 however underwater gliders generally do not have propellers and rudders and can only control the center of gravity through the mass adjustment system inside the platform aghili 2012 thus achieving pitch and roll angle adjustment combined with buoyancy control to achieve the heading adjustment of underwater gliders bi 2010 feng yang et al 2010 therefore the heading adjustment of the underwater glider is a rotational motion generated by the coupling of the internal mass adjustment system and the buoyancy control system the heading adjustment of the underwater glider takes some time from the sensor to the controller to the actuator and the multi system coupling guo et al 2012 the presence of delay variables will have a significant impact on the motion control performance of the underwater glider and change the structural stability of the control system he et al 2013 the study of delays in control systems has been a hot topic in the control science of underwater unmanned vehicle uuv tan and wang 2013 combined with the dynamics of the point mass jia wang et al 2008 the auv is modeled as an underdriven system li jia wang et al proposed a lyapunov based tracking controller to stabilize the error dynamics and force the position error to a small neighborhood of the origin by using the backstepping method simulation results validate the proposed tracking method in bi feng yang s paper the global and uniform asymptotic stabilization problem of the resulting cascaded system is reduced to the stabilization problem of two subsystems by using a cascade method for the stabilization of the subsystem involving yaw moments a control law based on a feedback linearization method is proposed feng yang et al 2010 in the study of formation control problems with communication delays xiao zhang et al proposed a distributed formation control protocol using graph theory negative matrix analysis and lyapunov stability theory to obtain a range of eigenvalues about the control parameter matrix and to give sufficient conditions for achieving formation stability zhang and jiang 2020 for multi uavs systems in 3d environment under the condition of time delay and interference constraints danghui yan et al 2020 proposed a sliding mode formation control algorithm based on consistency and considering delay simulation results show that the proposed control algorithm is able to maintain the desired formation considering the delay and interference constraints in the formation process xun zhang introduces the design ideas of distributed control systems in network control systems ncs into the design of uuv control system structures which is the current research direction this is of great significance to the research of uuv control theory and its engineering applications my team is mainly engaged in the motion control research of underwater unmanned vehicle such as underwater glider and auv during the design and development of underwater gliders it was found that the gliders exhibit inexplicable circular motion during sea trials which excludes the interference of currents and waves this motion also occurs under extremely favorable sea conditions later by adjusting the response speed of the control mechanism the occurrence of this phenomenon was found to be highly relevant therefore in this paper an attempt is made to analyze the stability of the equilibrium point of the system and the existence of the hopf bifurcation starting from the starting point of the hopf bifurcation caused by the time delay using the delay of the system as a bifurcation parameter marsden et al 2003 2 nonlinear kinematic modeling of underwater glider in this paper the 6 dof kinematic model jia wang et al 2008 of underwater vehicle is developed by using two rectangular coordinate systems one is a fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ southeast geographic coordinate system which is fixed to the earth the other is a kinematic coordinate system g x y z each coordinate system is defined according to a right handed system as shown in fig 1 the axis e ξ is kept horizontal and the normal east is usually selected as its positive direction the axis e η is placed in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the axis e ξ and the direction due south is chosen as its positive direction the axis e ζ is placed perpendicular to the coordinate plane e ξ η and its positive direction points to the center of the earth the origin of the motion coordinate system can be selected at the center of gravity g of the underwater vehicle the origin is denoted as o in the motion coordinate system g x y z the axis o x is generally selected in the longitudinal section of the underwater vehicle pointing forward of the bow and parallel to the waterline plane the axis o y is perpendicular to the longitudinal section of the underwater vehicle pointing to the starboard side of the underwater vehicle and parallel to plane of the waterline the axis o z is in the longitudinal section of the underwater vehicle pointing towards the bottom of the underwater vehicle position vector x y z and attitude euler angle ϕ θ ψ of underwater vehicle are defined in a fixed coordinate system the linear velocity u v w and angular velocity p q r of underwater vehicle are defined in the motion coordinate system the center of gravity position x g y g z g floating center position x b y b z b according to newton s second law and euler s equation karaoglu and merdan 2014 the vector form of underwater vehicle space equation of motion is obtained as follows li et al 2012 1 m δ v δ t ω v δ ω δ t r g ω ω r g f σ i δ ω δ t ω i ω r g m δ v δ t ω r g m v t σ in general the external form of the underwater vehicle is symmetrical from left to right and from top to bottom and the moment of inertia of the underwater vehicle can be obtained as follows when the left side and the right side are perfectly symmetrical i x y i y x i y z i z y 0 when perfectly symmetrical from top to bottom i y z i z y i z x i x z 0 when the center of gravity of the underwater vehicle g does not coincide with the origin o of the dynamics system the general 6 dof spatial kinematic equation of

have propellers and rudders liljeback et al 2012 which makes the steering of water gliders completely different from that of auv rov and other powered underwater vehicles in terms of the theoretical problem of heading control underwater gliders are completely different from other underwater vehicles marsden et al 2003 me et al 2008 in order to study the heading problem of auv only the x o y law of motion in the horizontal plane can be considered however the underwater glider can only adjust the buoyancy rolling mass torque and pitch mass torque of the oil bag in the vertical direction the roll angle of the underwater glider can be changed by adjusting the roll mass torque the pitch angle of the underwater glider can be changed by adjusting the pitch mass matrix qi and liu 2020 the vertical buoyancy of the underwater glider can be changed by adjusting the amount of oil in the external oil bag only buoyancy roll moment and pitch moment can be generated directly by the underwater glider the center of gravity is controlled by a mass adjustment system inside the platform so that pitch and roll angles can be adjusted qinglai et al 2010 in combination with the buoyancy control the heading adjustment of the underwater glider is achieved thus the heading adjustment of the underwater glider is a rotational motion generated by the coupling of the internal mass adjustment system and the buoyancy control system wang et al 2008 other variables including horizontal displacement vertical displacement and yaw moment are the result of the coupled action of the kinematic system tan and wang 2013 according to the law governing the routes of water gliders xiao et al 2017 xiong 2008 it can be known x y n 0 z 0 k 0 m 0 the mathematical description of underwater glider heading adjustment is as follows 6 m u v r w q 0 m v w p u r 0 m w u q v p z i x p i z i y q r k i y q i x i z r p m i z r i y i x p q 0 a b c d e f to obtain the yaw angle acceleration both sides of equation 6 f are derived to give 7 i z r i y i x p q p q 0 according to the formulas 6 d and 6 e p 1 i x k i z i y q r q 1 i y m i x i z r p sort out formula it can be obtained 8 i z r i y i x q i x k i z i y q r i y i x p i y m i x i z p r 0 since the underwater glider has no active steering mechanism such as rudder it can only adjust the course passively by adjusting the pitch angle and rolling angle according to the real time estimates and calculations of the course the course control system can get the displacement of the glider s trim and roll mass blocks the trim angle and roll angle are generated by the gravity component produced by the mass block xu and xiao 2007 there is a serious time lag problem in the control link therefore the time delay will have a significant impact on the stability of the whole heading control system yan et al 2020 the heading control of the system with time delay adopts the state feedback control law k k p ψ τ k d ψ τ k a ψ τ m 0 ψ τ ψ t τ ψ τ ψ t τ ψ τ ψ t τ r t ψ t ψ is the heading angle by substituting this relationship into the mathematical model 8 the dynamics equation of underwater glider heading control can be obtained i z ψ t i y i x k a i x q ψ t τ i y i x k d i x q ψ t τ i y i x k p i x q ψ t τ i y i x i z i y q 2 i x i y i x i x i z p 2 i y ψ t 0 rewrite the above equation as follows 9 ψ t s 1 ψ t τ s 2 ψ t τ s 3 ψ t τ η ψ t 0 where η i x i y i

term with ψ is added to increase the order of the disturbance equation is improved to the third order the stability of heading control is introduced 2 because the control item of ψ is introduced it is equivalent to changing the value of the hydrodynamic derivative corresponding to the value of ψ furthermore by changing the control constant k p k d k a an effect equivalent to the hydrodynamic derivative value can be obtained therefore appropriately selecting k p k d k a of the control term the stability can be improved 4 the influence of delay characteristics on the equilibrium point and the existence of hopf bifurcation the stability of the equilibrium point 0 0 0 and the existence of hopf bifurcation yan et al 2020 yang 2008 are studied and discussed by considering delay variables as bifurcation parameters the characteristics of a class of nonlinear third order time delay heading control systems for underwater unmanned aerial vehicles e g gliders are analyzed yang 2012 the system is modeled for all underwater gliders yang et al 2015 10 ψ t s 1 ψ t τ s 2 ψ t τ s 3 ψ t τ η ψ t 0 let x ψ ψ ψ t x τ ψ τ ψ τ ψ τ t the state equation of the closed loop control system of the underwater glider heading be 11 x t a 1 x t a 2 x τ t y t c 1 x t c 2 x τ t where a 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 a 3 a 2 a 1 a 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 3 τ a 2 τ a 1 τ c 1 1 0 0 c 2 0 0 0 a 1 0 a 2 η a 3 0 a 1 τ s 1 a 2 τ s 2 a 3 τ s 3 the system characteristic equation be transformed into the following form 12 φ λ τ λ 3 a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 a 3 a 1 τ λ 2 exp λ τ a 2 τ λ exp λ τ a 3 τ exp λ τ this is because all characteristics of the closed loop control system depend on the distribution of the roots of the above equation in order to make the system locally stable at the equilibrium point 0 0 0 it is necessary to ensure that the characteristic roots of the characteristic equations have negative real parts in the absence of delay τ 0 the conditions for system stability can be obtained according to the routh hurwith criterion qinglai et al 2010 13 a 1 a 1 τ 0 a 1 a 1 τ a 2 a 2 τ a 3 a 3 τ 0 a 3 a 3 τ 0 by setting the heading control parameters k p k d k a the system can satisfy the conditions of equation 13 thus ensuring the local asymptotic stability of the system at the equilibrium point when the system satisfies the conditions of equation 13 the glider platform still rotates periodically under the unset conditions so the existence of limit cycles of the system should be considered therefore the conditions τ 0 under which the system generates a hopf bifurcation with time delay at the equilibrium point will be analyzed below firstly we assume that the system has a hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point that is the system has a pair of conjugate pure imaginary eigenroots wang et al 2008 λ i w w 0 which are substituted into the characteristic equation and set φ λ τ λ i w 0 we can get 14 i w 3 a 1 i w 2 a 2 i w a 3 a 1 τ i w 2 e i w τ a 2 τ i w e i w τ a 3 τ e i w τ 0 separating the real part from the imaginary part it can be obtained 15 γ w i μ w 0 where γ w a 3 a 1 w 2 a 2 τ w sin w τ a 3 τ a 1 τ w cos w τ μ w a 2 w w 3 a 2 τ w cos w τ a 3 τ a 1 τ w sin w τ let γ w 0 and η w 0 and subtract sin w τ and cos w τ to get 16 w 6 b 2 w 4 b 1 w 2 b 0 0 where b 2 a 1 2 2 a 2 b 1 a 2 2 a 2 τ 2 a 1 τ 2 2 a 1 a 3 b 0 a 3 τ 2 a 3 2 because of a 3 0 and a 3 τ 0 therefore b 0 a 3 τ 2 a 3 2 0 let b 0 a 3 τ 2 a 3 2 0 then equation 16 can be converted to 17 z 3 b 2 z 2 b 1 z b 0 0 so the characteristic equation is transformed into 18 φ z z 3 b 2 z 2 b 1 z b 0 consider the coefficient of φ z δ b 2 2 3 b 1 when δ 0 φ z is a strictly monotonically increasing function if δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 or δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 φ z 0 so φ z has no positive roots therefore under the above conditions equation 12 for any τ 0 has no pure imaginary roots in other words the system 12 is globally stable at the equilibrium point the following theorem is given theorem 1 assuming that condition ① δ 0 ② δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 ③ δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 φ z 0 any of which is satisfied then the system 12 is globally stable at the equilibrium point that is for any delay τ 0 the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable ye 2019 let s assume the coefficient in φ z 19 δ b 2 2 3 b 1 0 z δ b 2 3 0 φ z 0 that is the coefficients of the system characteristic equation do not satisfy the conditions of theorem 1 then there is at least a pair of pure imaginary roots i w 0 in the characteristic equation of the system 18 which is substituted into the following equation 20 sin w τ a 2 τ w 2 a 2 τ a 2 w 2 w 4 a 3 a 1 w 2 a 3 τ a 1 τ w a 1 a 3 τ 2 w a 2 a 2 τ a 3 τ a 2 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w 2 a 2 τ 2 w 2 a 2 τ a 2 w 2 w 4 a 2 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w cos w τ a 2 τ a 2 w 2 w 4 a 3 a 1 w 2 a 3 τ a 1 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w 2 a 2 τ 2 w 2 by numerically calculating the above equation the critical value of the lag τ k k 0 1 2 can be obtained with a minimum time delay τ 0 and the corresponding value w 0 since the solution order of eq 20 is high and there are periodic solutions the specific results can be solved by a computer program to determine whether the system will undergo hopf bifurcation it is also necessary to check whether the transverse condition is satisfied in the characteristic equation 12 of the system the derivative value τ is taken and the critical values τ 0 and w 0 are substituted into the equation 21 d λ d τ χ a χ b i γ a γ b i where χ a a 3 τ w 0 sin w 0 τ 0 a 2 τ w 0 2 cos w 0 τ 0 2 a 1 τ w 0 sin w 0 τ 0 χ b a 3 τ w 0 cos w 0 τ 0 a 2 τ w 0 2 sin w 0 τ 0 2 a 1 τ w

τ 2 a 1 τ w 0 sin w 0 τ 0 a 2 τ w 0 2 cos w 0 τ 0 a 2 3 w 0 2 a 1 τ w 0 3 sin w 0 τ 0 a 2 τ cos w 0 τ 0 1 d sgn φ ω 0 2 where d a 1 τ 2 ω 0 4 a 2 τ 2 ω 0 2 a 3 τ 2 according to equation 19 we can know φ ω 0 2 0 so it satisfies the transverse condition according to the hopf bifurcation theory zhang 2017 the following conclusions can be drawn theorem 2 assuming that condition 19 is satisfied then a the equilibrium point of the system 9 is asymptotically stable if the delay variable is τ 0 τ 0 and unstable if τ τ 0 b when the lag variables τ τ k k 0 1 2 and τ k are calculated according to eq 20 the system 9 will produce a hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point 5 analysis on the direction and stability of hopf bifurcation theorem 1 and theorem 2 give stability conditions and hopf bifurcation conditions for a class of nonlinear third order time delayed trajectory control systems for underwater unmanned vehicles this section focuses on the stability of the directional and periodic solutions of the hofp bifurcation using the poincaré regular regular form yang 2008 and the central manifold method yang et al 2015 let the delay variables τ τ 0 η η r τ 0 be the minimum time

direction of the hopf bifurcation is determined by the sign of η 2 w 2 determines the period of the bifurcation periodic solution if w 2 0 w 2 0 then the period decreases increases in addition the period of the periodic solution zhang and jiang 2020 of the nonlinear mass block regulation system can be estimated by the following equation 30 w η 2 π w 0 1 t 2 η 2 7 numerical calculation and simulation verification the physical parameters of the underwater glider platform zhou et al 2019 used in the numerical test simulation in this paper are shown in table 1 the heading control parameters of the underwater glider platform are set to k p 220 k i 2 k d 50 k a 6 according to formula 20 w 0 0 228 and τ 0 2 235s are calculated substituting the critical value into equation 22 re d λ d τ τ τ 0 λ i w 0 0 can be obtained since the crossover condition is satisfied the system will undergo hopf bifurcation in the numerical simulation the given yaw rate signal is delayed by τ 2 235s then based on the above theory the eigenvolumes ν 2 1 520 0 η 2 0 925 0 and w 2 5 966 0 from the eigenvolume it can be seen that the bifurcation period solution of the hopf generated by the system is unstable and the oscillation period becomes gradually larger and the hopf bifurcation is supercritical at this time as can be seen in fig 2 the periodic oscillation generated by the suspension system dissipates at a slower rate with time it will gradually dissipate and lose stability fig 3 shows the circular phase trajectory in the limit of the supercritical hopf bifurcation of the velocity variable in the two dimensional plane fig 4 shows the process of adjusting the rolling angle of the underwater glider from the figure it can be seen that the heading control of the underwater glider has entered an oscillation cycle the roll angle is continuously adjusted in fact the actual heading of the underwater glider has deviated from the set heading from the second setting node fig 5 shows the three dimensional motion process of the underwater glider from the figure it can be seen that although the heading control of the underwater glider enters the hopf bifurcation the depth profile motion is still controlled stably because the depth control link and heading control link of the underwater glider are separated from each other there is no coupling relationship between them fig 6 shows the latitudinal position tracking error curve of the underwater glider from the figure it can be found that the error in the latitude direction is within 500 m during the stable tracking process and the error is more than 2 5 km after the hopf divergence occurs fig 7 shows the position tracking error curves of the underwater glider in the longitude direction from the figure it can be found that the error in the longitude direction is within 100 m during the stable tracking and over 500 m after the hopf bifurcation occurs in the numerical calculations the heading control parameters of the underwater glider platform set are kept constant and remain still k p 220 k i 2 k d 50 k a 6 given the yaw rate signal delay τ 1 5s re d λ d τ τ τ 0 λ i w 0 0 and τ τ 0 can be calculated according to formulas 22 the hopf bifurcation occurs in the system itself but the equilibrium and stability conditions are satisfied thus the time history of the stable equilibrium point fig 8 a and the phase trajectory of the stable equilibrium point fig 8 b are obtained for the subcritical hopf bifurcation keeping the heading control parameters constant the given delay time of the yaw rate signal is τ 3 5s re d λ d τ τ τ 0 λ i w 0 0 and τ τ 0 can be calculated according to eq 22 because the system itself has undergone hopf bifurcation the equilibrium and stability conditions are not met therefore the subcritical hopf bifurcation instability limit cycle time course fig 8 c and the instability limit cycle phase trajectory fig 8 d are obtained 8 conclusions in this paper an underwater glider motion

20224,the underwater glider platform is equipped with a mass block adjustment system which can directly control the roll angle and pitch angle through mass block adjustment and indirectly control the heading angle through the coupling of profile motion as the underwater glider energy and space limitations drive the low power and low frequency control it will inevitably lead to the underwater

analysis hopf bifurcation time delay system wen qing zhang liang long da qin dong sun lin zhang wu hong guo 1 introduction with the development of marine science and technology at home and abroad the use of underwater gliders auvs and other underwater unmanned aerial vehicles to observe the marine environment and investigate marine resources has become a common trend xu and xiao 2007 there are great differences between underwater gliders and auvs in terms of navigation attitude adjustment in general auvs use forward or lateral thrusters for speed adjustment and rudders for heading control xiong 2008 however underwater gliders generally do not have propellers and rudders and can only control the center of gravity through the mass adjustment system inside the platform aghili 2012 thus achieving pitch and roll angle adjustment combined with buoyancy control to achieve the heading adjustment of underwater gliders bi 2010 feng yang et al 2010 therefore the heading adjustment of the underwater glider is a rotational motion generated by the coupling of the internal mass adjustment system and the buoyancy control system the heading adjustment of the underwater glider takes some time from the sensor to the controller to the actuator and the multi system coupling guo et al 2012 the presence of delay variables will have a significant impact on the motion control performance of the underwater glider and change the structural stability of the control system he et al 2013 the study of delays in control systems has been a hot topic in the control science of underwater unmanned vehicle uuv tan and wang 2013 combined with the dynamics of the point mass jia wang et al 2008 the auv is modeled as an underdriven system li jia wang et al proposed a lyapunov based tracking controller to stabilize the error dynamics and force the position error to a small neighborhood of the origin by using the backstepping method simulation results validate the proposed tracking method in bi feng yang s paper the global and uniform asymptotic stabilization problem of the resulting cascaded system is reduced to the stabilization problem of two subsystems by using a cascade method for the stabilization of the subsystem involving yaw moments a control law based on a feedback linearization method is proposed feng yang et al 2010 in the study of formation control problems with communication delays xiao zhang et al proposed a distributed formation control protocol using graph theory negative matrix analysis and lyapunov stability theory to obtain a range of eigenvalues about the control parameter matrix and to give sufficient conditions for achieving formation stability zhang and jiang 2020 for multi uavs systems in 3d environment under the condition of time delay and interference constraints danghui yan et al 2020 proposed a sliding mode formation control algorithm based on consistency and considering delay simulation results show that the proposed control algorithm is able to maintain the desired formation considering the delay and interference constraints in the formation process xun zhang introduces the design ideas of distributed control systems in network control systems ncs into the design of uuv control system structures which is the current research direction this is of great significance to the research of uuv control theory and its engineering applications my team is mainly engaged in the motion control research of underwater unmanned vehicle such as underwater glider and auv during the design and development of underwater gliders it was found that the gliders exhibit inexplicable circular motion during sea trials which excludes the interference of currents and waves this motion also occurs under extremely favorable sea conditions later by adjusting the response speed of the control mechanism the occurrence of this phenomenon was found to be highly relevant therefore in this paper an attempt is made to analyze the stability of the equilibrium point of the system and the existence of the hopf bifurcation starting from the starting point of the hopf bifurcation caused by the time delay using the delay of the system as a bifurcation parameter marsden et al 2003 2 nonlinear kinematic modeling of underwater glider in this paper the 6 dof kinematic model jia wang et al 2008 of underwater vehicle is developed by using two rectangular coordinate systems one is a fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ southeast geographic coordinate system which is fixed to the earth the other is a kinematic coordinate system g x y z each coordinate system is defined according to a right handed system as shown in fig 1 the axis e ξ is kept horizontal and the normal east is usually selected as its positive direction the axis e η is placed in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the axis e ξ and the direction due south is chosen as its positive direction the axis e ζ is placed perpendicular to the coordinate plane e ξ η and its positive direction points to the center of the earth the origin of the motion coordinate system can be selected at the center of gravity g of the underwater vehicle the origin is denoted as o in the motion coordinate system g x y z the axis o x is generally selected in the longitudinal section of the underwater vehicle pointing forward of the bow and parallel to the waterline plane the axis o y is perpendicular to the longitudinal section of the underwater vehicle pointing to the starboard side of the underwater vehicle and parallel to plane of the waterline the axis o z is in the longitudinal section of the underwater vehicle pointing towards the bottom of the underwater vehicle position vector x y z and attitude euler angle ϕ θ ψ of underwater vehicle are defined in a fixed coordinate system the linear velocity u v w and angular velocity p q r of underwater vehicle are defined in the motion coordinate system the center of gravity position x g y g z g floating center position x b y b z b according to newton s second law and euler s equation karaoglu and merdan 2014 the vector form of underwater vehicle space equation of motion is obtained as follows li et al 2012 1 m δ v δ t ω v δ ω δ t r g ω ω r g f σ i δ ω δ t ω i ω r g m δ v δ t ω r g m v t σ in general the external form of the underwater vehicle is symmetrical from left to right and from top to bottom and the moment of inertia of the underwater vehicle can be obtained as follows when the left side and the right side are perfectly symmetrical i x y i y x i y z i z y 0 when perfectly symmetrical from top to bottom i y z i z y i z x i x z 0 when the center of gravity of the underwater vehicle g does not coincide with the origin o of the dynamics system the general 6 dof spatial kinematic equation of the underwater vehicle is obtained as follows 2 m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q x m v w p u r y g r 2 p 2 z g q r p x g q p r y m w u q v p z g p 2 q 2 x g r p q y g r q p z i x p i z i y

have propellers and rudders liljeback et al 2012 which makes the steering of water gliders completely different from that of auv rov and other powered underwater vehicles in terms of the theoretical problem of heading control underwater gliders are completely different from other underwater vehicles marsden et al 2003 me et al 2008 in order to study the heading problem of auv only the x o y law of motion in the horizontal plane can be considered however the underwater glider can only adjust the buoyancy rolling mass torque and pitch mass torque of the oil bag in the vertical direction the roll angle of the underwater glider can be changed by adjusting the roll mass torque the pitch angle of the underwater glider can be changed by adjusting the pitch mass matrix qi and liu 2020 the vertical buoyancy of the underwater glider can be changed by adjusting the amount of oil in the external oil bag only buoyancy roll moment and pitch moment can be generated directly by the underwater glider the center of gravity is controlled by a mass adjustment system inside the platform so that pitch and roll angles can be adjusted qinglai et al 2010 in combination with the buoyancy control the heading adjustment of the underwater glider is achieved thus the heading adjustment of the underwater glider is a rotational motion generated by the coupling of the internal mass adjustment system and the buoyancy control system wang et al 2008 other variables including horizontal displacement vertical displacement and yaw moment are the result of the coupled action of the kinematic system tan and wang 2013 according to the law governing the routes of water gliders xiao et al 2017 xiong 2008 it can be known x y n 0 z 0 k 0 m 0 the mathematical description of underwater glider heading adjustment is as follows 6 m u v r w q 0 m v w p u r 0 m w u q v p z i x p i z i y q r k i y q i x i z r p m i z r i y i x p q 0 a b c d e f to obtain the yaw angle acceleration both sides of equation 6 f are derived to give 7 i z r i y i x p q p q 0 according to the formulas 6 d and 6 e p 1 i x k i z i y q r q 1 i y m i x i z r p sort out formula it can be obtained 8 i z r i y i x q i x k i z i y q r i y i x p i y m i x i z p r 0 since the underwater glider has no active steering mechanism such as rudder it can only adjust the course passively by adjusting the pitch angle and rolling angle according to the real time estimates and calculations of the course the course control system can get the displacement of the glider s trim and roll mass blocks the trim angle and roll angle are generated by the gravity component produced by the mass block xu and xiao 2007 there is a serious time lag problem in the control link therefore the time delay will have a significant impact on the stability of the whole heading control system yan et al 2020 the heading control of the system with time delay adopts the state feedback control law k k p ψ τ k d ψ τ k a ψ τ m 0 ψ τ ψ t τ ψ τ ψ t τ ψ τ ψ t τ r t ψ t ψ is the heading angle by substituting this relationship into the mathematical model 8 the dynamics equation of underwater glider heading control can be obtained i z ψ t i y i x k a i x q ψ t τ i y i x k d i x q ψ t τ i y i x k p i x q ψ t τ i y i x i z i y q 2 i x i y i x i x i z p 2 i y ψ t 0 rewrite the above equation as follows 9 ψ t s 1 ψ t τ s 2 ψ t τ s 3 ψ t τ η ψ t 0 where η i x i y i

term with ψ is added to increase the order of the disturbance equation is improved to the third order the stability of heading control is introduced 2 because the control item of ψ is introduced it is equivalent to changing the value of the hydrodynamic derivative corresponding to the value of ψ furthermore by changing the control constant k p k d k a an effect equivalent to the hydrodynamic derivative value can be obtained therefore appropriately selecting k p k d k a of the control term the stability can be improved 4 the influence of delay characteristics on the equilibrium point and the existence of hopf bifurcation the stability of the equilibrium point 0 0 0 and the existence of hopf bifurcation yan et al 2020 yang 2008 are studied and discussed by considering delay variables as bifurcation parameters the characteristics of a class of nonlinear third order time delay heading control systems for underwater unmanned aerial vehicles e g gliders are analyzed yang 2012 the system is modeled for all underwater gliders yang et al 2015 10 ψ t s 1 ψ t τ s 2 ψ t τ s 3 ψ t τ η ψ t 0 let x ψ ψ ψ t x τ ψ τ ψ τ ψ τ t the state equation of the closed loop control system of the underwater glider heading be 11 x t a 1 x t a 2 x τ t y t c 1 x t c 2 x τ t where a 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 a 3 a 2 a 1 a 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 3 τ a 2 τ a 1 τ c 1 1 0 0 c 2 0 0 0 a 1 0 a 2 η a 3 0 a 1 τ s 1 a 2 τ s 2 a 3 τ s 3 the system characteristic equation be transformed into the following form 12 φ λ τ λ 3 a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 a 3 a 1 τ λ 2 exp λ τ a 2 τ λ exp λ τ a 3 τ exp λ τ this is because all characteristics of the closed loop control system depend on the distribution of the roots of the above equation in order to make the system locally stable at the equilibrium point 0 0 0 it is necessary to ensure that the characteristic roots of the characteristic equations have negative real parts in the absence of delay τ 0 the conditions for system stability can be obtained according to the routh hurwith criterion qinglai et al 2010 13 a 1 a 1 τ 0 a 1 a 1 τ a 2 a 2 τ a 3 a 3 τ 0 a 3 a 3 τ 0 by setting the heading control parameters k p k d k a the system can satisfy the conditions of equation 13 thus ensuring the local asymptotic stability of the system at the equilibrium point when the system satisfies the conditions of equation 13 the glider platform still rotates periodically under the unset conditions so the existence of limit cycles of the system should be considered therefore the conditions τ 0 under which the system generates a hopf bifurcation with time delay at the equilibrium point will be analyzed below firstly we assume that the system has a hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point that is the system has a pair of conjugate pure imaginary eigenroots wang et al 2008 λ i w w 0 which are substituted into the characteristic equation and set φ λ τ λ i w 0 we can get 14 i w 3 a 1 i w 2 a 2 i w a 3 a 1 τ i w 2 e i w τ a 2 τ i w e i w τ a 3 τ e i w τ 0 separating the real part from the imaginary part it can be obtained 15 γ w i μ w 0 where γ w a 3 a 1 w 2 a 2 τ w sin w τ a 3 τ a 1 τ w cos w τ μ w a 2 w w 3 a 2 τ w cos w τ a 3 τ a 1 τ w sin w τ let γ w 0 and η w 0 and subtract sin w τ and cos w τ to get 16 w 6 b 2 w 4 b 1 w 2 b 0 0 where b 2 a 1 2 2 a 2 b 1 a 2 2 a 2 τ 2 a 1 τ 2 2 a 1 a 3 b 0 a 3 τ 2 a 3 2 because of a 3 0 and a 3 τ 0 therefore b 0 a 3 τ 2 a 3 2 0 let b 0 a 3 τ 2 a 3 2 0 then equation 16 can be converted to 17 z 3 b 2 z 2 b 1 z b 0 0 so the characteristic equation is transformed into 18 φ z z 3 b 2 z 2 b 1 z b 0 consider the coefficient of φ z δ b 2 2 3 b 1 when δ 0 φ z is a strictly monotonically increasing function if δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 or δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 φ z 0 so φ z has no positive roots therefore under the above conditions equation 12 for any τ 0 has no pure imaginary roots in other words the system 12 is globally stable at the equilibrium point the following theorem is given theorem 1 assuming that condition ① δ 0 ② δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 ③ δ 0 z δ b 2 3 0 φ z 0 any of which is satisfied then the system 12 is globally stable at the equilibrium point that is for any delay τ 0 the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable ye 2019 let s assume the coefficient in φ z 19 δ b 2 2 3 b 1 0 z δ b 2 3 0 φ z 0 that is the coefficients of the system characteristic equation do not satisfy the conditions of theorem 1 then there is at least a pair of pure imaginary roots i w 0 in the characteristic equation of the system 18 which is substituted into the following equation 20 sin w τ a 2 τ w 2 a 2 τ a 2 w 2 w 4 a 3 a 1 w 2 a 3 τ a 1 τ w a 1 a 3 τ 2 w a 2 a 2 τ a 3 τ a 2 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w 2 a 2 τ 2 w 2 a 2 τ a 2 w 2 w 4 a 2 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w cos w τ a 2 τ a 2 w 2 w 4 a 3 a 1 w 2 a 3 τ a 1 τ w a 3 τ a 1 τ w 2 a 2 τ 2 w 2 by numerically calculating the above equation the critical value of the lag τ k k 0 1 2 can be obtained with a minimum time delay τ 0 and the corresponding value w 0 since the solution order of eq 20 is high and there are periodic solutions the specific results can be solved by a computer program to determine whether the system will undergo hopf bifurcation it is also necessary to check whether the transverse condition is satisfied in the characteristic equation 12 of the system the derivative value τ is taken and the critical values τ 0 and w 0 are substituted into the equation 21 d λ d τ χ a χ b i γ a γ b i where χ a a 3 τ w 0 sin w 0 τ 0 a 2 τ w 0 2 cos w 0 τ 0 2 a 1 τ w 0 sin w 0 τ 0 χ b a 3 τ w 0 cos w 0 τ 0 a 2 τ w 0 2 sin w 0 τ 0 2 a 1 τ w

φ ω 0 2 0 so it satisfies the transverse condition according to the hopf bifurcation theory zhang 2017 the following conclusions can be drawn theorem 2 assuming that condition 19 is satisfied then a the equilibrium point of the system 9 is asymptotically stable if the delay variable is τ 0 τ 0 and unstable if τ τ 0 b when the lag variables τ τ k k 0 1 2 and τ k are calculated according to eq 20 the system 9 will produce a hopf bifurcation at the equilibrium point 5 analysis on the direction and stability of hopf bifurcation theorem 1 and theorem 2 give stability conditions and hopf bifurcation conditions for a class of nonlinear third order time delayed trajectory control systems for underwater unmanned vehicles this section focuses on the stability of the directional and periodic solutions of the hofp bifurcation using the poincaré regular regular form yang 2008 and the central manifold method yang et al 2015 let the delay variables τ τ 0 η η r τ 0 be the minimum time

characteristic quantity η 2 of the bifurcation direction guo et al 2012 and the characteristic quantity w 2 of the periodic variation requires obtaining the coefficients μ 1 0 after converting the

τ 0 based on the above calculation process the conclusion of theorem 3 can be got which is as follows theorem 3 in equation 29 if v 2 0 v 2 0 then the periodic solution of the system bifurcation is stable unstable that is the stability of the periodic solution is determined by the sign of v 2 if η 2 0 η 2 0 then the hopf bifurcation of the system is subcritical supercritical that is the direction of the hopf bifurcation is determined by the sign of η 2 w 2 determines the period of the bifurcation periodic solution if w 2 0 w 2 0 then the period decreases increases in addition the period of the periodic solution zhang and jiang 2020 of the nonlinear mass block regulation system can be estimated by the following equation 30 w η 2 π w 0 1 t 2 η 2 7 numerical calculation and simulation verification the physical parameters of the underwater glider platform zhou et al 2019 used in the numerical test simulation in this paper are shown in table 1 the heading control parameters of the underwater glider platform are set to k p 220 k i 2 k d 50 k a 6 according to formula 20 w 0 0 228 and τ 0 2 235s are calculated substituting the critical value into equation 22 re d λ d τ τ τ 0 λ i w 0 0 can be obtained since the crossover condition is satisfied the system will undergo hopf bifurcation in the numerical simulation the given yaw rate signal is delayed by τ 2 235s then based on the above theory the eigenvolumes ν 2 1 520 0 η 2 0 925 0 and w 2 5 966 0 from the eigenvolume it can be seen that the bifurcation period solution of the hopf generated by the system is unstable and the oscillation period becomes gradually larger and the hopf bifurcation is supercritical at this time as can be seen in fig 2 the periodic oscillation generated by the suspension system dissipates at a slower rate with time it will gradually dissipate and lose stability fig 3 shows the circular phase trajectory in the limit of the supercritical hopf bifurcation of the velocity variable in the two dimensional plane fig 4 shows the process of adjusting the rolling angle of the underwater glider from the figure it can be seen that the heading control of the underwater glider has entered an oscillation cycle the roll angle is continuously adjusted in fact the actual heading of the underwater glider has deviated from the set heading from the second setting node fig 5 shows the three dimensional motion process of the underwater glider from the figure it can be seen that although the heading control of the underwater glider enters the hopf bifurcation the depth profile motion is still controlled stably because the depth control link and heading control link of the underwater glider are separated from each other there is no coupling relationship between them fig 6 shows the latitudinal position tracking error curve of the underwater glider from the figure it can be found that the error in the latitude direction is within 500 m during the stable tracking process and the error is more than 2 5 km after the hopf divergence occurs fig 7 shows the position tracking error curves of the underwater glider in the longitude direction from the figure it can be found that the error in the longitude direction is within 100 m during the stable tracking and over 500 m after the hopf bifurcation occurs in the numerical calculations the heading control parameters of the underwater glider platform set are kept constant and remain still k p 220 k i 2 k d 50 k a 6 given the yaw rate signal delay τ 1 5s re d λ d τ τ τ 0 λ i w 0 0 and τ τ 0 can be calculated according to formulas 22 the hopf bifurcation occurs in the system itself but the equilibrium and stability conditions are satisfied thus the time history of the stable equilibrium point fig 8 a and the phase trajectory of the stable equilibrium point fig 8 b are obtained for the subcritical hopf bifurcation keeping the heading control parameters constant the given delay time of the yaw rate signal is τ 3 5s re d λ d τ τ τ 0 λ i w 0 0 and τ τ 0 can be calculated according to eq 22 because the system itself has undergone hopf bifurcation the equilibrium and stability conditions are not met therefore the subcritical hopf bifurcation instability limit cycle time course fig 8 c and the instability limit cycle phase trajectory fig 8 d are obtained 8 conclusions in this paper an underwater glider motion model with a mass control system with time delayed nonlinear parameters is studied and extended to a class of nonlinear stability problems with time delayed parameters first the vector form of the spatial equations of motion of the underwater unmanned vehicles is established using newton s second law and euler s equation and the classical pid algorithm is used to feed the heading state
