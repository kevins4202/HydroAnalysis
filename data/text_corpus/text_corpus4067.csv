20335,to develop an optimum design concept for the submerged floating tunnel sft many studies have evaluated the dynamic behavioral characteristics of submerged structures under various design loads and it has been concluded that rational mooring systems should be applied to very large and long submerged structures for use as transportation facilities for this purpose the concept of sfts moored by laterally inclined tethers anchored to the seabed has been mainly studied however the issue of erecting many tethers with individual seabed anchors or piles should be solved for the mooring systems this study aims to investigate the feasibility of the sfts moored by inclined tethers attached to fixed towers the new concept of sfts which fundamentally originated from cable stayed bridges was proposed for reducing burden of construction of individual seabed piles for each tether in this study behavioral characteristics of the sft under the regular and irregular waves were investigated by performing hydrodynamic analysis in time domain for suggesting feasible and acceptable concepts for the transportation facilities the effects of various geometric design parameters such as the draft sectional characteristics of the tunnel stiffness of the tethers and inclination of the fixed tower legs on the structural behaviors have been evaluated keywords submerged floating tunnel hydrodynamics global performance analysis mooring tethers waves 1 introduction although the conventional structures for oversea transportation facilities including bridges underwater tunnels and immersed tunnels have shown their structural safety and reliability there are significant limitations in constructing them in ocean environments for example the superstructure of the bridges should be supported by high rise columns in the deepwater ocean environments and it is absolutely difficult to design and construct the high rise columns due to structural stability issues construction methods and costs in addition the cost and construction period are extra burdens the concept of a submerged floating tunnel sft has been developed to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional oversea transportation facilities østlid 2010 npra 2011 fig 1 shows the sft models that consist of the submerged tunnel and mooring systems fundamentally the structural concept was developed based on the archimedes principle npra 2011 martire 2010 the concepts of sfts can be classified based on the relation between the weight and the buoyancy when the buoyancy is larger than weight of the system the tethers anchored to the seabed or any other fixed objects resist the uplift force formed due to the difference between the vertical forces in contrast when the weight of the system is larger than the buoyancy settlement of the tunnel should be resisted by the pontoons that have sufficient volume to provide the required buoyancy the long span transportation facilities require a continuous mooring system hence tethers anchored to fixed points and pontoons are needed for each sft concept comparing the concepts construction of tethers anchored to the seabed might be a burden because it needs several difficult construction stages including construction of seabed piles connection between piles and tethers and connection between tethers and the floating tunnel although the concept of pontoon stabilized submerged floating tunnel seems to be economically effective because there are no tethers that require anchoring it is difficult to maintain the lateral position of the tunnel when subjected to wave and current loadings this indicates that the first concept is structurally rational because the offshore structures are always subjected to waves and currents many studies have been conducted to investigate dynamic behavior of the sfts structural behavioral characteristics of the sfts under various environmental loadings such as waves currents seismic activities and tsunamis have been conducted by performing experiments and numerical simulations based on the theory of hydrodynamics kunisu et al 1994 remseth et al 1999 pilato et al 2008 hong and ge 2010 jakobsen 2010 kunisu 2010 lu et al 2010 dong et al 2012 korea institute of ocean science and technology kiost conducted 1 100 scaled model tests of a simple submerged tunnel moored by vertical and inclined tethers anchored to the seabed under the regular waves oh et al 2013 cifuentes et al 2015 suggested the rational hydrodynamic analysis method using morison elements to model the tunnel and tethers using the suggested numerical methods they analyzed the motion of kiost s sft model under the same wave conditions by comparing the results they validated the suggested analysis method most of the earlier works have focused on studying the sfts moored by tethers anchored to the seabed under various environmental loading conditions jin and kim 2018 studied the rational method of hydro elastic analysis of the sft subjected to extreme wave and seismic excitations in time domain lin et al 2018 suggested dynamic response analysis of sfts due to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction lee t al 2016 investigated the seismic behaviors of sfts considering the effects of seawater upon the seismic behaviors xiang et al 2018 studied the behavioral characteristics of an sft whose tether was broken thus evaluating the damaged conditions of the sft won et al 2021 studied the torsional behavior of the joints of the submerged floating tunnel segments by experiment and analysis to develop an optimum design concept of the sft the dynamic behavioral characteristics of the submerged structures under various governing design load cases have been studied by several researchers and institutes and it has been concluded that the rational mooring system should be applied to the very large and long submerged structures that could be used as the transportation facility for this purpose the concept of sfts moored by laterally inclined tethers anchored to seabed has been mainly studied and the concept show very good global performance however the issue of erecting many tethers with individual seabed anchors or piles should be solved for such mooring systems kiost suggested the new type of sft concept which is based on the fundamental concept of cable stayed bridges fig 2 the most significant difference between the new design and the conventional sfts is the anchoring methodology for tethers the mooring system of the conventional sft is similar to that of tlp tension leg platform so every tether of the conventional sft is anchored to the seabed by independent piles such as suction piles in many kinds of research the span length distance between the tethers in a longitudinal direction of the sft has been assumed 20 0 50 0 m so the conventional design of very long length sfts requires numerous independent pile construction before tether anchoring and tether submerged tunnel connection construction as shown in fig 2 the tethers that resist the uplift of the submerged tunnel are attached to the fixed column and not to the seabed as the tethers do not need to be directly anchored to the seabed seabed pile construction is not required it is the most significant advantage of the newly suggested sft concept won and kim 2018 studied the feasibility of the conceptual model under wave conditions although the tunnel of the concept might have difficulties of vertical and lateral stiffness induced by the longitudinally inclined tethers it was concluded that the structure could be applied to mild environments with suitable span length and section designs they could not suggest the design strategy for the new type sft concept design in severe conditions in detail this study aims to investigate the dynamic behavioral characteristics of the sfts moored by inclined tethers attached to fixed towers under the regular and irregular waves the analytical studies were conducted by performing hydrodynamic analysis in time domain using orcaflex orcina 2018 one of the most widely used commercial code for offshore dynamics in addition the effects of various geometric design parameters such as the draft sectional characteristics of the tunnel stiffness of the tethers and inclination of the fixed tower legs on the structural behaviors have been extensively studied to suggest feasible and acceptable concepts for the transportation facility in severe environmental conditions based on the extensive parametric study the design strategies to overcome of the weakness of the sft model were suggested in detail 2 theoretical background and simulation strategy 2 1 equation of motion of the submerged rods the main structural components of the sfts could be modelled as submerged slender rods shown in fig 3 therefore hydrodynamic analysis of the floating tunnel tethers and towers could be conducted based on the equation of motion of submerged slender rods presented by garrett 1982 as given below 1 e i r λ r q m r 2 λ t e i k 2 3 1 2 r r 1 t a i e λ a i e where r s t position vector of the rod s arc length parameter t time ei bending stiffness t tensile force k

the material and geometric properties of the rods can be directly considered also the forces induced by the environmental loadings including that of waves and currents could be applied as the distributed force components in the equation the distributed forces induced by waves and currents can be determined by morison equation so the total distributed force can be summarized as follows 4 q

directly obtain the structural responses to the environmental loadings in time domain for the conventional large floating structures the time domain analysis could be performed with various frequency dependent parameters to numerically consider the structural characteristics of the floating body in offshore fields including added mass coefficients radiation damping and wave forces it means that frequency domain analysis to obtain the required parameters for the floater should be performed before conducting the time domain analysis after obtaining all the required frequency dependent parameters of the floater the fully coupled floater tether hydrodynamic analysis could be performed but according to a previous study conducted by cristian et al 2015 a time domain simulation of the sfts moored by tethers could be directly performed without pre calculation of the frequency dependent parameters because all the main structural components of the sfts could be simply modelled as the submerged cylinder members using the morison equation to confirm that the analytical results obtained by the two different simulation strategies shown in fig 4 are directly compared to the experimental result oh et al 2013 performed by kiost in 2011 for the validation work the simple sft with tethers was simulated the shape and properties of the sft with experimental conditions are presented in fig 5 and table 1 oh et al conducted the experiments of 1 100 scaled model under the scaled wave condition then they plotted all the results for the prototype model on a real scale therefore the simulation was conducted for the real scaled condition shown in table 1 for comparison in the experiment a 1 2 mm diameter steel wire was used for tethers therefore the tethers were not failed under all the examined wave conditions during the experiment but in the real scaled condition the tethers could be failed due to quite large tension in the simulation for validation work material yield and failure were not considered because the object of this comparison is for verifying the analysis methodologies for the fully coupled analysis strategy 1 frequency domain analysis for the floating tunnel and time domain analysis for the coupled sft model were conducted using ansys aqwa ansys 2017 one of the mostly used commercial finite element analysis fea code also orcaflex one of the mostly used hydrodynamic simulation code was used to perform the direct hydrodynamic analysis using morison members strategy 2 the panel model was used to perform frequency domain analysis for calculating the added mass radiation damping 1st and 2nd order wave forces and hydrostatic stiffness fig 6 a beam elements were used to model the tethers for the time domain analysis using orcaflex a tunnel and four tethers were modelled using the beam elements for the direct hydrodynamic analysis fig 7 the morison equation was applied to calculate the wave induced forces the structural responses of the examined sft could be obtained by either of the two methodologies fig 8 the maximum and minimum responses of the tunnel motion and tether tension obtained by the simulations were compared to those obtained from the experiments as shown in fig 9 both the simulation strategies could be rationally used to obtain the structural responses under the waves based on the validation results strategy 2 is mainly used as the simulation method in this study for considering the stiffness of the tunnel itself 3 dynamic behavior of the sfts moored by inclined tethers attached to the fixed towers 3 1 analysis model fig 10 shows the general configuration of the new type of sft investigated in this study the general concept originated from the concept of cable stayed bridges the superstructure of the cable stayed bridge subjected to the downward loads is supported by the stay cables that were attached to the fixed tower similarly the floating tunnel of the sft subjected to the upward loads estimated by buoyancy minus weight is supported by the inclined tethers that were attached to the submerged fixed tower in addition the horizontal motion of the floating tunnel is resisted by the inclined tethers as well as its own bending stiffness in this study we investigated the dynamic behavioral characteristics of the sfts under various wave conditions table 1 presents the properties of the base model used in this study from the base model various parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of various design parameters on the structural performance of the sfts table 2 gives the geometric and material properties of the base model and the environmental conditions considered in this study are given in table 3 the weight of the tunnel was calculated by considering the weights of concrete outer and inner walls 169 02 tonf m and 112 27 tonf m respectively secondary non structural members 5 of weights of concrete walls and ballast water a buoyancy weight ratio bwr of the examined tunnel was planned as 1 2 by controlling the weight of the ballast water in this study the weights of running cars and trains were not included in this study the dynamic responses of the sft under the various regular and irregular wave conditions were analyzed to examine the most severe condition the wave direction was determined as the perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the sft wave spreading was not considered it is well known that the morison equation can be used to calculate hydrodynamic loads acting on submerged members whose diameter to wavelength ratios are less than 1 5 xu et al 2019 therefore the range of the regular wave period examined in this study was assumed considering the proper diameter to wavelength ratio for following direct hydrodynamic analysis using only the morison members the irregular wave was modelled by jonswap wave spectrum the significant wave height and peak period of the examined irregular wave are assumed based on the environmental condition of the south sea of south korea the details of the irregular wave model are presented in section 3 4 the sft consists of the submerged and floating tunnels tethers and towers fig 10 fig 11 shows the numerical model of the examined sft using orcaflex for the hydrodynamic analysis all the structural components were modelled by the beam elements using the morison equation to continuously calculate the wave induced forces in time domain the connections between a tunnel and tethers a tower and tethers and a tunnel and towers are pinned connections the bottoms of the tower legs are fixed to the seabed the right and left ends of the tunnel are fixed for the vertical displacement and bending to consider the behavior of the continuous tunnel 3 2 free vibration analysis fig 12 shows the free vibration modes of the sft obtained by eigenvalue analysis based on the result natural periods and mode shapes of the model were investigated the natural periods and free vibration mode shapes could be controlled by the stiffness of the structures as well as the mass as the tunnel is supported by tethers the stiffness of the system could be controlled by the tethers as well as the bending stiffness of the floating tunnel 3 3 dynamic responses under regular waves figs 13 and 14 show the motion of the sft and tension of the tethers under various regular waves in the time domain analysis the results clearly show that the structural responses are directly induced by the applied waves both the amplitude and period of the applied wave affect the amplitude and the period of the response also there is a phase between the applied wave and the structural responses the phase lag between the sway and heave response is as below 6 p h a s e l a g s t 4 where t wave period fig 15 presents the maximum values of motion of the sft and tensile force of the tether under the various regular waves as shown in the figure the sway response increases when the wave period increases because the natural period of the free vibration in a lateral direction is longer than the examined wave periods as shown in fig 12 but the tendency of the maximum values of the heave motion differs based on the fundamental theories of structural dynamics it can be expected that the amplitude of the response increases when a wave whose period is closer to the natural period of the structure is applied according to free vibration analysis the natural period of the structure in the vertical direction was 8 73 s therefore the maximum values of the heave motion decrease although the wave period increases further beyond the natural period the same tendency was observed in the maximum tether tension results 3 4 dynamic responses under irregular waves the offshore floating structures are subjected to the irregular waves therefore the dynamic responses of the sft models under the severe irregular wave conditions were investigated for a practical study in this study significant wave height h s and peak period t p of the irregular wave were selected considering the 100 year return period environmental condition of the specific korean ocean region the irregular wave whose significant wave height and peak period are 10 85 m and 14 37 s was modelled by jonswap wave spectrum using eq 7 det norske veritas 2010 fig 16 shows the generated irregular wave

energy density to the maximum of the corresponding pierson moskowitz spectrum f wave frequency f m 1 t p t p peak period and h s significant wave height given by 1 π 2 α 5 γ 30 g f m 2 fig 17 exhibits the tunnel motions measured at the center of the floating tunnel under the irregular wave as shown in the figure the irregular motion is induced by the characteristics of the applied wave model according to the result the maximum lateral and vertical displacements of the floating tunnel under the harsh wave condition were 8 35 m and 3 68 m respectively this is absolutely unacceptable considering the serviceability as the transportation facility as well as for the structural safety therefore the design parameters should be revised to mitigate the structural response under the design wave condition 4 effect of various design parameters on the structural responses of the sfts under the severe wave condition 4 1 effect of the draft of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts the wave induced motion of the water particle is related to the perpendicular distance between location of the particle and the free surface hence the wave forces could be reduced as the submerged structure is far from the free surface based on the fundamental idea the effect of the draft of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts under the irregular wave was analytically investigated for the case study the sft models whose drafts are 50 0 m 75 0 m and 100 0 m were simulated under the same irregular wave figs 18 and 19 show the motion of the tunnels and tension of the tethers with the different drafts the analytical results clearly show that the dynamic responses are effectively reduced when deep draft design is applied for the submerged tunnel however the hydrostatic pressure applied to the tunnel was not taken into account it means that the tunnel wall design should be carefully conducted considering the induced stress due to the applied hydrostatic pressure when attempting the deep draft design due to the increase in hydrostatic pressure there is limitation in the draft of the tunnel as well as the geometric design of the transportation facility 4 2 effect of the tether stiffness on the dynamic responses of the sfts axial stiffness of the tethers is one of the components that mainly influence the structural system in this study various tether types were examined for the sft system table 4 shows the properties of the examined tethers the properties of the tunnel are the same as those shown in table 2 and the draft is 100 0 m as shown in figs 20 and 21 motion of the floating tunnel could be mitigated by applying high stiffness tethers the analytical results show that the fluctuating range of the motion as well as the maximum value were successively reduced as a high stiffness tether is designed hence the design strategy is effective for mitigating the fatigue damage as well figs 22 and 23 shows the maximum and minimum tether tensions with different tether designs the results from the analysis show that the structural safety criteria could be satisfied when the steel tube which has wall thickness larger than 0 06 m is used while all the examined stay cables could be acceptable due to high ultimate strength 4 3 effect of the outer diameter of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts mitigation of the wave induced forces is one of the methods that could mitigate the dynamic responses as well as enhance the structural stiffness as shown in eq 4 the wave induced forces depends on the size of the section of the tunnel as well as other parameters such as added mass and drag coefficients therefore the effect of the outer diameter of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts was investigated in this study table 5 shows the range of the considered outer diameter of the tunnel with associated bending stiffness axial stiffness and mass per unit length of the parametric study for this analytical study the steel tube type tether whose outer diameter and wall thickness are respectively 0 533 m and 0 040 m was applied and the bwr of the tunnel is 1 2 also the draft of the tunnel is 100 0 m in this case study figs 24 25 and 26 clearly indicate that the dynamic responses could be effectively reduced when a smaller outer diameter is applied for the tunnel section because of the mitigation of wave induced forces as the wave induced force is reduced the fluctuating range of motion of the tunnel is reduced although the axial and bending stiffness of the tunnel are reduced in addition the tensile force and stress at the section of the tethers are also reduced due to reduction of motion of the tunnel the maximum stress level as well as the fluctuation range of the stress could also be reduced therefore fatigue performance of the tethers could be dramatically enhanced by downsizing the tunnel section consequently downsizing of the tunnel section is one of the solutions to mitigate the dynamic responses of the structure however the size of the tunnel is directly related to the traffic capacity therefore a dual tunnel system consisting of two parallel tunnels might be considered to use in the case of small sized tunnel for response mitigation 4 4 effect of leg inclination on the dynamic responses of the sfts the inclination of the tower legs is related to the lateral and vertical components of the axial stiffness of the tethers a parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of the leg inclination on the dynamic responses of the sfts table 6 presents the properties of the sft models used to investigate the effect of inclination of the tower legs the dynamic responses of the sfts with different inclinations of the tower leg from 0 0 to 60 0 were calculated and compared the draft of the tunnel is 100 0 m also the irregular wave model is the same as that considered in the previous sections fig 27 shows the motion of the tunnel at different inclinations of tower legs in the time domain the response is sensitively affected by the parameter the analytical results fig 28 show that the swaying motion of the tunnel increases as inclination increases from 0 0 to 30 0 while heaving motion of the tunnel increases when inclination increases from 0 0 to 10 0 after reaching the maximum values the sway and heave responses are reduced as the inclination increases applying a larger inclination the lateral stiffness induced by the tether stiffness might be increased thus reducing both the lateral motion and the resulting vertical motion meanwhile vertical stiffness induced by tether stiffness is reduced as a larger inclination is applied in addition the levels of initial and dynamic tensile forces could be increased due to increase in inclination of the tethers therefore negative tension might be applied due to the increased dynamic portion of tension consequently there are advantages and disadvantages due to the inclination of the tower legs according to the analytical results vertically straight type is suitable to reduce the motion under the waves if the engineer wants to control the responses using an inclined tower leg design inclination should be larger than 60 0 however it is not recommended from the economic point of view 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the dynamic behavioral characteristics of the sft moored by inclined tethers attached to fixed towers and case studies were conducted to find ways to reduce the structural responses to harsh environmental conditions based on the numerical simulation results we present the following important dynamic characteristics owing to the structural characteristics the examined sft might show unacceptable structural performance under a harsh wave load although the newly suggested concept of the sft could reduce the burden of the seabed anchor or pile construction its structural performance should be improved for it to be used as a transportation facility to find the design strategy case studies were conducted in this study effects of the main design parameters including draft tether stiffness size of the tunnel section and inclination of the tower legs on the dynamic behaviors were analytically investigated the application of deep draft and high stiffness tethers are effective methods to reduce the dynamic responses of the tunnel using the deep draft design the wave forces could be exponentially reduced also the high stiffness tethers will induce high stiffness to the tunnel as well as cause changes in the natural frequency of the tunnel however there are limitations in applying these methods from the increasing static water pressure issue fabrication and construction point of views when a small size tunnel is designed the motion of the sft reduced significantly because the wave induced forces were effectively reduced therefore the dual tube type sft could be one of the alternative concepts for very harsh environment this study clearly shows that there are advantages and disadvantages in using inclined tower legs the motion of the tunnel with inclined tower legs was smaller compared with tunnel with vertical tower legs especially when the inclination is larger than 60 0 however it is economically impractical as shown in this study there are various design factors that influence the structural performance of the sfts therefore the engineer should carefully combine the design strategies to reduce the structural response especially under harsh environmental conditions credit authorship

frequency domain analysis to obtain the required parameters for the floater should be performed before conducting the time domain analysis after obtaining all the required frequency dependent parameters of the floater the fully coupled floater tether hydrodynamic analysis could be performed but according to a previous study conducted by cristian et al 2015 a time domain simulation of the sfts moored by tethers could be directly performed without pre calculation of the frequency dependent parameters because all the main structural components of the sfts could be simply modelled as the submerged cylinder members using the morison equation to confirm that the analytical results obtained by the two different simulation strategies shown in fig 4 are directly compared to the experimental result oh et al 2013 performed by kiost in 2011 for the validation work the simple sft with tethers was simulated the shape and properties of the sft with experimental conditions are presented in fig 5 and table 1 oh et al conducted the experiments of 1 100 scaled model under the scaled wave condition then they plotted all the results for the prototype model on a real scale therefore the simulation was conducted for the real scaled condition shown in table 1 for comparison in the experiment a 1 2 mm diameter steel wire was used for tethers therefore the tethers were not failed under all the examined wave conditions during the experiment but in the real scaled condition the tethers could be failed due to quite large tension in the simulation for validation work material yield and failure were not considered because the object of this comparison is for verifying the analysis methodologies for the fully coupled analysis strategy 1 frequency domain analysis for the floating tunnel and time domain analysis for the coupled sft model were conducted using ansys aqwa ansys 2017 one of the mostly used commercial finite element analysis fea code also orcaflex one of the mostly used hydrodynamic simulation code was used to perform the direct hydrodynamic analysis using morison members strategy 2 the panel model was used to perform frequency domain analysis for calculating the added mass radiation damping 1st and 2nd order wave forces and hydrostatic stiffness fig 6 a beam elements were used to model the tethers for the time domain analysis using orcaflex a tunnel and four tethers were modelled using the beam elements for the direct hydrodynamic analysis fig 7 the morison equation was applied to calculate the wave induced forces the structural responses of the examined sft could be obtained by either of the two methodologies fig 8 the maximum and minimum responses of the tunnel motion and tether tension obtained by the simulations were compared to those obtained from the experiments as shown in fig 9 both the simulation strategies could be rationally used to obtain the structural responses under the waves based on the validation results strategy 2 is mainly used as the simulation method in this study for considering the stiffness of the tunnel itself 3 dynamic behavior of the sfts moored by inclined tethers attached to the fixed towers 3 1 analysis model fig 10 shows the general configuration of the new type of sft investigated in this study the general concept originated from the concept of cable stayed bridges the superstructure of the cable stayed bridge subjected to the downward loads is supported by the stay cables that were attached to the fixed tower similarly the floating tunnel of the sft subjected to the upward loads estimated by buoyancy minus weight is supported by the inclined tethers that were attached to the submerged fixed tower in addition the horizontal motion of the floating tunnel is resisted by the inclined tethers as well as its own bending stiffness in this study we investigated the dynamic behavioral characteristics of the sfts under various wave conditions table 1 presents the properties of the base model used in this study from the base model various parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of various design parameters on the structural performance of the sfts table 2 gives the geometric and material properties of the base model and the environmental conditions considered in this study are given in table 3 the weight of the tunnel was calculated by considering the weights of concrete outer and inner walls 169 02 tonf m and 112 27 tonf m respectively secondary non structural members 5 of weights of concrete walls and ballast water a buoyancy weight ratio bwr of the examined tunnel was planned as 1 2 by controlling the weight of the ballast water in this study the weights of running cars and trains were not included in this study the dynamic responses of the sft under the various regular and irregular wave conditions were analyzed to examine the most severe condition the wave direction was determined as the perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the sft wave spreading was not considered it is well known that the morison equation can be used to calculate hydrodynamic loads acting on submerged members whose diameter to wavelength ratios are less than 1 5 xu et al 2019 therefore the range of the regular wave period examined in this study was assumed considering the proper diameter to wavelength ratio for following direct hydrodynamic analysis using only the morison members the irregular wave was modelled by jonswap wave spectrum the significant wave height and peak period of the examined irregular wave are assumed based on the environmental condition of the south sea of south korea the details of the irregular wave model are presented in section 3 4 the sft consists of the submerged and floating tunnels tethers and towers fig 10 fig 11 shows the numerical model of the examined sft using orcaflex for the hydrodynamic analysis all the structural components were modelled by the beam elements using the morison equation to continuously calculate the wave induced forces in time domain the connections between a tunnel and tethers a tower and tethers and a tunnel and towers are pinned connections the bottoms of the tower legs are fixed to the seabed the right and left ends of the tunnel are fixed for the vertical displacement and bending to consider the behavior of the continuous tunnel 3 2 free vibration analysis fig 12 shows the free vibration modes of the sft obtained by eigenvalue analysis based on the result natural periods and mode shapes of the model were investigated the natural periods and free vibration mode shapes could be controlled by the stiffness of the structures as well as the mass as the tunnel is supported by tethers the stiffness of the system could be controlled by the tethers as well as the bending stiffness of the floating tunnel 3 3 dynamic responses under regular waves figs 13 and 14 show the motion of the sft and tension of the tethers under various regular waves in the time domain analysis the results clearly show that the structural responses are directly induced by the applied waves both the amplitude and period of the applied wave affect the amplitude and the period of the response also there is a phase between the applied wave and the structural responses the phase lag between the sway and heave response is as below 6 p h a s e l a g s t 4 where t wave period fig 15 presents the maximum values of motion of the sft and tensile force of the tether under the various regular waves as shown in the figure the sway response increases when the wave period increases because the natural period of the free vibration in a lateral direction is longer than the examined wave periods as shown in fig 12 but the tendency of the maximum values of the heave motion differs based on the fundamental theories of structural dynamics it can be expected that the amplitude of the response increases when a wave whose period is closer to the natural period of the structure is applied according to free vibration analysis the natural period of the structure in the vertical direction was 8 73 s therefore the maximum values of the heave motion decrease although the wave period increases further beyond the natural period the same tendency was observed in the maximum tether tension results 3 4 dynamic responses under irregular waves the offshore floating structures are subjected to the irregular waves therefore the dynamic responses of the sft models under the severe irregular wave conditions were investigated for a practical study in this study significant wave height h s and peak period t p of the irregular wave were selected considering the 100 year return period environmental condition of the specific korean ocean region the irregular wave whose significant wave height and peak period are 10 85 m and 14 37 s was modelled by jonswap wave spectrum using eq 7 det norske veritas 2010 fig 16 shows the generated irregular wave 7 s f α g 2 16 π 4 f 5 e 5 4 f f m 4 γ b where α spectral energy parameter b e 1 2 σ 2 f f m 1 2 σ σ 1 f o r f f m σ 2 f o r f f m γ peak shape parameter to represent the ratio of the maximum spectral energy density to the maximum of the corresponding pierson moskowitz spectrum f wave frequency f m 1 t p t p peak period and h s significant wave height given by 1 π 2 α 5 γ 30 g f m 2 fig 17 exhibits the tunnel motions measured at the center of the floating tunnel under the irregular wave as shown in the figure the irregular motion is induced by the characteristics of the applied wave model according to the result the maximum lateral and vertical displacements of the floating tunnel under the harsh wave condition were 8 35 m and 3 68 m respectively this is absolutely unacceptable considering the serviceability as the transportation facility as well as for the structural safety therefore the design parameters should be revised to mitigate the structural response under the design wave condition 4 effect of various design parameters on the structural responses of the sfts under the severe wave condition 4 1 effect of the draft of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts the wave induced motion of the water particle is related to the perpendicular distance between location of the particle and the free surface hence the wave forces could be reduced as the submerged structure is far from the free surface based on the fundamental idea the effect of the draft of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts under the irregular wave was analytically investigated for the case study the sft models whose drafts are 50 0 m 75 0 m and 100 0 m were simulated under the same irregular wave figs 18 and 19 show the motion of the tunnels and tension of the tethers with the different drafts the analytical results clearly show that the dynamic responses are effectively reduced when deep draft design is applied for the submerged tunnel however the hydrostatic pressure applied to the tunnel was not taken into account it means that the tunnel wall design should be carefully conducted considering the induced stress due to the applied hydrostatic pressure when attempting the deep draft design due to the increase in hydrostatic pressure there is limitation in the draft of the tunnel as well as the geometric design of the transportation facility 4 2 effect of the tether stiffness on the dynamic responses of the sfts axial stiffness of the tethers is one of the components that mainly influence the structural system in this study various tether types were examined for the sft system table 4 shows the properties of the examined tethers the properties of the tunnel are the same as those shown in table 2 and the draft is 100 0 m as shown in figs 20 and 21 motion of the floating tunnel could be mitigated by applying high stiffness tethers the analytical results show that the fluctuating range of the motion as well as the maximum value were successively reduced as a high stiffness tether is designed hence the design strategy is effective for mitigating the fatigue damage as well figs 22 and 23 shows the maximum and minimum tether tensions with different tether designs the results from the analysis show that the structural safety criteria could be satisfied when the steel tube which has wall thickness larger than 0 06 m is used while all the examined stay cables could be acceptable due to high ultimate strength 4 3 effect of the outer diameter of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts mitigation of the wave induced forces is one of the methods that could mitigate the dynamic responses as well as enhance the structural stiffness as shown in eq 4 the wave induced forces depends on the size of the section of the tunnel as well as other parameters such as added mass and drag coefficients therefore the effect of the outer diameter of the tunnel on the dynamic responses of the sfts was investigated in this study table 5 shows the range of the considered outer diameter of the tunnel with associated bending stiffness axial stiffness and mass per unit length of the parametric study for this analytical study the steel tube type tether whose outer diameter and wall thickness are respectively 0 533 m and 0 040 m was applied and the bwr of the tunnel is 1 2 also the draft of the tunnel is 100 0 m in this case study figs 24 25 and 26 clearly indicate that the dynamic responses could be effectively reduced when a smaller outer diameter is applied for the tunnel section because of the mitigation of wave induced forces as the wave induced force is reduced the fluctuating range of motion of the tunnel is reduced although the axial and bending stiffness of the tunnel are reduced in addition the tensile force and stress at the section of the tethers are also reduced due to reduction of motion of the tunnel the maximum stress level as well as the fluctuation range of the stress could also be reduced therefore fatigue performance of the tethers could be dramatically enhanced by downsizing the tunnel section consequently downsizing of the tunnel section is one of the solutions to mitigate the dynamic responses of the structure however the size of the tunnel is directly related to the traffic capacity therefore a dual tunnel system consisting of two parallel tunnels might be considered to use in the case of small sized tunnel for response mitigation 4 4 effect of leg inclination on the dynamic responses of the sfts the inclination of the tower legs is related to the lateral and vertical components of the axial stiffness of the tethers a parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of the leg inclination on the dynamic responses of the sfts table 6 presents the properties of the sft models used to investigate the effect of inclination of the tower legs the dynamic responses of the sfts with different inclinations of the tower leg from 0 0 to 60 0 were calculated and compared the draft of the tunnel is 100 0 m also the irregular wave model is the same as that considered in the previous sections fig 27 shows the motion of the tunnel at different inclinations of tower legs in the time domain the response is sensitively affected by the parameter the analytical results fig 28 show that the swaying motion of the tunnel increases as inclination increases from 0 0 to 30 0 while heaving motion of the tunnel increases when inclination increases from 0 0 to 10 0 after reaching the maximum values the sway and heave responses are reduced as the inclination increases applying a larger inclination the lateral stiffness induced by the tether stiffness might be increased thus reducing both the lateral motion and the resulting vertical motion meanwhile vertical stiffness induced by tether stiffness is reduced as a larger inclination is applied in addition the levels of initial and dynamic tensile forces could be increased due to increase in inclination of the tethers therefore negative tension might be applied due to the increased dynamic portion of tension consequently there are advantages and disadvantages due to the inclination of the tower legs according to the analytical results vertically straight type is suitable to reduce the motion under the waves if the engineer wants to control the responses using an inclined tower leg design inclination should be larger than 60 0 however it is not recommended from the economic point of view 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the dynamic behavioral characteristics of the sft moored by inclined tethers attached to fixed towers and case studies were conducted to find ways to reduce the structural responses to harsh environmental conditions based on the numerical simulation results we present the following important dynamic characteristics owing to the structural characteristics the examined sft might show unacceptable structural performance under a harsh wave load although the newly suggested concept of the sft could reduce the burden of the seabed anchor or pile construction its structural performance should be improved for it to be used as a transportation facility to find the design strategy case studies were conducted in this study effects of the main design parameters including draft tether stiffness size of the tunnel section and inclination of the tower legs on the dynamic behaviors were analytically investigated the application of deep draft and high stiffness tethers are effective methods to reduce the dynamic responses of the tunnel using the deep draft design the wave forces could be exponentially reduced also the high stiffness tethers will induce high stiffness to the tunnel as well as cause changes in the natural frequency of the tunnel however there are limitations in applying these methods from the increasing static water pressure issue fabrication and construction point of views when a small size tunnel is designed the motion of the sft reduced significantly because the wave induced forces were effectively reduced therefore the dual tube type sft could be one of the alternative concepts for very harsh environment this study clearly shows that there are advantages and disadvantages in using inclined tower legs the motion of the tunnel with inclined tower legs was smaller compared with tunnel with vertical tower legs especially when the inclination is larger than 60 0 however it is economically impractical as shown in this study there are various design factors that influence the structural performance of the sfts therefore the engineer should carefully combine the design strategies to reduce the structural response especially under harsh environmental conditions credit authorship

20336,the objective of this paper is to study the dynamic response and stability of a flexible foil with emphasis on flutter mechanism the hybrid coupled fluid structure algorithm is applied to investigate the effect of solid to fluid mass ratio on the dynamic response and stability of a 2 d flexible foil the results show that with increase of the solid to fluid mass ratio the failure will be triggered in turn such as the static divergence the dynamic divergence and the flutter divergence the predicted divergence velocity boundary increasing with the increase of solid to fluid mass ratio is in accordance with the experimental results the reduced order model rom is applied to investigate the flutter mechanism the flutter boundary estimated by the rom based fsi model shows good agreement with the experimental and numerical results the results obtained from the complex eigenvalue analysis show that the instability depends on the fluid mode and the structural mode which consist of plunging mode and pitching mode flutter is triggered by the unstable pitching mode meanwhile the fluid mode and plunging mode are stable keywords flexible foil fluid structure interaction dynamic response stability flutter rom 1 introduction flexible lifting bodies have attracted a growing interest in wind turbine structure ship propulsion and marine vehicles due to lightweight corrosion resistant etc however the flexible foil is prone to deform under dynamic load causing some unavoidable problems such as noise vibration and even structural failure especially when it exceeds the structure s deformation capacity and the foils get unstable ducoin and young 2013a huang et al 2019 wu et al 2017 hence it is important to predict the dynamic response and the stability boundaries of the flexible lifting bodies accurately previous work has mainly focused on the stability of the foil in aerospace lee and lee 2013 sun et al 2018 2019 theodorsen 1935 and sears 1941 calculated the aerodynamic forces of a two degree of freedom thin airfoil undergoing small amplitude harmonic motion with linear potential theory kousen and bendiksen 1988 used euler equations to calculate the static divergence and flutter divergence velocity of a two degree of freedom airfoil woolston and castile s woolston and castile 1951 presented an experimental investigation on the effects of fluid and structural parameters on the stability characteristics of a naca 16 010 airfoil an analytical investigation based on the two dimensional aerodynamic theory for incompressible flow was also supplemented they found that theoretical results followed the trends indicated by experiment but overestimated the flutter dimensionless velocity boundary for low mass ratios in addition to the dynamic response of flexible airfoils much recent work has been conducted to investigate the transient response of flexible hydrofoils chae et al 2013 wu et al 2018 ducoin and young 2013b where the fluid density cannot be neglected and hence the effects of fluid inertia and damping forces cannot be negligible ducoin and young 2013a cieslowsi and besch cieslowski and besch 1970 performed low mass ratio stability experiments to investigate the flutter boundaries in a high speed towing basin and a variable pressure water tunnel with subcavitating flow they demonstrated mass ratio angle of attack and foil depth all affected the flutter boundaries besch and liu 1971 further measured the hydrofoil flutter and divergence velocities under different mass ratios they investigated that static failure occurred earlier than flutter for the low mass ratio models lelong et al 2018 conducted an experiment to study the structural response of flexible hydrofoil the second and higher order modes was observed to increase slightly with flow velocity especially for higher angles of incidence and this frequency increase is believed to be due to added stiffness with development of the numerical methods the fluid structure interaction fsi algorithms acted an important role in solving the hydroelastic instability problems connell and yue 2007 akcabay and young 2012 fully coupled fc method ryzhakov et al 2010 can lead to ill conditioned system due to the variables with different scaling in the multi field problem loosely coupled lc method farhat et al 2006 lacks sufficient time accuracy and numerical stability tightly coupled tc approach cannot avoid numerical instability issues caused by artificial added mass effects especially for a flexible hydrofoil in a heavy fluid forster et al 2007 causin et al 2005 young et al 2012a developed a loosely hybrid coupling lhc algorithm that can avoid numerical instability issues associated with artificial added mass effects by embedding theodorsen s analytical approximation of the hydroelastic forces in the solution process wu et al 2015 investigated the hydroelastic response of a flexible hydrofoil in cavitating flow with hc algorithm they stated that the cavitation has significant effect on the hydrofoil deformation and the hydroelastic response young et al 2018 presented experimental and numerical studies on the steady state hydroelastic response of composite hydrofoils the results showed that material bend twist coupling that led to nose up would experience higher hydrodynamic load coefficients accelerated stall and static response while the opposite is true for material bend twist coupling that leads to nose down twist flutter a self excited vibration mainly affected by the coupling interaction of inertial force elastic force and dynamic force has been attracted more attention in contrast to other stability problems like static divergence and dynamic divergence much work kim and lee 2000 shahrzad and mahzoon 2002 has been employed to study the flutter boundaries and distinctive characteristics bose et al 2019 computed the critical speed as a function of mass ratio by changing the structure density venkatramani et al 2018 experimentally investigated precursor measures for flutter they revealed that flutter instability is a regime of intermittency they also found that as the flow speed increased towards the flutter speed there appeared intermittent bursts of periodic oscillations and eventually the dynamic transition into fully developed limit cycle oscillations owing to the large cost of traditional theoretical experimental and numerical methods for the stability problem a reduced order model cowan et al 2001 gao and zhang 2020 siddiqui et al 2020 has been employed to reduce the computational cost and to analyze the mechanism of flutter hall et al 2000 constructed a reduced order model rom to study the transonic unsteady aerodynamic flows the flutter speed calculated by rom was found that it was in good agreement with the results derived from potential theories gao et al 2017 investigated the physical mechanism of frequency lock in by rom and numerical method the results showed that frequency lock in was caused by the linear coupled mode flutter gao et al 2019 further used a reduced order model to improve the stability of the transonic buffet flow by activating the structural degree of freedom results showed that the activated structural degree of freedom can stabilize the buffet flow eliminating the source of the oscillatory flow the essence of this strategy was to efficiently utilize the coupling effect between the structural mode and the fluid mode to improve the stability of the fluid mode by properly decreasing the stability margin of the structural mode as illustrated above though numerous experimental and theoretical studies of dynamic response and stability around a flexible foil have been conducted a numerical research that considers the influence of the virtual additional mass force and a reduced order model to analyze the flutter mechanism need to be further investigated this paper presents a numerical study on the dynamic response and stability of a flexible foil with hc approach which involves a wide range of solid to fluid density and considers the virtual additional mass force of water a reduced order model is applied to reveal the flutter mechanism and present the critical flutter speed more effectively 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations the equations of incompressible and unsteady reynolds average navier

castile s venkatramani et al 2018 experimental work the foil is located at 7c from the inlet with the initial angle of attack α 0 0 the chord c 0 305 m and the span s 0 001 m the reynolds number r e c

stability of a flexible foil fig 4 shows the predicted reduced velocity u u ω θ b varying with mass ratio μ m π ρ f b 2 which is changed by varying the fluid density ρ f and fixing the solid density ρ s where u is the flow velocity note that the black symbols represent the numerical results in present study and the black dotted line is the boundary between stability and divergence base on these points the blue symbols and dotted line represent the woolston and castile s experimental and theoretical results venkatramani et al 2018 respectively and the red dotted line represents divergence boundary based on the linear potential theory chae et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 according to the predicted stability divergence dynamic response as shown in fig 5 of the flexible foil it can be characterized as four regions including steady static divergence dynamic divergence and flutter divergence it is obviously that the predicted trend of divergence boundaries is similar to that with the linear potential theory namely the reduced divergence velocity increases with mass ratio μ increasing the discrepancy between the predicted and theoretical boundary when μ 0 9 is because the dynamic divergence and flutter are not only affected by solid restoring force and fluid induced static moment but also depends on the solid and fluid inertia and damping terms which are neglected by linear potential theory fig 5 shows the evolution of heaving and pitching deformation as well as the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients for the typical cases shown in fig 4 the lift coefficient is calculated by c l l 0 5 ρ l u 2 s c and the moment coefficient c m m 0 5 ρ l u 2 s c 2 combining figs 4 and 5 when 0 μ 0 9 the foil dynamic response develops from stable to static divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u and the heaving and pitching deformations decrease with time until zero when foil is stable while for the static divergence the heaving and pitching deformations increase monotonously with time without oscillation because of the loss of the effective torsional stiffness as shown in fig 5 b when 0 9 μ 1 9 the foil dynamic response converts from stable to dynamic divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u as shown in fig 5 c and d the heaving and pitching deformations increase with time accompanied by oscillations with a gradual decay in frequency when μ 1 9 the foil transforms from stable to critical flutter then flutter divergence with increasing of reduced velocity u for the critical flutter the heaving and pitching deformations are observed to oscillate with a constant amplitude and a fixed frequency and there is a phase difference between the heaving and pitching deformation as shown in fig 5 e with the increase of velocity the flutter divergence will be triggered and the deformations increase with time the critical flutter speed is also confirmed by woolston and castile s experimental results venkatramani et al 2018 the predicted flutter boundary in this work is slightly lower than the experimental values venkatramani et al 2018 which is because the two dimensional model used in present study ignores the three dimensional effects that assumes no relative movement or rotation between the foil sections fig 5 shows examples of different stability divergence behavior and further investigates the interaction between the deformations and dynamic load coefficients of the flexible foil it should be note that the lift coefficients have the same trend with heaving deformation similarly the moment coefficients are the same with pitching deformation which indicates that lift mainly affects heaving deformation and moment mainly affects pitching deformation figs 6 8 show the predicted heaving and pitching deformations and vorticity contours with positive vorticity values representing the counterclockwise vortex structures and the negative values representing the clockwise ones of the flexible foil in static divergence dynamic divergence and flutter respectively with the black horizontal line representing the initial position of the foil in which the dimensionless time is calculated by t δ t ω θ δ t denotes the time step fig 9 shows the phase trajectory to further demonstrate the dynamic response with the x axis of the phase trajectory diagram representing the pitching deformation of the flexible foil and the y axis being the pitching angular acceleration for the static divergence case as shown in fig 6 the heaving and pitching deformations continue to increase with the effective angle of attack getting larger from fig 9 a it can be observed that the angular velocity increases as the pitching deformation increases which causes the foil rapidly destabilized as for the flutter case as shown in fig 7 from t 0 to t 1 the flexible foil twists counterclockwise to the maximum angle and bends upwards at t t 2 and t t 3 the flexible foil bends down to the maximum position and meanwhile twists clockwise to the maximum angle from t 4 to t 5 the trend of deformation is opposite to that from t 2 to t 3 the vortex areas of the suction side and pressure side are approximately symmetrically distributed and dissipate downstream the leading and trailing edges of the foil move up and down alternately as time increases the persistent oscillation contributes phase trajectory of flutter being a limit cycle oscillation as shown in fig 9 b as for the dynamic divergence case as given in fig 8 at t t 1 the flexible foil deviates from the initial position and bends upwards from t 0 to t 1 the flexible foil twists clockwise from t 1 to t 3 the heaving deformation continues to increase and the whole foil is above the initial position at t t 3 from t 3 to t 5 the foil continues to twist clockwise and the leading edge of the foil deviates far from the initial position with the increase of the effective angle due to the twist deformation the vortex region on the suction side of the foil gradually increases and that on the pressure side decreases besides the vortices on both sides generate and dissipate alternately in the wake region as shown in fig 9 c as twist deformation increases pitching angular acceleration firstly oscillates and then decreases which is due to the decrease of the reduced frequency shown in fig 10 in order to feature the divergence frequency fig 10 shows the variation of reduced frequency with mass ratio of flexible foil in which the dimensionless reduced frequency is calculated by k c ω b u where ω is the divergence frequency the predicted flutter frequencies agree well with the experimental and theoretical critical flutter frequencies based on woolston and castile venkatramani et al 2018 for the typical flow conditions the reduced frequency of static divergence equals to zero because the foil vibrations without oscillation while the frequency of dynamic divergence decreases from a fixed value to zero with the increase of deformation according to fig 8 the critical flutter frequency is constant with fixed mass ratio and it decays with increasing mass ratio fig 11 shows the predicted total heaving and pitching damping coefficients as a function of the reduced velocity at various mass ratio when ξ t 0 the foil is stable on the contrary the foil is unstable when the foil flutters ξ t b e n d i n g or ξ t t w i s t i n g 0 for both the heaving and pitching damping coefficients the critical dimensionless speed gradually increases with the increase of mass ratio 3 2 flutter analysis of a flexible foil with the reduced order model numerical methods can accurately predict the flow features of fluid structure interaction but it becomes inefficient to analyze the effect of flow parameters and structural materials on the dynamic response and instabilities rom is a more efficient approach to construct a low order model that can extract the main dynamic characteristics of the unsteady flow to replace the full order cfd approach rom solves the stability problem from the perspective of fluid mode and structure mode the flutter dynamics can be explicitly identified by the eigenvalues of a complex matrix in which therefore a linear rom composed of coupling of dynamic model and structure model is utilized in present work the dynamic model is constructed by the arx method hollkamp and batill 1991 and it contains four steps sample training parameter identification error analysis and equation transformation as shown in fig 12 once completed the model is applied in place of the unsteady cfd solution in the fluid structure interaction simulation to predict the response of the structure this solution with the discrete time model in place can be executed at almost no computational cost relative to the unsteady cfd solution furthermore it is not dependent on the freestream dynamic pressure or any of the structural parameters such as generalized mass and stiffness this allows one to vary these parameters and to use the fast model solution to observe their effect on the response of the structure hence a substantial amount of computational time is saved in determining foil instabilities by running the coupled model solution rather than the time marched cfd solution in sample training output signal is taken from the unsteady cfd solver for a given input signal the optimal input signal required for parameter identification plays the important role in the dynamic modeling in parameter identification the input signal and output signal are processed and the parameter a i and b i are required to be identified if the error between the cfd simulations and identified results is less than 10 continue the fourth step if not go back to the second step in order to complete the state space dynamic analysis the discrete difference equation should be turned into continuous time form equation in sample training to avoid some numerical problems caused by sharp corners of original 3211 multistep hamel and jategaonkar 1996 the integral form of 3211 multistep is applied in present input signal due to its ease of implementation and broad frequency content gao et al 2017 which can be expressed in eq 7 eq 8 the function of multi step heaving and pitching displacements is shown in fig 13 it is noted that the input signals for heaving and pitching displacements are out of phase allowing the identification procedure to distinguish the effects of different inputs in the system response 7 h m 0 t 0 1 3 t 0 18 6 t 0 21 6 t 0 23 6 t 0 25 t 0 t 1 t t

main feature of the flow field is the superposition of fluid modes which can be obtained by solving the eigenvalues of the matrix a a fig 15 shows the eigenvalues of the matrix a a with different orders at μ 4 18 u 1 85 the horizontal axis calculated by the real part of the eigenvalue represents the damping property of the flow field the positive real part means the flow is unstable and the vertical axis calculated by the imaginary part represents the frequency characteristics of the flow field no positive real part of the eigenvalues is observed which indicates that the flow field is stable when the foil flutters at μ 4 18 u 1 85 as for the structure model analysis the generalized motion equation can be expressed as follows 14 m ξ g ξ k ξ q where ξ ξ and ξ are the heaving and pitching displacement velocity and acceleration of the foil respectively m 1 x α x α r α 2 k ω h c u 2 0 0 ω α c u 2 for the convenience of solving it in the time domain the structural state vector is introduced as follows 15 x ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n t then equation 14 can be written in the state space form 16 x s t a s x s t b s f t ξ t c s x s t d s f t where a s 0 i m 1 k m 1 g b s 0 m 1 c s 1 0 d s 0 0 is the square matrix i is the identity matrix q 1 π μ r α 2 is the dynamic pressure by coupling the dynamic continuous time state equation with structural state equation the rom based fsi model can be expressed as follows 17 x s t x a t a s q b s d a c s q b s c a b a c s a a x s t x a t a a e x a e t where the subscripts a and s denote the fluid and structure respectively only the matrix a s and b s change with the variation of structural properties the analysis of system stability is converted into the problem of solving the complex eigenvalues of a ae fig 16 shows the system eigenvalues with the model order n 16 when μ 4 18 u 1 85 the horizontal axis calculated by the real part of the eigenvalues represents the foil damping characteristics positive values means the system is stable otherwise it means divergence and the vertical axis calculated by the imaginary part represents the system frequency characteristics corresponding to the flutter reduced frequency at the critical state note that a pair of conjugate eigenvalues is observed in the right half plane it s approximately equal to the flutter reduced frequency k s 0 324 when μ 4 18 u 1 85 therefore the global unstable reduced frequency can be identified in this way fig 17 shows the root locus at different reduced velocity with a fixed mass ratio μ 4 18 the vertical axis is calculated by the imaginary part of the eigenvalue of a ae the horizontal axis is calculated by the real part the change in reduced velocity is achieved by changing the structural property ω θ in structure motion equation it simplifies the calculation and avoids solving the flow field repeatedly when the real part the foil damping is zero the branch of the imaginary part the foil reduced frequency corresponding to the natural heaving frequency is called the plunging mode the branch of which corresponding to the natural pitching frequency is called the pitching mode it could be observed that the pitching mode eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis from the left half plane to the right half plane and the plunging mode eigenvalues are always in the left half plane which indicates that flutter of the foil is triggered by the pitching mode instability for example when the reduced velocity is u 1 75 the foil is stable as shown in fig 4 when the reduced velocity is u 1 95 the foil is divergence as shown in fig 8 to further illustrate the divergence boundary at μ 4 18 the variation in the real part and imaginary part of pitching mode and plunging mode with reduced velocity is plotted in fig 18 the point p v p g p means the foil needs g p damping to maintain simple harmonic motion when the foil velocity is v p if the real damping of the foil less than g p the foil need increasing damping to maintain simple harmonic motion so the foil is divergence at v p on the contrary if the real damping of foil more than g p the foil need decreasing damping to maintain simple harmonic motion so the foil is attenuated we usually suppose the real damping is zero so when the g p 0 the foil is divergence when the g p 0 the foil flutters when the g p 0 the foil is stable note that the plunging mode and pitching mode are observed to be coupled with the increasing of reduced velocity and the pitching mode gets unstable when the reduced velocity u 1 85 which is the critical velocity of flutter the imaginary value of the pitching mode corresponding to the critical velocity is the critical frequency k s 0 36 the flutter boundary at μ 4 18 analyzed by the rom based fsi model is in good agreement with the cfd csd simulation results and are basically consistent with the experimental values which indicates that the rom based fsi model is suitable for flutter analysis 4 conclusions in this work hybrid coupled numerical method is applied to analyze the dynamic response and stability of a flexible foil which considers the influence of the virtual additional mass force with theodorsen assumption with special emphasis on the flutter mechanism via the reduced order model approach the predicted trend of divergence velocity boundaries is similar to that with the linear potential theory the reduced divergence velocity increases with solid to fluid mass ratio μ increasing in addition the predicted reduced velocity calculated by hybrid coupled method is slightly lower than the that with the linear potential theory when μ 0 9 due to the solid and fluid inertia and damping terms which are neglected by linear potential theory the results show that the failure forms of the foil are static divergence dynamic divergence and flutter divergence with the increase of mass ratio when 0 μ 0 9 the foil dynamic response develops from stable to static divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u when 0 9 μ 1 9 the foil dynamic response converts from stable to dynamic divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u when μ 1 9 the foil transforms from stable to critical flutter then flutter divergence with increasing of reduced velocity u for the static divergence case the heaving and pitching deformations increase monotonously with time without oscillation causing the reduced frequency to be zero for the dynamic divergence the deformations increase with time accompanied by oscillations with a gradual decay in frequency resulting in the reduced frequency from a fixed value to zero for the critical flutter the deformations oscillate with a constant amplitude and a fixed frequency triggering to the reduced frequency to be a constant value and the persistent oscillation contributes phase trajectory of flutter being a limit cycle oscillation the reduced order model rom approach is applied to investigate the flutter mechanism the flutter boundary at μ 4 18 analyzed by the rom based fsi model is in good agreement with the cfd csd simulation results and are basically consistent with the experimental values the results show that the flutter is triggered by the pitching mode instability while the fluid mode and plunging mode are stable credit authorship contribution statement yunqing liu conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

20336,the objective of this paper is to study the dynamic response and stability of a flexible foil with emphasis on flutter mechanism the hybrid coupled fluid structure algorithm is applied to investigate the effect of solid to fluid mass ratio on the dynamic response and stability of a 2 d flexible foil the results show that with increase of the solid to fluid mass ratio the failure will be triggered in turn such as the static divergence the dynamic divergence and the flutter divergence the predicted divergence velocity boundary increasing with the increase of solid to fluid mass ratio is in accordance with the experimental results the reduced order model rom is applied to investigate the flutter mechanism the flutter boundary estimated by the rom based fsi model shows good agreement with the experimental and numerical results the results obtained from the complex eigenvalue analysis show that the instability depends on the fluid mode and the structural mode which consist of plunging mode and pitching mode flutter is triggered by the unstable pitching mode meanwhile the fluid mode and plunging mode are stable keywords flexible foil fluid structure interaction dynamic response stability flutter rom 1 introduction flexible lifting bodies have attracted a growing interest in wind turbine structure ship propulsion and marine vehicles due to lightweight corrosion resistant etc however the flexible foil is prone to deform under dynamic load causing some unavoidable problems such as noise vibration and even structural failure especially when it exceeds the structure s deformation capacity and the foils get unstable ducoin and young 2013a huang et al 2019 wu et al 2017 hence it is important to predict the dynamic response and the stability boundaries of the flexible lifting bodies accurately previous work has mainly focused on the stability of the foil in aerospace lee and lee 2013 sun et al 2018 2019 theodorsen 1935 and sears 1941 calculated the aerodynamic forces of a two degree of freedom thin airfoil undergoing small amplitude harmonic motion with linear potential theory kousen and bendiksen 1988 used euler equations to calculate the static divergence and flutter divergence velocity of a two degree of freedom airfoil woolston and castile s woolston and castile 1951 presented an experimental investigation on the effects of fluid and structural parameters on the stability characteristics of a naca 16 010 airfoil an analytical investigation based on the two dimensional aerodynamic theory for incompressible flow was also supplemented they found that theoretical results followed the trends indicated by experiment but overestimated the flutter dimensionless velocity boundary for low mass ratios in addition to the dynamic response of flexible airfoils much recent work has been conducted to investigate the transient response of flexible hydrofoils chae et al 2013 wu et al 2018 ducoin and young 2013b where the fluid density cannot be neglected and hence the effects of fluid inertia and damping forces cannot be negligible ducoin and young 2013a cieslowsi and besch cieslowski and besch 1970 performed low mass ratio stability experiments to investigate the flutter boundaries in a high speed towing basin and a variable pressure water tunnel with subcavitating flow they demonstrated mass ratio angle of attack and foil depth all affected the flutter boundaries besch and liu 1971 further measured the hydrofoil flutter and divergence velocities under different mass ratios they investigated that static failure occurred earlier than flutter for the low mass ratio models lelong et al 2018 conducted an experiment to study the structural response of flexible hydrofoil the second and higher order modes was observed to increase slightly with flow velocity especially for higher angles of incidence and this frequency increase is believed to be due to added stiffness with development of the numerical methods the fluid structure interaction fsi algorithms acted an important role in solving the hydroelastic instability problems connell and yue 2007 akcabay and young 2012 fully coupled fc method ryzhakov et al 2010 can lead to ill conditioned system due to the variables with different scaling in the multi field problem loosely coupled lc method farhat et al 2006 lacks sufficient time accuracy and numerical stability tightly coupled tc approach cannot avoid numerical instability issues caused by artificial added mass effects especially for a flexible hydrofoil in a heavy fluid forster et al 2007 causin et al 2005 young et al 2012a developed a loosely hybrid coupling lhc algorithm that can avoid numerical instability issues associated with artificial added mass effects by embedding theodorsen s analytical approximation of the hydroelastic forces in the solution process wu et al 2015 investigated the hydroelastic response of a flexible hydrofoil in cavitating flow with hc algorithm they stated that the cavitation has significant effect on the hydrofoil deformation and the hydroelastic response young et al 2018 presented experimental and numerical studies on the steady state hydroelastic response of composite hydrofoils the results showed that material bend twist coupling that led to nose up would experience higher hydrodynamic load coefficients accelerated stall and static response while the opposite is true for material bend twist coupling that leads to nose down twist flutter a self excited vibration mainly affected by the coupling interaction of inertial force elastic force and dynamic force has been attracted more attention in contrast to other stability problems like static divergence and dynamic divergence much work kim and lee 2000 shahrzad and mahzoon 2002 has been employed to study the flutter boundaries and distinctive characteristics bose et al 2019 computed the critical speed as a function of mass ratio by changing the structure density venkatramani et al 2018 experimentally investigated precursor measures for flutter they revealed that flutter instability is a regime of intermittency they also found that as the flow speed increased towards the flutter speed there appeared intermittent bursts of periodic oscillations and eventually the dynamic transition into fully developed limit cycle oscillations owing to the large cost of traditional theoretical experimental and numerical methods for the stability problem a reduced order model cowan et al 2001 gao and zhang 2020 siddiqui et al 2020 has been employed to reduce the computational cost and to analyze the mechanism of flutter hall et al 2000 constructed a reduced order model rom to study the transonic unsteady aerodynamic flows the flutter speed calculated by rom was found that it was in good agreement with the results derived from potential theories gao et al 2017 investigated the physical mechanism of frequency lock in by rom and numerical method the results showed that frequency lock in was caused by the linear coupled mode flutter gao et al 2019 further used a reduced order model to improve the stability of the transonic buffet flow by activating the structural degree of freedom results showed that the activated structural degree of freedom can stabilize the buffet flow eliminating the source of the oscillatory flow the essence of this strategy was to efficiently utilize the coupling effect between the structural mode and the fluid mode to improve the stability of the fluid mode by properly decreasing the stability margin of the structural mode as illustrated above though numerous experimental and theoretical studies of dynamic response and stability around a flexible foil have been conducted a numerical research that considers the influence of the virtual additional mass force and a reduced order model to analyze the flutter mechanism need to be further investigated this paper presents a numerical study on the dynamic response and stability of a flexible foil with hc approach which involves a wide range of solid to fluid density and considers the virtual additional mass force of water a reduced order model is applied to reveal the flutter mechanism and present the critical flutter speed more effectively 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations the equations of incompressible and unsteady reynolds average navier

castile s venkatramani et al 2018 experimental work the foil is located at 7c from the inlet with the initial angle of attack α 0 0 the chord c 0 305 m and the span s 0 001 m the reynolds number r e c

stability of a flexible foil fig 4 shows the predicted reduced velocity u u ω θ b varying with mass ratio μ m π ρ f b 2 which is changed by varying the fluid density ρ f and fixing the solid density ρ s where u is the flow velocity note that the black symbols represent the numerical results in present study and the black dotted line is the boundary between stability and divergence base on these points the blue symbols and dotted line represent the woolston and castile s experimental and theoretical results venkatramani et al 2018 respectively and the red dotted line represents divergence boundary based on the linear potential theory chae et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 according to the predicted stability divergence dynamic response as shown in fig 5 of the flexible foil it can be characterized as four regions including steady static divergence dynamic divergence and flutter divergence it is obviously that the predicted trend of divergence boundaries is similar to that with the linear potential theory namely the reduced divergence velocity increases with mass ratio μ increasing the discrepancy between the predicted and theoretical boundary when μ 0 9 is because the dynamic divergence and flutter are not only affected by solid restoring force and fluid induced static moment but also depends on the solid and fluid inertia and damping terms which are neglected by linear potential theory fig 5 shows the evolution of heaving and pitching deformation as well as the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients for the typical cases shown in fig 4 the lift coefficient is calculated by c l l 0 5 ρ l u 2 s c and the moment coefficient c m m 0 5 ρ l u 2 s c 2 combining figs 4 and 5 when 0 μ 0 9 the foil dynamic response develops from stable to static divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u and the heaving and pitching deformations decrease with time until zero when foil is stable while for the static divergence the heaving and pitching deformations increase monotonously with time without oscillation because of the loss of the effective torsional stiffness as shown in fig 5 b when 0 9 μ 1 9 the foil dynamic response converts from stable to dynamic divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u as shown in fig 5 c and d the heaving and pitching deformations increase with time accompanied by oscillations with a gradual decay in frequency when μ 1 9 the foil transforms from stable to critical flutter then flutter divergence with increasing of reduced velocity u for the critical flutter the heaving and pitching deformations are observed to oscillate with a constant amplitude and a fixed frequency and there is a phase difference between the heaving and pitching deformation as shown in fig 5 e with the increase of velocity the flutter divergence will be triggered and the deformations increase with time the critical flutter speed is also confirmed by woolston and castile s experimental results venkatramani et al 2018 the predicted flutter boundary in this work is slightly lower than the experimental values venkatramani et al 2018 which is because the two dimensional model used in present study ignores the three dimensional effects that assumes no relative movement or rotation between the foil sections fig 5 shows examples of different stability divergence behavior and further investigates the interaction between the deformations and dynamic load coefficients of the flexible foil it should be note that the lift coefficients have the same trend with heaving deformation similarly the moment coefficients are the same with pitching deformation which indicates that lift mainly affects heaving deformation and moment mainly affects pitching deformation figs 6 8 show the predicted heaving and pitching deformations and vorticity contours with positive vorticity values representing the counterclockwise vortex structures and the negative values representing the clockwise ones of the flexible foil in static divergence dynamic divergence and flutter respectively with the black horizontal line representing the initial position of the foil in which the dimensionless time is calculated by t δ t ω θ δ t denotes the time step fig 9 shows the phase trajectory to further demonstrate the dynamic response with the x axis of the phase trajectory diagram representing the pitching deformation of the flexible foil and the y axis being the pitching angular acceleration for the static divergence case as shown in fig 6 the heaving and pitching deformations continue to increase with the effective angle of attack getting larger from fig 9 a it can be observed that the angular velocity increases as the pitching deformation increases which causes the foil rapidly destabilized as for the flutter case as shown in fig 7 from t 0 to t 1 the flexible foil twists counterclockwise to the maximum angle and bends upwards at t t 2 and t t 3 the flexible foil bends down to the maximum position and meanwhile twists clockwise to the maximum angle from t 4 to t 5 the trend of deformation is opposite to that from t 2 to t 3 the vortex areas of the suction side and pressure side are approximately symmetrically distributed and dissipate downstream the leading and trailing edges of the foil move up and down alternately as time increases the persistent oscillation contributes phase trajectory of flutter being a limit cycle oscillation as shown in fig 9 b as for the dynamic divergence case as given in fig 8 at t t 1 the flexible foil deviates from the initial position and bends upwards from t 0 to t 1 the flexible foil twists clockwise from t 1 to t 3 the heaving deformation continues to increase and the whole foil is above the initial position at t t 3 from t 3 to t 5 the foil continues to twist clockwise and the leading edge of the foil deviates far from the initial position with the increase of the effective angle due to the twist deformation the vortex region on the suction side of the foil gradually increases and that on the pressure side decreases besides the vortices on both sides generate and dissipate alternately in the wake region as shown in fig 9 c as twist deformation increases pitching angular acceleration firstly oscillates and then decreases which is due to the decrease of the reduced frequency shown in fig 10 in order to feature the divergence frequency fig 10 shows the variation of reduced frequency with mass ratio of flexible foil in which the dimensionless reduced frequency is calculated by k c ω b u where ω is the divergence frequency the predicted flutter frequencies agree well with the experimental and theoretical critical flutter frequencies based on woolston and castile venkatramani et al 2018 for the typical flow conditions the reduced frequency of static divergence equals to zero because the foil vibrations without oscillation while the frequency of dynamic divergence decreases from a fixed value to zero with the increase of deformation according to fig 8 the critical flutter frequency is constant with fixed mass ratio and it decays with increasing mass ratio fig 11 shows the predicted total heaving and pitching damping coefficients as a function of the reduced velocity at various mass ratio when ξ t 0 the foil is stable on the contrary the foil is unstable when the foil flutters ξ t b e n d i n g or ξ t t w i s t i n g 0 for both the heaving and pitching damping coefficients the critical dimensionless speed gradually increases with the increase of mass ratio 3 2 flutter analysis of a flexible foil with the reduced order model numerical methods can accurately predict the flow features of fluid structure interaction but it becomes inefficient to analyze the effect of flow parameters and structural materials on the dynamic response and instabilities rom is a more efficient approach to construct a low order model that can extract the main dynamic characteristics of the unsteady flow to replace the full order cfd approach rom solves the stability problem from the perspective of fluid mode and structure mode the flutter dynamics can be explicitly identified by the eigenvalues of a complex matrix in which therefore a linear rom composed of coupling of dynamic model and structure model is utilized in present work the dynamic model is constructed by the arx method hollkamp and batill 1991 and it contains four steps sample training parameter identification error analysis and equation transformation as shown in fig 12 once completed the model is applied in place of the unsteady cfd solution in the fluid structure interaction simulation to predict the response of the structure this solution with the discrete time model in place can be executed at almost no computational cost relative to the unsteady cfd solution furthermore it is not dependent on the freestream dynamic pressure or any of the structural parameters such as generalized mass and stiffness this allows one to vary these parameters and to use the fast model solution to observe their effect on the response of the structure hence a substantial amount of computational time is saved in determining foil instabilities by running the coupled model solution rather than the time marched cfd solution in sample training output signal is taken from the unsteady cfd solver for a given input signal the optimal input signal required for parameter identification plays the important role in the dynamic modeling in parameter identification the input signal and output signal are processed and the parameter a i and b i are required to be identified if the error between the cfd simulations and identified results is less than 10 continue the fourth step if not go back to the second step in order to complete the state space dynamic analysis the discrete difference equation should be turned into continuous time form equation in sample training to avoid some numerical problems caused by sharp corners of original 3211 multistep hamel and jategaonkar 1996 the integral form of 3211 multistep is applied in present input signal due to its ease of implementation and broad frequency content gao et al 2017 which can be expressed in eq 7 eq 8 the function of multi step heaving and pitching displacements is shown in fig 13 it is noted that the input signals for heaving and pitching

the coupling with the structure s state equation in continuous space the continuous time form equations are given by the bilinear transformation 13 x a t a a x a t b a ξ t f a a c a x a t d a ξ t the main feature of the flow field is the superposition of fluid modes which can be obtained by solving the eigenvalues of the matrix a a fig 15 shows the eigenvalues of the matrix a a with different orders at μ 4 18 u 1 85 the horizontal axis calculated by the real part of the eigenvalue represents the damping property of the flow field the positive real part means the flow is unstable and the vertical axis calculated by the imaginary part represents the frequency characteristics of the flow field no positive real part of the eigenvalues is observed which indicates that the flow field is stable when the foil flutters at μ 4 18 u 1 85 as for the structure model analysis the generalized motion equation can be expressed as follows 14 m ξ g ξ k ξ q where ξ ξ and ξ are the heaving and pitching displacement velocity and acceleration of the foil respectively m 1 x α x α r α 2 k ω h c u 2 0 0 ω α c u 2 for the convenience of solving it in the time domain the structural state vector is introduced as follows 15 x ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n t then equation 14 can be written in the state space form 16 x s t a s x s t b s f t ξ t c s x s t d s f t where a s 0 i m 1 k m 1 g b s 0 m 1 c s 1 0 d s 0 0 is the square matrix i is the identity matrix q 1 π μ r α 2 is the dynamic pressure by coupling the dynamic continuous time state equation with structural state equation the rom based fsi model can be expressed as follows 17 x s t x a t a s q b s d a c s q b s c a b a c s a a x s t x a t a a e x a e t where the subscripts a and s denote the fluid and structure respectively only the matrix a s and b s change with the variation of structural properties the analysis of system stability is converted into the problem of solving the complex eigenvalues of a ae fig 16 shows the system eigenvalues with the model order n 16 when μ 4 18 u 1 85 the horizontal axis calculated by the real part of the eigenvalues represents the foil damping characteristics positive values means the system is stable otherwise it means divergence and the vertical axis calculated by the imaginary part represents the system frequency characteristics corresponding to the flutter reduced frequency at the critical state note that a pair of conjugate eigenvalues is observed in the right half plane it s approximately equal to the flutter reduced frequency k s 0 324 when μ 4 18 u 1 85 therefore the global unstable reduced frequency can be identified in this way fig 17 shows the root locus at different reduced velocity with a fixed mass ratio μ 4 18 the vertical axis is calculated by the imaginary part of the eigenvalue of a ae the horizontal axis is calculated by the real part the change in reduced velocity is achieved by changing the structural property ω θ in structure motion equation it simplifies the calculation and avoids solving the flow field repeatedly when the real part the foil damping is zero the branch of the imaginary part the foil reduced frequency corresponding to the natural heaving frequency is called the plunging mode the branch of which corresponding to the natural pitching frequency is called the pitching mode it could be observed that the pitching mode eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis from the left half plane to the right half plane and the plunging mode eigenvalues are always in the left half plane which indicates that flutter of the foil is triggered by the pitching mode instability for example when the reduced velocity is u 1 75 the foil is stable as shown in fig 4 when the reduced velocity is u 1 95 the foil is divergence as shown in fig 8 to further illustrate the divergence boundary at μ 4 18 the variation in the real part and imaginary part of pitching mode and plunging mode with reduced velocity is plotted in fig 18 the point p v p g p means the foil needs g p damping to maintain simple harmonic motion when the foil velocity is v p if the real damping of the foil less than g p the foil need increasing damping to maintain simple harmonic motion so the foil is divergence at v p on the contrary if the real damping of foil more than g p the foil need decreasing damping to maintain simple harmonic motion so the foil is attenuated we usually suppose the real damping is zero so when the g p 0 the foil is divergence when the g p 0 the foil flutters when the g p 0 the foil is stable note that the plunging mode and pitching mode are observed to be coupled with the increasing of reduced velocity and the pitching mode gets unstable when the reduced velocity u 1 85 which is the critical velocity of flutter the imaginary value of the pitching mode corresponding to the critical velocity is the critical frequency k s 0 36 the flutter boundary at μ 4 18 analyzed by the rom based fsi model is in good agreement with the cfd csd simulation results and are basically consistent with the experimental values which indicates that the rom based fsi model is suitable for flutter analysis 4 conclusions in this work hybrid coupled numerical method is applied to analyze the dynamic response and stability of a flexible foil which considers the influence of the virtual additional mass force with theodorsen assumption with special emphasis on the flutter mechanism via the reduced order model approach the predicted trend of divergence velocity boundaries is similar to that with the linear potential theory the reduced divergence velocity increases with solid to fluid mass ratio μ increasing in addition the predicted reduced velocity calculated by hybrid coupled method is slightly lower than the that with the linear potential theory when μ 0 9 due to the solid and fluid inertia and damping terms which are neglected by linear potential theory the results show that the failure forms of the foil are static divergence dynamic divergence and flutter divergence with the increase of mass ratio when 0 μ 0 9 the foil dynamic response develops from stable to static divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u when 0 9 μ 1 9 the foil dynamic response converts from stable to dynamic divergence with an increase of reduced velocity u when μ 1 9 the foil transforms from stable to critical flutter then flutter divergence with increasing of reduced velocity u for the static divergence case the heaving and pitching deformations increase monotonously with time without oscillation causing the reduced frequency to be zero for the dynamic divergence the deformations increase with time accompanied by oscillations with a gradual decay in frequency resulting in the reduced frequency from a fixed value to zero for the critical flutter the deformations oscillate with a constant amplitude and a fixed frequency triggering to the reduced frequency to be a constant value and the persistent oscillation contributes phase trajectory of flutter being a limit cycle oscillation the reduced order model rom approach is applied to investigate the flutter mechanism the flutter boundary at μ 4 18 analyzed by the rom based fsi model is in good agreement with the cfd csd simulation results and are basically consistent with the experimental values the results show that the flutter is triggered by the pitching mode instability while the fluid mode and plunging mode are stable credit authorship contribution statement yunqing liu conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

openings are often used in the top of large spaces without inner columns such as the theatre and the lounge in large passenger ships this design accompanied by in tension pillars above the long span stiffened panel can decrease the deck deflection largely in this paper experimental and finite element analysis is performed of the ultimate compressive strength of two long span stiffened panels subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads the comparison of experimental results shows that the in tension pillars only increase slightly the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel the experimental results show agreement with the simulations performed by the ansys finite element solver the validated numerical results illustrate the buckling and ultimate behaviour of long span stiffened panels with their progressive collapse processes the analysed ultimate loads are compared to the results calculated by seven existing empirical formulae the finite element analysis also discusses the effect of girder openings on the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel keywords ultimate strength stiffened panel in tension pillar experiment numerical simulation passenger ship deck 1 introduction large passenger ships specifically for cruises are multi decked ships equipped with all luxury and necessary amenities the special requirements complicate the design issues in the superstructure of passenger ships it is required to utilise the load carrying capability of the superstructure for the longitudinal strength in the design of passenger ships various novel structural types are introduced to satisfy the structural strength and function such as the long span stiffened panel 1 1 long span stiffened panel long span stiffened panels are often used in the top of large spaces without inner columns such as the theatre and the lounge in large passenger ships see fig 1 the ship deck panels are subjected to both uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment and lateral pressure load by the accommodation and public spaces the plate thickness in the superstructure is often designed just to satisfy the minimum requirement of the thickness of deck plating 5 0 mm in classification society rules such as lr 2020 in these special design considerations there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the buckling and ultimate strength of thin plates andric and zanic 2010 pei et al 2020 the buckling of thin plates is to be carefully checked in upper decks where local loads are low but the hull girder stress can be high to increase the bending stiffness of deck panels and to take the lightweight into consideration the longitudinal and transverse girders are often designed with high webs and multi openings on the webs these openings can be also used for running heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems and passing pipes or cables to further decrease the deflection of long span stiffened panels pillars in tension are installed above 1 2 ultimate strength analysis zhang 2016 and kim et al 2018 reviewed the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels analysed by employing experimental numerical empirical and analytical methods the buckling and ultimate strength of stiffened panels are affected by the effective plate and stiffener slenderness ratio experimental method is one of the most rigorous approaches to analyse the buckling and ultimate behaviour of structures for conventional stiffened panels many experiments on plates and stiffened panels were carried out in the literature e g ghavami and khedmati 2006 gordo and guedes soares 2008 2012 xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b 2021b manco et al 2019 kong et al 2020 and liu et al 2021 experimental results are often used to derive empirical formulae and to validate the numerical and analytical methods finite element analysis is the preferred tool for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened structures generally the buckling and ultimate behaviour of structures can be predicted approximately when the boundary conditions and the material nonlinearities are well defined e g xu et al 2013 2017 tekgoz et al 2015 kim et al 2017 li et al 2018 doan et al 2020 and xu and guedes soares 2021a the finite element analysis can provide an in depth understanding of the strength of stiffened structures empirical formula is the most rapid method to predict the ultimate strength e g paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 2019 2020 xu et al 2018 and ao et al 2019 however their accuracy relies not only on a large number of accidental observations experimental and numerical results but also on an in depth understanding of the mechanical behaviour of structures empirical formulae are often proposed to analyse the stiffened plates whose thicknesses are larger than 10 mm for thin plates 10 mm the buckling and ultimate behaviour should be checked carefully analytical methods have been developed for predicting the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened panels based on failure mode calculations e g paik et al 2001 paik and lee 2005 brubak et al 2013 andric et al 2014 alps ulsap 2016 and ozdemir et al 2018 one of the most famous methods is the alps ulsap 2016 where the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel based on six individual failure modes are computed and then the lowest value is selected as the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panel generally the ultimate compressive strength of intact stiffened panels using various methods has been well investigated however the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with a variety of openings such as the openings on the plating and the web of the stiffener is not well understood furthermore plates with in tension pillars are not found in earlier studies experimental and numerical methods are the most reliable tools for analysing novel structures liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 recently doan et al 2020 and liu et al 2020 analysed numerically the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels discussing the effect of stiffener openings the openings take an essential part in the change of stress distribution and ultimate load carrying capacity of stiffened panels the existence of openings can cause structural failure stress concentration and ultimate strength reduction there are different collapse modes for stiffened panels with and without openings on longitudinal and transverse girders in the conventional analysis of continuous stiffened panels the displacement at transverse frames and longitudinal girders are constrained as they are assumed to be strong enough not to produce lateral deflection e g xu et al 2018 however the openings on longitudinal girders reduce their axial stiffness and the collapse of the stiffened panel is affected strongly by the plastic buckling of longitudinal girders with web openings doan et al 2020 there are obvious lateral deflections for the longitudinal girders in the actual condition thus the idealised boundary condition i e zero lateral deflection is an unreasonable assumption for analysing the stiffened panel with openings on longitudinal girders generally its ultimate compressive strength needs to be further investigated besides the openings on longitudinal girders the thin plating is another characteristic of the long span stiffened panels in the upper decks of large passenger ships as the buckling modes of thin plates are complex and diverse it is challenging to apply the empirical or analytical method for analysing accurately their buckling and ultimate strength the actual load condition of ship deck panels can be well represented by combined axial compression and lateral pressure boundary conditions affect strongly the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and periodic and symmetric boundary conditions are used in the longitudinal direction the periodic boundary condition gives logical modelling to continuous stiffened panels xu et al 2013 doan et al 2020 this condition well generates the actual situation of continuity between individual stiffened panels 1 3 present work the present paper performs experimental and finite element analysis of the ultimate compressive strength of continuous stiffened panels with multi openings on the girders they are subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads the effect of in tension pillars on the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel is evaluated the objective of the present study is to analyse the ultimate strength of long span stiffened panels for constructing the top of large spaces in large passenger ships the experimental and numerical results are analysed in terms of the force displacement relationship buckling collapse process permanent deformation and stress distribution of each specimen the nonlinear finite element analysis also discusses the effect of girder openings on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels seven existing empirical formulae are used to calculate the ultimate compressive stress of panels compared to the experimental results 2 experimental details the experimental programme evaluates the ultimate compressive strength of two long span stiffened panels under combined uniaxial and lateral loads see fig 2 it aims to investigate the effect of initial lateral deflection on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels the lateral load is to simulate the design pressure load of the deck due to the activities of its use and the structural self weight the uniaxial load is to simulate the uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment 2 1 test specimens the geometrical dimensions of stiffened panels are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the scales of length and plate thickness are about 1 10 and 1 2 33 respectively these two stiffened panels are designed without and with six pillars in tension denoted by first specimen and second specimen respectively the longitudinal and transverse girders are designed using high webs with multi circular and elongated circular openings inside this type of stiffened panel provides much larger bending stiffness with smaller deflection under lateral pressure the structural components of panel specimens are built of 3 0 mm and 4 0 mm plates the plating has 3 0 mm thickness the longitudinal and transverse girder are t45 20 4 0 4 0 mm tee bar the longitudinal stiffener is 20 4 0 mm flat bar and the circular pillar is φ50 4 0 mm the structural strength depends on the geometry of the structural components and their material properties the mechanical properties of the steels that are used to fabricate the specimens are defined by quasi static tensile tests the uniaxial tensile tests are performed following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile stress strain relationships are presented in fig 3 the yield stresses of the 3 0 mm and 4 0 mm steel materials used in the specimens are 414 mpa and 399 mpa respectively the geometrical initial imperfection on each specimen plating is measured by a 3d laser scanner and the boundary lines of the specimen compose of a reference plane zero for the first and second specimens 1630 1780 mm2 the overall maximum out of plane deformations are 3 5 mm and 3 0 mm respectively fig 4 the initial imperfection is affected by the fabrication process showing an irregular shape the initial imperfection of plate components between stiffeners is about 2 0 mm similar to the imperfection calculated by the empirical formula 0 1tβ 2 0 1 3 0 2 542 1 94 mm 2 2 experimental setup the long span stiffened panel is supported by the longitudinal and transverse bulkheads the load and boundary conditions fig 5 are prescribed appropriately in the experiments as shown in fig 6 the experimental setup represents the edge constraints of stiffened panels required in lr 2016 and abs 2020 the lateral and uniaxial forces are enforced by four and seven hydraulic cylinders respectively in each loading system the synchronization of hydraulic cylinders is achieved by controlling an oil pump and a load transducer is used to measure the output force of one more synchronous hydraulic cylinder fig 6b for imposing the lateral load in the experiments concentrated loads are applied at four intersections of the longitudinal and transverse girders instead of the uniform pressure the uniaxial loading position is reinforced by a rigid beam to provide a uniformly distributed load for the specimens and to avoid the stress concentration the unloaded edges are simply supported by the clamping fixtures where the z displacement and y rotation are constrained see figs 5 and 6 it should be mentioned that there are small gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures to allow the x displacement in the specimen edges the procedure for conducting each experiment is described as follows 1 the loading and unloading are repeated three times in the elastic stage to eliminate partially the weld induced residual stresses in the specimen and to calibrate the testing equipment and measuring instruments the maximum lateral and uniaxial loads are about 2 0 t and 35 0 t respectively 2 the lateral load is imposed by the hydraulic cylinders until 4 0 t out of plane load pressure of 1 38 t m2 firstly and then the uniaxial load is applied until the specimen collapses the experimental lateral pressure of 1 38 t m2 is scaled from the prototype design pressure of 0 32 t m2 with the scaling of 10 2 33 in large passenger ships the design pressure and the gravity of upper decks are about 0 32 t m2 and 0 06 t m2 respectively the lateral load is very small compared to the uniaxial load induced by the longitudinal bending the layout of the displacement transducers is shown in fig 7 three displacement transducers are installed at the uniaxial load locations to measure the uniaxial deformation of specimens and five displacement transducers are installed at the lateral locations to measure the out of plane deformation of specimens three direction strain gauges are arranged at the stress concentration regions and six key points are presented in fig 7 the finite element analyses were performed before the experiments to search the regions of stress concentration in the specimens 3 experimental results the experimental results present the effect of in tension pillars on the buckling and ultimate behaviour of long span stiffened panels the experimental results are analysed in terms of the force displacement relationship deformation and stress distribution of each specimen 3 1 axial load versus displacement the experimental axial load displacement curves of panel specimens are presented in fig 8 a the resulting axial force is the total uniaxial load applied by seven hydraulic cylinders and the resulting axial displacement is the mean value measured by three transducers at the load positions d1 d3 in fig 7 the experimental maximum applied loads i e the ultimate compressive strengths are 119 2 t and 121 5 t for the first and second specimens respectively it is observed that the panel with in tension pillars shows only 1 9 higher ultimate strength than the one without pillars it is demonstrated that the pillars only affect strongly the lateral deflection of the panel but have a very small influence on the ultimate compressive strength the resultant average stress strain relationships of the panel specimens are presented in fig 8b the average stress is calculated by dividing the applied external force to the original cross sectional area of the stiffened panel 5890 mm2 and the average strain is calculated by dividing the developed axial displacement by the original length of the panel 1630 mm here the average stresses are 202 4 mpa and 206 3 mpa for the first and second specimens respectively 3 2 lateral deformation 3 2 1 initial deformation under lateral load fig 9 shows the out of plane deformations measured by the d4 d8 displacement transducers when imposing the lateral load of 4 0 t it should be mentioned that the first specimen presents excessive lateral displacement because of the gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures nevertheless the in tension pillars decrease largely the lateral deformation in the second specimen generally the first specimen shows a long half wavelength deflection and the second specimen shows a wavelength deflection due to the constraint of pillars 3 2 2 deformation under ultimate load each specimen collapses when a sudden and significant deformation is observed accompanied by a noticeable reduction of the uniaxial external load the permanent deformation shapes of specimens are presented in fig 10 and their local deformations at the middle three spans are given in fig 11 the pillars affect the collapse mode of the stiffened panel but both specimens collapse at the spans where d6 and d7 transducers are placed see red lines in fig 11 flexural buckling occurs at the longitudinal girders and stiffeners with associated plates involving the yielding and stiffness loss of components fig 12 shows the lateral deformation at the mid span with increasing the axial imposed displacement both specimens show a similar deformation shape with the initial deformations presented in fig 9 generally the lateral deformation increases almost linearly with the uniaxial load similar to the linear relationship between uniaxial load and displacement see fig 8 the permanent lateral deflections of the plates are 12 0 mm and 7 4 mm for the first and second specimens respectively the first specimen shows a long half wavelength flexural buckling and collapses at the mid span and the second specimen shows a wavelength buckling due to the constraint of pillars 3 3 stress in the experiments von mises stresses can be obtained based on the data measured by the three direction strain gauges comparison of stresses at some key points presented in fig 7 is shown in fig 13 the analysed value takes the corresponding material yield stress 414 mpa and 399 mpa when exceeding this magnitude since the formulae of material mechanics for calculating the stresses are based on linear elasticity it is observed that the first specimen suffers material yielding earlier than the second specimen especially at the longitudinal stiffener p4 and girder p5 it is mainly because the first specimen suffers much larger out of plane deformation at the mid span see d6 in fig 12 in both specimens the stiffeners yield earlier than the plates illustrating that the buckling of stiffened panels is dominated by the buckling and yielding of stiffeners it should be mentioned that the stresses in the panel specimens are much smaller than the material yield stress when only imposing the lateral load of 4 0 t the results of initial stresses under lateral load can be found at null axial load in fig 13 4 finite element model finite element analysis of stiffened panels is performed using the commercial software ansys fig 14 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the high level of geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacement and the finite strain are also activated the finite element model is generated using shell181 elements to analyse the local buckling in the girders six finite elements in the web of girders are generated and the element size is selected at about 7 5 mm this mesh density is sufficient to capture the global and local buckling of plates and stiffeners accurately the finite element model consists of 59 749 nodes and 58 898 shell elements the material properties of the high strength steels with a thickness of 3 0 mm and 4 0 mm are defined by an elastic perfectly plastic material model with the yield stress of 414 mpa and of 399 mpa respectively young s modulus of 206 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 are also defined the actual geometries of stiffened panels with the scanned initial geometrical imperfections fig 4 are used to create the finite element models similar modelling was presented by yu et al 2019 and liu et al 2021 as the initial preloading cycles were used to eliminate the residual stress partially in the experiments the welding induced residual stress is not explicitly modelled in the finite element analysis for the loading edge only the x displacement is free in the direction the external load is applied and for the reactive edge the fully clamped condition is considered see fig 14 the z displacement and y rotation are constrained at all the nodes along the unloaded edges this condition is to generate the actual boundary of specimens in the experiments the uniaxial load is applied at all the nodes along the loading edge and the ultimate load of the specimens is determined from the peak value of the uniaxial load at the initial loading the total lateral load of 4 0 t is applied at the nodes where the lateral hydraulic cylinders are placed 5 finite element results 5 1 axial load versus displacement the numerical axial load displacement curves of specimens compared to the experimental results are presented in fig 15 in the first and second specimens the numerical ultimate average stresses are 194 4 mpa and 200 3 mpa respectively showing good agreement with the experimental ones errors of 4 0 and 2 9 it can be seen that the numerical average strains at the ultimate load are much smaller than the experimental ones for example 1 03 versus 2 75 in the first specimen the slopes of the load displacement curves show apparent differences in elastic stiffness see fig 15 one of the reasons for that is the existence of gaps between the unloaded edges of specimens and the clamping fixtures in the experiments the gap allowing the x displacement in each unloaded edge also causes a small z displacement in the unloaded edge during the loading process this z displacement finally induces a larger experimental x displacement for the specimens nevertheless zero displacement constraints are imposed at the unloaded edges in the finite element analysis similar issues were also observed in the compressive tests of stiffened panels such as fig 12 in kim et al 2009 fig 20 in xu and guedes soares 2013c and fig 10 in liu et al 2021 it should be mentioned that in the experiments the gaps of edge supports are inevitable to allow the uniaxial sliding movements in the ultimate loading process when comparing the numerical results it is also observed that the in tension pillars increase slightly the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel 3 0 the small discrepancy of numerical results can be also found in the experimental one 1 9 thus it can be concluded that the pillars are designed to control only the lateral deflection of stiffened panels 5 2 progressive collapse process and permanent deformation the numerical progressive collapse process and permanent deformation shape of panel specimens are presented in fig 16 generally the tendency of the experimental out of plane deformations can be captured by the simulations as there are the gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures in the experiments the numerical lateral deformations are much smaller than the experimental ones both specimens collapse at a similar failure mode under combined uniaxial and lateral pressures initially the panels undergo elastic deformation and afterwards the stresses are concentrated at the longitudinal stiffeners step 1 in fig 16 the stiffeners are much weaker compared to the longitudinal girders and the plate components with the increase of the loading buckling occurs at the longitudinal stiffeners and the stresses also start to be concentrated at the plate components and the openings on the web of longitudinal girders step 2 in fig 16 finally plastic buckling is developed at the mid span leading to the overall structural collapse step 3 in fig 16 compared to the first specimen the stress concentrations are more obvious in the second specimen with pillars due to their constraints 5 3 stress the resulting numerical von mises stresses of two key points presented in fig 7 compared to the experimental results are shown in fig 17 here the points in the longitudinal girder p5 and stiffener p6 are selected more details about the distribution of numerical von mises stresses at the ultimate limit state can be found in step 3 in fig 16 in general the experimental stresses are predicted approximately by the simulations except for p6 in the first specimen in the beginning the numerical initial stresses induced by the lateral load are very small since the well defined boundary leads to better stress transfer and smaller stress in the structure afterwards numerical and experimental stresses are close during the axial loading process for the first specimen the earlier stress concentration at the longitudinal stiffener p6 in the experiment may be induced by the boundary constraints 6 comparison of empirical formulae the finite element results are compared with the existing formulae for ultimate compressive strength to further investigate the structural behaviour of long span stiffened panels 6 1 numerical results for comparison for reference some influence factors that are not considered in the empirical formulae are analysed numerically to show their effects on the ultimate strength 6 1 1 effect of imperfections and lateral loads the initial out of plane deformation is integrated directly into the finite element analysis in section 4 here two more simulations are performed omitting the initial deformation the comparisons only show 2 3 and 2 1 larger ultimate strength for the first and second specimens respectively it illustrates that the initial geometrical imperfections affect the elastic plastic buckling strength slightly in the present study two more simulations are performed omitting the lateral loads the numerical results only show 1 0 and 1 3 larger ultimate strength for the first and second specimens respectively the lateral load affects slightly the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panels since the lateral load is relatively small it indicates that the design pressure of the ship deck affects slightly the ultimate strength of deck structures under axial compression the deck design pressure mainly affects the out of plane deformation related to the bending stiffness 6 1 2 effect of girder openings the multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders affect the buckling and ultimate strength of stiffened panels two more simulations are performed without these openings see fig 18 it can be seen that the multi openings on girders reduce the ultimate strength of 6 9 and 12 0 for the first and second specimens respectively it indicates that the girder openings affect larger the compressive strength of stiffened panel with in tension pillars this phenomenon may be caused by different failure patterns see fig 16 where a smaller lateral deflection exists in the stiffened panel with in tension pillars the bending stiffness of longitudinal girders plays a more important role in the contribution of ultimate compressive strength when the lateral deflection is constrained by the pillars 6 2 analysis of empirical formulae the principal parameters affecting the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels are the plate and column slenderness ratio β and λ 1 β b t p σ y e 2 λ a π r σ y e in ship structures the practical range of β for the plate component and λ for the stiffener associated with plating is 1 0 4 5 and 0 15 0 90 respectively smith 1975 in passenger ship structures the typical range of β and λ are 2 0 6 0 and 0 15 0 40 respectively in the present study the panel specimen is composed of three types of stiffeners with an attached plate see fig 19 for the widths of plating 170 mm and 205 mm see fig 2 the β values are analysed at 2 54 and 3 06 respectively the λ values are analysed at 0 23 0 89 and 0 96 for the three stiffeners with an attached plate respectively seven existing empirical formulae are used to calculate the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels see table 2 as there are several β and λ values for the panel specimen its ultimate strength σ u av σ y i e the ratio of average stress and yield stress is analysed by 3 σ u av σ y n 1 σ u 1 a 1 n 2 σ u 2 a 2 n 3 σ u 3 a 3 σ y n 1 a 1 n 2 a 2 n 3 a 3 n and a are the total number and the cross sectional area of stiffeners associated with plating respectively σ u1 σ u2 and σ u3 are the ultimate strength of three stiffeners with an attached plate see fig 19 in the experiments the analysed ratios of average stress and yield stress are 0 50 and 0 51 for the first and second specimens respectively when taking the average yield stress of two materials 406 5 mpa the experimental normalised strength is slightly smaller than the analytical results see table 2 and the formula proposed by lin 1985 predicts the closest value 7 conclusions experimental and finite element analyses have been performed of the ultimate strength of long span stiffened panels subjected to combined lateral and uniaxial loads revealing the progressive collapse mechanism of the stiffened panels without and with in tension pillars the pillars affect slightly the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel although they affect strongly the out of plane deformation in the experiments it is impossible to satisfy the idealised conditions such as zero displacements at the supports for this reason the sequencing of the accuracy of numerical prediction is the ultimate load structural stress and deformation or displacement for the specimens the empirical formula proposed by lin 1985 predicts approximately the ultimate strength the effect of lateral load is very small on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel in the present study since the design pressure on the upper decks of large passenger ships is very small 0 32 t m2 the minor effect was also observed in liu et al 2021 demonstrating that the deck pressure load affects slightly the deck ultimate compressive strength the ship is subjected to cyclic bending moments and thus further experiments need to be performed to assess the deck structure under alternate compression and tension as determined numerically by liu and guedes soares 2020 credit authorship contribution statement

openings are often used in the top of large spaces without inner columns such as the theatre and the lounge in large passenger ships this design accompanied by in tension pillars above the long span stiffened panel can decrease the deck deflection largely in this paper experimental and finite element analysis is performed of the ultimate compressive strength of two long span stiffened panels subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads the comparison of experimental results shows that the in tension pillars only increase slightly the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel the experimental results show agreement with the simulations performed by the ansys finite element solver the validated numerical results illustrate the buckling and ultimate behaviour of long span stiffened panels with their progressive collapse processes the analysed ultimate loads are compared to the results calculated by seven existing empirical formulae the finite element analysis also discusses the effect of girder openings on the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel keywords ultimate strength stiffened panel in tension pillar experiment numerical simulation passenger ship deck 1 introduction large passenger ships specifically for cruises are multi decked ships equipped with all luxury and necessary amenities the special requirements complicate the design issues in the superstructure of passenger ships it is required to utilise the load carrying capability of the superstructure for the longitudinal strength in the design of passenger ships various novel structural types are introduced to satisfy the structural strength and function such as the long span stiffened panel 1 1 long span stiffened panel long span stiffened panels are often used in the top of large spaces without inner columns such as the theatre and the lounge in large passenger ships see fig 1 the ship deck panels are subjected to both uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment and lateral pressure load by the accommodation and public spaces the plate thickness in the superstructure is often designed just to satisfy the minimum requirement of the thickness of deck plating 5 0 mm in classification society rules such as lr 2020 in these special design considerations there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the buckling and ultimate strength of thin plates andric and zanic 2010 pei et al 2020 the buckling of thin plates is to be carefully checked in upper decks where local loads are low but the hull girder stress can be high to increase the bending stiffness of deck panels and to take the lightweight into consideration the longitudinal and transverse girders are often designed with high webs and multi openings on the webs these openings can be also used for running heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems and passing pipes or cables to further decrease the deflection of long span stiffened panels pillars in tension are installed above 1 2 ultimate strength analysis zhang 2016 and kim et al 2018 reviewed the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels analysed by employing experimental numerical empirical and analytical methods the buckling and ultimate strength of stiffened panels are affected by the effective plate and stiffener slenderness ratio experimental method is one of the most rigorous approaches to analyse the buckling and ultimate behaviour of structures for conventional stiffened panels many experiments on plates and stiffened panels were carried out in the literature e g ghavami and khedmati 2006 gordo and guedes soares 2008 2012 xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b 2021b manco et al 2019 kong et al 2020 and liu et al 2021 experimental results are often used to derive empirical formulae and to validate the numerical and analytical methods finite element analysis is the preferred tool for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened structures generally the buckling and ultimate behaviour of structures can be predicted approximately when the boundary conditions and the material nonlinearities are well defined e g xu et al 2013 2017 tekgoz et al 2015 kim et al 2017 li et al 2018 doan et al 2020 and xu and guedes soares 2021a the finite element analysis can provide an in depth understanding of the strength of stiffened structures empirical formula is the most rapid method to predict the ultimate strength e g paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 2019 2020 xu et al 2018 and ao et al 2019 however their accuracy relies not only on a large number of accidental observations experimental and numerical results but also on an in depth understanding of the mechanical behaviour of structures empirical formulae are often proposed to analyse the stiffened plates whose thicknesses are larger than 10 mm for thin plates 10 mm the buckling and ultimate behaviour should be checked carefully analytical methods have been developed for predicting the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened panels based on failure mode calculations e g paik et al 2001 paik and lee 2005 brubak et al 2013 andric et al 2014 alps ulsap 2016 and ozdemir et al 2018 one of the most famous methods is the alps ulsap 2016 where the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel based on six individual failure modes are computed and then the lowest value is selected as the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panel generally the ultimate compressive strength of intact stiffened panels using various methods has been well investigated however the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with a variety of openings such as the openings on the plating and the web of the stiffener is not well understood furthermore plates with in tension pillars are not found in earlier studies experimental and numerical methods are the most reliable tools for analysing novel structures liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 recently doan et al 2020 and liu et al 2020 analysed numerically the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels discussing the effect of stiffener openings the openings take an essential part in the change of stress distribution and ultimate load carrying capacity of stiffened panels the existence of openings can cause structural failure stress concentration and ultimate strength reduction there are different collapse modes for stiffened panels with and without openings on longitudinal and transverse girders in the conventional analysis of continuous stiffened panels the displacement at transverse frames and longitudinal girders are constrained as they are assumed to be strong enough not to produce lateral deflection e g xu et al 2018 however the openings on longitudinal girders reduce their axial stiffness and the collapse of the stiffened panel is affected strongly by the plastic buckling of longitudinal girders with web openings doan et al 2020 there are obvious lateral deflections for the longitudinal girders in the actual condition thus the idealised boundary condition i e zero lateral deflection is an unreasonable assumption for analysing the stiffened panel with openings on longitudinal girders generally its ultimate compressive strength needs to be further investigated besides the openings on longitudinal girders the thin plating is another characteristic of the long span stiffened panels in the upper decks of large passenger ships as the buckling modes of thin plates are complex and diverse it is challenging to apply the empirical or analytical method for analysing accurately their buckling and ultimate strength the actual load condition of ship deck panels can be well represented by combined axial compression and lateral pressure boundary conditions affect strongly the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and periodic and symmetric boundary conditions are used in the longitudinal direction the periodic boundary condition gives logical modelling to continuous stiffened panels xu et al 2013 doan et al 2020 this condition well generates the actual situation of continuity between individual stiffened panels 1 3 present work the present paper performs experimental and finite element analysis of the ultimate compressive strength of continuous stiffened panels with multi openings on the girders they are subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads the effect of in tension pillars on the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel is evaluated the objective of the present study is to analyse the ultimate strength of long span stiffened panels for constructing the top of large spaces in large passenger ships the experimental and numerical results are analysed in terms of the force displacement relationship buckling collapse process permanent deformation and stress distribution of each specimen the nonlinear finite element analysis also discusses the effect of girder openings on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels seven existing empirical formulae are used to calculate the ultimate compressive stress of panels compared to the experimental results 2 experimental details the experimental programme evaluates the ultimate compressive strength of two long span stiffened panels under combined uniaxial and lateral loads see fig 2 it aims to investigate the effect of initial lateral deflection on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels the lateral load is to simulate the design pressure load of the deck due to the activities of its use and the structural self weight the uniaxial load is to simulate the uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment 2 1 test specimens the geometrical dimensions of stiffened panels are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the scales of length and plate thickness are about 1 10 and 1 2 33 respectively these two stiffened panels are designed without and with six pillars in tension denoted by first specimen and second specimen respectively the longitudinal and transverse girders are designed using high webs with multi circular and elongated circular openings inside this type of stiffened panel provides much larger bending stiffness with smaller deflection under lateral pressure the structural components of panel specimens are built of 3 0 mm and 4 0 mm plates the plating has 3 0 mm thickness the longitudinal and transverse girder are t45 20 4 0 4 0 mm tee bar the longitudinal stiffener is 20 4 0 mm flat bar and the circular pillar is φ50 4 0 mm the structural strength depends on the geometry of the structural components and their material properties the mechanical properties of the steels that are used to fabricate the specimens are defined by quasi static tensile tests the uniaxial tensile tests are performed following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile stress strain relationships are presented in fig 3 the yield stresses of the 3 0 mm and 4 0 mm steel materials used in the specimens are 414 mpa and 399 mpa respectively the geometrical initial imperfection on each specimen plating is measured by a 3d laser scanner and the boundary lines of the specimen compose of a reference plane zero for the first and second specimens 1630 1780 mm2 the overall maximum out of plane deformations are 3 5 mm and 3 0 mm respectively fig 4 the initial imperfection is affected by the fabrication process showing an irregular shape the initial imperfection of plate components between stiffeners is about 2 0 mm similar to the imperfection calculated by the empirical formula 0 1tβ 2 0 1 3 0 2 542 1 94 mm 2 2 experimental setup the long span stiffened panel is supported by the longitudinal and transverse bulkheads the load and boundary conditions fig 5 are prescribed appropriately in the experiments as shown in fig 6 the experimental setup represents the edge constraints of stiffened panels required in lr 2016 and abs 2020 the lateral and uniaxial forces are enforced by four and seven hydraulic cylinders respectively in each loading system the synchronization of hydraulic cylinders is achieved by controlling an oil pump and a load transducer is used to measure the output force of one more synchronous hydraulic cylinder fig 6b for imposing the lateral load in the experiments concentrated loads are applied at four intersections of the longitudinal and transverse girders instead of the uniform pressure the uniaxial loading position is reinforced by a rigid beam to provide a uniformly distributed load for the specimens and to avoid the stress concentration the unloaded edges are simply supported by the clamping fixtures where the z displacement and y rotation are constrained see figs 5 and 6 it should be mentioned that there are small gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures to allow the x displacement in the specimen edges the procedure for conducting each experiment is described as follows 1 the loading and unloading are repeated three times in the elastic stage to eliminate partially the weld induced residual stresses in the specimen and to calibrate the testing equipment and measuring instruments the maximum lateral and uniaxial loads are about 2 0 t and 35 0 t respectively 2 the lateral load is imposed by the hydraulic cylinders until 4 0 t out of plane load pressure of 1 38 t m2 firstly and then the uniaxial load is applied until the specimen collapses the experimental lateral pressure of 1 38 t m2 is scaled from the prototype design pressure of 0 32 t m2 with the scaling of 10 2 33 in large passenger ships the design pressure and the gravity of upper decks are about 0 32 t m2 and 0 06 t m2 respectively the lateral load is very small compared to the uniaxial load induced by the longitudinal bending the layout of the displacement transducers is shown in fig 7 three displacement transducers are installed at the uniaxial load locations to measure the uniaxial deformation of specimens and five displacement transducers are installed at the lateral locations to measure the out of plane deformation of specimens three direction strain gauges are arranged at the stress concentration regions and six key points are presented in fig 7 the finite element analyses were performed before the experiments to search the regions of stress concentration in the specimens 3 experimental results the experimental results present the effect of in tension pillars on the buckling and ultimate behaviour of long span stiffened panels the experimental results are analysed in terms of the force displacement relationship deformation and stress distribution of each specimen 3 1 axial load versus displacement the experimental axial load displacement curves of panel specimens are presented in fig 8 a the resulting axial force is the total uniaxial load applied by seven hydraulic cylinders and the resulting axial displacement is the mean value measured by three transducers at the load positions d1 d3 in fig 7 the experimental maximum applied loads i e the ultimate compressive strengths are 119 2 t and 121 5 t for the first and second specimens respectively it is observed that the panel with in tension pillars shows only 1 9 higher ultimate strength than the one without pillars it is demonstrated that the pillars only affect strongly the lateral deflection of the panel but have a very small influence on the ultimate compressive strength the resultant average stress strain relationships of the panel specimens are presented in fig 8b the average stress is calculated by dividing the applied external force to the original cross sectional area of the stiffened panel 5890 mm2 and the average strain is calculated by dividing the developed axial displacement by the original length of the panel 1630 mm here the average stresses are 202 4 mpa and 206 3 mpa for the first and second specimens respectively 3 2 lateral deformation 3 2 1 initial deformation under lateral load fig 9 shows the out of plane deformations measured by the d4 d8 displacement transducers when imposing the lateral load of 4 0 t it should be mentioned that the first specimen presents excessive lateral displacement because of the gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures nevertheless the in tension pillars decrease largely the lateral deformation in the second specimen generally the first specimen shows a long half wavelength deflection and the second specimen shows a wavelength deflection due to the constraint of pillars 3 2 2 deformation under ultimate load each specimen collapses when a sudden and significant deformation is observed accompanied by a noticeable reduction of the uniaxial external load the permanent deformation shapes of specimens are presented in fig 10 and their local deformations at the middle three spans are given in fig 11 the pillars affect the collapse mode of the stiffened panel but both specimens collapse at the spans where d6 and d7 transducers are placed see red lines in fig 11 flexural buckling occurs at the longitudinal girders and stiffeners with associated plates involving the yielding and stiffness loss of components fig 12 shows the lateral deformation at the mid span with increasing the axial imposed displacement both specimens show a similar deformation shape with the initial deformations presented in fig 9 generally the lateral deformation increases almost linearly with the uniaxial load similar to the linear relationship between uniaxial load and displacement see fig 8 the permanent lateral deflections of the plates are 12 0 mm and 7 4 mm for the first and second specimens respectively the first specimen shows a long half wavelength flexural buckling and collapses at the mid span and the second specimen shows a wavelength buckling due to the constraint of pillars 3 3 stress in the experiments von mises stresses can be obtained based on the data measured by the three direction strain gauges comparison of stresses at some key points presented in fig 7 is shown in fig 13 the analysed value takes the corresponding material yield stress 414 mpa and 399 mpa when exceeding this magnitude since the formulae of material mechanics for calculating the stresses are based on linear elasticity it is observed that the first specimen suffers material yielding earlier than the second specimen especially at the longitudinal stiffener p4 and girder p5 it is mainly because the first specimen suffers much larger out of plane deformation at the mid span see d6 in fig 12 in both specimens the stiffeners yield earlier than the plates illustrating that the buckling of stiffened panels is dominated by the buckling and yielding of stiffeners it should be mentioned that the stresses in the panel specimens are much smaller than the material yield stress when only imposing the lateral load of 4 0 t the results of initial stresses under lateral load can be found at null axial load in fig 13 4 finite element model finite element analysis of stiffened panels is performed using the commercial software ansys fig 14 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the high level of geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacement and the finite strain are also activated the finite element model is generated using shell181 elements to analyse the local buckling in the girders six finite elements in the web of girders are generated and the element size is selected at about 7 5 mm this mesh density is sufficient to capture the global and local buckling of plates and stiffeners accurately the finite element model consists of 59 749 nodes and 58 898 shell elements the material properties of the high strength steels with a thickness of 3 0 mm and 4 0 mm are defined by an elastic perfectly plastic material model with the yield stress of 414 mpa and of 399 mpa respectively young s modulus of 206 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 are also defined the actual geometries of stiffened panels with the scanned initial geometrical imperfections fig 4 are used to create the finite element models similar modelling was presented by yu et al 2019 and liu et al 2021 as the initial preloading cycles were used to eliminate the residual stress partially in the experiments the welding induced residual stress is not explicitly modelled in the finite element analysis for the loading edge only the x displacement is free in the direction the external load is applied and for the reactive edge the fully clamped condition is considered see fig 14 the z displacement and y rotation are constrained at all the nodes along the unloaded edges this condition is to generate the actual boundary of specimens in the experiments the uniaxial load is applied at all the nodes along the loading edge and the ultimate load of the specimens is determined from the peak value of the uniaxial load at the initial loading the total lateral load of 4 0 t is applied at the nodes where the lateral hydraulic cylinders are placed 5 finite element results 5 1 axial load versus displacement the numerical axial load displacement curves of specimens compared to the experimental results are presented in fig 15 in the first and second specimens the numerical ultimate average stresses are 194 4 mpa and 200 3 mpa respectively showing good agreement with the experimental ones errors of 4 0 and 2 9 it can be seen that the numerical average strains at the ultimate load are much smaller than the experimental ones for example 1 03 versus 2 75 in the first specimen the slopes of the load displacement curves show apparent differences in elastic stiffness see fig 15 one of the reasons for that is the existence of gaps between the unloaded edges of specimens and the clamping fixtures in the experiments the gap allowing the x displacement in each unloaded edge also causes a small z displacement in the unloaded edge during the loading process this z displacement finally induces a larger experimental x displacement for the specimens nevertheless zero displacement constraints are imposed at the unloaded edges in the finite element analysis similar issues were also observed in the compressive tests of stiffened panels such as fig 12 in kim et al 2009 fig 20 in xu and guedes soares 2013c and fig 10 in liu et al 2021 it should be mentioned that in the experiments the gaps of edge supports are inevitable to allow the uniaxial sliding movements in the ultimate loading process when comparing the numerical results it is also observed that the in tension pillars increase slightly the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel 3 0 the small discrepancy of numerical results can be also found in the experimental one 1 9 thus it can be concluded that the pillars are designed to control only the lateral deflection of stiffened panels 5 2 progressive collapse process and permanent deformation the numerical progressive collapse process and permanent deformation shape of panel specimens are presented in fig 16 generally the tendency of the experimental out of plane deformations can be captured by the simulations as there are the gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures in the experiments the numerical lateral deformations are much smaller than the experimental ones both specimens collapse at a similar failure mode under combined uniaxial and lateral pressures initially the panels undergo elastic deformation and afterwards the stresses are concentrated at the longitudinal stiffeners step 1 in fig 16 the stiffeners are much weaker compared to the longitudinal girders and the plate components with the increase of the loading buckling occurs at the longitudinal stiffeners and the stresses also start to be concentrated at the plate components and the openings on the web of longitudinal girders step 2 in fig 16 finally plastic buckling is developed at the mid span leading to the overall structural collapse step 3 in fig 16 compared to the first specimen the stress concentrations are more obvious in the second specimen with pillars due to their constraints 5 3 stress the resulting numerical von mises stresses of two key points presented in fig 7 compared to the experimental results are shown in fig 17 here the points in the longitudinal girder p5 and stiffener p6 are selected more details about the distribution of numerical von mises stresses at the ultimate limit state can be found in step 3 in fig 16 in general the experimental stresses are predicted approximately by the simulations except for p6 in the first specimen in the beginning the numerical initial stresses induced by the lateral load are very small since the well defined boundary leads to better stress transfer and smaller stress in the structure afterwards numerical and experimental stresses are close during the axial loading process for the first specimen the earlier stress concentration at the longitudinal stiffener p6 in the experiment may be induced by the boundary constraints 6 comparison of empirical formulae the finite element results are compared with the existing formulae for ultimate compressive strength to further investigate the structural behaviour of long span stiffened panels 6 1 numerical results for comparison for reference some influence factors that are not considered in the empirical formulae are analysed numerically to show their effects on the ultimate strength 6 1 1 effect of imperfections and lateral loads the initial out of plane deformation is integrated directly into the finite element analysis in section 4 here two more simulations are performed omitting the initial deformation the comparisons only show 2 3 and 2 1 larger ultimate strength for the first and second specimens respectively it illustrates that the initial geometrical imperfections affect the elastic plastic buckling strength slightly in the present study two more simulations are performed omitting the lateral loads the numerical results only show 1 0 and 1 3 larger ultimate strength for the first and second specimens respectively the lateral load affects slightly the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panels since the lateral load is relatively small it indicates that the design pressure of the ship deck affects slightly the ultimate strength of deck structures under axial compression the deck design pressure mainly affects the out of plane deformation related to the bending stiffness 6 1 2 effect of girder openings the multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders affect the buckling and ultimate strength of stiffened panels two more simulations are performed without these openings see fig 18 it can be seen that the multi openings on girders reduce the ultimate strength of 6 9 and 12 0 for the first and second specimens respectively it indicates that the girder openings affect larger the compressive strength of stiffened panel with in tension pillars this phenomenon may be caused by different failure patterns see fig 16 where a smaller lateral deflection exists in the stiffened panel with in tension pillars the bending stiffness of longitudinal girders plays a more important role in the contribution of ultimate compressive strength when the lateral deflection is constrained by the pillars 6 2 analysis of empirical formulae the principal parameters affecting the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels are the plate and column slenderness ratio β and λ 1 β b t p σ y e 2 λ a π r σ y e in ship structures the practical range of β for the plate component and λ for the stiffener associated with plating is 1 0 4 5 and 0 15 0 90 respectively smith 1975 in passenger ship structures the typical range of β and λ are 2 0 6 0 and 0 15 0 40 respectively in the present study the panel specimen is composed of three types of stiffeners with an attached plate see fig 19 for the widths of plating 170 mm and 205 mm see fig 2 the β values are analysed at 2 54 and 3 06 respectively the λ values are analysed at 0 23 0 89 and 0 96 for the three stiffeners with an attached plate respectively seven existing empirical formulae are used to calculate the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels see table 2 as there are several β and λ values for the panel specimen its ultimate strength σ u av σ y i e the ratio of average stress and yield stress is analysed by 3 σ u av σ y n 1 σ u 1 a 1 n 2 σ u 2 a 2 n 3 σ u 3 a 3 σ y n 1 a 1 n 2 a 2 n 3 a 3 n and a are the total number and the cross sectional area of stiffeners associated with plating respectively σ u1 σ u2 and σ u3 are the ultimate strength of three stiffeners with an attached plate see fig 19 in the experiments the analysed ratios of average stress and yield stress are 0 50 and 0 51 for the first and second specimens respectively when taking the average yield stress of two materials 406 5 mpa the experimental normalised strength is slightly smaller than the analytical results see table 2 and the formula proposed by lin 1985 predicts the closest value 7 conclusions experimental and finite element analyses have been performed of the ultimate strength of long span stiffened panels subjected to combined lateral and uniaxial loads revealing the progressive collapse mechanism of the stiffened panels without and with in tension pillars the pillars affect slightly the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel although they affect strongly the out of plane deformation in the experiments it is impossible to satisfy the idealised conditions such as zero displacements at the supports for this reason the sequencing of the accuracy of numerical prediction is the ultimate load structural stress and deformation or displacement for the specimens the empirical formula proposed by lin 1985 predicts approximately the ultimate strength the effect of lateral load is very small on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel in the present study since the design pressure on the upper decks of large passenger ships is very small 0 32 t m2 the minor effect was also observed in liu et al 2021 demonstrating that the deck pressure load affects slightly the deck ultimate compressive strength the ship is subjected to cyclic bending moments and thus further experiments need to be performed to assess the deck structure under alternate compression and tension as determined numerically by liu and guedes soares 2020 credit authorship contribution statement

20338,welding as the most common joining technique causes welding deformations that reduce the geometrical accuracy of hull structures in conventional variation analysis welding distortion is not taken into account in this paper a compliant assembly variation modeling and analysis method is presented to investigate the impact of local weld induced shrinkage on the propagation relation from the initial deviation to the final assembly deviation in thin plate assembly first welding deformations in the form of inherent strains are incorporated into variation analysis model based on kirchhoff plate model additionally part deviations are also introduced via equivalent forces in order to consider the effects of geometrical variation on compliant assembly then other variation sources such as fixture locating errors are modeled as equality constraints of the mechanical variation model which are then transformed into boundary conditions with lagrange multiplier method with an additional stiffness matrix we describe concisely the coupling relationship between initial deviations and welding deformations caused by gaps and misalignments in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method numerical simulations and experimental verifications are carried out for two assembly cases and the results show that the present method has high prediction accuracy and efficiency this study provides a potential application for improving assembly dimensions considering the inevitable manufacturing deviations and welding deformations keywords compliant variation analysis welding distortion inherent strain initial deviations geometrical gap and misalignment 1 introduction welding is an important joining technique and widely used in many industrial applications such as in ocean engineering aerospace and automotive industries it is inevitable that welding deformation occur due to the non uniform heating and cooling cycle during welding process the continuous accumulation of welding deformation in multi station assembly processes affects the next stage of assembly and welding process as an example weld induced deformations in ship building will not only reduce the assembly dimension quality but also have a significant influence on the structural performance and safety of the ship roland et al 2004 at present weld induced structural deformation continues to pose a serious challenge in the construction process of ships therefore it is necessary to establish an accurate variation analysis model to improve the assembly quality and reduce welding distortion existing variation analysis models can be divided into rigid models and compliant models according to the deformability assumption of components based on the kinematics theory several rigid variation methods have been proposed for the assembly of block components including directly linearization method deterministic locating method etc chase et al 1995 gao et al 1998 wang et al 2003 but for thin walled strucutures the impact of part deformation on assembly quality has been observed which promote the development of compliant variations analysis methods to predict assembly geometric precision as an example method of influence coefficients mic hu and koren 1997 liu and hu 1997 is a widely used method to predict the final assembly variation this method established a linear relationship between the part deviation and the assembly deviation using finite element method furthermore camelio et al 2003 2004 extended mic to predict the dimensional variation propagation for a multi station compliant assembly using a state space model based on mic zhang and shi 2016a b developed a model to predict assembly deviation for compliant composite assembly for the assembly of aeronautical panels consisting of many parts and sub processes lin et al 2014 proposed a deviation propagation model based on substructure analysis which could reduce the model complexity as well as improve the computational efficiency during the assembly process it is assumed that the joining process itself does not generate any deformation previously research on thin plate assembly mainly focused on the global deviation propagation relation for compliant variation models such as mic and finite element methods then a sensitivity matrix is constructed to describe the influence of the initial variation unfortunately the effect of local welding deformation on variation simulation is neglected in most existing models which makes it difficult to carry out an accurate assembly analysis for hull structures in contrast to mic variation simulation in shipbuilding is heavily influenced by geometric deviations and welded distortions a priori knowledge of the welding deformations of each weld seam is vital to predicting assembly variation efficiently during the welding process at present the thermal elastic plastic tep finite element method and the inherent strain method are two main numerical methods to predict welding distortion ueda and yamakawa 1971 first established the theoretical formulations of the tep model to simulate the entire welding process in order to simulate multi pass welding processes of plant piping quickly and accurately an analysis code based on the iterative substructure method was developed maekawa et al 2015 wang et al 2012 using tep method seo et al 2018 investigated the thermal distortion mechanism and the effect of welding sequences on thin plate panel deformation during the assembly process tep method as an effective tool has been widely used to predict thermal field welding deformation and residual stress in the welding process this method however is mainly used for small scale structures since the complicated thermo mechanical behavior of welding leads to an enormous computaition burden for large scale engineering structures as an alternative to the time consuming tep method ueda and yuan 1992 proposed the inherent strain theory to calculate welding deformation and residual stress based on elasticity analysis additionally the inherent strain method can be roughly divided into two categories temperature load method ha 2008 and equivalent load method park and an 2015 2017 park et al 2013 podder et al 2016 in the former methods the inherent strains are converted into a temperature loads incorporating with the aritificial thermal expansion coefficients to derive welding deformation to produce welding deformation the artificial thermal expansion coefficients are assigned as a material property temperature load methods only consider the normal strain components of inherent strain but ignore the effect of shear strains which is non significant in a pure thermal expansion process however the angular deformation caused by shear strain can not be obtained by the temperature load method such in a t welded structure according to the latter methods the inherent strains at the weld line and adjacent area are converted into internal forces and moments taking into account the effect of transverse shear strain components as an extension of the inherent strain method biswas et al 2013 proposed an average plastic strain method to evaluate weld induced deformation for complex structures in order to investigate the influence of welding induced buckling wang et al 2018 developed a computational model based on inherent deformation to evaluate the out of plane welding distortion and welding buckling condition for investigation of the effect of assembly sequence and gap on the final deformation interface element model deng et al 2007 2013 deng and murakawa 2008 woo et al 2020 was developed based on inherent strain theory the prediction of welding deformation in most existing welding simulation models is based on nominal part geometry which may differ from actual distortion as a result of part manufacturing deviation in addition welding simulations based on actual parts are rarely found in literatures liam gannon et al 2012 studied the effects of post weld residual stress and distortion on the ultimate strength of ship structures davies et al 2015 investigated the relationship between the initial plate profiles and the post weld deformation of thin butt welded plates the final deformation of the plate after welding is strongly influenced by the pre existing deformation of the plate using first order shear deformation shell theory combined with the equivalent single layer of shell element goncalves et al 2016 proposed a homogenization method to analyze sandwich structures characterized by manufacturing induced imperfections by using this method local imperfections are described by representative volume elements while global imperfections are described by equivalent shell stiffness the effect of geometric imperfections on the vibration of isotropic rectangular plates was investigated makvandi et al 2018 by using the mindlin theory in which geometric imperfections in the same form as the first buckling mode shape are incorporated into the von kármán nonlinear strain displacement relation additionally novotný et al 2018 proposed a novel numerical method to generate geometrical imperfections in welding simulations using eigenvalue analysis method an initial imperfection can be incorporated into the finite element model for the creation of a new finite element model the influence of imperfections on residual distortion of welded parts was investigated using the new model while traditional researches on welding distortion prediction mostly focus on the deterministic approaches which neglect the impact of parts variation during welding a combination of variation analysis and welding simulation is necessary for obtaining the final assembly deformations in the statistical sense pahkamaa et al 2012 investigated the effect of geometrical variations and welding distortions on the final assembly springback the welding deformation as a random value was incorporated into a variation model which was extracted from a welding database based on nominal parts based on welding experiment wärmefjord et al 2016 proposed a virtual geometry assurance process for welded assemblies they analyzed the effects of part position assembly fixture variations and welding induced distortions on the final assembly variations to consider the effects of welding distortion as a form of equivalent force chung 2006 proposed an improved method of influence coefficients imic for ships and offshore structures choi and chung 2015 extended the influence coefficient calculation to account for the distortion of the joining process they established a linear relationship between the welding distortion and the assembly deviation using a transformation matrix the imic is used by choi and chung 2018 to develop a variation simulation model that includes the welding deformation as the result of pre stress in the form of an additional stiffness matrix additionally lee and chung 2019 used imic to develop a variation simulation model that can reflect the coupling relationship between out of plane variation and in plane variation as part of these methods welding deformation as a prescribed displacement boundary condition is incorporated into the variation model however the relationship between initial deviation and welding distortion is still unclear the present work makes an attempt to establish a novel compliant assembly variation analysis model with consideration of random initial deviation and welding shrinkage the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theoretical develpment of the proposed compliant assembly variation analysis method which consists of three main steps 1 part manufacturing deviations and welding induced deformations are introduced in the form of equivalent additional force based on inherent strain and kirchhoff plate theory 2 fixture locating errors and other variation sources are introduced into the variation model as prescribed displacement boundary condition using lagrange multiplier method 3 the coupling relationship between initial deviations and welding deformations caused by gaps misalignments is concisely described with an additional stiffness matrix in section 3 the proposed method is validated with two small scale butt welded plate cases and a ship block subassembly case and the numerical and experimental results are discussed finally some conclusion is given in the last section 4 2 theoretical modeling of assembly variation 2 1 variation analysis for welded assemblies the final assembly variations are not only caused by part deviations but are also influenced by welding deformations during the welding process additionally the welding distortions are determined by welding parameters e g welding voltage welding current welding speed etc welding sequences and welding tool errors furthermore gaps and misalignments caused by part deviations in the positioning stage also affect the final welding distortion this paper aims to investigate the influence of local welding deformation on assembly variation by applying the welding simulation to actual parts therefore it is necessary to adopt some reasonable strategies to consider the main influence factors while disregarding the minor influence factors for the variation propagation process in this analysis some reasonable assumptions and conditions areset 1 friction force contact area gravity etc are ignored 2 the fixtures and welding guns are assumed rigid and 3 assembly operations are performed in a single station as illustrated in fig 1 a type of thin plate welded structure assembly process is comprised of four basic steps step 1 locating parts to the fixtures fig 1a compliant parts are loaded to fixtures with the deterministic positioning by 3 2 1 locating principle menassa and devries 1989 and over constrained positioning by n 2 1 with n 3 locating principle cai at el 1996 the 3 2 1 locating fixtures are used here to constrain a rigid body motion for welded parts however n 3 holding fixtures are used to prevent excessive deformation of non rigid parts during the positioning process the actual positions of the locating fixtures solid triangles differ from the nominal positions the dotted dashed lines of the locating points on the plates thus the part total deviations v u consist of part manufacturing deviations v md u and fixture position errors v fd u if each plate has more than one source of variation then the total deviation of these two parts is given by 1 v u p 1 v u p 1 md v u p 1 fd t and v u p 2 v u p 2 md v u p 2 fd t step 2 clamping parts to the nominal position fig 1b in order to clamp the parts to the nominal position a set of clamping forces f u p 1 and f u p 2 are applied to the plates given the part stiffness matrices k u p 1 and k u p 2 the clamping forces can be calculated as follows 2 f u p 1 k u p 1 v u p 1 and f u p 2 k u p 2 v u p 2 step 3 welding the compliant parts fig 1c the two parts are welded together while the clamping forces are still being applied due to the non uniform heating and cooling cycle process of the welded region the weld induced energy u w will lead to dimensional and geometrical deviations as well as part deformations besides the gap and misalignment caused by initial geometric deviations have a great influence on the welding deformation in other words the welding distortions are subdivided into two deformation patterns the local shrinkage from nominal components and the other deformation induced by gaps and misalignments in the current study the welding distortions as a form of the additional stiffness matrix and equivalent force are introduced into the assembly process to calculate final assembly deviation step 4 releasing clamps and assembly springback fig 1d the welded parts will have a springback after the applied clamping forces are removed from the parts the spingback deformations depend on the springback force vector f w which is relating to initial deviation and weld induced deformation after computation of the global stiffness matrix k w the assembled global force displacement equations can be expressed as 3 k w v w f w note that the global stiffness matrix k w depends on the stiffness of unwelded parts k u and the additional stiffness matrix k a introduced by welding technology in step 3 the details will be presented in the latter part of this section besides the fixture s constraints and other connected constraints are transformed into displacement boundary conditions and the displacement constraints can be expressed as multi freedom constraint equations 4 l v w d where l is coefficient matrix for the constraint equation d d 1 d 2 d m n t is the displacement vector here m and n are the number of degrees of freedom for pate 1 and plate 2 respectively according eqs 3 and 4 the final assembly springback deviations vector v w can be obtained by lagrange multiplier method quyen et al 2019 which has an important advantage for treating multi freedom constraints 5 k w l t l 0 v w λ f w d where λ denotes the lagrange multiplier vector in this paper newton raphson approach can be used to solve the incremental updates of the stiffness matrix eq 5 can be expressed in an iterative form as 6 k w v w i 1 l t λ i 1 f w l v w i 1 d where i denotes the ith iteration combining the penalty method with the lagrange multiplier method quyen et al 2019 multiplication of l t to the second equation in eq 6 with an initial guess λ 0 0 and rearranging terms yields 7 v w i k w s l t l 1 f w s l t d where s is a diagonal matrix of penalty weights 2 2 construction of the stiffness matrix and force vector of weld induced deformation as mentioned above the coupled problems of the relationship between the initial deviation and welding deformation are key issues for the assembly variation analysis of welded components on the one hand most researchers on variation analysis have focused primarily on the initial deviations without considering weld induced deformation which affects the final product during the assembly process on the other hand significant efforts neglect the influence of geometrical deviations e g plate thickness misalignments and gaps on welding deformations as shown in fig 2 the geometrical deviations of welding joint directly lead to the change of heat flow input at the welding seam and further cause the deviation of temperature field and stress field beyond the prediction of the deterministic theory which also adds unknown difficulty to control the welding deformation therefore weld induced energy should be considered in step 3 to reflect the change of input heat source energy considering the time consuming costs and convergence of thermo elastic plastic analysis for welding problems interface element deng et al 2007 2013 deng and murakawa 2008 murakawa et al 2012 woo et al 2020 based on elastic fem is applied to consider the effect of gap and misalignment in the welding process as such the governing equation in a weak form by the principle of virtual work is written to account for welding distortions 8 δ δ u int δ u w δ w ext 0 where is the total energy u int is the internal energy u w is the weld induced energy w ext is the external energy and δ denotes the variational operator it is worth mentioning that weld induced energy u w to be modeled can include the one of base energy from nominal parts as well as additional energy from non nominal parts caused by gaps and misalignments based on inherent strain method the additional term δ u w is computed as 9 δ u w a n δ ε m δ κ d a where n and m refer to the stress resultant tensor and the bending moment tensor respectively ε and κ are the tensors of strain and curvature to overcome these limitations and difficulties of the change of stress field the welding distortion from nominal parts as a form of the equivalent force f is introduced into the assembly process to calculate the final assembly deviation to consider the effects of gaps and misalignments caused by initial geometrical deviations an additional stiffness matrix k a v gap is introduced as a new term in eq 3 which is related to the initial geometrical deviation v gap the detailed procedure is presented in appendix a according to eqs 8 and 9 the relationship between the springback force and displacement can be rewritten as 10 k u p 1 k u p 2 k a v gap v w f u p 1 f u p 2 f where k a is the additional stiffness matrix f u and f in the form of the equivalent force of the initial deviation and welding distortion are introduced into the assembly process to calculate final assembly deviation by the plate model based elastic analysis method details in appendix a the stiffness matrix and springback force in eq 3 is replaced by the additional terms for welding distortion in eq 8 to apply boundary conditions eq 4 the final assembly springback deviations vector v w can be obtained by 11 v w i k u p 1 k u p 2 k a v gap s l t l 1 f u p 1 f u p 2 f s l t d in this study eq 11 establishes the relationship between initial deviations and assembly springback deviations also the statistical deviation analysis with monte carlo simulation can be performed which accounts for the influence of initial variation such as the part manufacturing deviations fixture position errors and the gap and the misalignment 2 3 solution procedure of the present method the solution procedure of the proposed method is shown in fig 3 in the beginning part manufacturing deviations are introduced in the form of equivalent strains based on kirchhoff plate theory besides the locating fixture errors and other deviations are converted into boundary conditions by lagrange multiplier method secondly in order to obtain an accurate variation model welding distortion in the form of additional equivalent force is integrated into the present model specifically gaps and misalignments induced by the initial geometric deviations are modeled as the nonlinear spring which significantly reduces the dimensional accuracy in this study an additional stiffness matrix is applied to express the effect of gaps and misalignments on the final assembly deformation finally a statistical deviation analysis for the prediction of assembly springback is performed to account for multiple variation sources including part deviations fixture errors and welding distortions 3 numerical examples and discussions three study cases are presented in this section two butt welded plates one ship block subassembly including two experiments for deterministic deformation prediction and analysis as well as a numerical simulation for statistical deviation 3 1 case study of butt welded plates 3 1 1 validation of the present model in this section we use a two plate assembly case a and case b as an example to evaluate how part deviations combine with welding deformations to influence final assembly springback the dimensions of each plate are 150 mm 150 mm 2 mm as shown in fig 4 a b the material of each part is aluminum alloy 6061 t6 in case a the thin plates are welded without an initial gap fig 4a while case b has an initial gap between the thin plates and the initial gap is set to be 0 5 mm see fig 4b for validation purposes two plates are butt welded with a fronius cmt4000 welding system see fig 5 a filler wire er4043 with a diameter of 1 2 mm is used and the shielding gas is 100 ar the detailed welding parameters are summarized in table 1 for the welding assembly process the same restraint conditions are used in case a and case b in addition the welding distortions of specimens are measured using a three coordinate system handy scan 300tm measuring precision 0 01 mm horizontal resolution and 0 04 mm vertical resolution in order to use the inherent strain as an initial strain in the proposed method the inherent strain should be obtained beforehand a sequentially coupled three dimensional thermal elastic plastic analysis using abaqus is used in this study to predict inherent strain a two step solution procedure is adopted first the heat transfer analysis can be performed in order to obtain the temperature field second the mechanical analysis can be carried out by applying the temperature history results as an initial thermal load three dimensional eight node solid elements dc3d8 are applied in the thermal analysis and then are converted to c3d8r in the mechanical analysis a dense element mesh is used in the vicinity of the weld centerline while a coarser mesh is applied in the remaining zone the length of each element in the welding direction is 1 0 mm and the number of elements is four in the thickness direction the finite element mesh consists of 79200 elements and 100415 nodes for each case cases a and b are clamped with the same boundary condition as those of the experiments as shown in fig 5 the welding line bold line mesh model and clamping condition are also illustrated in fig 6 a comparison of the welding displacements for cases a and b under the same constraint conditions see fig 6 is shown in fig 7 fig 7 a b shows the longitudinal shrinkage distributions of the top surface for case a and case b with the maximum displacements of 0 0269 mm and 0 0328 mm respectively similarly fig 7 c d shows the transverse shrinkage distributions of the top surface for case a and case b with the maximum displacements of 0 0321 mm and 0 0359 mm respectively besides fig 7 e f shows the transverse bending angular distortion for case a and case b with the maximum displacements of 1 491 mm and 1 627 mm respectively as shown in fig 7 the longitudinal shrinkage and transverse shrinkage values are smaller than the out of plane deformation values furthermore with the impact of the initial gap these kinds of welding deformations are larger in case b than those in case a according to simulation results obtained by thermal elastic plastic fem the inherent strain components of the butt welded joint are shown in table 2 based on the inherent strain theory assembly deviation analysis is employed to predict the final assembly springback as well as considering part deviations and welding distortion as shown in fig 8 60 uniformly distributed nodes are selected as key points marked by circle to guarantee the measurement accuracy the deviations for each case are obtained from welding experiments as shown in appendix b according to the part deviation presented in appendix b the out of plane deformations of two cases case a and case b are discussed here to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method the comparison of the result from the experiment and the result from the proposed method is shown in fig 9 from fig 9a the maximum difference value of out of plane displacement z deviation between the experiment and the present method without considering part deviation is 0 4925 mm while the maximum difference between the experimental measurements and the present method considering part deviation is 0 2390 mm according to fig 9a the prediction results of the present method considering part deviation are highly consistent with the experimental results for case b the results by the present method are plotted in fig 9b it can be seen from fig 9b that the maximum difference between the experimental measurements and the present method is 0 3486 mm without taking into account part deviation in addition the maximum difference of the experimental measurements and the present method is 0 2469 mm when part deviation is considered as shown in these figures part deviations have a significant influence on the final welding deformation comparing fig 9a with fig 9b it also shows that these kinds of welding deformations calculated by case b are larger than that of case a with the impact of the initial gap 3 1 2 statistical variation analysis for more study of the variation propagation relationship between initial deviations and weld induced distortions we consider part deviations and fixture errors as the initial deviations during welding assembly for case a and case b six deviation points along with the welding line are selected as sources of part deviations and six measurement points are used to predict the assembly deviation based on these given sources of variation the location of part deviation point fixture positioning point and measurement point are listed in fig 10 and table 3 we assume that the part manufacturing deviations in z direction are 1 mm and fixture deviations in z direction are 3 mm based on the assumed deviations for two cases a deterministic deviation analysis is performed to predict the final assembly deviations with the initial deviation and welding distortion considered the angular deformations on the top of the butt weld plates are shown in fig 11 fig 11 a b show the out of plane deflection distributions z deviation of case a and b along the transverse line respectively and then fig 11 c d present the 3d plot of z deviation distributions of two welded models without considering the initial part deviations respectively besides fig 11 e f illustrate the 3d plot of z deviation distributions of two cases considering the influence of initial part deviations respectively based on the simulation results with without the initial deviations the maximum deviation values of the welded plate are 1 765 mm and 1 487 mm for case a and 1 981 mm and 1 644 mm for case b respectively from these results it should be noticed that the initial deviations have a great impact on the final assembly deviations during variation simulations it is important to consider the effect of initial deviations on the assembly springback after welding in order to achieve a realistic result based on monte carlo simulation a statistical analysis is performed for butt welded plates examining the impact of deviation sources such as manufacturing deviations fixture error and gap parameters on final assembly deformation for two cases we assume that all the variations are independent and follow a normal distribution without mean shift unless otherwise specified the standard deviation of part variations in z direction is set to 1 mm moreover the standard deviation of the fixture errors in the z direction is 3 mm in case b the standard deviation of gap errors is 1 mm in the y direction based on the normal distribution assumption a 2000 times monte carlo simulation is conducted the significant effects of initial deviations on the assembly springback show in fig 12 and table 4 fig 12 a b shows the distribution of angular distortion for case a and b respectively according to these results the mean values of two cases increase as the distance from welding seam decreases i e from m1 to m6 in addition its value reaches a maximum near the weld center the standard deviation in both cases however decrease with m1 to m6 as shown in table 4 when comparing the results of the two cases case b has a larger mean and standard deviation overall than case a this indicates that the initial gap is one of the main factors in the welding assembly process based on the simulation results it is clear that variation sources such as part deviations fixture errors welding deformations and gaps have a great effect on the final assembly deviation 3 2 case study of ship block subassembly furthermore an engineering case of ship block subassembly is presented to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method the structure consists of one base plate and three stiffeners fig 13 shows the relative position and detailed size of this subassembly the material of each part is ah36 as shown in fig 14 the structure is welded with mag welding using a fanuc m20ia 12l welding system and the welding conditions are summarized in table 5 er70s filler wire with a 1 2 mm diameter and 80 ar and 20 co2 shielding gas is used the welding distortions of the specimen are measured using a 3d smart line profile sensors gocator 2450 measuring precision in x y 0 1 mm and the measurement points are illustrated in fig 15 the detailed values and the location of the part deviations are shown in appendix c it is assumed that each source of variation is independent for simplicity and only z direction deviation is considered as illustrated in fig 16 weld induced inherent strain of a small scale welded joint is analyzed using thermal elastic plastic analysis to predict the deviation of the final subassembly fig 16a shows this ﬁllet welded joint and welding sequence which consists of a flange 200 mm 200 mm 8 mm and a web 200 mm 150 mm 8 mm the finite element model of the fillet welded joint consists of 55954 nodes and 44400 elements as shown in fig 16b the material of the filler joint is the same as those in the experiment of ship block subassembly this sequentially coupled three dimensional thermal elastic plastic analysis is performed by abaqus after that the computed out of plane welding distortion of the fillet joint after welding is shown in fig 17 the results show that the maximum out of plane welding distortion after welding is 2 65 mm by integrating the plastic strain obtained from the thermal elasticplastic finite element analysis the values of inherent strain evaluated from this small ﬁllet welded joint are summarized in table 6 in this study the out of plane deformation z direction of the base plate is investigated due to the stiffener s high rigidity compared with the base plate the stiffener remained almost underformed the inherent strain derived from the fillet welded joint is used as an initial strain to predict the final assembly springback deflection according to the measured part deviation on the base plate listed in appendix c the out of plane deviations at the ten points along the two edges lines 1 and 2 after welding are illustrated in fig 18 as shown in fig 18a the maximum relative error between the experiment and the present method in the out of plane displacement z deviation along line 1 is 7 9 fig 18b shows that the maximum relative error in out of plane displacement z deviation along line 2 between the experimental measurements and the present method is 13 4 the reason behind this relatively large difference between these two sides indicates that the effect of twisting distortion occurs to some degree it can be seen that good agreement is observed between the present method and the experimental results 4 conclusions this paper presents a compliant variation model of welded structures based on inherent strain theory and interface element method which considers the effects of initial deviations fixture errors and welding distortion during the welding assembly process in this paper the inherent strain obtained by thermal elastic plastic fem is applied to the plate model based elastic analysis model in the form of initial strain load using inherent strain theory and kirchhoff plate theory as the theoretical foundation the proposed model can be used to predict the final assembly deviation then the elastic finite element model based on inherent strain theory and kirchhoff plate theory is developed to predict the final assembly deviations with enough computational accuracy in addition the relationship between the assembly deviation and welding deformation has been investigated with the presented model according to the comparison with experimental results the validation of the developed method is evaluated with butt

plate can be expressed as follows a 1 u x y z u 0 x y z w 0 x v x y z v 0 x y z w 0 y w x y z w 0 x y where u v w denote the displacement components of an arbitrary point along x y z axis respectively and u 0 v 0 w 0 are the displacements of the mid plane in x y and z directions respectively and ϕ x ϕ y w 0 x w 0 y are the rotations with respect to positive y and negative x axis assuming small deformations the initial strains can be divided into two categories in a manner similar to that employed in liu et al 2018a 2018b the equivalent strains of initial deformation ε are induced by initial deviation and the inherent strains ε are produced by the inherent deformations hence the strain incremental is written as a 2 ε ε ε ε with a 3 ε ε x ε y γ x y u 0 x z 2 w 0 x 2 v 0 y z 2 w 0 y 2 u 0 y v 0 x 2 z 2 w 0 x y ε ε x ε y γ x y u 0 x z 2 w 0 x 2 v 0 y z 2 w 0 y 2 u 0 y v 0 x 2 z 2 w 0 x y where u u v w w 0 x w 0 y t represents the initial generalized displacements induced with initial deviation and then ε ε x ε y ε x y t is vector of inherent strain which has four components the longitudinal inherent strain ε x in the welding direction the transverse inherent strain ε y in the transverse direction the curvature κ x and κ y around about the y and x axes of lines normal to the middle plane respectively for a typical welded joint the distribution of inherent strain due to welding can be obtained by thermal elastic plastic fem or experimental method as shown in fig a1 the four inherent strain components can be defined as follows deng and murakawa 2008 a 4 ε x δ x b ε y δ y b κ x θ x b κ y θ y b where δ x and δ y are the inherent deformation in longitudinal and transverse directions respectively θ x and θ y are the inherent bending in longitudinal and transverse directions respectively b is the width of the inherent strain zone fig a 1 butt welded joint with inherent deformations fig a 1 for isotropic materials with young s modulus e poisson s ratio ν the constitutive relationship between stresses and strains can be given with the following elastic constitutive law a 5 σ c ε in which c denotes the material stiffness matrix and can be given as a 6 c e 1 ν 2 1 v 0 v 1 0 0 0 1 v 2 using the principle of virtual work for kirchhoff plate the governing equation for mechanical analysis in the finite element formulation can be given by a 7 δ π v σ δ ε d v v b δ u d v f e δ u 0 to obtain the governing equations in matrix forms the generalized displacement u 0 v 0 w 0 and the rotation ϕ x ϕ y are constructed by polynomial interpolation functions here we use equal interpolation of all variables m 4 n p 12 let u 0 x y j 1 m u j ψ j 1 v 0 x y j 1 m v j ψ j 2 w 0 x y j 1 n w j ψ j 3 ϕ x x y j 1 p s j 1 ψ j 4 ϕ y x y j 1 p s j 2 ψ j 5 substituting interpolation functions for u 0 v 0 w 0 ϕ x ϕ y into the weak form of governing equations and neglecting the body force and applied external forces we obtain the following ﬁnite element model in general matrix form a 8 k k a v f f where the stiffness matrix k is dependent on the part deviations the additional force f is transformed from initial deviations in the welding process welding distortions are affected by both local shrinkage inherent deformation wang et al 2017 due to the non uniform heating and cooling cycle process of the welded region and the gaps and misalignments induced by the initial geometric deviations therefore the equivalent force f denotes the force induced by local shrinkage in welding step and the additional stiffness matrix k a is used to consider the effect of gaps and misalignments here the components of element stiffness matrix are listed as k i j 11 ω e a 11 ψ i 1 x ψ j 1 x a 66 ψ i 1 y ψ j 1 y d x d y k i j 12 ω e a 12 ψ i 1 x ψ j 2 y a 66

20338,welding as the most common joining technique causes welding deformations that reduce the geometrical accuracy of hull structures in conventional variation analysis welding distortion is not taken into account in this paper a compliant assembly variation modeling and analysis method is presented to investigate the impact of local weld induced shrinkage on the propagation relation from the initial deviation to the final assembly deviation in thin plate assembly first welding deformations in the form of inherent strains are incorporated into variation analysis model based on kirchhoff plate model additionally part deviations are also introduced via equivalent forces in order to consider the effects of geometrical variation on compliant assembly then other variation sources such as fixture locating errors are modeled as equality constraints of the mechanical variation model which are then transformed into boundary conditions with lagrange multiplier method with an additional stiffness matrix we describe concisely the coupling relationship between initial deviations and welding deformations caused by gaps and misalignments in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method numerical simulations and experimental verifications are carried out for two assembly cases and the results show that the present method has high prediction accuracy and efficiency this study provides a potential application for improving assembly dimensions considering the inevitable manufacturing deviations and welding deformations keywords compliant variation analysis welding distortion inherent strain initial deviations geometrical gap and misalignment 1 introduction welding is an important joining technique and widely used in many industrial applications such as in ocean engineering aerospace and automotive industries it is inevitable that welding deformation occur due to the non uniform heating and cooling cycle during welding process the continuous accumulation of welding deformation in multi station assembly processes affects the next stage of assembly and welding process as an example weld induced deformations in ship building will not only reduce the assembly dimension quality but also have a significant influence on the structural performance and safety of the ship roland et al 2004 at present weld induced structural deformation continues to pose a serious challenge in the construction process of ships therefore it is necessary to establish an accurate variation analysis model to improve the assembly quality and reduce welding distortion existing variation analysis models can be divided into rigid models and compliant models according to the deformability assumption of components based on the kinematics theory several rigid variation methods have been proposed for the assembly of block components including directly linearization method deterministic locating method etc chase et al 1995 gao et al 1998 wang et al 2003 but for thin walled strucutures the impact of part deformation on assembly quality has been observed which promote the development of compliant variations analysis methods to predict assembly geometric precision as an example method of influence coefficients mic hu and koren 1997 liu and hu 1997 is a widely used method to predict the final assembly variation this method established a linear relationship between the part deviation and the assembly deviation using finite element method furthermore camelio et al 2003 2004 extended mic to predict the dimensional variation propagation for a multi station compliant assembly using a state space model based on mic zhang and shi 2016a b developed a model to predict assembly deviation for compliant composite assembly for the assembly of aeronautical panels consisting of many parts and sub processes lin et al 2014 proposed a deviation propagation model based on substructure analysis which could reduce the model complexity as well as improve the computational efficiency during the assembly process it is assumed that the joining process itself does not generate any deformation previously research on thin plate assembly mainly focused on the global deviation propagation relation for compliant variation models such as mic and finite element methods then a sensitivity matrix is constructed to describe the influence of the initial variation unfortunately the effect of local welding deformation on variation simulation is neglected in most existing models which makes it difficult to carry out an accurate assembly analysis for hull structures in contrast to mic variation simulation in shipbuilding is heavily influenced by geometric deviations and welded distortions a priori knowledge of the welding deformations of each weld seam is vital to predicting assembly variation efficiently during the welding process at present the thermal elastic plastic tep finite element method and the inherent strain method are two main numerical methods to predict welding distortion ueda and yamakawa 1971 first established the theoretical formulations of the tep model to simulate the entire welding process in order to simulate multi pass welding processes of plant piping quickly and accurately an analysis code based on the iterative substructure method was developed maekawa et al 2015 wang et al 2012 using tep method seo et al 2018 investigated the thermal distortion mechanism and the effect of welding sequences on thin plate panel deformation during the assembly process tep method as an effective tool has been widely used to predict thermal field welding deformation and residual stress in the welding process this method however is mainly used for small scale structures since the complicated thermo mechanical behavior of welding leads to an enormous computaition burden for large scale engineering structures as an alternative to the time consuming tep method ueda and yuan 1992 proposed the inherent strain theory to calculate welding deformation and residual stress based on elasticity analysis additionally the inherent strain method can be roughly divided into two categories temperature load method ha 2008 and equivalent load method park and an 2015 2017 park et al 2013 podder et al 2016 in the former methods the inherent strains are converted into a temperature loads incorporating with the aritificial thermal expansion coefficients to derive welding deformation to produce welding deformation the artificial thermal expansion coefficients are assigned as a material property temperature load methods only consider the normal strain components of inherent strain but ignore the effect of shear strains which is non significant in a pure thermal expansion process however the angular deformation caused by shear strain can not be obtained by the temperature load method such in a t welded structure according to the latter methods the inherent strains at the weld line and adjacent area are converted into internal forces and moments taking into account the effect of transverse shear strain components as an extension of the inherent strain method biswas et al 2013 proposed an average plastic strain method to evaluate weld induced deformation for complex structures in order to investigate the influence of welding induced buckling wang et al 2018 developed a computational model based on inherent deformation to evaluate the out of plane welding distortion and welding buckling condition for investigation of the effect of assembly sequence and gap on the final deformation interface element model deng et al 2007 2013 deng and murakawa 2008 woo et al 2020 was developed based on inherent strain theory the prediction of welding deformation in most existing welding simulation models is based on nominal part geometry which may differ from actual distortion as a result of part manufacturing deviation in addition welding simulations based on actual parts are rarely found in literatures liam gannon et al 2012 studied the effects of post weld residual stress and distortion on the ultimate strength of ship structures davies et al 2015 investigated the relationship between the initial plate profiles and the post weld deformation of thin butt welded plates the final deformation of the plate after welding is strongly influenced by the pre existing deformation of the plate using first order shear deformation shell theory combined with the equivalent single layer of shell element goncalves et al 2016 proposed a homogenization method to analyze sandwich structures characterized by manufacturing induced imperfections by using this method local imperfections are described by representative volume elements while global imperfections are described by equivalent shell stiffness the effect of geometric imperfections on the vibration of isotropic rectangular plates was investigated makvandi et al 2018 by using the mindlin theory in which geometric imperfections in the same form as the first buckling mode shape are incorporated into the von kármán nonlinear strain displacement relation additionally novotný et al 2018 proposed a novel numerical method to generate geometrical imperfections in welding simulations using eigenvalue analysis method an initial imperfection can be incorporated into the finite element model for the creation of a new finite element model the influence of imperfections on residual distortion of welded parts was investigated using the new model while traditional researches on welding distortion prediction mostly focus on the deterministic approaches which neglect the impact of parts variation during welding a combination of variation analysis and welding simulation is necessary for obtaining the final assembly deformations in the statistical sense pahkamaa et al 2012 investigated the effect of geometrical variations and welding distortions on the final assembly springback the welding deformation as a random value was incorporated into a variation model which was extracted from a welding database based on nominal parts based on welding experiment wärmefjord et al 2016 proposed a virtual geometry assurance process for welded assemblies they analyzed the effects of part position assembly fixture variations and welding induced distortions on the final assembly variations to consider the effects of welding distortion as a form of equivalent force chung 2006 proposed an improved method of influence coefficients imic for ships and offshore structures choi and chung 2015 extended the influence coefficient calculation to account for the distortion of the joining process they established a linear relationship between the welding distortion and the assembly deviation using a transformation matrix the imic is used by choi and chung 2018 to develop a variation simulation model that includes the welding deformation as the result of pre stress in the form of an additional stiffness matrix additionally lee and chung 2019 used imic to develop a variation simulation model that can reflect the coupling relationship between out of plane variation and in plane variation as part of these methods welding deformation as a prescribed displacement boundary condition is incorporated into the variation model however the relationship between initial deviation and welding distortion is still unclear the present work makes an attempt to establish a novel compliant assembly variation analysis model with consideration of random initial deviation and welding shrinkage the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theoretical develpment of the proposed compliant assembly variation analysis method which consists of three main steps 1 part manufacturing deviations and welding induced deformations are introduced in the form of equivalent additional force based on inherent strain and kirchhoff plate theory 2 fixture locating errors and other variation sources are introduced into the variation model as prescribed displacement boundary condition using lagrange multiplier method 3 the coupling relationship between initial deviations and welding deformations caused by gaps misalignments is concisely described with an additional stiffness matrix in section 3 the proposed method is validated with two small scale butt welded plate cases and a ship block subassembly case and the numerical and experimental results are discussed finally some conclusion is given in the last section 4 2 theoretical modeling of assembly variation 2 1 variation analysis for welded assemblies the final assembly variations are not only caused by part deviations but are also influenced by welding deformations during the welding process additionally the welding distortions are determined by welding parameters e g welding voltage welding current welding speed etc welding sequences and welding tool errors furthermore gaps and misalignments caused by part deviations in the positioning stage also affect the final welding distortion this paper aims to investigate the influence of local welding deformation on assembly variation by applying the welding simulation to actual parts therefore it is necessary to adopt some reasonable strategies to consider the main influence factors while disregarding the minor influence factors for the variation propagation process in this analysis some reasonable assumptions and conditions areset 1 friction force contact area gravity etc are ignored 2 the fixtures and welding guns are assumed rigid and 3 assembly operations are performed in a single station as illustrated in fig 1 a type of thin plate welded structure assembly process is comprised of four basic steps step 1 locating parts to the fixtures fig 1a compliant parts are loaded to fixtures with the deterministic positioning by 3 2 1 locating principle menassa and devries 1989 and over constrained positioning by n 2 1 with n 3 locating principle cai at el 1996 the 3 2 1 locating fixtures are used here to constrain a rigid body motion for welded parts however n 3 holding fixtures are used to prevent excessive deformation of non rigid parts during the positioning process the actual positions of the locating fixtures solid triangles differ from the nominal positions the dotted dashed lines of the locating points on the plates thus the part total deviations v u consist of part manufacturing deviations v md u and fixture position errors v fd u if each plate has more than one source of variation then the total deviation of these two parts is given by 1 v u p 1 v u p 1 md v u p 1 fd t and v u p 2 v u p 2 md v u p 2 fd t step 2 clamping parts to the nominal position fig 1b in order to clamp the parts to the nominal position a set of clamping forces f u p 1 and f u p 2 are applied to the plates given the part stiffness matrices k u p 1 and k u p 2 the clamping forces can be calculated as follows 2 f u p 1 k u p 1 v u p 1 and f u p 2 k u p 2 v u p 2 step 3 welding the compliant parts fig 1c the two parts are welded together while the clamping forces are still being applied due to the non uniform heating and cooling cycle process of the welded region the weld induced energy u w will lead to dimensional and geometrical deviations as well as part deformations besides the gap and misalignment caused by initial geometric deviations have a great influence on the welding deformation in other words the welding distortions are subdivided into two deformation patterns the local shrinkage from nominal components and the other deformation induced by gaps and misalignments in the current study the welding distortions as a form of the additional stiffness matrix and equivalent force are introduced into the assembly process to calculate final assembly deviation step 4 releasing clamps and assembly springback fig 1d the welded parts will have a springback after the applied clamping forces are removed from the parts the spingback deformations depend on the springback force vector f w which is relating to initial deviation and weld induced deformation after computation of the global stiffness matrix k w the assembled global force displacement equations can be expressed as 3 k w v w f w note that the global stiffness matrix k w depends on the stiffness of unwelded parts k u and the additional stiffness matrix k a introduced by welding technology in step 3 the details will be presented in the latter part of this section besides the fixture s constraints and other connected constraints are transformed into displacement boundary conditions and the displacement constraints can be expressed as multi freedom constraint equations 4 l v w d where l is coefficient matrix for the constraint equation d d 1 d 2 d m n t is the displacement vector here m and n are the number of degrees of freedom for pate 1 and plate 2 respectively according eqs 3 and 4 the final assembly springback deviations vector v w can be obtained by lagrange multiplier method quyen et al 2019 which has an important advantage for treating multi freedom constraints 5 k w l t l 0 v w λ f w d where λ denotes the lagrange multiplier vector in this paper newton raphson approach can be used to solve the incremental updates of the stiffness matrix eq 5 can be expressed in an iterative form as 6 k w v w i 1 l t λ i 1 f w l v w i 1 d where i denotes the ith iteration combining the penalty method with the lagrange multiplier method quyen et al 2019 multiplication of l t to the second equation in eq 6 with an initial guess λ 0 0 and rearranging terms yields 7 v w i k w s l t l 1 f w s l t d where s is a diagonal matrix of penalty weights 2 2 construction of the stiffness matrix and force vector of weld induced deformation as mentioned above the coupled problems of the relationship between the initial deviation and welding deformation are key issues for the assembly variation analysis of welded components on the one hand most researchers on variation analysis have focused primarily on the initial deviations without considering weld induced deformation which affects the final product during the assembly process on the other hand significant efforts neglect the influence of geometrical deviations e g plate thickness misalignments and gaps on welding deformations as shown in fig 2 the geometrical deviations of welding joint directly lead to the change of heat flow input at the welding seam and further cause the deviation of temperature field and stress field beyond the prediction of the deterministic theory which also adds unknown difficulty to control the welding deformation therefore weld induced energy should be considered in step 3 to reflect the change of input heat source energy considering the time consuming costs and convergence of thermo elastic plastic analysis for welding problems interface element deng et al 2007 2013 deng and murakawa 2008 murakawa et al 2012 woo et al 2020 based on elastic fem is applied to consider the effect of gap and misalignment in the welding process as such the governing equation in a weak form by the principle of virtual work is written to account for welding distortions 8 δ δ u int δ u w δ w ext 0 where is the total energy u int is the internal energy u w is the weld induced energy w ext is the external energy and δ denotes the variational operator it is worth mentioning that weld induced energy u w to be modeled can include the one of base energy from nominal parts as well as additional energy from non nominal parts caused by gaps and misalignments based on inherent strain method the additional term δ u w is computed as 9 δ u w a n δ ε m δ κ d a where n and m refer to the stress resultant tensor and the bending moment tensor respectively ε and κ are the tensors of strain and curvature to overcome these limitations and difficulties of the change of stress field the welding distortion from nominal parts as a form of the equivalent force f is introduced into the assembly process to calculate the final assembly deviation to consider the effects of gaps and misalignments caused by initial geometrical deviations an additional stiffness matrix k a v gap is introduced as a new term in eq 3 which is related to the initial geometrical deviation v gap the detailed procedure is presented in appendix a according to eqs 8 and 9 the relationship between the springback force and displacement can be rewritten as 10 k u p 1 k u p 2 k a v gap v w f u p 1 f u p 2 f where k a is the additional stiffness matrix f u and f in the form of the equivalent force of the initial deviation and welding distortion are introduced into the assembly process to calculate final assembly deviation by the plate model based elastic analysis method details in appendix a the stiffness matrix and springback force in eq 3 is replaced by the additional terms for welding distortion in eq 8 to apply boundary conditions eq 4 the final assembly springback deviations vector v w can be obtained by 11 v w i k u p 1 k u p 2 k a v gap s l t l 1 f u p 1 f u p 2 f s l t d in this study eq 11 establishes the relationship between initial deviations and assembly springback deviations also the statistical deviation analysis with monte carlo simulation can be performed which accounts for the influence of initial variation such as the part manufacturing deviations fixture position errors and the gap and the misalignment 2 3 solution procedure of the present method the solution procedure of the proposed method is shown in fig 3 in the beginning part manufacturing deviations are introduced in the form of equivalent strains based on kirchhoff plate theory besides the locating fixture errors and other deviations are converted into boundary conditions by lagrange multiplier method secondly in order to obtain an accurate variation model welding distortion in the form of additional equivalent force is integrated into the present model specifically gaps and misalignments induced by the initial geometric deviations are modeled as the nonlinear spring which significantly reduces the dimensional accuracy in this study an additional stiffness matrix is applied to express the effect of gaps and misalignments on the final assembly deformation finally a statistical deviation analysis for the prediction of assembly springback is performed to account for multiple variation sources including part deviations fixture errors and welding distortions 3 numerical examples and discussions three study cases are presented in this section two butt welded plates one ship block subassembly including two experiments for deterministic deformation prediction and analysis as well as a numerical simulation for statistical deviation 3 1 case study of butt welded plates 3 1 1 validation of the present model in this section we use a two plate assembly case a and case b as an example to evaluate how part deviations combine with welding deformations to influence final assembly springback the dimensions of each plate are 150 mm 150 mm 2 mm as shown in fig 4 a b the material of each part is aluminum alloy 6061 t6 in case a the thin plates are welded without an initial gap fig 4a while case b has an initial gap between the thin plates and the initial gap is set to be 0 5 mm see fig 4b for validation purposes two plates are butt welded with a fronius cmt4000 welding system see fig 5 a filler wire er4043 with a diameter of 1 2 mm is used and the shielding gas is 100 ar the detailed welding parameters are summarized in table 1 for the welding assembly process the same restraint conditions are used in case a and case b in addition the welding distortions of specimens are measured using a three coordinate system handy scan 300tm measuring precision 0 01 mm horizontal resolution and 0 04 mm vertical resolution in order to use the inherent strain as an initial strain in the proposed method the inherent strain should be obtained beforehand a sequentially coupled three dimensional thermal elastic plastic analysis using abaqus is used in this study to predict inherent strain a two step solution procedure is adopted first the heat transfer analysis can be performed in order to obtain the temperature field second the mechanical analysis can be carried out by applying the temperature history results as an initial thermal load three dimensional eight node solid elements dc3d8 are applied in the thermal analysis and then are converted to c3d8r in the mechanical analysis a dense element mesh is used in the vicinity of the weld centerline while a coarser mesh is applied in the remaining zone the length of each element in the welding direction is 1 0 mm and the number of elements is four in the thickness direction the finite element mesh consists of 79200 elements and 100415 nodes for each case cases a and b are clamped with the same boundary condition as those of the experiments as shown in fig 5 the welding line bold line mesh model and clamping condition are also illustrated in fig 6 a comparison of the welding displacements for cases a and b under the same constraint conditions see fig 6 is shown in fig 7 fig 7 a b shows the longitudinal shrinkage distributions of the top surface for case a and case b with the maximum displacements of 0 0269 mm and 0 0328 mm respectively similarly fig 7 c d shows the transverse shrinkage distributions of the top surface for case a and case b with the maximum displacements of 0 0321 mm and 0 0359 mm respectively besides fig 7 e f shows the transverse bending angular distortion for case a and case b with the maximum displacements of 1 491 mm and 1 627 mm respectively as shown in fig 7 the longitudinal shrinkage and transverse shrinkage values are smaller than the out of plane deformation values furthermore with the impact of the initial gap these kinds of welding deformations are larger in case b than those in case a according to simulation results obtained by thermal elastic plastic fem the inherent strain components of the butt welded joint are shown in table 2 based on the inherent strain theory assembly deviation analysis is employed to predict the final assembly springback as well as considering part deviations and welding distortion as shown in fig 8 60 uniformly distributed nodes are selected as key points marked by circle to guarantee the measurement accuracy the deviations for each case are obtained from welding experiments as shown in appendix b according to the part deviation presented in appendix b the out of plane deformations of two cases case a and case b are discussed here to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method the comparison of the result from the experiment and the result from the proposed method is shown in fig 9 from fig 9a the maximum difference value of out of plane displacement z deviation between the experiment and the present method without considering part deviation is 0 4925 mm while the maximum difference between the experimental measurements and the present method considering part deviation is 0 2390 mm according to fig 9a the prediction results of the present method considering part deviation are highly consistent with the experimental results for case b the results by the present method are plotted in fig 9b it can be seen from fig 9b that the maximum difference between the experimental measurements and the present method is 0 3486 mm without taking into account part deviation in addition the maximum difference of the experimental measurements and the present method is 0 2469 mm when part deviation is considered as shown in these figures part deviations have a significant influence on the final welding deformation comparing fig 9a with fig 9b it also shows that these kinds of welding deformations calculated by case b are larger than that of case a with the impact of the initial gap 3 1 2 statistical variation analysis for more study of the variation propagation relationship between initial deviations and weld induced distortions we consider part deviations and fixture errors as the initial deviations during welding assembly for case a and case b six deviation points along with the welding line are selected as sources of part deviations and six measurement points are used to predict the assembly deviation based on these given sources of variation the location of part deviation point fixture positioning point and measurement point are listed in fig 10 and table 3 we assume that the part manufacturing deviations in z direction are 1 mm and fixture deviations in z direction are 3 mm based on the assumed deviations for two cases a deterministic deviation analysis is performed to predict the final assembly deviations with the initial deviation and welding distortion considered the angular deformations on the top of the butt weld plates are shown in fig 11 fig 11 a b show the out of plane deflection distributions z deviation of case a and b along the transverse line respectively and then fig 11 c d present the 3d plot of z deviation distributions of two welded models without considering the initial part deviations respectively besides fig 11 e f illustrate the 3d plot of z deviation distributions of two cases considering the influence of initial part deviations respectively based on the simulation results with without the initial deviations the maximum deviation values of the welded plate are 1 765 mm and 1 487 mm for case a and 1 981 mm and 1 644 mm for case b respectively from these results it should be noticed that the initial deviations have a great impact on the final assembly deviations during variation simulations it is important to consider the effect of initial deviations on the assembly springback after welding in order to achieve a realistic result based on monte carlo simulation a statistical analysis is performed for butt welded plates examining the impact of deviation sources such as manufacturing deviations fixture error and gap parameters on final assembly deformation for two cases we assume that all the variations are independent and follow a normal distribution without mean shift unless otherwise specified the standard deviation of part variations in z direction is set to 1 mm moreover the standard deviation of the fixture errors in the z direction is 3 mm in case b the standard deviation of gap errors is 1 mm in the y direction based on the normal distribution assumption a 2000 times monte carlo simulation is conducted the significant effects of initial deviations on the assembly springback show in fig 12 and table 4 fig 12 a b shows the distribution of angular distortion for case a and b respectively according to these results the mean values of two cases increase as the distance from welding seam decreases i e from m1 to m6 in addition its value reaches a maximum near the weld center the standard deviation in both cases however decrease with m1 to m6 as shown in table 4 when comparing the results of the two cases case b has a larger mean and standard deviation overall than case a this indicates that the initial gap is one of the main factors in the welding assembly process based on the simulation results it is clear that variation sources such as part deviations fixture errors welding deformations and gaps have a great effect on the final assembly deviation 3 2 case study of ship block subassembly furthermore an engineering case of ship block subassembly is presented to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method the structure consists of one base plate and three stiffeners fig 13 shows the relative position and detailed size of this subassembly the material of each part is ah36 as shown in fig 14 the structure is welded with mag welding using a fanuc m20ia 12l welding system and the welding conditions are summarized in table 5 er70s filler wire with a 1 2 mm diameter and 80 ar and 20 co2 shielding gas is used the welding distortions of the specimen are measured using a 3d smart line profile sensors gocator 2450 measuring precision in x y 0 1 mm and the measurement points are illustrated in fig 15 the detailed values and the location of the part deviations are shown in appendix c it is assumed that each source of variation is independent for simplicity and only z direction deviation is considered as illustrated in fig 16 weld induced inherent strain of a small scale welded joint is analyzed using thermal elastic plastic analysis to predict the deviation of the final subassembly fig 16a shows this ﬁllet welded joint and welding sequence which consists of a flange 200 mm 200 mm 8 mm and a web 200 mm 150 mm 8 mm the finite element model of the fillet welded joint consists of 55954 nodes and 44400 elements as shown in fig 16b the material of the filler joint is the same as those in the experiment of ship block subassembly this sequentially coupled three dimensional thermal elastic plastic analysis is performed by abaqus after that the computed out of plane welding distortion of the fillet joint after welding is shown in fig 17 the results show that the maximum out of plane welding distortion after welding is 2 65 mm by integrating the plastic strain obtained from the thermal elasticplastic finite element analysis the values of inherent strain evaluated from this small ﬁllet welded joint are summarized in table 6 in this study the out of plane deformation z direction of the base plate is investigated due to the stiffener s high rigidity compared with the base plate the stiffener remained almost underformed the inherent strain derived from the fillet welded joint is used as an initial strain to predict the final assembly springback deflection according to the measured part deviation on the base plate listed in appendix c the out of plane deviations at the ten points along the two edges lines 1 and 2 after welding are illustrated in fig 18 as shown in fig 18a the maximum relative error between the experiment and the present method in the out of plane displacement z deviation along line 1 is 7 9 fig 18b shows that the maximum relative error in out of plane displacement z deviation along line 2 between the experimental measurements and the present method is 13 4 the reason behind this relatively large difference between these two sides indicates that the effect of twisting distortion occurs to some degree it can be seen that good agreement is observed between the present method and the experimental results 4 conclusions this paper presents a compliant variation model of welded structures based on inherent strain theory and interface element method which considers the effects of initial deviations fixture errors and welding distortion

and u 0 v 0 w 0 are the displacements of the mid plane in x y and z directions respectively and ϕ x ϕ y w 0 x w 0 y are the rotations with respect to positive y and negative x axis assuming small deformations the initial strains can be divided into two categories in a manner similar to that employed in liu et al 2018a 2018b the equivalent strains of initial deformation ε are induced by initial

general matrix form a 8 k k a v f f where the stiffness matrix k is dependent on the part deviations the additional force f is transformed from initial deviations in the welding process welding distortions are affected by both local shrinkage inherent deformation wang et al 2017 due to the non uniform heating and cooling cycle process of the welded region and the gaps and misalignments

20339,the ship propulsion shafting often has a lot of uncertainty due to the impact of dynamic factors during the operation in order to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting under uncertainty the displacement responses were obtained utilizing the experiment and the numerical calculation based on a ship shafting test bench and the established nonparametric dynamic model the results show that the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting could be significantly affected by the uncertainty with the increase of uncertainty the fluctuation of the frequency response function gradually strengthens the amplitude of the displacement response is enlarged and the axis trajectory of the propulsion shafting becomes more complex therefore it is essential to consider the uncertainty in the process of the dynamic design and analysis for the ship propulsion shafting keywords dynamic characteristics ship propulsion shafting uncertainty nonparametric dynamic modeling 1 introduction the propulsion shafting is the most important component of the power device of the ship and its dynamic characteristics directly affect the navigation performance of the ship however during the navigation of ship due to the impact of dynamic factors e g hull deformation propeller hydrodynamics and bearing oil film there are always some uncertainties exiting in the propulsion shafting such as the parameter uncertainty and the structural uncertainty ge et al 2016 li et al 2019 shi et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 and these uncertainties can lead to the deviation of its dynamic characteristics from the original optimization design and cause the performance deterioration of the propulsion shafting such as excessive vibration and alignment failure jiang et al 2017 li et al 2019 murawski 2005 zhou et al 2016 therefore to ensure the safe navigation of the ship it is essential to investigate the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under uncertainty it is well known that the investigation of dynamic characteristics can be carried out by experiment and numerical simulation in practical application due to the complexity of the dynamic factors it is difficult to reveal the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under various uncertainties by means of experiments so numerical simulation is currently recognized as an effective means and widely applied in the dynamics design and analysis for the ship propulsion shafting however at present the dynamic numerical calculation of the ship propulsion shafting is mostly based on the deterministic dynamic model zhou et al 2016 he et al 2017 ma and zhang 2015 tian et al 2015 which means the dynamical equation can fully reflect the structure of propulsion shafting and the parameters are all accurately measured gan et al 2018 i e the model uncertainty and the data uncertainty are ignored in the modeling process as mentioned above uncertainty is often present in the propulsion shafting due to the impact of dynamic factors in practical application thus it is difficult to obtain an accurate dynamic calculation when the uncertainty of the propulsion shafting is ignored in the modeling process this leads to large errors between the existing calculation results and the actual ship test results and cannot accurately guide the dynamics design of the propulsion shafting therefore novel approaches are required to get a better insight into the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under uncertainty the nonparametric modeling proposed by soize is an emerging method for studying the effects of uncertainty in dynamic systems and can carry out the calculations and simulations without identifying the type and number of uncertainties soize 2000 2005 recently the nonparametric modeling approach has been widely used in various fields such as aerospace pradlwarter et al 2005 satellites pellissetti et al 2008 soil celarec and dolšek 2013 and vibro acoustics jiao et al 2017 and become the primary method to solve uncertain problems unfortunately in the field of ships few have been done to study the nonparametric modeling therefore in order to solve the problem of uncertainty in the study of ship propulsion shafting dynamics it is urgent to introduce the nonparametric modeling approach the main contribution of this study is to establish the nonparametric dynamic model for the ship propulsion shafting with the model uncertainty and the data uncertainty and to reveal its dynamic characteristics under uncertainty in this paper based on a ship shafting test bench the dynamic characteristics of propulsion shafting under uncertainty were investigated by the displacement responses measured and calculated firstly the changes of displacement responses under different degrees of uncertainty were discussed by the hull deformation simulation experiments based on the experimental analysis the displacement responses were calculated by the established nonparametric dynamic model and then the dynamic characteristics under uncertainty were investigated 2 experimental investigation 2 1 experimental design in order to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting under uncertainty by experiment an experimental system is given as follows 2 1 1 equipment the experimental investigations were carried out in the ship shafting test bench as shown in fig 1 and its main dimensions were listed in table 1 in fig 1 a a 3 phase ac motor with a rotating speed ranging from 0 to 1000 rpm was connected with the input end of the long shaft through a coupling to drive the rotation of the long shaft the long shaft was supported by three oil lubricated journal bearings i e the front bearing the intermediate bearing the stern bearing the height of each bearing can be adjusted through a worm gear screw lifter as shown in fig 1 b the height variation of the bearing was 0 25 mm for every revolution of the worm gear an eddy current displacement sensor with a sensitivity of 2500 mv mm and an effective range of 2 mm was installed on the intermediate bearing housing to monitor the bearing height change in real time in addition a counterweight plate with a mass of 15 kg was installed at the output end of the long shaft 2 1 2 set up in order to obtain the displacement response of the shafting under different degrees of uncertainty the hull deformation simulation experiments were performed by adjusting the elevation of the intermediate bearing during the experiments the uncertainty in the shafting was considered in three levels small moderate and high levels when the elevation change of the intermediate bearing was within the range of 0 to 0 mm i e δh 0 mm 0 1 to 0 1 mm i e δh 0 1 mm and 0 2 to 0 2 mm i e δh 0 2 mm respectively thus three groups of the experiments with different uncertainty were carried out on the test bench and the running time at each group of experiment was 10 min under a certain rotating speed of 300 r min to monitor the change of elevation in real time the displacements of the intermediate bearing were measured by the eddy current displacement sensor as shown in fig 2 it can be observed that there are significant differences in the change of displacement within different elevation ranges i e the small fluctuation when δh 0 mm as shown fig 2 a the moderate fluctuation when δh 0 1 mm as shown fig 2 b and the large fluctuation when δh 0 2 as shown fig 2 c which mean that three degrees of uncertainty could be achieved in the shafting by adjusting the intermediate bearing elevation 2 1 3 dynamic response measurement in order to measure the displacement response of the shafting in the horizontal direction x direction and the vertical direction y direction two czf bzf eddy current displacement sensors with a sensitivity of 2500 mv mm and an effective range of 2 mm were mounted close to the stern bearing as shown in fig 1 c a data acquisition system model number ni pxle 1071 was applied to collect the displacement response signals from the eddy current displacement sensors with the sampling frequency of 1024hz and sampling time of 5 s during the experiments a set of time series of displacement response signals was collected at an indeterminate interval and 32 analytical samples were obtained sequentially at each group of experiments 2 2 experimental results and discussion based on the displacement responses measured by the experiment the dynamic characteristics of the shafting under different degrees of uncertainty were analyzed as follows 2 2 1 waveform frequency spectrum and axis trajectory fig 3 are the time domain waveform and spectrum of measured displacement responses in the x direction of the shafting same results in the y direction further based on the measured displacement responses in the x and y direction the axis trajectory of the shafting was drawn as shown in fig 3 it can be observed that under three kinds of uncertainty the measured displacement response and the axis trajectory are obviously different when the shafting is under the small uncertainty as shown in fig 3 a the periodic waveform with approximately equal amplitude and a discontinuous narrowband frequency spectrum consisting mainly of the rotation frequency and its multiplication appear in the displacement response of the shafting and the axis trajectory represents an approximate ellipse with a small width indicating that the shaft runs repeatedly on a central orbit but a slight deviation from this central orbit when the shafting is under the moderate uncertainty as shown in fig 3 b the amplitude of the waveform is unequal and show a small fluctuation a low frequency f 1 occurs in the frequency spectrum and compare with the small uncertainty the axis trajectory widens indicating that the repeatability of axis trajectory has been worse when the shafting is under high uncertainty as shown in fig 3 c the distortion of the waveform is more severe a low frequency f 2 occurs in the frequency spectrum and the axis trajectory shows a greater degree of unrepeatability indicating that the shaft runs on the relatively discrete orbit and its operating stability is relatively poor 2 2 2 amplitude in order to investigate the amplitude variation of the displacement response under different degrees of uncertainty the root mean square rms of the displacement response of the shafting was calculated fig 4 shows the rms of the displacement response of 32 samples in the x and y directions in different range of elevation it can be seen from fig 4 that the rms of the displacement response in both the x direction and y direction fluctuates in a certain range under three different uncertainties under the small uncertainty the rms fluctuates in a small range with the increase of uncertainty the fluctuation range of rms gradually expands this phenomenon indicated the uncertainty can strengthen the displacement response and increase the instability of the shafting it is proved that the uncertainty is unavoidable and even a small uncertainty can cause the fluctuations in the dynamic characteristics of the shafting from experimental results however in the actual navigation of ship due to the complexity of dynamic factors it is difficult to reveal the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under various uncertainties by means of experiments therefore it is necessary to investigate the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under various uncertainties by means of numerical simulation 3 numerical investigation 3 1 nonparametric modeling 3 1 1 the reduced model of the propulsion shafting fig 5 shows the model of the propulsion shafting presented in the ship shafting bench it consists of a drive end a long shaft three oil lubricated sliding bearings and a load end the parameters involved are given in table 2 the m i i 1 7 are seven equivalent mass discs m 1 is the equivalent lumped mass of the drive end of the shaft m 2 m 4 and m 6 are the equivalent lumped mass at the front bearing intermediate bearing and stern bearing m 3 and m 5 are the equivalent lumped mass of the shaft between the three bearings and m 7 is the equivalent lumped mass at the load end of the shafting the discs are connected by massless elastic shafts 3 1 2 dynamic equations as for the ship shafting it can be simply seen as composed of three parts the rotating discs with the equivalent lumped mass the elastic but massless shaft and the supporting bearings since only the most important and fundamental movement forms are the objective of this study only the transverse vibration of the system is considered and the influence of torsional vibration and the gyroscopic effect are ignored here lal and tiwari 2012 thus by introducing a generalized coordinate vector u u 1 u 2 u 7 t u l x l j y l l 1 2 7 in the complex domain where j is used to indicate an imaginary term the finite element model of the dual span rotor can be expressed as 1 m u c u k u f where m diag m 1 m 2 m 7 c diag c 1 c 2 c 7 k k 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 k 2 k 22 k 2 k 2 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 44 k 3 k 3 2 k 3 k 3 k 3 k 3 k 4 k 66 k 4 k 4 k 4 k is the stiffness matrix where k l l 1 4 is the equivalent stiffness of the shaft and the k i i i 2 4 6 is the stiffness coefficient of the bearing the stiffness of the shafting can be obtained by flexibility coefficient method gan et al 2018 moreover the experimental modal analysis was carried out and the natural frequency of the system was measured on the test bench which provide a basis for the determination of system s stiffness coefficient f g g f e f o the description of each force as follows 1 gravity g g acts on the entire shaft and acts equivalently on each lumped mass disk the direction of it is downward in the y direction 2 the unbalanced excitation force f e m i e ω 2 acts on each lumped mass disk and the direction changes periodically the e is the mass eccentricity and ω is the rotational angular velocity 3 the calculation model used for the nonlinear oil film force f o on the shaft at the front bearing intermediate bearing and stern bearing is the unsteady nonlinear oil film force model proposed by capone in 1991 geng 2019 the nonlinear oil film force f x i and f y i i 1 3 are calculated as follows at first the dimensionless oil film force in the x and y directions of the fixed rectangular coordinate system is calculated by eq 2 2 f x 3 a x v x y α a g x y α sin α 2 s x y α cos α f y 3 a x v x y α a g x y α cos α 2 s x y α sin α where 3 α tan 1 y 2 x x 2 y π 2 sign y 2 x x 2 y π 2 sign y 2 x 4 a x 2 y 2 y 2 x 2 1 x 2 y 2 5 g x y α 2 1 x 2 y 2 π 2 tan 1 y cos α x sin α 1 x 2 y 2 6 v x y α 2 y cos α x sin α g x y α 1 x 2 y 2 7 s x y α x cos α y sin α 1 x cos α y sin α 2 then the dimensional component of the oil film force in the x and y directions are 8 f x s p f x f y s p f y where s p μ n ω r l r c 2 l 2 r 2 s is the sommerfeld correction factor p is the half of the quality of the shaft segment at the bearing μ n is the lubricating oil viscosity c is the average thickness of the oil film r is the radius of the bearing l is the length of the bearing at this time the dynamic model given by eq 1 is just a deterministic one in which the mass stiffness and damping are all accurately measured therefore this model can be seen as the mean model of the ship shafting in the actual navigation of the ship due to the influence of many dynamic factors there are substantial inevitable uncertainty in the shafting for example there are always errors between the design parameters and the real operating conditions all these imply that the mean model does not accurately reflect the actual situation in order to represent the actual operating state the uncertainties must be taken into account and consequently the random matrix model is of more practical significance which can be expressed as 9 m u c u k u f where m c and k are the random matrices corresponding to the mean mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively the g g and f e has also been randomized due to the relationship of the mass matrix 3 1 3 nonparametric calculation in the following several key equations are briefly introduced from soize 2000 s work to derive the dispersion control parameter and explain the simulation process for a random matrix in this study they will be applied to investigate the influence of the uncertainty in the shafting and explain the phenomenon in the experiment assuming a is a n n random matrix of the mass damping or stiffness according to the statistical characteristics of the random matrix it can be easily deduced that the probability density function pdf of a must fulfill the following three basic constraints according to the statistical properties of a random matrix 10 m n r p α a d a 1 m n r a p α a d a a m n r m n r ln det a p α a d a v v where m n r is constituted by positive definite symmetric matrices there are many methods for obtaining the pdf provided that there is enough information but the information one can obtain here is just the constraints in the circumstances the entropy is introduced to represent the degree of uncertainty of the system the maximum entropy principle can permit the function to constructed with available information and the pdf can be deduced by constructing the lagrangian and expressed as 11 p a a c a det a λ 1 exp n 1 2 λ 2 t r a 1 a t where a is the mathematical expectation of the random matrix a tr a j 1 n a j j and c a is a positive constant calculated by 12 c a 2 π n n 1 4 n 1 2 λ 2 n n 1 2 λ 2 l 1 n γ n l 2 λ 2 det a n 1 2 λ 2 where γ x is the gamma function defined by γ x 0 t x 1 e x d t x 0 the variance of the random matrix a can be expressed as 13 σ j k 1 n 1 2 λ a j k 2 a j j a k k since e a a f 2 σ j σ k σ j k 2 if defining a dispersion control parameter δ a as 14 δ a e a a f 2 a f 2 1 2 1 n 1 2 λ 1 tr a 2 tr a 2 1 2 then the parameter λ in eqs 11 13 can be deduced as 15 λ 1 2 δ a 2 1 δ a 2 n 1 tr a 2 tr a 2 it should be noted that for a stochastic system determined by the dimension n the λ increases as δ a decrease if λ then σ j k 0 δ a 0 and the random matrix a will approach in the mean matrix a therefore the construction of the random matrix a is mainly related to the dispersion control parameter δ a the random matrix can be obtained by controlling the dispersion control parameters and performing monte carlo simulation on the mean matrix for any positive symmetric matrix a it can be decomposed by the cholesky factorization into a product form of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix 16 a l a t l a where l a is the upper triangular real matrix assuming λ is a positive integer let m a n 1 2 λ and the random matrix a can be simulated by 17 a 1 m a j 1 m a l a t u j l a t u j t where u j is the vector composed of independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance thus the samples of the random matrix a are yielded by eq 17 and the random matrix model eq 9 can then be constructed soize 2000 the pdf of random matrix a is consistent with eq 11 therefore as for m c k the corresponded random matrixes m c k can be constructed by eqs 10 17 and the dispersion control parameters δ m δ c and δ k determines the sample space of these random matrixes respectably in this study there are many uncertain factors involved in the ship shafting and some parameters in the model cannot be directly measured therefore the levels of the uncertainty involved in the system are usually difficult to determine here we choose three different values of the divergence control parameter shown in eq 14 i e δ m δ c δ k 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 to investigate the fluctuations of the vibration response of the ship shafting for other uncertainty levels a similar analysis can be performed since the shafting is coupled by the gravity unbalanced excitation force and nonlinear oil film force in this paper the runge kutta method is used in the software matlab to integrate the eq 9 and the dynamic response of the system is computed the speed of shafting is 600 r min the time step is set as 1 50 of the period and 1100 periods were simulated to guarantee the veracity of the results the data of the first 1000 periods were discarded and the points of last 100 periods were adopted in the analysis 3 2 numerical results and discussion 3 2 1 frequency response function the frequency response function is an important indicator to measure the performance of the system it represents the relationship between the output and input of frequency and can describe a nonlinear system s essential characteristics the frequency response function of the system can be expressed as 18 h w w 2 m i w c k 1 and it is generally converted into decibels 19 d b w 10 log 10 w 4 h w f 2 where f represents the frobenius norm according to the shafting system dynamic model the system s frequency response function with different uncertainties is calculated and its amplitude frequency curve is shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the frequency response function without considering the uncertainty it can be seen that the frequency response function shows a gradual upward trend with increasing rotating speed after considering the uncertainty the frequency response functions are shown in fig 6 b d among them there are 32 samples under each uncertainty and the uncertainty is controlled by the dispersion control parameters of δ m δ c δ k 0 2 δ m δ c δ k 0 5 and δ m δ c δ k 0 8 compared with fig 6 a the frequency response function presents certain volatility it is because after considering the uncertainty the mass stiffness and damping matrix of the system are transformed from the deterministic matrix to random samples which is distributed within a specific range moreover from the variations in fig 6 b 6 d it can be seen that as the uncertainty increases the degree of fluctuation of the system s frequency response function also strengthens 3 2 2 waveform frequency spectrum and axis trajectory based on the runge kutta method the displacement response of the ship propulsion shafting under different uncertainty was calculated since the stern bearing is responsible for the important work of shafting and influenced by a variety of nonlinear dynamic factors han and lee 2019 peng et al 2011 the displacement response of the shaft at the stern bearing was analyzed in this study fig 7 shows the time domain waveform frequency spectrum and axis trajectory in the x direction of the shafting it can be clearly observed that under four kinds of dispersion control parameters the calculated displacement response and the axis trajectory are obvious different when the dispersion control parameters of mass stiffness and damping are δ m δ c δ k 0 as shown in fig 7 a the periodic waveform with approximately equal amplitude and a rotation frequency appear in the displacement response and the axis trajectory is an approximate ellipse indicating the axis trajectory repeats in a single orbit when the uncertainty is considered and the dispersion control parameters are δ m δ c δ k 0 2 as shown in fig 7 b no significant change in the waveform of the shafting compared with the fig 7 a but a one half octave frequency in addition to rotation frequency appears in the spectrum and the axis trajectory is a toroid with a certain width indicating that the repeatability of the axis trajectory becomes worse as the uncertainty increases when the dispersion control parameters are δ m δ c δ k 0 5 it can be seen from fig 7 c that the amplitude of the waveform is unequal and show small fluctuation the one half octave frequency is more obvious in the spectrum and a double ellipse occurs in the axis trajectory when the dispersion control parameters are δ m δ c δ k 0 8 as shown in fig 7 d the distortion of the waveform is more severe the amplitude of one half octave frequency in the spectrum has risen and the axis trajectory shows the multi elliptic dispersion trajectory 3 2 3 amplitude fig 8 shows the rms of the displacement response of 32 samples in the x and y directions under different uncertainty i e the dispersion control parameters are δ m δ c δ k 0 δ m δ c δ k 0 2 δ m δ c δ k 0 5 and δ m δ c δ k 0 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that when the dispersion control parameters are δ m δ c δ k 0 the rms of the displacement responses in both the x direction and y direction is a determined value when the dispersion control parameters are δ m δ c δ k 0 2 the rms fluctuates in a small range with the increase of uncertainty i e the dispersion control parameters are δ m δ c δ k 0 5 and δ m δ c δ k 0 8 the fluctuation range of rms gradually expands this phenomenon indicated the uncertainty can intensify the vibration and increase the instability of the shafting which is consisted with the experimental results the numerical analysis demonstrates that the nonparametric model permits well understanding the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting under uncertainty therefore it is necessary to introduce the nonparametric modeling approach in the process of the dynamics design and analysis for the ship propulsion shafting 4 conclusion and future work to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting under uncertainty an experimental and numerical study was conducted in the experiment the displacement responses of the propulsion shafting under different degrees of uncertainty were obtained through the hull deformation simulation experiments meanwhile the nonparametric modeling approach was introduced and the numerical calculation was carried out by the established nonparametric dynamic model based on the displacement responses measured and calculated the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting under the uncertainty were revealed both the experimental and numerical results show that the uncertainty can lead to the change in the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting and affect its operating performance when the uncertainty is small the displacement response shows a slight change and the axis trajectory represents the repeated trajectory in a narrow area indicating that the shafting runs in a relatively stable state as the uncertainty increases the change of the dynamic response becomes violent such as waveform distortion large scale amplitude fluctuation and increase in frequency component and the repeatability of axis trajectory becomes worse indicating that the shafting runs toward an unstable state therefore it is essential to consider the uncertainty in the dynamics design and analysis for the ship propulsion shafting and the nonparametric modeling method is a useful tool for this task however there are still some challenges in the actual applications such as quantitative and qualitative analysis of uncertainties and their coupling effect in the next time to further investigate the influence of the uncertainty on ship shafting the hydrodynamics simulation experiments and

20339,the ship propulsion shafting often has a lot of uncertainty due to the impact of dynamic factors during the operation in order to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting under uncertainty the displacement responses were obtained utilizing the experiment and the numerical calculation based on a ship shafting test bench and the established nonparametric dynamic model the results show that the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting could be significantly affected by the uncertainty with the increase of uncertainty the fluctuation of the frequency response function gradually strengthens the amplitude of the displacement response is enlarged and the axis trajectory of the propulsion shafting becomes more complex therefore it is essential to consider the uncertainty in the process of the dynamic design and analysis for the ship propulsion shafting keywords dynamic characteristics ship propulsion shafting uncertainty nonparametric dynamic modeling 1 introduction the propulsion shafting is the most important component of the power device of the ship and its dynamic characteristics directly affect the navigation performance of the ship however during the navigation of ship due to the impact of dynamic factors e g hull deformation propeller hydrodynamics and bearing oil film there are always some uncertainties exiting in the propulsion shafting such as the parameter uncertainty and the structural uncertainty ge et al 2016 li et al 2019 shi et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 and these uncertainties can lead to the deviation of its dynamic characteristics from the original optimization design and cause the performance deterioration of the propulsion shafting such as excessive vibration and alignment failure jiang et al 2017 li et al 2019 murawski 2005 zhou et al 2016 therefore to ensure the safe navigation of the ship it is essential to investigate the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under uncertainty it is well known that the investigation of dynamic characteristics can be carried out by experiment and numerical simulation in practical application due to the complexity of the dynamic factors it is difficult to reveal the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under various uncertainties by means of experiments so numerical simulation is currently recognized as an effective means and widely applied in the dynamics design and analysis for the ship propulsion shafting however at present the dynamic numerical calculation of the ship propulsion shafting is mostly based on the deterministic dynamic model zhou et al 2016 he et al 2017 ma and zhang 2015 tian et al 2015 which means the dynamical equation can fully reflect the structure of propulsion shafting and the parameters are all accurately measured gan et al 2018 i e the model uncertainty and the data uncertainty are ignored in the modeling process as mentioned above uncertainty is often present in the propulsion shafting due to the impact of dynamic factors in practical application thus it is difficult to obtain an accurate dynamic calculation when the uncertainty of the propulsion shafting is ignored in the modeling process this leads to large errors between the existing calculation results and the actual ship test results and cannot accurately guide the dynamics design of the propulsion shafting therefore novel approaches are required to get a better insight into the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under uncertainty the nonparametric modeling proposed by soize is an emerging method for studying the effects of uncertainty in dynamic systems and can carry out the calculations and simulations without identifying the type and number of uncertainties soize 2000 2005 recently the nonparametric modeling approach has been widely used in various fields such as aerospace pradlwarter et al 2005 satellites pellissetti et al 2008 soil celarec and dolšek 2013 and vibro acoustics jiao et al 2017 and become the primary method to solve uncertain problems unfortunately in the field of ships few have been done to study the nonparametric modeling therefore in order to solve the problem of uncertainty in the study of ship propulsion shafting dynamics it is urgent to introduce the nonparametric modeling approach the main contribution of this study is to establish the nonparametric dynamic model for the ship propulsion shafting with the model uncertainty and the data uncertainty and to reveal its dynamic characteristics under uncertainty in this paper based on a ship shafting test bench the dynamic characteristics of propulsion shafting under uncertainty were investigated by the displacement responses measured and calculated firstly the changes of displacement responses under different degrees of uncertainty were discussed by the hull deformation simulation experiments based on the experimental analysis the displacement responses were calculated by the established nonparametric dynamic model and then the dynamic characteristics under uncertainty were investigated 2 experimental investigation 2 1 experimental design in order to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the propulsion shafting under uncertainty by experiment an experimental system is given as follows 2 1 1 equipment the experimental investigations were carried out in the ship shafting test bench as shown in fig 1 and its main dimensions were listed in table 1 in fig 1 a a 3 phase ac motor with a rotating speed ranging from 0 to 1000 rpm was connected with the input end of the long shaft through a coupling to drive the rotation of the long shaft the long shaft was supported by three oil lubricated journal bearings i e the front bearing the intermediate bearing the stern bearing the height of each bearing can be adjusted through a worm gear screw lifter as shown in fig 1 b the height variation of the bearing was 0 25 mm for every revolution of the worm gear an eddy current displacement sensor with a sensitivity of 2500 mv mm and an effective range of 2 mm was installed on the intermediate bearing housing to monitor the bearing height change in real time in addition a counterweight plate with a mass of 15 kg was installed at the output end of the long shaft 2 1 2 set up in order to obtain the displacement response of the shafting under different degrees of uncertainty the hull deformation simulation experiments were performed by adjusting the elevation of the intermediate bearing during the experiments the uncertainty in the shafting was considered in three levels small moderate and high levels when the elevation change of the intermediate bearing was within the range of 0 to 0 mm i e δh 0 mm 0 1 to 0 1 mm i e δh 0 1 mm and 0 2 to 0 2 mm i e δh 0 2 mm respectively thus three groups of the experiments with different uncertainty were carried out on the test bench and the running time at each group of experiment was 10 min under a certain rotating speed of 300 r min to monitor the change of elevation in real time the displacements of the intermediate bearing were measured by the eddy current displacement sensor as shown in fig 2 it can be observed that there are significant differences in the change of displacement within different elevation ranges i e the small fluctuation when δh 0 mm as shown fig 2 a the moderate fluctuation when δh 0 1 mm as shown fig 2 b and the large fluctuation when δh 0 2 as shown fig 2 c which mean that three degrees of uncertainty could be achieved in the shafting by adjusting the intermediate bearing elevation 2 1 3 dynamic response measurement in order to measure the displacement response of the shafting in the horizontal direction x direction and the vertical direction y direction two czf bzf eddy current displacement sensors with a sensitivity of 2500 mv mm and an effective range of 2 mm were mounted close to the stern bearing as shown in fig 1 c a data acquisition system model number ni pxle 1071 was applied to collect the displacement response signals from the eddy current displacement sensors with the sampling frequency of 1024hz and sampling time of 5 s during the experiments a set of time series of displacement response signals was collected at an indeterminate interval and 32 analytical samples were obtained sequentially at each group of experiments 2 2 experimental results and discussion based on the displacement responses measured by the experiment the dynamic characteristics of the shafting under different degrees of uncertainty were analyzed as follows 2 2 1 waveform frequency spectrum and axis trajectory fig 3 are the time domain waveform and spectrum of measured displacement responses in the x direction of the shafting same results in the y direction further based on the measured displacement responses in the x and y direction the axis trajectory of the shafting was drawn as shown in fig 3 it can be observed that under three kinds of uncertainty the measured displacement response and the axis trajectory are obviously different when the shafting is under the small uncertainty as shown in fig 3 a the periodic waveform with approximately equal amplitude and a discontinuous narrowband frequency spectrum consisting mainly of the rotation frequency and its multiplication appear in the displacement response of the shafting and the axis trajectory represents an approximate ellipse with a small width indicating that the shaft runs repeatedly on a central orbit but a slight deviation from this central orbit when the shafting is under the moderate uncertainty as shown in fig 3 b the amplitude of the waveform is unequal and show a small fluctuation a low frequency f 1 occurs in the frequency spectrum and compare with the small uncertainty the axis trajectory widens indicating that the repeatability of axis trajectory has been worse when the shafting is under high uncertainty as shown in fig 3 c the distortion of the waveform is more severe a low frequency f 2 occurs in the frequency spectrum and the axis trajectory shows a greater degree of unrepeatability indicating that the shaft runs on the relatively discrete orbit and its operating stability is relatively poor 2 2 2 amplitude in order to investigate the amplitude variation of the displacement response under different degrees of uncertainty the root mean square rms of the displacement response of the shafting was calculated fig 4 shows the rms of the displacement response of 32 samples in the x and y directions in different range of elevation it can be seen from fig 4 that the rms of the displacement response in both the x direction and y direction fluctuates in a certain range under three different uncertainties under the small uncertainty the rms fluctuates in a small range with the increase of uncertainty the fluctuation range of rms gradually expands this phenomenon indicated the uncertainty can strengthen the displacement response and increase the instability of the shafting it is proved that the uncertainty is unavoidable and even a small uncertainty can cause the fluctuations in the dynamic characteristics of the shafting from experimental results however in the actual navigation of ship due to the complexity of dynamic factors it is difficult to reveal the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under various uncertainties by means of experiments therefore it is necessary to investigate the dynamic characteristics of ship propulsion shafting under various uncertainties by means of numerical simulation 3 numerical investigation 3 1 nonparametric modeling 3 1 1 the reduced model of the propulsion shafting fig 5 shows the model of the propulsion shafting presented in the ship shafting bench it consists of a drive end a long shaft three oil lubricated sliding bearings and a load end the parameters involved are given in table 2 the m i i 1 7 are seven equivalent mass discs m 1 is the equivalent lumped mass of the drive end of the shaft m 2 m 4 and m 6 are the equivalent lumped mass at the front bearing intermediate bearing and stern bearing m 3 and m 5 are the equivalent lumped mass of the shaft between the three bearings and m 7 is the equivalent lumped mass at the load end of the shafting the discs are connected by massless elastic shafts 3 1 2 dynamic equations as for the ship shafting it can be simply seen as composed of three parts the rotating discs with the equivalent lumped mass the elastic but massless shaft and the supporting bearings since only the most important and fundamental movement forms are the objective of this study only the transverse vibration of the system is considered and the influence of torsional vibration and the gyroscopic effect are ignored here lal and tiwari 2012 thus by introducing a generalized coordinate vector u u 1 u 2 u 7 t u l x l j y l l 1 2 7 in the complex domain where j is used to indicate an imaginary term the finite element model of the dual span rotor can be expressed as 1 m u c u k u f where m diag m 1 m 2 m 7 c diag c 1 c 2 c 7 k k 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 k 2 k 22 k 2 k 2 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 44 k 3 k 3 2 k 3 k 3 k 3 k 3 k 4 k 66 k 4 k 4 k 4 k is the stiffness matrix where k l l 1 4 is the equivalent stiffness of the shaft and the k i i i 2 4 6 is the stiffness coefficient of the bearing the stiffness of the shafting can be obtained by flexibility coefficient method gan et al 2018 moreover the experimental modal analysis was carried out and the natural frequency of the system was measured on the test bench which provide a basis for the determination of system s stiffness coefficient f g g f e f o the description of each force as follows 1 gravity g g acts on the entire shaft and acts equivalently on each lumped mass disk the direction of it is downward in the y direction 2 the unbalanced excitation force f e m i e ω 2 acts on each lumped mass disk and the direction changes periodically the e is the mass eccentricity and ω is the rotational angular velocity 3 the calculation model used for the nonlinear oil film force f o on the shaft at the front bearing intermediate bearing and stern bearing is the unsteady nonlinear oil film force model proposed by capone in 1991 geng 2019 the nonlinear oil film force f x i and f y i i 1 3 are calculated as follows at first the dimensionless oil film force in the x and y directions of the fixed rectangular coordinate system is calculated by eq 2 2 f x 3 a x v x y α a g x y α sin α 2 s x y α cos α f y 3 a x v x y α a g x y α cos α 2 s x y α sin α where 3 α tan 1 y 2 x x 2 y π 2 sign y 2 x x 2 y π 2 sign y 2 x 4 a x 2 y 2 y 2 x 2 1 x 2 y 2 5 g x y α 2 1 x 2 y 2 π 2 tan 1 y cos α x sin α 1 x 2 y 2 6 v x y α 2 y cos α x sin α g x y α 1 x 2 y 2 7 s x y α x cos α y sin α 1 x cos α y sin α 2 then the dimensional component of the oil film force in the x and y directions are 8 f x s p f x f y s p f y where s p μ n ω r l r c 2 l 2 r 2 s is the sommerfeld correction factor p is the half of the quality of the shaft segment at the bearing μ n is the lubricating oil viscosity c is the average thickness of the oil film r is the radius of the bearing l is the length of the bearing at this time the dynamic model given by eq 1 is just a deterministic one in which the mass stiffness and damping are all accurately measured therefore this model can be seen as the mean model of the ship shafting in the actual navigation of the ship due to the influence of many dynamic factors there are substantial inevitable uncertainty in the shafting for example there are always errors between the design parameters and the real operating conditions all these imply that the mean model does not accurately reflect the actual situation in order to represent the actual operating state the uncertainties must be taken into account and consequently the random matrix model is of more practical significance which can be expressed as 9 m u c u k u f where m c and k are the random matrices corresponding to the mean mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively the g g and f e has also been randomized due to the relationship of the mass matrix 3 1 3 nonparametric calculation in the following several key equations are briefly introduced from soize 2000 s work to derive the dispersion control parameter and explain the simulation process for a random matrix in this study they will be applied to investigate the influence of the uncertainty in the shafting and explain the phenomenon in the experiment assuming a is a n n random matrix of the mass damping or stiffness according to the statistical characteristics of the random matrix it can be easily deduced that the probability density function pdf of a must fulfill the following three basic constraints according to the statistical properties of a random matrix 10 m n r p α a d a 1 m n r a p α a d a a m n r m n r ln det a p α a d a v v where m n r is constituted by positive definite symmetric matrices there are many methods for obtaining the pdf provided that there is enough information but the information one can obtain here is just the constraints in the circumstances the entropy is introduced to represent the degree of uncertainty of the system the maximum entropy principle can permit the function to constructed with available information and the pdf can be deduced by constructing the lagrangian and expressed as 11 p a a c a det a λ 1 exp n 1 2 λ 2 t r a 1 a t where a is the mathematical expectation of the random matrix a tr a j 1 n a j j and c a is a positive constant calculated by 12 c a 2 π n n 1 4 n 1 2 λ 2 n n 1 2 λ 2 l 1 n γ n l 2 λ 2 det a n 1 2 λ 2 where γ x is the gamma function defined by γ x 0 t x 1 e x d t x 0 the variance of the random matrix a can be expressed as 13 σ j k 1 n 1 2 λ a j k 2 a j j a k k since e a a f 2 σ j σ k σ j k 2 if defining a dispersion control parameter δ a as 14 δ a e a a f 2 a f 2 1 2 1 n 1 2 λ 1 tr a 2 tr a 2 1 2 then the parameter λ in eqs 11 13 can be deduced as 15 λ 1 2 δ a 2 1 δ a 2 n 1 tr a 2 tr a 2 it should be noted that for a stochastic system determined by the dimension n the λ increases as δ a decrease if λ then σ j k 0 δ a 0 and the random matrix a will approach in the mean matrix a therefore the construction of the random matrix a is mainly related to the dispersion control parameter δ a the random matrix can be obtained by controlling the dispersion control parameters and performing monte carlo simulation on the mean matrix for any positive symmetric matrix a it can be decomposed by the cholesky factorization into a product form of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix 16 a l a t l a where l a is the upper triangular real matrix assuming λ is a positive integer let m a n 1 2 λ and the random matrix a can be simulated by 17 a 1 m a j 1 m a l a t u j l a t u j t where u j is the vector composed of independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance thus the samples of the random matrix a are yielded by eq 17 and the random matrix model eq 9 can then be constructed soize 2000 the pdf of random matrix a is consistent with eq 11 therefore as for m c k the corresponded random matrixes m c k can be constructed by eqs 10 17 and the dispersion control parameters δ m δ c and δ k determines the sample space of these random matrixes respectably in this study there are many uncertain factors involved in the ship shafting and some parameters in the model cannot be directly measured therefore the levels of the uncertainty involved in the system are usually difficult to determine here we choose three different values of the divergence control parameter shown in eq 14 i e δ m δ c δ k 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 to investigate the fluctuations of the vibration response of the ship shafting for other uncertainty levels a similar analysis can be performed since the shafting is coupled by the gravity unbalanced excitation force and nonlinear oil film force in this paper the runge kutta method is used in the software matlab to integrate the eq 9 and the dynamic response of the system is computed the speed of shafting is 600 r min the time step is set as 1 50 of the period and 1100 periods were simulated to guarantee the veracity of the results the data of the first 1000 periods were discarded and the points of last 100 periods were adopted in the analysis 3 2 numerical results and discussion 3 2 1 frequency response function the frequency response function is an important

according to the shafting system dynamic model the system s frequency response function with different uncertainties is calculated and its amplitude frequency curve is shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the
