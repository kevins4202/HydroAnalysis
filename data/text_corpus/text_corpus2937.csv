14685, motivation wastewater based epidemiology wbe has emerged as a promising approach for monitoring the covid 19 pandemic since the measurement process is cost effective and is exposed to fewer potential errors compared to other indicators like hospitalization data or the number of detected cases consequently wbe was gradually becoming a key tool for epidemic surveillance and often the most reliable data source as the intensity of clinical testing for covid 19 drastically decreased by the third year of the pandemic recent results suggests that the model based fusion of wastewater measurements with clinical data and other indicators is essential in future epidemic surveillance method in this work we developed a wastewater based compartmental epidemic model with a two phase vaccination dynamics and immune evasion we proposed a multi step optimization based data assimilation method for epidemic state reconstruction parameter estimation and prediction the computations make use of the measured viral load in wastewater the available clinical data hospital occupancy delivered vaccine doses and deaths the stringency index of the official social distancing rules and other measures the current state assessment and the estimation of the current transmission rate and immunity loss allow a plausible prediction of the future progression of the pandemic results qualitative and quantitative evaluations revealed that the contribution of wastewater data in our computational epidemiological framework makes predictions more reliable predictions suggest that at least half of the hungarian population has lost immunity during the epidemic outbreak caused by the ba 1 and ba 2 subvariants of omicron in the first half of 2022 we obtained a similar result for the outbreaks caused by the subvariant ba 5 in the second half of 2022 applicability the proposed approach has been used to support covid management in hungary and could be customized for other countries as well graphical abstract msc 37n25 92d30 keywords wastewater based epidemiology epidemic model dynamical system parameter estimation optimization data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe has gained a special interest during the covid 19 pandemic although it is not new in the literature been et al 2014 claro et al 2021 suggested that wbe is a powerful tool in the long term monitoring of covid 19 pandemic randazzo et al 2020 and zulli et al 2021 demonstrated that wbe is an efficient tool for supporting decision making on public policies during an epidemic outbreak however bibby et al 2021 drew attention to the typically uncertain dynamics of the virus secretion in feces which may undermine the potential for wbe as an early warning system olesen et al 2021 concluded that wbe can be used as a leading indicator but the lead time should be determined with a special care for the different applications the predictive quality of the wbe is data sensitive huizer et al 2021 therefore the processing and the normalization of the measured genome copy concentration are also essential zhu et al 2022 radu et al 2022 and lee et al 2021 used wbe to show the emergence of the alpha variant weeks before the first clinical case detected in austria and the united states respectively a similar observation is seen by lee et al 2022 for the rapid displacement of the delta variant by the highly virulent omicron variant morvan et al 2022 confirmed that the first signs of a new outbreak appear approximately a week earlier than clinical testing data using statistical methods krivoňáková et al 2021 showed a good correlation between wastewater data and clinical cases the dynamic relationship between the wastewater copy numbers and the clinical cases was identified by xiao et al 2022 and daza torres et al 2023 as a finite support discrete time impulse response function which constitutes the shedding load distribution a similar closed form distribution function with a detailed temperature model is used by phan et al 2023 to model the viral load in the dynamical model it is interesting that the time lag between wastewater data and clinical cases may be both positive and negative when analyzing separate epidemic outbreaks see e g xiao et al 2022 fig 3 panels c and d jiang et al 2022 developed artificial neural network models for continuous epidemic monitoring using training data set including catchment historical weather clinical testing coverage and vaccination rate alongside the statistical and machine learning approaches the dynamical compartmental susceptible exposed infected recovered seir type models are also promising for epidemic surveillance and prediction fernandez cassi et al 2021 showed that the wastewater based reconstruction fits better to a model based epidemic curve compared to estimates based on confirmed cases using a detailed seir type model introduced by lemaitre et al 2020 proverbio et al 2022 have used a wastewater based seir model and the extended kalman filter to reconstruct epidemic data and detect early warning performance phan et al 2023 developed a detailed static shedding model and they fit an seir model to the measured viral load for a single epidemic wave pájaro et al 2022 built a stochastic sir model and solved it by using monte carlo methods to predict the evolution of the pandemics incorporating viral load data and a variable infection rate to capture the effects of mitigation policies fazli et al 2021 proposed an agent based seir model using viral load as a measurement for the early detection and prediction of an outbreak the incidence was computed by mcmahan et al 2021 using a wastewater based seir model and the under detection rate was estimated the model was used to predict the future possibility of an outbreak nourbakhsh et al 2022 used a detailed compartmental model with viral secretion to wastewater to estimate prevalence incidence and reproduction number using the reported clinical cases hospital admission and viral load in wastewater to analyze the epidemic spread and estimate the transmission rate jiang et al 2021 used markov processes such that the seir compartments are considered hidden variables whereas the viral load and clinical cases are observations a likelihood based approach made it possible to understand the internal relationship between different states and how covid 19 actually transmits plateaus rebounds and the effects of individual behaviors in epidemics are analyzed and explained by berestycki et al 2021 using a specific sir type partial differential equation pde model and high precision wastewater measurement during the past two years our research group has been focusing on the dynamical analysis data reconstruction and prediction of the covid 19 pandemic in hungary using the tools of systems and control theory and high performance computation techniques in this line of research a detailed agent based stochastic epidemic simulator was developed that uses realistic population structures and movement patterns in an urban environment which was used for analysis and prediction reguly et al 2022 péni et al 2020 proposed a methodology to design predefined discrete levels for public restrictions or interventions fulfilling complex time dependent and often contradicting economic and healthcare related requirements the data reconstruction problem of estimating the possible real number of infections and the population of non measurable compartments was solved by polcz et al 2022 using a stochastic model predictive control design it was clearly shown by péni et al 2022 that the optimal design of testing intensity is essential to keep the stringency of epidemic measures on a tolerable level parallelly an advanced framework for wastewater surveillance based on the detection of viral rna was developed by róka et al 2021 which is still in official use in hungary our earlier models used official data on hospitalizations to predict future infection event numbers these predictions were also helpful in the early stages of the epidemic in this paper we investigate how far the predictions can be improved with the incorporation of wastewater virus load data into the model therefore our objective is to combine and enhance our previous models with wastewater data we show that the additional information from wastewater based observations efficiently improves model calibration and prediction power which further supports epidemic monitoring and decision making 2 materials and methods this section is divided into four major parts after a brief description on the methodology for collecting and processing wastewater measurements we introduce a dynamic epidemic model in section 2 2 then we propose an epidemic data reconstruction approach in two steps in sections 2 3 and 2 4 the three subsections start with a short problem formulation the technical details of the methodology can be read in the appendix which is divided into four parts first a formal epidemic model is described in appendix a secondly the dynamic model inversion is detailed in appendix b then a specific immunization model is presented in appendix c which allows to estimate additional quantities such as the rate of immunity loss appendix d brief parameter and noise sensitive analyses of the proposed approach are given in the supplementary material 2 1 viral load measurement in wastewater sars cov 2 genome copy numbers in sewage were determined from samples obtained from the hungarian national wastewater monitoring system wastewater samples have been collected weekly since july 2020 from the following locations in the three wastewater treatment plants wwtp of budapest from the county seats n 18 and as a composite sample from 5 cities in the budapest agglomeration this sampling scheme covers 40 of the hungarian population all samples were taken after a grid filter at wastewater treatment plants the samples are still raw sewage only the lumpy waste is filtered out wastewater samples were processed as published previously by róka et al 2021 briefly cell debris of a v 0 50 ml initial sample volume was sedimented by centrifugation and the supernatant was concentrated by flat sheet ultrafiltration membrane at room temperature viral particles were recovered from the membrane by vortexing in virus transport medium v c 1 ml nucleic acids were extracted from the concentrate by qiaamp viral mini kit according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentrate of volume v s 140 μ l was lysed and loaded on centrifuge extraction columns then rna was eluted in v e 30 μ l final volume sars cov 2 genome copies were quantified by qpcr using n1 as a target gene finally the value of the measurement is computed as follows 1 c raw v e v s v c v 0 qpcr result gc l we note that the raw samples were normalized using measured daily flow volumes and enterococcus counts as described in róka et al 2021 in eight wwtps two samples were processed a week finally resulting in 30 samples a week which were collected between monday and thursday 10 4 12 and 4 samples respectively the measurements were filtered as proposed by fernandez cassi et al 2021 namely we computed the moving median of the pcr cycles c q separately for all wwtps using a centered 31 days long window then we considered a pcr result inhibited if c q was more than three cycles beyond the median the raw pcr results i e the genome copy concentrations and the numbers of cycles obtained in szeged city are visualized in fig 1 where the inhibited measurements so called outliers are shaded whereas the red curve highlights the moving median of c q for each day the weighted average of the measurements taken on that day was calculated such that the weights are the population size at the wwtps the missing values at the weekends were computed by linear interpolation to smooth the obtained daily time series we used a 4th order low pass butterworth filter with f co 1 14 1 days cut off frequency we performed a zero phase filtering in the sense that the raw time series were filtered twice in both the forward and reverse directions this type of filter is not causal namely the value at a given time point depends on the future values too therefore the averaged and interpolated values of the last 7 days are repeated once at the end of the time series the filtered time series is denoted by c k off where k is the time label in days in fig 2 we illustrate c k off in comparison with the raw measurements in the same figure we present the data processed as proposed by róka et al 2021 remark 1 the applied filter removes the high range frequency components with periods less than 2 weeks which may result from an uneven sampling of the effluent over a week measurement errors may also contribute to high frequency components 2 2 dynamical epidemic model long term multi year epidemic reconstruction is a particularly challenging task as the pathogen has undergone significant mutations over the years social distancing rules vaccination the emergence of new immune evasive variants of concern voc and the continuously waning immunity further add to the difficulty of epidemic modeling 2 2 1 modeling goals in this section we develop a compartmental ordinary difference equation ode model where both the immunity loss and the clinical immunization are included and the major model parameters are allowed to vary in time inspired by péni et al 2020 we considered intermediate states of the illness including the hospital treatment the amount of detail in the model used was determined on the basis that the number of parameters is still computationally tractable based on past experience intermediate states are expected to be well observable from measurements 2 2 2 compartments we consider an improved compartmental model where the population of n individuals is divided into the following groups the group of susceptible people s comprises those who have never been infected or vaccinated but also any individual who are susceptible again by the waning immunity or the immune evasion of a new voc the group of immune or so called protected individuals r includes those who gained immunity either by recovery or vaccination the group of infected people is categorized according to the different phases and possible outcomes of the disease in this way we distinguish people in the latent l presymptomatic p and the main sequence phase of the disease note that the incubation period corresponds to the sum of the length of the latent and presymptomatic phases the reason we make a difference between l and p is that people in the latent phase are not yet infectious but they are in the presymptomatic phase to model the possible outcomes of the disease in the main sequence we consider four severity scenarios which are parameterized with three probability coefficients first a group of people remains asymptomatic a while others produce symptoms i with probability p i a person who have symptoms is hospitalized h with probability p h whereas a hospitalized patient may decease d with probability p d the average residence time in compartments l p i a h are denoted by the inverses of time coefficients τ l τ p τ i τ a τ h respectively 2 2 3 time range of epidemic reconstruction we consider a two and a half years long range of time for the reconstruction which has the following important phases in hungary 1 wild the first case in hungary was detected in march 2020 due to the strict official restrictions in spring 2020 the first wave was drastically suppressed but the wild sars cov 2 virus strain emerged again in autumn 2020 2 alpha in february 2021 alpha variant emerged 3 delta delta variant appeared in july 2021 4 ba 1 omicron appeared around the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 5 ba 2 subvariant ba 2 started to spread in march 2022 6 ba 5 in june 2022 subvariant ba 5 appeared 7 ba 5 tp1 as a turning point in the spread of ba 5 in september 2022 multiple mutants of subvariant ba 5 have appeared 8 bq 1 a rebound was observed in november 2022 caused by the emergence of a new omicron subvariant the bq 1 the milestone dates were approximated from the data of the national public health centre but are also published online by hodcroft 2023 2 2 4 available data our computations rely on the measured average genome copy concentration in wastewater the number of hospitalized and deceased patients with covid and the number of registered vaccinations i e the number of received first second and booster doses the types of vaccine doses are not available in this data set but the types of vaccines that require a single dose to obtain the full vaccination are negligible in hungary atlo team 2021b the reconstruction is regularized using the registered oxford stringency index i s k mathieu et al 2020 according to hale et al 2021 i s k 0 1 quantifies the strictness of the official restrictions on the social distancing e g mask wearing rules curfew postponed social events etc during the reconstruction we also make use of the estimated relative infectiousness of each voc compared to the wild type sars cov 2 strain during the evaluation of the obtained results we consider the estimated reproduction rate made by the group of our world in data owid mathieu et al 2020 moreover the estimated number of new cases is compared with the scaled number of the officially detected cases from the authors experience the hospital load as a major indicator has not been reliable since the emergence of ba 2 variant moreover the official detected cases are not representative as a potential validation data since the last quarter of 2022 due to the continuously decreasing testing intensity in this case study the test positivity rate is not considered because fluctuation of testing strategies in hungary highly influences the data moreover test positivity rate is not representative since the first quarter of 2022 2 2 5 assumptions according to mcevoy et al 2021 and nakajo and nishiura 2021 an asymptomatic person in the main sequence is less infectious compared to those in the presymptomatic phase or others in the main sequence having symptoms therefore we make the following assumptions assumption 1 infectious population we consider only q a portion of asymptomatic people being infectious but in the same rate as another symptomatic individual in the main phase of the disease we neglect the possible infections originating from hospitalized or deceased patients nourbakhsh et al 2022 considered a detailed epidemic model in which the infectious people are the major contributors to the viral load entering the sewer system they quantified the viral load as a linear function of the infectious population and those in the post infection period who have just recovered but the hospitalized patients and the infected people in the latent phase are excluded from the shedding population we also note that the estimates of hewitt et al 2022 nourbakhsh et al 2022 and phan et al 2023 made for the shedding characteristics show orders of magnitude lower shedding rates for individuals in the latent phase of the disease and about 10 days after symptoms onset motivated by these observations phan et al 2023 did not consider recovered people as relevant contributors to the viral load on the other hand nourbakhsh et al 2022 highlights that the viral load entering the sewer system is exposed to an exponential viral decay and is affected by the possible hydrodynamic processes e g dilution sedimentation and resuspension that leads to rna degradation but also delays in this study we neglect the in sewer degradation for simplicity and assume that the actual viral load entering the sewer system is proportional to the national average genome copy concentration without delays considering that the measurements arrive from 22 different wwtps that cover about 4 million people it is reasonable to assume that in sewer anomalies are compensated after the averaging filtering and smoothing steps described in section 2 1 finally to relate the shedding population with the actual measurements we consider a ratio denoted by q c between the number of infectious people and the national average genome copy concentration as it is formulated in the following assumption assumption 2 virus secretion the national average genome copy concentration measured in wastewater is assumed to be proportional to the number of infectious people at that day without delay the coefficient q c which relates the measured concentration and the infectious population is called the virus secretion coefficient the secretion coefficient q c is later calibrated using optimization for each variant although q c has no underlying physiological content the comparison of the obtained values for q c can estimate the relative rate of secretion during the whole course of the disease caused by two different variants averaged for the entire population the measurements of kang et al 2022 see e g panel b in fig 2 suggest that roughly 3 times more genome copies are shed during the delta infection than during the omicron wave therefore we expect q c delta estimated for the delta variant to be about 3 times higher compared to q c omicron obtained for omicron variants for the model parameters we make the following assumptions assumption 3 model coefficients we assume that the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic people q a is known and constant moreover the time coefficients τ and the probability of symptomatic infection p i are considered known for all voc emerged in hungary finally when a new voc becomes dominant the variant dependent coefficients τ p i are changing smoothly the presumed model coefficients are presented in table 1 the probability of hospitalization p h and of fatal outcome p d or the average hospitalization period 1 τ h depend not only on the properties of the dominant voc but also on the hospitalization strategies kemp et al 2021 kozyreff 2021 therefore these parameters may vary for the different countries in this study we focus on the epidemic waves in hungary the average hospitalization length in 2021 row 5 in table 1 were estimated from the hospital admission numbers recorded by the national public health centre other constants are applied from csutak et al 2022 assumption 4 unknown parameters the probability coefficients p h p d of the disease course model and the secretion coefficient q c of the pathogen are unknown parameters but constant during the dominance of a given voc for ba 1 and ba 2 subvariants of the omicron variant the virus secretion coefficient is presumed identical assumption 5 the transmission rate of the pathogen is considered smoothly time varying in this work we consider a model with vaccination where three vaccination statuses are distinguished not fully vaccinated fully vaccinated and boosted we make the following simplifying assumptions assumption 6 vaccination our model uses the following vaccination rules 1 full vaccination is ensured with two vaccine doses single dose full vaccination is negligible in hungary 2 the probability that a partially vaccinated individual will receive a second dose is p v 2 v 1 3 the time elapsed between the first two doses is normally distributed 4 a person who receives the full vaccine or a booster dose becomes temporarily immune with probability 1 but only after a certain period of time which is normally distributed 5 infected people are not vaccinated including those in the latent or the presymptomatic period 6 a susceptible and a recovered individual receives the second immunizing vaccine dose with the same probability 7 a fully vaccinated individual and a boosted susceptible receives a booster dose with the same probability 8 boosted individuals who are still protected do not receive further booster doses but only after losing their immunity we note that the estimated under detection rates discussed later suggest that the number of individuals who are aware of being infected by covid is much less compared to those who are undetected infected asymptomatic or infected with mild symptoms not attributed to covid this phenomenon is even more prevalent in the more advanced stages of the epidemic e g during the emergence of subvariant ba 1 considering this points 6 and 7 of assumption 6 are sufficiently realistic moreover repeated booster doses are not excluded in point 8 assumption 6 but a rational administration of vaccine doses is presumed namely a sufficiently long time should elapse between two booster doses a preliminary version of our vaccination model was presented in csutak et al 2022 in this study we make the following simplifying assumption on the relative risk of infection assumption 7 uniform infection the risk of a susceptible person becoming infected is independent of their vaccination status or previous history of infection our model considers only one single immune state a person can be susceptible to the virus s or protected r but we neglect further intermediate immune states however a protected individual may lose its immunity completely with a given rate due to a natural immune waning or due to the immune evasion capability of a new emerging virus strain we consider the following assumption for immunity loss assumption 8 uniform immunity waning on a given day a protected individual has the same probability of losing their immunity regardless of its vaccination status or previous history of infection note that assumptions 7 and 8 do not undermine the generality of the method as it can be parameterized otherwise with pre estimated relative risk coefficients which were measured in certain states e g king county 2022 finally we assume that the natural deaths and births are negligible compared to the deaths caused by the covid 2 2 6 dynamic equations finally we divide individuals into eight disjoint groups called the compartments which describe the epidemic state of the population on a given day k the transitions between the compartments are illustrated in fig 3 whereas the transition dynamics are characterized by the discrete time dynamical model present in the floating eq 2 the model parameters are explained in table 1 where the italic letter k in the subscripts denotes the time label of the respective quantities 2 2 7 infection mechanism the nonlinear infection process illustrated by the red curly arrow in fig 3 is encoded in the first two eqs 2a and 2b see the equation in box i where the transmission rate of the disease is characterized by the time varying coefficient β k with reference to assumption 1 the total number of infectious people who are able to transmit the pathogen is 3 y k p k i k q a a k according to the simplified vaccination rules assumption 6 the numbers of people in the different phases of the disease depend only on the number of new infections within the unit time frame 24 h caused by the y k infectious people the number of newly infected individuals on day k is denoted by u k and it can be expressed as follows 4 u k β k y k s k n on the other hand the new recoveries in 2h are described by the following terms 5 z k 1 p h k τ i k i k τ a k a k 1 p d k τ h k h k 2 2 8 vaccination and waning immunity the transition between the groups of susceptible s and protected people r is affected indirectly through infection recovery but also by vaccination waning immunity or the immune evasion capability of a new voc the immunization effect of vaccination green arrow in fig 3 is expressed by a single time varying coefficient ν k which denotes the proportion of susceptible people within a unit time frame who become immune by vaccination the immunization rate ν k can be estimated from the available vaccination data the loss of immunity is captured by a direct transition from the group of protected individuals r to susceptibles s as illustrated by the orange arrow in fig 3 the model does not distinguish between repeated susceptibility caused by the waning immunity or by the immune escape of a new voc both cases are considered as an event when an individual becomes susceptible again i e immunity is lost completely the proportion of protected people who lose immunity within a unit time frame is encoded in the so called immunity loss rate ω k immunization depends on the vaccination strategies whereas a sudden massive loss of immunity may be due to the emergence of a new voc with a strong immune evasion capability both effects are typically time dependent which are encoded by linear transitions between s and r with two time dependent rate coefficients ν k and ω k respectively the outer loop of the transition diagram illustrates that the immunization and waning are different in nature than the indirect transition from s to r through infection recovery 2 2 9 epidemic process as an interconnected system the direct transitions between susceptible and protected population make the epidemic dynamics uncertain as the dynamic nature of waning immunity and hence the daily rate of immunity loss ω k are unknown moreover immune waning makes the estimates of vaccination efficiency more uncertain thus the number of registered vaccinations is useful but not sufficient data to compute the daily rate of immunization ν k fortunately the advantageous properties of the epidemic process model allow us to decouple a linear subsystem 2b 2f from the overall compartmental model highlighted in a blue box both in 2 and in fig 3 this subsystem describes the course of the disease in the infected population according to assumption 6 the disease course model is interconnected with the immunization waning dynamics only through the daily new infections u k 4 and recoveries z k 5 once the sequences u k and z k are known and fixed the immunization waning dynamics can be analyzed separately the technical details of dynamic model representation are described in appendix a 2 3 new cases infected population reproduction number in this section we use wastewater measurements and hospitalization data to solve the disease dynamics i e to compute all unknown data of the isolated subsystem of 2 2 3 1 problem and outline the advantageous linear model structure of the disease course model makes it possible to perform a partial epidemic reconstruction through a single optimization based dynamic data assimilation problem we compute c the following unmeasured quantities c1 the number of new cases u k c2 the population in the compartments l p i a c3 the number of new recoveries z k c4 the effective reproduction number r c k c5 the unknown variant dependent probabilities p h p d c6 and the secretion coefficient q c through the optimization we compute epidemic data above such that the reconstructed quantities fit to the following measurements m m1 the measured genome copy concentration in wastewater c k off i e y k q c k c k off m2 the registered number of hospitalized patients h k off m3 the registered number of deceased patients d k off as much as possible remark 2 the disease course dynamics have advantageous stability and observability properties csutak et al 2021 2022 proved that for fixed model coefficients the state variables l p i a d are observable using only hospitalization load h independently of the rates of immunity loss or medical immunization these results suggest that the epidemic state observation formulated as an optimization problem has a solution 2 3 2 dynamic inversion of disease course model the unknown quantities of the disease course model can be classified as follows the number of new cases u k 4 is considered as an unknown disturbance input of the disease course model moreover the number of infected individuals in the different phases of the disease are unknown states l p i a according to assumption 4 coefficients p h p d and q c are piecewise constant unknown parameters finally the sequence of new recoveries z k 5 is a computed variable using the available measurement we are able to reconstruct the unknown input u k the unmeasured state variables l p i a the unknown variant dependent model constants p h p d q c simultaneously alongside further dependent variables such as the reproduction rate or the new recoveries the technical details of the dynamic inversion approach are summarized in appendix b 2 4 susceptible population transmission rate waning in this section we solve the immunization waning loop using the computed number of new cases and recoveries the registered stringency index vaccination data and an enhanced vaccination model 2 4 1 problem and outline to make a reliable prediction for the future evolution of the pandemic it is essential to have appropriate estimates for the following unknown u rate coefficients u1 the current transmission rate of the virus β u2 the rate of immunization by vaccination ν u3 the current rate of immunity loss ω furthermore it is also necessary to estimate u4 the susceptible population s note that the estimated rate of immunization u2 can be used to quantify the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns moreover the registered stringency index i s determines a prior estimate on the transmission rate u1 however estimating u3 is particularly difficult as it captures two independent processes first the rate of immunity loss aims to model a continuous ambient immunity waning secondly the rate of immunity loss may have sudden peaks as an emerging immune evasive voc causes a massive loss of immunity in the protected population at the same time waning affects the whole process to a high degree as it transmits the protected individuals with an arbitrary vaccination status to the susceptibles in this way the loss of immunity will thoroughly disrupt the susceptible population which becomes a mixture of individuals with different vaccination status and any possible history of infection not to mention the fact that the mixture of susceptibles is affected by the nonlinear infection process where the average rate of transmission is again uncertain as the infectiousness may depend on the immunity status of the population to estimate the susceptible population and the rate coefficients we use the computed quantities c1 c3 and consider the following data d d1 the registered vaccination data d2 the estimated stringency index i s d3 the relative infectiousness of each voc unlike the linear disease course model the immunization waning dynamics lack the advantage of state observability however the d2 and d3 can regulate the estimated value of the transmission rate whereas d1 with an initial estimate of waning determine the rate of immunization the problem is still under determined as the number of unknowns outweighs the measurements therefore our strategy is to find a solution for which 6 the rate of immunity loss is minimal such that 1 the transmission rate is close to an initial estimate made on the bases of d2 and d3 2 both the transmission and the immunity loss rates are smoothly varying in time 3 the unknown coefficients move between reasonable bounds other estimates on the reproduction number mathieu et al 2020 atlo team 2021a and our previous results polcz et al 2022 csutak et al 2022 serve as good bases to further regularize the problem 2 4 2 detailed vaccination model in model 2 it is not straightforward how to relate the immunization rate ν k to the registered first second and booster vaccine doses d1 therefore we consider an enhanced vaccination model with three vaccination statuses first we consider a group of individuals who are fully vaccinated and immunity has already been established after the full vaccination secondly a group of people are said to be boosted if immunity has already been developed after receiving a booster dose finally the remaining population is said to be not fully vaccinated the number of fully vaccinated and boosted individuals on day k are denoted by v f k and v b k respectively from a computational point of view dividing all compartments according to the vaccination status is not fortunate but observe that s and r are manipulated by the infected compartments through the number of new cases u k and new recoveries z k only which are already computed therefore we remove the disease course dynamics from the initial model as illustrated in panel a of fig 4 then we distinguish three subgroups of both the susceptible s s u s f s b and the protected population r r u r f r b as follows s u susceptible individuals who have not yet acquired immunity through vaccination r u individuals who are not fully vaccinated but who have acquired immunity through recovery s f individuals who have been fully vaccinated but have lost their immunity due to the waning immunity or the immune evasion capability of a new voc r f fully vaccinated individuals who are still protected possibly both by recovery or vaccination s b boosted individuals who lost their immunity r b boosted individuals who are still protected possibly both by recovery or a booster dose the transitions between the sub compartments are illustrated in panel b of fig 4 the enhanced vaccination model uses two rate coefficients for immunization on day k ν f k proportion of the not fully vaccinated population n v f acquires immunity by full vaccination and moves to compartment r f moreover ν b k proportion of fully vaccinated individuals v f regain or retain immunity by receiving a booster dose finally ν b k proportion of boosted susceptibles regain immunity by receiving an additional booster dose to represent the indirect infection recovery transition between each pair of sub compartments s r the number of new cases and recoveries are distributed appropriately according to the vaccination status of susceptible people a detailed description of the enhanced immunization model is available in appendix c remark 3 until the middle of 2022 data provided by official bodies suggested that it was reasonable to separate the fully vaccinated and the boosted population our choices and points 1 and 4 in assumption 6 were also confirmed by the definitions used in king county 2022 however separating the two states does not seem to be important today therefore the vaccination model is planned to be reformulated in the future 2 4 3 heuristics to estimate the rate coefficients the simultaneous reconstruction of the three smoothly time varying rate coefficients β k ν k ω k is not straightforward therefore as the initial step we give a preliminary estimate for the immunization rate ν k using the registered vaccination data with the assumption that ω 0 then the priori estimate on ν k allows us to formulate a simple dynamic data assimilation problem to compute the transmission rate β k and the immunity loss rate ω k of the epidemic process using the estimated rate ω k we can update the immunization rate ν k which makes possible to improve the estimates for ω k and β k etc namely the rate coefficients and the number of susceptibles and protected people in the three different vaccination statuses can be estimated iteratively using simple computational steps the iterations converge and give an approximated solution to a more complex data assimilation problem the technical details of the optimization based iterative approach are summarized in appendix d 3 results and discussion in this section we evaluate and discuss the potential of the proposed approach for reconstruction and prediction 3 1 retrospective epidemic data reconstruction first we present and discuss a retrospective reconstruction for the entire time span of the pandemic in hungary using wastewater data until 1 february 2023 3 1 1 estimated parameters and under detection rate the viral load in wastewater gives us information about the current epidemic state whereas the hospitalization data gives delayed information about severe infections these two data sets allow us to fit model parameters which affect the course of the disease as the incubation period and serological analyses can well approximate the average length of the illness we had the possibility to estimate the hospitalization probability p h the registered hospital load and the cumulative number of deaths gives the possibility to estimate the probability of a fatal outcome p d if a person is hospitalized the estimated probability coefficients for the different voc are presented in rows 1 2 of table 2 due to the linear structure of the disease course model the number of new cases and the number of infected people in the different phases of the disease can be reconstructed simply using dynamic inversion section 2 3 the computed number of new infections is illustrated in fig 5 compared with the official detected cases the under detection rate denote by q u and then the scaled series of detected cases are computed separately for each epidemic wave as described in remark 7 the scaled and smoothly concatenated curves of the consecutive outbreaks are also illustrated by the stacked area plot in fig 5 the estimated under detection rates for the different waves are given in the legend of fig 5 and in row 3 of table 2 we can make the following observations the probability of developing symptoms and being hospitalized gradually decreases with the newer virus variants the hospitalization probability peaks at the alpha variant and then decreases gradually this estimate corresponds to the fact that the highest peak of hospital load is attained in march 2021 during the third epidemic outbreak caused by the alpha variant in that case the hospital load at the peak of the third wave exceeded the hospital capacity in hungary 10000 patients the estimated values of the secretion coefficient for the major variants are presented in row 4 of table 2 it is worth remarking that the virus secretion coefficient estimated for the omicron variants reduced for a third compared to that obtained for delta row 4 in table 2 these estimates correspond to the results of kang et al 2022 examining the resulting values for the secretion coefficients row 4 of table 2 we found that shedding is roughly 3 5 times more intensive during the delta infection than the omicron infection the computed ratio is confirmed by the measurements of kang et al 2022 the secretion of the ancestor variant in comparison with the delta variant seems reasonable although we haven t found a comparative study to confirm this result nevertheless we should discuss the secretion coefficient computed for alpha variant as it is only one 3rd of the value obtained for delta and fairly close to the value obtained for omicron the obtained secretion coefficient for the alpha variant can be attributed to the higher hospitalization probability computed for the wave caused by the alpha variant note that q c and p h are estimated simultaneously the infectious shedding population in comparison with the scaled genome copy concentration is presented in fig 6 the reconstructed curve of hospitalization along with the official data is presented in fig 7 the computed reproduction number is illustrated in fig 8 in alongside by the bayesian estimate made by the group of owid mathieu et al 2020 finally the heuristic approach in section 2 4 is also able to estimate the transmission rate of the virus fig 9 illustrates its evolution during the epidemic waves section s1 of the supplementary document presents a brief parameter sensitivity analysis of our approach with respect to the fixed model constants in table 1 moreover in section s2 of the supplementary document we analyze the uncertainty of the estimated parameters in table 2 in the terms of the wastewater measurement noise 3 1 2 immunization and waning the estimated immunization rate and the best case rate of immunity loss are illustrated in fig 10 knowing these two rate coefficients we are able to compute the number of daily new immunizations and immunity loss events fig 11 but also their cumulative curves fig 12 when an individual loses immunity twice e g first after recovery and second after vaccination they are counted as two distinct events in fig 12 we also present the estimated number of susceptible and protected people alongside the cumulative cases immunizations and immunity loss the reconstructed curves suggest that by the third quarter of 2022 the epidemic wave triggered by the emergence of variant ba 5 was rebounded multiple times first in september 2022 possibly due to the star of school year secondly in november 2022 possible due to the appearance of the variant bq 1 hodcroft 2023 in table 3 we made estimates on the number of infections immunity loss and clinical immunizations these estimates are computed separately for each epidemic outbreak in row 1 the estimated sum of all infections predicts that 155 of the population have been infected in 2022 and about 204 of the population have been infected during the whole time span of the covid 19 pandemic these estimates should be interpreted such that in average the whole population became infected which is not impossible considering the high immune evasive properties of the different subvariants of omicron variant lyngse et al 2022 however as reported by iwasaki 2021 or sheehan et al 2021 short term reinfections and hence quick immunity loss are possible even for the wild type or alpha variants for individuals without any known immune disorder in row 2 we estimated the number of people who have lost immunity during and before the outbreaks these estimates suggest a massive 131 loss of immunity and or a strong immune evasive capability of the emerging subvariants of omicron during 2022 we highlight that these numbers are rough estimates and are not appropriate for assessing the relative immune evasive capability of two virus variants at the same time the computed rate of immunity loss fig 10 confirms the estimates of lyngse et al 2021 and cocchio et al 2022 that the omicron ba 1 and ba 2 variants are at least four times immune evasive compared to the delta variant we remark that the immunity loss rate is a time varying coefficient therefore its inverse gives the expected time of being susceptible again the computed expected time for losing immunity in specific periods of the epidemic was 2021 fall semester 1 0 0027 days 1 year 2022 first quarter 1 0 008 days 4 months 2022 aug oct 1 0 0085 days 4 months 2022 dec 1 0 017 days 2 months considering that these parameters are national estimates we found that they show good correlation with the findings of stein et al 2023 but also not too far from the more optimistic estimates of willyard 2023 in row 5 the decreasing effectiveness of vaccinations is due to the fact that the majority of the vaccinated population was presumably immunized through recovery we note that our model does not consider hybrid immunity so a vaccine given to an immune person does not count as extra immunization according to this interpretation the first vaccination campaign in the 2021 wave was the most successful during and after the outbreak caused by the alpha variant as about 78 of the vaccinated population was not infected or had already lost immunity 3 2 prediction here we illustrate the prediction potential of the proposed approach first we simulate short term predictions at every day in two cases 1 using both medical and wastewater data 2 using only medical data secondly we simulate multiple long term 6 months long predictions at a fixed date considering different scenarios parameter values but using both medical and wastewater data 3 2 1 short term predictions and comparison the estimated current status of the epidemic spread allows us to simulate its future evolution the current state and hence the future evolution of the epidemic can be estimated more accurately if the measured viral load in wastewater is used in the calculations to illustrate the contribution of the water measurements we performed 30 day long predictions every day starting 20 august 2020 with and without wastewater data the prediction at a given starting day let us denote it by k 0 is simulated in three steps first the raw data are clipped to k k 0 namely the computations are performed without any measurements obtained for the future secondly we perform a reconstruction to estimate the pandemic state on day k 0 finally a prediction is obtained by evaluating the dynamic recursion of the epidemic model 2 to evaluate the quality of the predictions the results of the reconstruction and prediction are compared with a retrospective reconstruction in both two cases with and without wastewater data note that the reconstructions were performed using the same methodology as the retrospective reconstructions but with a smaller data set and with fixed coefficients p h and q c remark 4 the predictions both using and neglecting wastewater measurements assume that the hospitalization probability p h and the secretion coefficient q c are given and fixed a priori however the actual values of p h and q c considered during the current reconstructions were obtained through a retrospective reconstruction using wastewater data although we use the same model constants in both cases with and without wastewater the results suggest that wastewater measurements have the advantage to show the trends of an outbreak earlier this observation is even more striking since the appearance of variant ba 2 where the hospitalization curve does not show the typical trends as before cf figs 6 and 7 in fig 13 we illustrate two possible predictions on 20 distinct days simulated with red and without wastewater blue in each subplot of fig 13 the solid vertical red line denotes k 0 the actual starting day which is also given in the title of the subplot each dashed line represents a reconstruction up to k 0 followed by a simulated prediction from k 0 in each subplot the results of a retrospective reconstruction are also illustrated by solid lines in both cases using both medical and wastewater data red and using only medical data blue the colored areas in fig 13 illustrate the detected cases scaled to fit the new cases computed retrospectively practically the colored areas in each subplot illustrating the scaled detected cases resemble the corresponding segments of the scaled detected cases in fig 5 finally in fig 13 the obtained quantities were later normalized to a population of 1000 to facilitate convenient visualization of the y axes in general we observed that the characteristic phases of an outbreak appear earlier in the wastewater data than in hospitalization load in fig 13 we illustrated a few predictions in different phases of the outbreaks namely first signs of an outbreak p1 p7 emergence p2 p4 p8 p11 p16 peaks p9 p12 p17 decline p3 p5 p14 end of an outbreak p6 p10 p15 rebounds p13 and plateaus p18 p19 p20 on 26 august 2020 wastewater measurements resulted in a prediction p1 which could be obtained only 13 days later p2 using solely hospitalization data then on 16 december 2020 wastewater measurements already forecast the near end of the 1st wave p3 from measurements the emergence of alpha variant was predicted on 11 february 2021 p4 whereas the increasing hospitalization data warned us only by the end of february then we predicted the end of the outbreak on 28 march 2021 p5 whereas the peak of the hospital occupancy was detected only 8 days later the first sign of the third wave caused by delta variant was detected on 24 august 2021 p7 using measurements and 2 days later using only hospitalization data however the first accurate prediction for the exponential emergence detected on 6 september 2021 p8 was obtained only 10 days later using only hospitalization curves without wastewater measurements outbreak peaks could only be detected retrospectively in this case study as hospital treatment data are delayed by τ l 1 τ p 1 τ i 1 τ a 1 8 14 days compared to the number of new cases from wastewater we detected peaks for about 10 days earlier for waves caused by variants delta p9 omicron ba 1 p12 ba 2 p13 and ba 5 p17 to measure the quality of a prediction we considered the euclidean distance between the sequences obtained for the new cases through the current prediction and the retrospective reconstruction within the prediction horizon n 30 days in this case study underestimating forecasts are penalized against those that overestimated the severity of the outbreak correspondingly we consider the distances in the logarithmic scale log 10 formally a prediction made on day k is qualified by the square root of the following measure 7 i 1 n log 10 y k i predicted log 10 y k i reconstructed 2 additionally a prediction made without wastewater data is compared to the reconstruction made without the knowledge of wastewater data in terms of 7 the maximum prediction error obtained without wastewater is 25 higher compared to that obtained using wastewater data the two worst predictions are illustrated in p6 and p10 of fig 13 on 30 may 2021 the medical data suggested a rebound of the past wave caused by the alpha variant p6 however a new wave emerged only three months later by early september 2021 p7 on the other hand the virus secretion coefficient estimated for the omicron variants reduced to a third compared to that of delta row 4 in table 2 therefore the emergence of the omicron variant could not be detected yet on 3 january 2022 p10 but only 8 days later p11 remark 5 we note that in 53 of days wastewater based predictions resulted in a higher prediction error in the terms of 7 it is also worth mentioning that the euclidean distance of the logarithm is not the best quality measure as it does not qualify the difference between the shapes of two curves 3 2 2 long term prediction considering a starting time 1 may 2022 as the time label of the last available data we simulate the epidemic process model 2 to estimate the future evolution of the pandemic by that time the fourth wave caused by the omicron ba 1 and ba 2 variants ended but a new immune evasive variant ba 5 was expected to emerge in that situation we made the following assumptions 1 the immune evasive capability of ba 5 is similar to that estimated for ba 1 ba 2 i e ω 0 0062 in average between 1 january and 15 april 2022 therefore the future immunity loss rate is estimated to be ω 0 0062 25 p1 in fig 14 2 the estimated transmission rate is extrapolated with a possible 30 deviation from its last computed value p2 in fig 14 3 as for the fixed table 1 and computed model constants table 2 we used the available values namely those available or estimated for variant ba 2 4 we assume no significant vaccination activity in the near future to make a statistical prediction we simulated 126 scenarios using different β and ω values plot p3 in fig 14 illustrates the average and the standard deviation of the predicted curves for the estimated new cases in all figures we illustrate the actual curves obtained later through a retrospective reconstruction 4 conclusions as the number and relevance of clinical tests for covid 19 are declining wbe is becoming the primary source of information on disease transmission in a community recognizing this both who and the european union considers wbe a promising public health tool even beyond the current pandemic motivated by these international trends we proposed a novel approach combining wastewater based epidemic surveillance with detailed dynamical modeling to improve epidemic monitoring and prediction we developed a novel compartmental epidemic model with a 2 phase vaccination dynamics and waning immunity immune evasion and waning are described by a single compartmental transition from the recovered people to the susceptibles but with a time dependent transition rate using time dependent model parameters relevant to the dominant virus variants the model allows for us to reconstruct the unknown epidemiological data during the whole time span of the pandemic using the registered number of hospitalized patients and the measured genome copy concentration in the wastewater alongside the popular epidemic indicators incidence prevalence reproduction number transmission rate a full epidemic state reconstruction is possible in each time instant including the susceptible and protected population in the different vaccination status and the infected population in the different phases of the disease it is shown that wastewater based viral information can be efficiently used to track the transmission rate of the virus the rate of immunization by vaccination and the rate of losing immunity within a time frame as time varying parameters in the computations we exploit the registered stringency index and the relative infectiousness of the dominant virus variant which provides a starting point in estimating the transmission rate the estimated immunization rate allows us to quantify the effectiveness of vaccination by comparing the estimated new immunizations with the received vaccine doses within a given time interval the detailed reconstruction provides a reliable estimate of the current epidemic situation which allows us to give a prediction with an extrapolated transmission rate and waning characteristics to promote computational tractability the long term epidemic surveillance framework reconstruction and prediction was implemented by multiple efficient optimization steps the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a case study of pandemic reconstruction and prediction in hungary the results suggest that wastewater measurements make predictions more reliable as the characteristic moments of an outbreak appear about a week earlier in wastewater data the computed model based predictions were shared with the hungarian national public health center to support decision making on public policies in hungary in this work we successfully demonstrated that wastewater based epidemic modeling substantially contributes to the translation of environmental surveillance data to outbreak management

through the grant post covid2021 64 appendix a dynamical model representation in this section we provide a few technical details and further remarks on the epidemic process model introduced in section 2 2 a 1 model decomposition the special model structure of the epidemic process model allows to reformulate it as an interconnection of a linear parameter varying model and a scalar nonlinear model first we consider a dynamical model for the course of the disease of the infected population as a subsystem of 2 as follows a 1 x k 1 f θ k x k b u k y k c x k where x vec l p i a h d r n x is the state θ vec τ l τ p τ i τ a τ h p i p h p d r n p is the parameter the daily new cases u appears as an input the hospitalized h and deceased d patients are measured states the number of infectious people y is an indirectly measured output of the system furthermore the coefficient matrices are given below f θ τ l 0 0 0 0 0 τ l τ p 0 0 0 0 0 p i τ p τ i 0 0 0 0 1 p i τ p 0 τ a 0 0 0 0 p h τ i 0 τ h 0 0 0 0 0 p d τ h 0 a 2 b vec 1 0 0 0 0 0 c row 0 1 1 q a 0 0 system a 1 with matrices a 2 constitutes the disease course model or simply the disease model which is highlighted in the compartmental model 2 as the overall population n was assumed invariant the number of immune people can be expressed as r n k s where k l p i a h d denotes the sum of infected and deceased people accordingly the time evolution of the susceptible individuals can be described by a single recursion as follows a 3 s k 1 1 ν k ω k s k ω k n k k u k system a 1 and a 3 are interconnected through the feedback u k β k y k s k n 4 where β is unknown remark 6 system a 3 is manipulated indirectly by β and directly both by the rate of immunity loss ω and the immunization rate ν the two rate coefficients ω and ν can be considered as a dual pair of each other however their roles and nature are different unlike ν which is well defined and can be manipulated by vaccination strategies the rate of immunity loss ω is unknown and in an ideal world cannot be manipulated by humans but is primarily due to mutation of the virus in this way the transition dynamics between s and r can also be considered as a differential game fisac et al 2019 in which the two opponents humans and virus are struggling to win over as many people as possible in compartments r and s respectively coefficients ν and ω are manipulated exclusively by both humans and virus respectively whereas the transmission rate β of the pathogen can be manipulated both by social distancing strategies and the increasing infectiousness of the virus a 2 variant dependent model constants and their smooth transitions the model coefficients τ p and q c are variant dependent such that their values are smoothly changing as a new voc gains dominance to characterize the piece wise constant parameter functions which vary smoothly between two constant levels we introduce specific characteristic functions that highlights the dominance period of a given voc when a new voc emerges and overcomes another variant the proportion of the new variant compared to the sum of both variants follows a sigmoid like curve radu et al 2022 when a model parameter θ changes from value θ 0 to θ 1 such that the new voc emerges at time k 1 k it takes dominance at time k 1 and the old variant vanishes at time k 1 k then we consider the following smooth transition between the two parameter values a 4 θ k θ 0 θ 1 θ 0 σ k k 1 k for all k k 1 k k 1 k 1 k where σ 1 1 0 1 constitutes the following normalized sigmoid type function a 5 σ t σ t σ 1 σ 1 σ 1 and σ t 1 e s 0 t 1 in a 5 we use a scaling factor s 0 5 which provides a sufficiently small slope at the two ends of the parameter transition assume that a given voc emerges and takes dominance at time k 1 in a duration of 2 k 1 1 days then another variant overcomes it in a duration of 2 k 2 1 around time k 2 then using function σ we introduce the characteristic function χ voc for that variant which highlights its dominance pattern as follows χ voc k 0 if k k 1 k 1 σ k k 1 k 1 if k 1 k 1 k k 1 k 1 1 if k 1 k 1 k k 2 k 2 1 σ k k 2 k 2 if k 2 k 2 k k 2 k 2 0 if k 2 k 2 k where as described in section 2 2 3 the variants of concern that emerged in hungary are as follows a 6 voc wild alpha delta ba 1 ba 2 ba 5 we note that the sum of the characteristic functions gives identically one namely voc χ voc 1 in fig a 15 we illustrate the characteristic functions correspondingly to the variant dominance observed in hungary if we fix the characteristic curves for all dominant variants in a 6 we are able to estimate all model coefficients by piece wise constant functions with smooth transitions as follows a 7 p k voc p voc χ voc k τ k voc τ voc χ voc k q c k voc q c voc χ voc k where according to assumption 3 the virus secretion coefficient corresponding to variants ba 1 and ba 2 are identical i e q c ba 1 q c ba 2 remark 7 under detection rate the characteristic curves allow the estimation of the number of all infections within an epidemic wave such that the series of new infections are multiplied by the characteristic curve of an epidemic wave and the resulting series are summarized over the time e g the new cases during the spread of delta variant can be computed as follows a 8 k 0 t 1 χ delta k c o m p u t e d new cases on day k u k the number of detected cases can be computed similarly a 9 k 0 t 1 χ delta k d e t e c t e d new cases on day k denoted by u k off therefore the under detection rate during the wave caused by delta can be computed as the proportion of the two quantities above namely a 10 q u delta k χ delta k u k k χ delta k u k off 4 9 finally the scaled series of the detected cases denoted by u k off are computed such that each segment of the series u off characterized by q u voc is scaled by the corresponding multiplier q u voc then the resulting series are accumulated for all outbreaks formally a 11 u k off voc q u voc χ voc k u k off sequence u k off is illustrated in fig 5 by the colored area appendix b dynamic inversion to compute infected people undetected cases and unknown model coefficients in this section we formalize the optimization based dynamic inversion approach introduced in section 2 3 the dynamic inversion of the linear disease course dynamics a 1 constitutes in the computation of the unknown input u k 4 using the measured output q c k c k off m1 and states h k off and d k off practically the dynamic inversion or the output tracking problem has three reference outputs m1 m2 m3 to track by manipulating one single variable c1 the number of new infections u k in this construction the problem is over determined therefore new degrees of freedom have to be introduced to the optimization task by relaxing a few model coefficients as follows 1 we consider q c voc as free variables c6 2 the probability levels of being hospitalized p h voc and of fatal outcome p d voc are searched as free variables within a given reasonable domain c5 the cost function of the multi objective optimization problem is constructed as follows b 1 j k 1 t w h ref h k h k off 2 tracking error h off k 1 t w d ref d k d k off 2 tracking error d off k 1 t w c ref y k q c k c k off 2 tracking error c off k 0 t 2 w u s u k 1 u k 2 smoothly varying new cases where y k is defined in the output eq 3 and w h ref w d ref w c ref w u s are weight constants which scale the different cost terms into a common order of magnitude the last term in b 1 promotes a smooth solution for u k which does not make abrupt changes in time differently from variables h k d k y k which are initialized in k 0 the input u k is unknown in k 0 and its value is irrelevant in k t this explains the range of indices in the last summation of b 1 finally the optimization problem can be formulated as follows problem 1 optimization based dynamic inversion given the dynamical disease course model a 1 with initial condition x 0 0 fixed model constants q a and τ voc corresponding to each dominant voc a 6 there are given m1 m2 m3 as references to track with k 1 t we are looking for 1 p h voc and p d voc 0 1 the unknown probability levels 2 q c voc the unknown secretion coefficients 3 u k 0 the daily new cases as a sequence of unknown inputs k 0 t 1 4 x k 0 the number of infected people in the 5 different states of the disease k 1 t which solve the state recursion a 1 and minimize the cost function b 1 remark 8 the number of infectious people y k can also be added as a free instrumental variable ruled by the output eq 3 in this way further degrees of freedom are introduced in problem 1 which promotes finding a feasible solution to the nonlinear gradient based optimization task after the optimization of problem 1 we are able to compute other important epidemiological quantities such as the number of infectious people 3 the new recoveries 5 as well as the reproduction number of the disease these quantities can be inferred without knowing the nature of waning immunity and the effects of vaccination the time dependent effective reproduction number of the disease can be given as follows b 2 r c k β k 1 τ p k p i k τ i k q a 1 p i k τ a k s k n in this formulation r c k requires the knowledge of s k and β k which are still unknown after the solution of problem 1 however the term β k s k can be expressed from u k β k y k s k n 4 then an alternative formula for r c can be given as follows b 3 r c k u k y k 1 τ p k p i k τ i k q a 1 p i k τ a k during the optimization we used the following weight constants in the cost function w h ref 1 w d ref w c ref 1 0 5 w u s 1 0 4 the values of the parameters are available in table 1 appendix c immunization model based on the descriptions of section 2 4 2 here we derive a dynamical model describing immunity waning infection and vaccination in three different vaccination statuses moreover we propose a simple model for the dynamic effects of the delayed immunization through vaccination in this section the cumulative number of first second and booster doses delivered are denoted by v first off v second off v boosted off respectively see the equation in box ii c 1 delayed effect of vaccination a susceptible individual does not acquire immunity immediately after vaccination but a certain amount of time is needed for the vaccine to take effect in this section we present the points 2 3 and 4 of assumption 6 in more detail assumption 9 the delayed immunization is modeled as follows 1 the probability that a partially vaccinated individual will be fully vaccinated can be well approximated as follows c 2 p v 2 v 1 v second off v first off 1 0 967 where v first off and v second off denote the last available vaccination data 2 the time elapsed between the first two doses is normally distributed with expected value t 12 21 days and standard deviation σ 12 7 days 3 after receiving a the full vaccine or a booster dose a person becomes temporarily immune after a certain period of time which is normally distributed with expected value t e 14 days and standard deviation σ e 4 days in accordance with assumption 9 an individual gains immunity after the first vaccine dose with probability p v 2 v 1 but only after a normally distributed delay with expected value t 12 e t 12 t e 51 days and standard deviation σ 12 e σ e 2 σ 12 2 8 days then the expected fully vaccinated population on day k can be approximated as follows c 3 v f k p v 2 v 1 i 2 σ 12 e 2 σ 12 e v first k t 12 e i off q i σ 12 e whereas the boosted population is c 4 v b k i 2 σ e 2 σ e v boost k t e i off q i σ e in c 3 and c 4 the weight coefficients q i are derived from the cumulative distribution function φ of the standard normal distribution c 5 q i σ φ 2 i 1 2 σ φ 2 i 1 2 σ 2 φ 4 σ 1 2 σ 1 1 remark 9 note that the number of vaccinated people in c 3 and c 4 are practically computed by a convolution of the official data with a gaussian window therefore the normally distributed delay of the effect of the first and booster doses has a beneficial smoothing effect on the official data c 2 distribution of new cases and recoveries in accordance with assumption 7 the distribution of new cases by vaccination status on day k is determined by the distribution s u k s f k s b k of the susceptible population at that time namely c 6 u k u u k u f k u b k such that u u k u f k u b k u k s u k s k u k s f k s k u k s b k s k moreover the distribution of new recoveries by vaccination status on day k is approximated by the distribution of the susceptible population on day k t 0 k namely c 7 z k z u k z f k z b k such that z u k z f k z b k z k s u k t 0 s k t 0 z k s f k t 0 s k t 0 u k s b k t 0 s k t 0 where t 0 k 1 τ l k 1 τ p k p i k τ i k 1 p i k τ a k p h k τ h k constitutes the expected duration of recovery c 3 state recursion with vaccination and waning model finally a state recursion for the dynamics of the susceptible and protected population is given in the floating eq c 1 where and denote the rates of immunization triggered by the full vaccinations and booster doses the immunization rates can be expressed as follows c 8 note that the two rates in c 8 corresponding to the received vaccine doses are a fine tuning of the single immunization rate ν k in the 8 compartmental model 2 to retain the overall rate of immunization of susceptibles through vaccination in general the value of ν k can be expressed as follows c 9 ν k ν f k s u k ν b k s f k s b k s k remark 10 assuming no waning immunity ω 0 s f 0 and s b 0 the overall rate of immunization is c 10 ν k ν f k v f k v f k 1 v f k k k the subgroups of the susceptible and protected people and the transitions between the subgroups are presented in fig 4 appendix d heuristics to estimate the rate of transmission of the pathogen and the waning immunity here we describe the iterative approach to estimate the three time varying rate coefficients of the epidemic process the basic idea of the heuristics was introduced briefly in section 2 4 3 namely the rates of immunization and immunity loss are computed step by step one after another by fixing one and computing the other and then vice versa d 1 fix ω compute ν the recursion model c 1 makes it possible to simulate the time evolution of susceptibles in the three different vaccination statuses for a given rate of immunity loss this algebraic problem can be formulated as follows problem 2 estimate the rate of immunization through vaccination consider the following pre computed quantities 1 u k the pre computed number of new cases 2 z k the pre computed number of new recoveries 3 ω k an estimated rate of immunity loss first initialized by ω 0 4 v f k and v b k pre processed official vaccination data where k 0 t we are looking for a solution to recursion c 1 with initial condition s u 0 n in problem 2 the new cases u k and new recoveries z k were pre computed through the dynamic inversion described in problem 1 whereas the rate of immunity loss ω k is first initialized by zero i e no waning immunity is assumed then a solution to the recursion c 1 allows computing the overall rate of immunization ν k as described in c 9 this value to ν k allows us to give an estimate for the rate of immunity loss ω k as described in the following subsection d 2 fix ν compute ω a pre computed immunization rate allows us to formulate a simple optimization problem to estimate both the immunity loss and the transmission rates the stringency index d2 and the approximated infectiousness β voc d3 of each voc allows us to determine a prior estimate for the actual transmission rate of the virus as follows d 1 β k ref voc χ voc k β voc i s k we presume that β k ref is a good estimate to use as a flexible reference for the optimized smooth transmission rate β k during the optimization the immunity loss rate ω k is searched as a smooth time varying sequence not producing abrupt changes such that its value is included into the objective function with a given weight in this way the unknown coefficients are kept between reasonable bounds and the transmission rate sequence is regularized by the measured stringency index and the relative infectiousness of the emerging variants with these considerations we finally define the following cost function to minimize j 2 k 0 t 1 w u ref u k u ˆ k 2 tracking error new cases k 0 t 1 w b ref β k ref β k 2 tracking error β k 0 t 2 w b sm β k 1 β k 2 smooth transmission rate k 0 t 2 w w sm ω k 1 ω k 2 smooth immunity loss rate d 2 k 0 t 1 w ω c ω k 2 immunity loss cost note that variables u ˆ k β k ω k are unknown in k 0 t however their values in k t are not needed as they are not required to compute the state in k t similarly the distance between β t and β t 1 or between ω t and ω t 1 are not relevant these considerations explain the ranges of summations in d 2 the optimization problem to find β k ω k and an updated number of susceptibles s k is formulated as follows problem 3 estimate the susceptible population and the rate of immunity loss consider the following pre computed quantities 1 u k the pre computed number of new cases within 24 h 2 y k the number of infectious people 3 k k the number of infected and deceased people 4 β k ref a reference transmission rate of the pathogen inferred from the stringency index 5 ν k an estimated rate of immunization triggered by vaccination where k 0 t we are looking for 1 s k 0 n the number of susceptible individuals 2 ω k 0 the rate of immunity loss 3 β k β β the actual rate of transmission of the pathogen 4 u ˆ k an instrumental variable reconstructing the number of new cases which solve s k 1 1 ν k ω k s k ω k n k k u ˆ k a 3 satisfy u ˆ k β k y k s k n 4 and minimize d 2 remark 11 the instrumental variable u ˆ k introduces a further degree of freedom in problem 3 which makes the nonlinear gradient based optimization task computationally more tractable namely it promotes finding an initial feasible solution d 3 alternating iterations observe that problem 3 makes use of the immunization rate ν k but provides an estimated immunity loss rate ω k whereas in problem 2 we solve the recursion c 1 to find the immunization rate for a given sequence of immunity loss rate therefore problems 2 and 3 can be solved multiple times one after another such that a problem 2 is solved first with no waning assumed ω 0 or b problem 3 is solved first with a simple vaccination model c 10 scenario a and b are equivalent as the solution of problem 2 with ω 0 generates ν as given in c 10 we note that the proposed iteration of the two problems in succession converged in all our experiments remark 12 the alternating iterations considered here were inspired by the iterative solution of cisneros and werner 2020 for nonlinear model predictive control problems the main similarity between the approaches is the existence of a precomputed parameter trajectory in our case the immunization rate ν which can be initialized e g by 0 and updated by a closed form recursion c 1 for any feasible values of the unknown variables the immunity loss rate ω moreover the unknown variables are computed by an optimization problem 3 which is parameterized by the parameter trajectory a significant difference is the type of the optimization problem cisneros and werner 2020 presumes a convex quadratic program whereas problem 3 is bilinear therefore the existing preliminary convergence results of cisneros and werner 2020 hespe and werner 2021 morato et al 2021 and cisneros 2021 are not applicable here and considering the difficulty of the problem it will be a target of future work to give a proof of convergence for this iteration appendix e supplementary data supplementary material related to this

14685, motivation wastewater based epidemiology wbe has emerged as a promising approach for monitoring the covid 19 pandemic since the measurement process is cost effective and is exposed to fewer potential errors compared to other indicators like hospitalization data or the number of detected cases consequently wbe was gradually becoming a key tool for epidemic surveillance and often the most reliable data source as the intensity of clinical testing for covid 19 drastically decreased by the third year of the pandemic recent results suggests that the model based fusion of wastewater measurements with clinical data and other indicators is essential in future epidemic surveillance method in this work we developed a wastewater based compartmental epidemic model with a two phase vaccination dynamics and immune evasion we proposed a multi step optimization based data assimilation method for epidemic state reconstruction parameter estimation and prediction the computations make use of the measured viral load in wastewater the available clinical data hospital occupancy delivered vaccine doses and deaths the stringency index of the official social distancing rules and other measures the current state assessment and the estimation of the current transmission rate and immunity loss allow a plausible prediction of the future progression of the pandemic results qualitative and quantitative evaluations revealed that the contribution of wastewater data in our computational epidemiological framework makes predictions more reliable predictions suggest that at least half of the hungarian population has lost immunity during the epidemic outbreak caused by the ba 1 and ba 2 subvariants of omicron in the first half of 2022 we obtained a similar result for the outbreaks caused by the subvariant ba 5 in the second half of 2022 applicability the proposed approach has been used to support covid management in hungary and could be customized for other countries as well graphical abstract msc 37n25 92d30 keywords wastewater based epidemiology epidemic model dynamical system parameter estimation optimization data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe has gained a special interest during the covid 19 pandemic although it is not new in the literature been et al 2014 claro et al 2021 suggested that wbe is a powerful tool in the long term monitoring of covid 19 pandemic randazzo et al 2020 and zulli et al 2021 demonstrated that wbe is an efficient tool for supporting decision making on public policies during an epidemic outbreak however bibby et al 2021 drew attention to the typically uncertain dynamics of the virus secretion in feces which may undermine the potential for wbe as an early warning system olesen et al 2021 concluded that wbe can be used as a leading indicator but the lead time should be determined with a special care for the different applications the predictive quality of the wbe is data sensitive huizer et al 2021 therefore the processing and the normalization of the measured genome copy concentration are also essential zhu et al 2022 radu et al 2022 and lee et al 2021 used wbe to show the emergence of the alpha variant weeks before the first clinical case detected in austria and the united states respectively a similar observation is seen by lee et al 2022 for the rapid displacement of the delta variant by the highly virulent omicron variant morvan et al 2022 confirmed that the first signs of a new outbreak appear approximately a week earlier than clinical testing data using statistical methods krivoňáková et al 2021 showed a good correlation between wastewater data and clinical cases the dynamic relationship between the wastewater copy numbers and the clinical cases was identified by xiao et al 2022 and daza torres et al 2023 as a finite support discrete time impulse response function which constitutes the shedding load distribution a similar closed form distribution function with a detailed temperature model is used by phan et al 2023 to model the viral load in the dynamical model it is interesting that the time lag between wastewater data and clinical cases may be both positive and negative when analyzing separate epidemic outbreaks see e g xiao et al 2022 fig 3 panels c and d jiang et al 2022 developed artificial neural network models for continuous epidemic monitoring using training data set including catchment historical weather clinical testing coverage and vaccination rate alongside the statistical and machine learning approaches the dynamical compartmental susceptible exposed infected recovered seir type models are also promising for epidemic surveillance and prediction fernandez cassi et al 2021 showed that the wastewater based reconstruction fits better to a model based epidemic curve compared to estimates based on confirmed cases using a detailed seir type model introduced by lemaitre et al 2020 proverbio et al 2022 have used a wastewater based seir model and the extended kalman filter to reconstruct epidemic data and detect early warning performance phan et al 2023 developed a detailed static shedding model and they fit an seir model to the measured viral load for a single epidemic wave pájaro et al 2022 built a stochastic sir model and solved it by using monte carlo methods to predict the evolution of the pandemics incorporating viral load data and a variable infection rate to capture the effects of mitigation policies fazli et al 2021 proposed an agent based seir model using viral load as a measurement for the early detection and prediction of an outbreak the incidence was computed by mcmahan et al 2021 using a wastewater based seir model and the under detection rate was estimated the model was used to predict the future possibility of an outbreak nourbakhsh et al 2022 used a detailed compartmental model with viral secretion to wastewater to estimate prevalence incidence and reproduction number using the reported clinical cases hospital admission and viral load in wastewater to analyze the epidemic spread and estimate the transmission rate jiang et al 2021 used markov processes such that the seir compartments are considered hidden variables whereas the viral load and clinical cases are observations a likelihood based approach made it possible to understand the internal relationship between different states and how covid 19 actually transmits plateaus rebounds and the effects of individual behaviors in epidemics are analyzed and explained by berestycki et al 2021 using a specific sir type partial differential equation pde model and high precision wastewater measurement during the past two years our research group has been focusing on the dynamical analysis data reconstruction and prediction of the covid 19 pandemic in hungary using the tools of systems and control theory and high performance computation techniques in this line of research a detailed agent based stochastic epidemic simulator was developed that uses realistic population structures and movement patterns in an urban environment which was used for analysis and prediction reguly et al 2022 péni et al 2020 proposed a methodology to design predefined discrete levels for public restrictions or interventions fulfilling complex time dependent and often contradicting economic and healthcare related requirements the data reconstruction problem of estimating the possible real number of infections and the population of non measurable compartments was solved by polcz et al 2022 using a stochastic model predictive control design it was clearly shown by péni et al 2022 that the optimal design of testing intensity is essential to keep the stringency of epidemic measures on a tolerable level parallelly an advanced framework for wastewater surveillance based on the detection of viral rna was developed by róka et al 2021 which is still in official use in hungary our earlier models used official data on hospitalizations to predict future infection event numbers these predictions were also helpful in the early stages of the epidemic in this paper we investigate how far the predictions can be improved with the incorporation of wastewater virus load data into the model therefore our objective is to combine and enhance our previous models with wastewater data we show that the additional information from wastewater based observations efficiently improves model calibration and prediction power which further supports epidemic monitoring and decision making 2 materials and methods this section is divided into four major parts after a brief description on the methodology for collecting and processing wastewater measurements we introduce a dynamic epidemic model in section 2 2 then we propose an epidemic data reconstruction approach in two steps in sections 2 3 and 2 4 the three subsections start with a short problem formulation the technical details of the methodology can be read in the appendix which is divided into four parts first a formal epidemic model is described in appendix a secondly the dynamic model inversion is detailed in appendix b then a specific immunization model is presented in appendix c which allows to estimate additional quantities such as the rate of immunity loss appendix d brief parameter and noise sensitive analyses of the proposed approach are given in the supplementary material 2 1 viral load measurement in wastewater sars cov 2 genome copy numbers in sewage were determined from samples obtained from the hungarian national wastewater monitoring system wastewater samples have been collected weekly since july 2020 from the following locations in the three wastewater treatment plants wwtp of budapest from the county seats n 18 and as a composite sample from 5 cities in the budapest agglomeration this sampling scheme covers 40 of the hungarian population all samples were taken after a grid filter at wastewater treatment plants the samples are still raw sewage only the lumpy waste is filtered out wastewater samples were processed as published previously by róka et al 2021 briefly cell debris of a v 0 50 ml initial sample volume was sedimented by centrifugation and the supernatant was concentrated by flat sheet ultrafiltration membrane at room temperature viral particles were recovered from the membrane by vortexing in virus transport medium v c 1 ml nucleic acids were extracted from the concentrate by qiaamp viral mini kit according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentrate of volume v s 140 μ l was lysed and loaded on centrifuge extraction columns then rna was eluted in v e 30 μ l final volume sars cov 2 genome copies were quantified by qpcr using n1 as a target gene finally the value of the measurement is computed as follows 1 c raw v e v s v c v 0 qpcr result gc l we note that the raw samples were normalized using measured daily flow volumes and enterococcus counts as described in róka et al 2021 in eight wwtps two samples were processed a week finally resulting in 30 samples a week which were collected between monday and thursday 10 4 12 and 4 samples respectively the measurements were filtered as proposed by fernandez cassi et al 2021 namely we computed the moving median of the pcr cycles c q separately for all wwtps using a centered 31 days long window then we considered a pcr result inhibited if c q was more than three cycles beyond the median the raw pcr results i e the genome copy concentrations and the numbers of cycles obtained in szeged city are visualized in fig 1 where the inhibited measurements so called outliers are shaded whereas the red curve highlights the moving median of c q for each day the weighted average of the measurements taken on that day was calculated such that the weights are the population size at the wwtps the missing values at the weekends were computed by linear interpolation to smooth the obtained daily time series we used a 4th order low pass butterworth filter with f co 1 14 1 days cut off frequency we performed a zero phase filtering in the sense that the raw time series were filtered twice in both the forward and reverse directions this type of filter is not causal namely the value at a given time point depends on the future values too therefore the averaged and interpolated values of the last 7 days are repeated once at the end of the time series the filtered time series is denoted by c k off where k is the time label in days in fig 2 we illustrate c k off in comparison with the raw measurements in the same figure we present the data processed as proposed by róka et al 2021 remark 1 the applied filter removes the high range frequency components with periods less than 2 weeks which may result from an uneven sampling of the effluent over a week measurement errors may also contribute to high frequency components 2 2 dynamical epidemic model long term multi year epidemic reconstruction is a particularly challenging task as the pathogen has undergone significant mutations over the years social distancing rules vaccination the emergence of new immune evasive variants of concern voc and the continuously waning immunity further add to the difficulty of epidemic modeling 2 2 1 modeling goals in this section we develop a compartmental ordinary difference equation ode model where both the immunity loss and the clinical immunization are included and the major model parameters are allowed to vary in time inspired by péni et al 2020 we considered intermediate states of the illness including the hospital treatment the amount of detail in the model used was determined on the basis that the number of parameters is still computationally tractable based on past experience intermediate states are expected to be well observable from measurements 2 2 2 compartments we consider an improved compartmental model where the population of n individuals is divided into the following groups the group of susceptible people s comprises those who have never been infected or vaccinated but also any individual who are susceptible again by the waning immunity or the immune evasion of a new voc the group of immune or so called protected individuals r includes those who gained immunity either by recovery or vaccination the group of infected people is categorized according to the different phases and possible outcomes of the disease in this way we distinguish people in the latent l presymptomatic p and the main sequence phase of the disease note that the incubation period corresponds to the sum of the length of the latent and presymptomatic phases the reason we make a difference between l and p is that people in the latent phase are not yet infectious but they are in the presymptomatic phase to model the possible outcomes of the disease in the main sequence we consider four severity scenarios which are parameterized with three probability coefficients first a group of people remains asymptomatic a while others produce symptoms i with probability p i a person who have symptoms is hospitalized h with probability p h whereas a hospitalized patient may decease d with probability p d the average residence time in compartments l p i a h are denoted by the inverses of time coefficients τ l τ p τ i τ a τ h respectively 2 2 3 time range of epidemic reconstruction we consider a two and a half years long range of time for the reconstruction which has the following important phases in hungary 1 wild the first case in hungary was detected in march 2020 due to the strict official restrictions in spring 2020 the first wave was drastically suppressed but the wild sars cov 2 virus strain emerged again in autumn 2020 2 alpha in february 2021 alpha variant emerged 3 delta delta variant appeared in july 2021 4 ba 1 omicron appeared around the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 5 ba 2 subvariant ba 2 started to spread in march 2022 6 ba 5 in june 2022 subvariant ba 5 appeared 7 ba 5 tp1 as a turning point in the spread of ba 5 in september 2022 multiple mutants of subvariant ba 5 have appeared 8 bq 1 a rebound was observed in november 2022 caused by the emergence of a new omicron subvariant the bq 1 the milestone dates were approximated from the data of the national public health centre but are also published online by hodcroft 2023 2 2 4 available data our computations rely on the measured average genome copy concentration in wastewater the number of hospitalized and deceased patients with covid and the number of registered vaccinations i e the number of received first second and booster doses the types of vaccine doses are not available in this data set but the types of vaccines that require a single dose to obtain the full vaccination are negligible in hungary atlo team 2021b the reconstruction is regularized using the registered oxford stringency index i s k mathieu et al 2020 according to hale et al 2021 i s k 0 1 quantifies the strictness of the official restrictions on the social distancing e g mask wearing rules curfew postponed social events etc during the reconstruction we also make use of the estimated relative infectiousness of each voc compared to the wild type sars cov 2 strain during the evaluation of the obtained results we consider the estimated reproduction rate made by the group of our world in data owid mathieu et al 2020 moreover the estimated number of new cases is compared with the scaled number of the officially detected cases from the authors experience the hospital load as a major indicator has not been reliable since the emergence of ba 2 variant moreover the official detected cases are not representative as a potential validation data since the last quarter of 2022 due to the continuously decreasing testing intensity in this case study the test positivity rate is not considered because fluctuation of testing strategies in hungary highly influences the data moreover test positivity rate is not representative since the first quarter of 2022 2 2 5 assumptions according to mcevoy et al 2021 and nakajo and nishiura 2021 an asymptomatic person in the main sequence is less infectious compared to those in the presymptomatic phase or others in the main sequence having symptoms therefore we make the following assumptions assumption 1 infectious population we consider only q a portion of asymptomatic people being infectious but in the same rate as another symptomatic individual in the main phase of the disease we neglect the possible infections originating from hospitalized or deceased patients nourbakhsh et al 2022 considered a detailed epidemic model in which the infectious people are the major contributors to the viral load entering the sewer system they quantified the viral load as a linear function of the infectious population and those in the post infection period who have just recovered but the hospitalized patients and the infected people in the latent phase are excluded from the shedding population we also note that the estimates of hewitt et al 2022 nourbakhsh et al 2022 and phan et al 2023 made for the shedding characteristics show orders of magnitude lower shedding rates for individuals in the latent phase of the disease and about 10 days after symptoms onset motivated by these observations phan et al 2023 did not consider recovered people as relevant contributors to the viral load on the other hand nourbakhsh et al 2022 highlights that the viral load entering the sewer system is exposed to an exponential viral decay and is affected by the possible hydrodynamic processes e g dilution sedimentation and resuspension that leads to rna degradation but also delays in this study we neglect the in sewer degradation for simplicity and assume that the actual viral load entering the sewer system is proportional to the national average genome copy concentration without delays considering that the measurements arrive from 22 different wwtps that cover about 4 million people it is reasonable to assume that in sewer anomalies are compensated after the averaging filtering and smoothing steps described in section 2 1 finally to relate the shedding population with the actual measurements we consider a ratio denoted by q c between the number of infectious people and the national average genome copy concentration as it is formulated in the following assumption assumption 2 virus secretion the national average genome copy concentration measured in wastewater is assumed to be proportional to the number of infectious people at that day without delay the coefficient q c which relates the measured concentration and the infectious population is called the virus secretion coefficient the secretion coefficient q c is later calibrated using optimization for each variant although q c has no underlying physiological content the comparison of the obtained values for q c can estimate the relative rate of secretion during the whole course of the disease caused by two different variants averaged for the entire population the measurements of kang et al 2022 see e g panel b in fig 2 suggest that roughly 3 times more genome copies are shed during the delta infection than during the omicron wave therefore we expect q c delta estimated for the delta variant to be about 3 times higher compared to q c omicron obtained for omicron variants for the model parameters we make the following assumptions assumption 3 model coefficients we assume that the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic people q a is known and constant moreover the time coefficients τ and the probability of symptomatic infection p i are considered known for all voc emerged in hungary finally when a new voc becomes dominant the variant dependent coefficients τ p i are changing smoothly the presumed model coefficients are presented in table 1 the probability of hospitalization p h and of fatal outcome p d or the average hospitalization period 1 τ h depend not only on the properties of the dominant voc but also on the hospitalization strategies kemp et al 2021 kozyreff 2021 therefore these parameters may vary for the different countries in this study we focus on the epidemic waves in hungary the average hospitalization length in 2021 row 5 in table 1 were estimated from the hospital admission numbers recorded by the national public health centre other constants are applied from csutak et al 2022 assumption 4 unknown parameters the probability coefficients p h p d of the disease course model and the secretion coefficient q c of the pathogen are unknown parameters but constant during the dominance of a given voc for ba 1 and ba 2 subvariants of the omicron variant the virus secretion coefficient is presumed identical assumption 5 the transmission rate of the pathogen is considered smoothly time varying in this work we consider a model with vaccination where three vaccination statuses are distinguished not fully vaccinated fully vaccinated and boosted we make the following simplifying assumptions assumption 6 vaccination our model uses the following vaccination rules 1 full vaccination is ensured with two vaccine doses single dose full vaccination is negligible in hungary 2 the probability that a partially vaccinated individual will receive a second dose is p v 2 v 1 3 the time elapsed between the first two doses is normally distributed 4 a person who receives the full vaccine or a booster dose becomes temporarily immune with probability 1 but only after a certain period of time which is normally distributed 5 infected people are not vaccinated including those in the latent or the presymptomatic period 6 a susceptible and a recovered individual receives the second immunizing vaccine dose with the same probability 7 a fully vaccinated individual and a boosted susceptible receives a booster dose with the same probability 8 boosted individuals who are still protected do not receive further booster doses but only after losing their immunity we note that the estimated under detection rates discussed later suggest that the number of individuals who are aware of being infected by covid is much less compared to those who are undetected infected asymptomatic or infected with mild symptoms not attributed to covid this phenomenon is even more prevalent in the more advanced stages of the epidemic e g during the emergence of subvariant ba 1 considering this points 6 and 7 of assumption 6 are sufficiently realistic moreover repeated booster doses are not excluded in point 8 assumption 6 but a rational administration of vaccine doses is presumed namely a sufficiently long time should elapse between two booster doses a preliminary version of our vaccination model was presented in csutak et al 2022 in this study we make the following simplifying assumption on the relative risk of infection assumption 7 uniform infection the risk of a susceptible person becoming infected is independent of their vaccination status or previous history of infection our model considers only one single immune state a person can be susceptible to the virus s or protected r but we neglect further intermediate immune states however a protected individual may lose its immunity completely with a given rate due to a natural immune waning or due to the immune evasion capability of a new emerging virus strain we consider the following assumption for immunity loss assumption 8 uniform immunity waning on a given day a protected individual has the same probability of losing their immunity regardless of its vaccination status or previous history of infection note that assumptions 7 and 8 do not undermine the generality of the method as it can be parameterized otherwise with pre estimated relative risk coefficients which were measured in certain states e g king county 2022 finally we assume that the natural deaths and births are negligible compared to the deaths caused by the covid 2 2 6 dynamic equations finally we divide individuals into eight disjoint groups called the compartments which describe the epidemic state of the population on a given day k the transitions between the compartments are illustrated in fig 3 whereas the transition dynamics are characterized by the discrete time dynamical model present in the floating eq 2 the model parameters are explained in table 1 where the italic letter k in the subscripts denotes the time label of the respective quantities 2 2 7 infection mechanism the nonlinear infection process illustrated by the red curly arrow in fig 3 is encoded in the first two eqs 2a and 2b see the equation in box i where the transmission rate of the disease is characterized by the time varying coefficient β k with reference to assumption 1 the total number of infectious people who are able to transmit the pathogen is 3 y k p k i k q a a k according to the simplified vaccination rules assumption 6 the numbers of people in the different phases of the disease depend only on the number of new infections within the unit time frame 24 h caused by the y k infectious people the number of newly infected individuals on day k is denoted by u k and it can be expressed as follows 4 u k β k y k s k n on the other hand the new recoveries in 2h are described by the following terms 5 z k 1 p h k τ i k i k τ a k a k 1 p d k τ h k h k 2 2 8 vaccination and waning immunity the transition between the groups of susceptible s and protected people r is affected indirectly through infection recovery but also by vaccination waning immunity or the immune evasion capability of a new voc the immunization effect of vaccination green arrow in fig 3 is expressed by a single time varying coefficient ν k which denotes the proportion of susceptible people within a unit time frame who become immune by vaccination the immunization rate ν k can be estimated from the available vaccination data the loss of immunity is captured by a direct transition from the group of protected individuals r to susceptibles s as illustrated by the orange arrow in fig 3 the model does not distinguish between repeated susceptibility caused by the waning immunity or by the immune escape of a new voc both cases are considered as an event when an individual becomes susceptible again i e immunity is lost completely the proportion of protected people who lose immunity within a unit time frame is encoded in the so called immunity loss rate ω k immunization depends on the vaccination strategies whereas a sudden massive loss of immunity may be due to the emergence of a new voc with a strong immune evasion capability both effects are typically time dependent which are encoded by linear transitions between s and r with two time dependent rate coefficients ν k and ω k respectively the outer loop of the transition diagram illustrates that the immunization and waning are different in nature than the indirect transition from s to r through infection recovery 2 2 9 epidemic process as an interconnected system the direct transitions between susceptible and protected population make the epidemic dynamics uncertain as the dynamic nature of waning immunity and hence the daily rate of immunity loss ω k are unknown moreover immune waning makes the estimates of vaccination efficiency more uncertain thus the number of registered vaccinations is useful but not sufficient data to compute the daily rate of immunization ν k fortunately the advantageous properties of the epidemic process model allow us to decouple a linear subsystem 2b 2f from the overall compartmental model highlighted in a blue box both in 2 and in fig 3 this subsystem describes the course of the disease in the infected population according to assumption 6 the disease course model is interconnected with the immunization waning dynamics only through the daily new infections u k 4 and recoveries z k 5 once the sequences u k and z k are known and fixed the immunization waning dynamics can be analyzed separately the technical details of dynamic model representation are described in appendix a 2 3 new cases infected population reproduction number in this section we use wastewater measurements and hospitalization data to solve the disease dynamics i e to compute all unknown data of the isolated subsystem of 2 2 3 1 problem and outline the advantageous linear model structure of the disease course model makes it possible to perform a partial epidemic reconstruction through a single optimization based dynamic data assimilation problem we compute c the following unmeasured quantities c1 the number of new cases u k c2 the population in the compartments l p i a c3 the number of new recoveries z k c4 the effective reproduction number r c k c5 the unknown variant dependent probabilities p h p d c6 and the secretion coefficient q c through the optimization we compute epidemic data above such that the reconstructed quantities fit to the following measurements m m1 the measured genome copy concentration in wastewater c k off i e y k q c k c k off m2 the registered number of hospitalized patients h k off m3 the registered number of deceased patients d k off as much as possible remark 2 the disease course dynamics have advantageous stability and observability properties csutak et al 2021 2022 proved that for fixed model coefficients the state variables l p i a d are observable using only hospitalization load h independently of the rates of immunity loss or medical immunization these results suggest that the epidemic state observation formulated as an optimization problem has a solution 2 3 2 dynamic inversion of disease course model the unknown quantities of the disease course model can be classified as follows the number of new cases u k 4 is considered as an unknown disturbance input of the disease course model moreover the number of infected individuals in the different phases of the disease are unknown states l p i a according to assumption 4 coefficients p h p d and q c are piecewise constant unknown parameters finally the sequence of new recoveries z k 5 is a computed variable using the available measurement we are able to reconstruct the unknown input u k the unmeasured state variables l p i a the unknown variant dependent model constants p h p d q c simultaneously alongside further dependent variables such as the reproduction rate or the new recoveries the technical details of the dynamic inversion approach are summarized in appendix b 2 4 susceptible population transmission rate waning in this section we solve the immunization waning loop using the computed number of new cases and recoveries the registered stringency index vaccination data and an enhanced vaccination model 2 4 1 problem and outline to make a reliable prediction for the future evolution of the pandemic it is essential to have appropriate estimates for the following unknown u rate coefficients u1 the current transmission rate of the virus β u2 the rate of immunization by vaccination ν u3 the current rate of immunity loss ω furthermore it is also necessary to estimate u4 the susceptible population s note that the estimated rate of immunization u2 can be used to quantify the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns moreover the registered stringency index i s determines a prior estimate on the transmission rate u1 however estimating u3 is particularly difficult as it captures two independent processes first the rate of immunity loss aims to model a continuous ambient immunity waning secondly the rate of immunity loss may have sudden peaks as an emerging immune evasive voc causes a massive loss of immunity in the protected population at the same time waning affects the whole process to a high degree as it transmits the protected individuals with an arbitrary vaccination status to the susceptibles in this way the loss of immunity will thoroughly disrupt the susceptible population which becomes a mixture of individuals with different vaccination status and any possible history of infection not to mention the fact that the mixture of susceptibles is affected by the nonlinear infection process where the average rate of transmission is again uncertain as the infectiousness may depend on the immunity status of the population to estimate the susceptible population and the rate coefficients we use the computed quantities c1 c3 and consider the following data d d1 the registered vaccination data d2 the estimated stringency index i s d3 the relative infectiousness of each voc unlike the linear disease course model the immunization waning dynamics lack the advantage of state observability however the d2 and d3 can regulate the estimated value of the transmission rate whereas d1 with an initial estimate of waning determine the rate of immunization the problem is still under determined as the number of unknowns outweighs the measurements therefore our strategy is to find a solution for which 6 the rate of immunity loss is minimal such that 1 the transmission rate is close to an initial estimate made on the bases of d2 and d3 2 both the transmission and the immunity loss rates are smoothly varying in time 3 the unknown coefficients move between reasonable bounds other estimates on the reproduction number mathieu et al 2020 atlo team 2021a and our previous results polcz et al 2022 csutak et al 2022 serve as good bases to further regularize the problem 2 4 2 detailed vaccination model in model 2 it is not straightforward how to relate the immunization rate ν k to the registered first second and booster vaccine doses d1 therefore we consider an enhanced vaccination model with three vaccination statuses first we consider a group of individuals who are fully vaccinated and immunity has already been established after the full vaccination secondly a group of people are said to be boosted if immunity has already been developed after receiving a booster dose finally the remaining population is said to be not fully vaccinated the number of fully vaccinated and boosted individuals on day k are denoted by v f k and v b k respectively from a computational point of view dividing all compartments according to the vaccination status is not fortunate but observe that s and r are manipulated by the infected compartments through the number of new cases u k and new recoveries z k only which are already computed therefore we remove the disease course dynamics from the initial model as illustrated in panel a of fig 4 then we distinguish three subgroups of both the susceptible s s u s f s b and the protected population r r u r f r b as follows s u susceptible individuals who have not yet acquired immunity through vaccination r u individuals who are not fully vaccinated but who have acquired immunity through recovery s f individuals who have been fully vaccinated but have lost their immunity due to the waning immunity or the immune evasion capability of a new voc r f fully vaccinated individuals who are still protected possibly both by recovery or vaccination s b boosted individuals who lost their immunity r b boosted individuals who are still protected possibly both by recovery or a booster dose the transitions between the sub compartments are illustrated in panel b of fig 4 the enhanced vaccination model uses two rate coefficients for immunization on day k ν f k proportion of the not fully vaccinated population n v f acquires immunity by full vaccination and moves to compartment r f moreover ν b k proportion of fully vaccinated individuals v f regain or retain immunity by receiving a booster dose finally ν b k proportion of boosted susceptibles regain immunity by receiving an additional booster dose to represent the indirect infection recovery transition between each pair of sub compartments s r the number of new cases and recoveries are distributed appropriately according to the vaccination status of susceptible people a detailed description of the enhanced immunization model is available in appendix c remark 3 until the middle of 2022 data provided by official bodies suggested that it was reasonable to separate the fully vaccinated and the boosted population our choices and points 1 and 4 in assumption 6 were also confirmed by the definitions used in king county 2022 however separating the two states does not seem to be important today therefore the vaccination model is planned to be reformulated in the future 2 4 3 heuristics to estimate the rate coefficients the simultaneous reconstruction of the three smoothly time varying rate coefficients β k ν k ω k is not straightforward therefore as the initial step we give a preliminary estimate for the immunization rate ν k using the registered vaccination data with the assumption that ω 0 then the priori estimate on ν k allows us to formulate a simple dynamic data assimilation problem to compute the transmission rate β k and the immunity loss rate ω k of the epidemic process using the estimated rate ω k we can update the immunization rate ν k which makes possible to improve the estimates for ω k and β k etc namely the rate coefficients and the number of susceptibles and protected people in the three different vaccination statuses can be estimated iteratively using simple computational steps the iterations converge and give an approximated solution to a more complex data assimilation problem the technical details of the optimization based iterative approach are summarized in appendix d 3 results and discussion in this section we evaluate and discuss the potential of the proposed approach for reconstruction and prediction 3 1 retrospective epidemic data reconstruction first we present and discuss a retrospective reconstruction for the entire time span of the pandemic in hungary using wastewater data until 1 february 2023 3 1 1 estimated parameters and under detection rate the viral load in wastewater gives us information about the current epidemic state whereas the hospitalization data gives delayed information about severe infections these two data sets allow us to fit model parameters which affect the course of the disease as the incubation period and serological analyses can well approximate the average length of the illness we had the possibility to estimate the hospitalization probability p h the registered hospital load and the cumulative number of deaths gives the possibility to estimate the probability of a fatal outcome p d if a person is hospitalized the estimated probability coefficients for the different voc are presented in rows 1 2 of table 2 due to the linear structure of the disease course model the number of new cases and the number of infected people in the different phases of the disease can be reconstructed simply using dynamic inversion section 2 3 the computed number of new infections is illustrated in fig 5 compared with the official detected cases the under detection rate denote by q u and then the scaled series of detected cases are computed separately for each epidemic wave as described in remark 7 the scaled and smoothly concatenated curves of the consecutive outbreaks are also illustrated by the stacked area plot in fig 5 the estimated under detection rates for the different waves are given in the legend of fig 5 and in row 3 of table 2 we can make the following observations the probability of developing symptoms and being hospitalized gradually decreases with the newer virus variants the hospitalization probability peaks at the alpha variant and then decreases gradually this estimate corresponds to the fact that the highest peak of hospital load is attained in march 2021 during the third epidemic outbreak caused by the alpha variant in that case the hospital load at the peak of the third wave exceeded the hospital capacity in hungary 10000 patients the estimated values of the secretion coefficient for the major variants are presented in row 4 of table 2 it is worth remarking that the virus secretion coefficient estimated for the omicron variants reduced for a third compared to that obtained for delta row 4 in table 2 these estimates correspond to the results of kang et al 2022 examining the resulting values for the secretion coefficients row 4 of table 2 we found that shedding is roughly 3 5 times more intensive during the delta infection than the omicron infection the computed ratio is confirmed by the measurements of kang et al 2022 the secretion of the ancestor variant in comparison with the delta variant seems reasonable although we haven t found a comparative study to confirm this result nevertheless we should discuss the secretion coefficient computed for alpha variant as it is only one 3rd of the value obtained for delta and fairly close to the value obtained for omicron the obtained secretion coefficient for the alpha variant can be attributed to the higher hospitalization probability computed for the wave caused by the alpha variant note that q c and p h are estimated simultaneously the infectious shedding population in comparison with the scaled genome copy concentration is presented in fig 6 the reconstructed curve of hospitalization along with the official data is presented in fig 7 the computed reproduction number is illustrated in fig 8 in alongside by the bayesian estimate made by the group of owid mathieu et al 2020 finally the heuristic approach in section 2 4 is also able to estimate the transmission rate of the virus fig 9 illustrates its evolution during the epidemic waves section s1 of the supplementary document presents a brief parameter sensitivity analysis of our approach with respect to the fixed model constants in table 1 moreover in section s2 of the supplementary document we analyze the uncertainty of the estimated parameters in table 2 in the terms of the wastewater measurement noise 3 1 2 immunization and waning the estimated immunization rate and the best case rate of immunity loss are illustrated in fig 10 knowing these two rate coefficients we are able to compute the number of daily new immunizations and immunity loss events fig 11 but also their cumulative curves fig 12 when an individual loses immunity twice e g first after recovery and second after vaccination they are counted as two distinct events in fig 12 we also present the estimated number of susceptible and protected people alongside the cumulative cases immunizations and immunity loss the reconstructed curves suggest that by the third quarter of 2022 the epidemic wave triggered by the emergence of variant ba 5 was rebounded multiple times first in september 2022 possibly due to the star of school year secondly in november 2022 possible due to the appearance of the variant bq 1 hodcroft 2023 in table 3 we made estimates on the number of infections immunity loss and clinical immunizations these estimates are computed separately for each epidemic outbreak in row 1 the estimated sum of all infections predicts that 155 of the population have been infected in 2022 and about 204 of the population have been infected during the whole time span of the covid 19 pandemic these estimates should be interpreted such that in average the whole population became infected which is not impossible considering the high immune evasive properties of the different subvariants of omicron variant lyngse et al 2022 however as reported by iwasaki 2021 or sheehan et al 2021 short term reinfections and hence quick immunity loss are possible even for the wild type or alpha variants for individuals without any known immune disorder in row 2 we estimated the number of people who have lost immunity during and before the outbreaks these estimates suggest a massive 131 loss of immunity and or a strong immune evasive capability of the emerging subvariants of omicron during 2022 we highlight that these numbers are rough estimates and are not appropriate for assessing the relative immune evasive capability of two virus variants at the same time the computed rate of immunity loss fig 10 confirms the estimates of lyngse et al 2021 and cocchio et al 2022 that the omicron ba 1 and ba 2 variants are at least four times immune evasive compared to the delta variant we remark that the immunity loss rate is a time varying coefficient therefore its inverse gives the expected time of being susceptible again the computed expected time for losing immunity in specific periods of the epidemic was 2021 fall semester 1 0 0027 days 1 year 2022 first quarter 1 0 008 days 4 months 2022 aug oct 1 0 0085 days 4 months 2022 dec 1 0 017 days 2 months considering that these parameters are national estimates we found that they show good correlation with the findings of stein et al 2023 but also not too far from the more optimistic estimates of willyard 2023 in row 5 the decreasing effectiveness of vaccinations is due to the fact that the majority of the vaccinated population was presumably immunized through recovery we note that our model does not consider hybrid immunity so a vaccine given to an immune person does not count as extra immunization according to this interpretation the first vaccination campaign in the 2021 wave was the most successful during and after the outbreak caused by the alpha variant as about 78 of the vaccinated population was not infected or had already lost immunity 3 2 prediction here we illustrate the prediction potential of the proposed approach first we simulate short term predictions at every day in two cases 1 using both medical and wastewater data 2 using only medical data secondly we simulate multiple long term 6 months long predictions at a fixed date considering different scenarios parameter values but using both medical and wastewater data 3 2 1 short term predictions and comparison the estimated current status of the epidemic spread allows us to simulate its future evolution the current state and hence the future evolution of the epidemic can be estimated more accurately if the measured viral load in wastewater is used in the calculations to illustrate the contribution of the water measurements we performed 30 day long predictions every day starting 20 august 2020 with and without wastewater data the prediction at a given starting day let us denote it by k 0 is simulated in three steps first the raw data are clipped to k k 0 namely the computations are performed without any measurements obtained for the future secondly we perform a reconstruction to estimate the pandemic state on day k 0 finally a prediction is obtained by evaluating the dynamic recursion of the epidemic model 2 to evaluate the quality of the predictions the results of the reconstruction and prediction are compared with a retrospective reconstruction in both two cases with and without wastewater data note that the reconstructions were performed using the same methodology as the retrospective reconstructions but with a smaller data set and with fixed coefficients p h and q c remark 4 the predictions both using and neglecting wastewater measurements assume that the hospitalization probability p h and the secretion coefficient q c are given and fixed a priori however the actual values of p h and q c considered during the current reconstructions were obtained through a retrospective reconstruction using wastewater data although we use the same model constants in both cases with and without wastewater the results suggest that wastewater measurements have the advantage to show the trends of an outbreak earlier this observation is even more striking since the appearance of variant ba 2 where the hospitalization curve does not show the typical trends as before cf figs 6 and 7 in fig 13 we illustrate two possible predictions on 20 distinct days simulated with red and without wastewater blue in each subplot of fig 13 the solid vertical red line denotes k 0 the actual starting day which is also given in the title of the subplot each dashed line represents a reconstruction up to k 0 followed by a simulated prediction from k 0 in each subplot the results of a retrospective reconstruction are also illustrated by solid lines in both cases using both medical and wastewater data red and using only medical data blue the colored areas in fig 13 illustrate the detected cases scaled to fit the new cases computed retrospectively practically the colored areas in each subplot illustrating the scaled detected cases resemble the corresponding segments of the scaled detected cases in fig 5 finally in fig 13 the obtained quantities were later normalized to a population of 1000 to facilitate convenient visualization of the y axes in general we observed that the characteristic phases of an outbreak appear earlier in the wastewater data than in hospitalization load in fig 13 we illustrated a few predictions in different phases of the outbreaks namely first signs of an outbreak p1 p7 emergence p2 p4 p8 p11 p16 peaks p9 p12 p17 decline p3 p5 p14 end of an outbreak p6 p10 p15 rebounds p13 and plateaus p18 p19 p20 on 26 august 2020 wastewater measurements resulted in a prediction p1 which could be obtained only 13 days later p2 using solely hospitalization data then on 16 december 2020 wastewater measurements already forecast the near end of the 1st wave p3 from measurements the emergence of alpha variant was predicted on 11 february 2021 p4 whereas the increasing hospitalization data warned us only by the end of february then we predicted the end of the outbreak on 28 march 2021 p5 whereas the peak of the hospital occupancy was detected only 8 days later the first sign of the third wave caused by delta variant was detected on 24 august 2021 p7 using measurements and 2 days later using only hospitalization data however the first accurate prediction for the exponential emergence detected on 6 september 2021 p8 was obtained only 10 days later using only hospitalization curves without wastewater measurements outbreak peaks could only be detected retrospectively in this case study as hospital treatment data are delayed by τ l 1 τ p 1 τ i 1 τ a 1 8 14 days compared to the number of new cases from wastewater we detected peaks for about 10 days earlier for waves caused by variants delta p9 omicron ba 1 p12 ba 2 p13 and ba 5 p17 to measure the quality of a prediction we considered the euclidean distance between the sequences obtained for the new cases through the current prediction and the retrospective reconstruction within the prediction horizon n 30 days in this case study underestimating forecasts are penalized against those that overestimated the severity of the outbreak correspondingly we consider the distances in the logarithmic scale log 10 formally a prediction made on day k is qualified by the square root of the following measure 7 i 1 n log 10 y k i predicted log 10 y k i reconstructed 2 additionally a prediction made without wastewater data is compared to the reconstruction made without the knowledge of wastewater data in terms of 7 the maximum prediction error obtained without wastewater is 25 higher compared to that obtained using wastewater data the two worst predictions are illustrated in p6 and p10 of fig 13 on 30 may 2021 the medical data suggested a rebound of the past wave caused by the alpha variant p6 however a new wave emerged only three months later by early september 2021 p7 on the other hand the virus secretion coefficient estimated for the omicron variants reduced to a third compared to that of delta row 4 in table 2 therefore the emergence of the omicron variant could not be detected yet on 3 january 2022 p10 but only 8 days later p11 remark 5 we note that in 53 of days wastewater based predictions resulted in a higher prediction error in the terms of 7 it is also worth mentioning that the euclidean distance of the logarithm is not the best quality measure as it does not qualify the difference between the shapes of two curves 3 2 2 long term prediction considering a starting time 1 may 2022 as the time label of the last available data we simulate the epidemic process model 2 to estimate the future evolution of the pandemic by that time the fourth wave caused by the omicron ba 1 and ba 2 variants ended but a new immune evasive variant ba 5 was expected to emerge in that situation we made the following assumptions 1 the immune evasive capability of ba 5 is similar to that estimated for ba 1 ba 2 i e ω 0 0062 in average between 1 january and 15 april 2022 therefore the future immunity loss rate is estimated to be ω 0 0062 25 p1 in fig 14 2 the estimated transmission rate is extrapolated with a possible 30 deviation from its last computed value p2 in fig 14 3 as for the fixed table 1 and computed model constants table 2 we used the available values namely those available or estimated for variant ba 2 4 we assume no significant vaccination activity in the near future to make a statistical prediction we simulated 126 scenarios using different β and ω values plot p3 in fig 14 illustrates the average and the standard deviation of the predicted curves for the estimated new cases in all figures we illustrate the actual curves obtained later through a retrospective reconstruction 4 conclusions as the number and relevance of clinical tests for covid 19 are declining wbe is becoming the primary source of information on disease transmission in a community recognizing this both who and the european union considers wbe a promising public health tool even beyond the current pandemic motivated by these international trends we proposed a novel approach combining wastewater based epidemic surveillance with detailed dynamical modeling to improve epidemic monitoring and prediction we developed a novel compartmental epidemic model with a 2 phase vaccination dynamics and waning immunity immune evasion and waning are described by a single compartmental transition from the recovered people to the susceptibles but with a time dependent transition rate using time dependent model parameters relevant to the dominant virus variants the model allows for us to reconstruct the unknown epidemiological data during the whole time span of the pandemic using the registered number of hospitalized patients and the measured genome copy concentration in the wastewater alongside the popular epidemic indicators incidence prevalence reproduction number transmission rate a full epidemic state reconstruction is possible in each time instant including the susceptible and protected population in the different vaccination status and the infected population in the different phases of the disease it is shown that wastewater based viral information can be efficiently used to track the transmission rate of the virus the rate of immunization by vaccination and the rate of losing immunity within a time frame as time varying parameters in the computations we exploit the registered stringency index and the relative infectiousness of the dominant virus variant which provides a starting point in estimating the transmission rate the estimated immunization rate allows us to quantify the effectiveness of vaccination by comparing the estimated new immunizations with the received vaccine doses within a given time interval the detailed reconstruction provides a reliable estimate of the current epidemic situation which allows us to give a prediction with an extrapolated transmission rate and waning characteristics to promote computational tractability the long term epidemic surveillance framework reconstruction and prediction was implemented by multiple efficient optimization steps the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a case study of pandemic reconstruction and prediction in hungary the results suggest that wastewater measurements make predictions more reliable as the characteristic moments of an outbreak appear about a week earlier in wastewater data the computed model based predictions were shared with the hungarian national public health center to support decision making on public policies in hungary in this work we successfully demonstrated that wastewater based epidemic modeling substantially contributes to the translation of environmental surveillance data to outbreak management

through the grant post covid2021 64 appendix a dynamical model representation in this section we provide a few technical details and further remarks on the epidemic process model introduced in section 2 2 a 1 model decomposition the special model structure of the epidemic process model allows to reformulate it as an interconnection of a linear parameter varying model and a scalar nonlinear model first we consider a dynamical model for the course of the disease of the infected population as a subsystem of 2 as follows a 1 x k 1 f θ k x k b u k y k c x k where x vec l p i a h d r n x is the state θ vec τ l τ p τ i τ a τ h p i p h p d r n p is the parameter the daily new cases u appears as an input the hospitalized h and deceased d patients are measured states the number of infectious people y is an indirectly measured output of the system furthermore the coefficient matrices are given below f θ τ l 0 0 0 0 0 τ l τ p 0 0 0 0 0 p i τ p τ i 0 0 0 0 1 p i τ p 0 τ a 0 0 0 0 p h τ i 0 τ h 0 0 0 0 0 p d τ h 0 a 2 b vec 1 0 0 0 0 0 c row 0 1 1 q a 0 0 system a 1 with matrices a 2 constitutes the disease course model or simply the disease model which is highlighted in the compartmental model 2 as the overall population n was assumed invariant the number of immune people can be expressed as r n k s where k l p i a h d denotes the sum of infected and deceased people accordingly the time evolution of the susceptible individuals can be described by a single recursion as follows a 3 s k 1 1 ν k ω k s k ω k n k k u k system a 1 and a 3 are interconnected through the feedback u k β k y k s k n 4 where β is unknown remark 6 system a 3 is manipulated indirectly by β and directly both by the rate of immunity loss ω and the immunization rate ν the two rate coefficients ω and ν can be considered as a dual pair of each other however their roles and nature are different unlike ν which is well defined and can be manipulated by vaccination strategies the rate of immunity loss ω is unknown and in an ideal world cannot be manipulated by humans but is primarily due to mutation of the virus in this way the transition dynamics between s and r can also be considered as a differential game fisac et al 2019 in which the two opponents humans and virus are struggling to win over as many people as possible in compartments r and s respectively coefficients ν and ω are manipulated exclusively by both humans and virus respectively whereas the transmission rate β of the pathogen can be manipulated both by social distancing strategies and the increasing infectiousness of the virus a 2 variant dependent model constants and their smooth transitions the model coefficients τ p and q c are variant dependent such that their values are smoothly changing as a new voc gains dominance to characterize the piece wise constant parameter functions which vary smoothly between two constant levels we introduce specific characteristic functions that highlights the dominance period of a given voc when a new voc emerges and overcomes another variant the proportion of the new variant compared to the sum of both variants follows a sigmoid like curve radu et al 2022 when a model parameter θ changes from value θ 0 to θ 1 such that the new voc emerges at time k 1 k it takes dominance at time k 1 and the old variant vanishes at time k 1 k then we consider the following smooth transition between the two parameter values a 4 θ k θ 0 θ 1 θ 0 σ k k 1 k for all k k 1 k k 1 k 1 k where σ 1 1 0 1 constitutes the following normalized sigmoid type function a 5 σ t σ t σ 1 σ 1 σ 1 and σ t 1 e s 0 t 1 in a 5 we use a scaling factor s 0 5 which provides a sufficiently small slope at the two ends of the parameter transition assume that a given voc emerges and takes dominance at time k 1 in a duration of 2 k 1 1 days then another variant overcomes it in a duration of 2 k 2 1 around time k 2 then using function σ we introduce the characteristic function χ voc for that variant which highlights its dominance pattern as follows χ voc k 0 if k k 1 k 1 σ k k 1 k 1 if k 1 k 1 k k 1 k 1 1 if k 1 k 1 k k 2 k 2 1 σ k k 2 k 2 if k 2 k 2 k k 2 k 2 0 if k 2 k 2 k where as described in section 2 2 3 the variants of concern that emerged in hungary are as follows a 6 voc wild alpha delta ba 1 ba 2 ba 5 we note that the sum of the characteristic functions gives identically one namely voc χ voc 1 in fig a 15 we illustrate the characteristic functions correspondingly to the variant dominance observed in hungary if we fix the characteristic curves for all dominant variants in a 6 we are able to estimate all model coefficients by piece wise constant functions with smooth transitions as follows a 7 p k voc p voc χ voc k τ k voc τ voc χ voc k q c k voc q c voc χ voc k where according to assumption 3 the virus secretion coefficient corresponding to variants ba 1 and ba 2 are identical i e q c ba 1 q c ba 2 remark 7 under detection rate the characteristic curves allow the estimation of the number of all infections within an epidemic wave such that the series of new infections are multiplied by the characteristic curve of an epidemic wave and the resulting series are summarized over the time e g the new cases during the spread of delta variant can be computed as follows a 8 k 0 t 1 χ delta k c o m p u t e d new cases on day k u k the number of detected cases can be computed similarly a 9 k 0 t 1 χ delta k d e t e c t e d new cases on day k denoted by u k off therefore the under detection rate during the wave caused by delta can be computed as the proportion of the two quantities above namely a 10 q u delta k χ delta k u k k χ delta k u k off 4 9 finally the scaled series of the detected cases denoted by u k off are computed such that each segment of the series u off characterized by q u voc is scaled by the corresponding multiplier q u voc then the resulting series are accumulated for all outbreaks formally a 11 u k off voc q u voc χ voc k u k off sequence u k off is illustrated in fig 5 by the colored area appendix b dynamic inversion to compute infected people undetected cases and unknown model coefficients in this section we formalize the optimization based dynamic inversion approach introduced in section 2 3 the dynamic inversion of the linear disease course dynamics a 1 constitutes in the computation of the unknown input u k 4 using the measured output q c k c k off m1 and states h k off and d k off practically the dynamic inversion or the output tracking problem has three reference outputs m1 m2 m3 to track by manipulating one single variable c1 the number of new infections u k in this construction the problem is over determined therefore new degrees of freedom have to be introduced to the optimization task by relaxing a few model coefficients as follows 1 we consider q c voc as free variables c6 2 the probability levels of being hospitalized p h voc and of fatal outcome p d voc are searched as free variables within a given reasonable domain c5 the cost function of the multi objective optimization problem is constructed as follows b 1 j k 1 t w h ref h k h k off 2 tracking error h off k 1 t w d ref d k d k off 2 tracking error d off k 1 t w c ref y k q c k c k off 2 tracking error c off k 0 t 2 w u s u k 1 u k 2 smoothly varying new cases where y k is defined in the output eq 3 and w h ref w d ref w c ref w u s are weight constants which scale the different cost terms into a common order of magnitude the last term in b 1 promotes a smooth solution for u k which does not make abrupt changes in time differently from variables h k d k y k which are initialized in k 0 the input u k is unknown in k 0 and its value is irrelevant in k t this explains the range of indices in the last summation of b 1 finally the optimization problem can be formulated as follows problem 1 optimization based dynamic inversion given the dynamical disease course model a 1 with initial condition x 0 0 fixed model constants q a and τ voc corresponding to each dominant voc a 6 there are given m1 m2 m3 as references to track with k 1 t we are looking for 1 p h voc and p d voc 0 1 the unknown probability levels 2 q c voc the unknown secretion coefficients 3 u k 0 the daily new cases as a sequence of unknown inputs k 0 t 1 4 x k 0 the number of infected people in the 5 different states of the disease k 1 t which solve the state recursion a 1 and minimize the cost function b 1 remark 8 the number of infectious people y k can also be added as a free instrumental variable ruled by the output eq 3 in this way further degrees of freedom are introduced in problem 1 which promotes finding a feasible solution to the nonlinear gradient based optimization task after the optimization of problem 1 we are able to compute other important epidemiological quantities such as the number of infectious people 3 the new recoveries 5 as well as the reproduction number of the disease these quantities can be inferred without knowing the nature of waning immunity and the effects of vaccination the time dependent effective reproduction number of the disease can be given as follows b 2 r c k β k 1 τ p k p i k τ i k q a 1 p i k τ a k s k n in this formulation r c k requires the knowledge of s k and β k which are still unknown after the solution of problem 1 however the term β k s k can be expressed from u k β k y k s k n 4 then an alternative formula for r c can be given as follows b 3 r c k u k y k 1 τ p k p i k τ i k q a 1 p i k τ a k during the optimization we used the following weight constants in the cost function w h ref 1 w d ref w c ref 1 0 5 w u s 1 0 4 the values of the parameters are available in table 1 appendix c immunization model based on the descriptions of section 2 4 2 here we derive a dynamical model describing immunity waning infection and vaccination in three different vaccination statuses moreover we propose a simple model for the dynamic effects of the delayed immunization through vaccination in this section the cumulative number of first second and booster doses delivered are denoted by v first off v second off v boosted off respectively see the equation in box ii c 1 delayed effect of vaccination a susceptible individual does not acquire immunity immediately after vaccination but a certain amount of time is needed for the vaccine to take effect in this section we present the points 2 3 and 4 of assumption 6 in more detail assumption 9 the delayed immunization is modeled as follows 1 the probability that a partially vaccinated individual will be fully vaccinated can be well approximated as follows c 2 p v 2 v 1 v second off v first off 1 0 967 where v first off and v second off denote the last available vaccination data 2 the time elapsed between the first two doses is normally distributed with expected value t 12 21 days and standard deviation σ 12 7 days 3 after receiving a the full vaccine or a booster dose a person becomes temporarily immune after a certain period of time which is normally distributed with expected value t e 14 days and standard deviation σ e 4 days in accordance with assumption 9 an individual gains immunity after the first vaccine dose with probability p v 2 v 1 but only after a normally distributed delay with expected value t 12 e t 12 t e 51 days and standard deviation σ 12 e σ e 2 σ 12 2 8 days then the expected fully vaccinated population on day k can be approximated as follows c 3 v f k p v 2 v 1 i 2 σ 12 e 2 σ 12 e v first k t 12 e i off q i σ 12 e whereas the boosted population is c 4 v b k i 2 σ e 2 σ e v boost k t e i off q i σ e in c 3 and c 4 the weight coefficients q i are derived from the cumulative distribution function φ of the standard normal distribution c 5 q i σ φ 2 i 1 2 σ φ 2 i 1 2 σ 2 φ 4 σ 1 2 σ 1 1 remark 9 note that the number of vaccinated people in c 3 and c 4 are practically computed by a convolution of the official data with a gaussian window therefore the normally distributed delay of the effect of the first and booster doses has a beneficial smoothing effect on the official data c 2 distribution of new cases and recoveries in accordance with assumption 7 the distribution of new cases by vaccination status on day k is determined by the distribution s u k s f k s b k of the susceptible population at that time namely c 6 u k u u k u f k u b k such that u u k u f k u b k u k s u k s k u k s f k s k u k s b k s k moreover the distribution of new recoveries by vaccination status on day k is approximated by the distribution of the susceptible population on day k t 0 k namely c 7 z k z u k z f k z b k such that z u k z f k z b k z k s u k t 0 s k t 0 z k s f k t 0 s k t 0 u k s b k t 0 s k t 0 where t 0 k 1 τ l k 1 τ p k p i k τ i k 1 p i k τ a k p h k τ h k constitutes the expected duration of recovery c 3 state recursion with vaccination and waning model finally a state recursion for the dynamics of the susceptible and protected population is given in the floating eq c 1 where and denote the rates of immunization triggered by the full vaccinations and booster doses the immunization rates can be expressed as follows c 8 note that the two rates in c 8 corresponding to the received vaccine doses are a fine tuning of the single immunization rate ν k in the 8 compartmental model 2 to retain the overall rate of immunization of susceptibles through vaccination in general the value of ν k can be expressed as follows c 9 ν k ν f k s u k ν b k s f k s b k s k remark 10 assuming no waning immunity ω 0 s f 0 and s b 0 the overall rate of immunization is c 10 ν k ν f k v f k v f k 1 v f k k k the subgroups of the susceptible and protected people and the transitions between the subgroups are presented in fig 4 appendix d heuristics to estimate the rate of transmission of the pathogen and the waning immunity here we describe the iterative approach to estimate the three time varying rate coefficients of the epidemic process the basic idea of the heuristics was introduced briefly in section 2 4 3 namely the rates of immunization and immunity loss are computed step by step one after another by fixing one and computing the other and then vice versa d 1 fix ω compute ν the recursion model c 1 makes it possible to simulate the time evolution of susceptibles in the three different vaccination statuses for a given rate of immunity loss this algebraic problem can be formulated as follows problem 2 estimate the rate of immunization through vaccination consider the following pre computed quantities 1 u k the pre computed number of new cases 2 z k the pre computed number of new recoveries 3 ω k an estimated rate of immunity loss first initialized by ω 0 4 v f k and v b k pre processed official vaccination data where k 0 t we are looking for a solution to recursion c 1 with initial condition s u 0 n in problem 2 the new cases u k and new recoveries z k were pre computed through the dynamic inversion described in problem 1 whereas the rate of immunity loss ω k is first initialized by zero i e no waning immunity is assumed then a solution to the recursion c 1 allows computing the overall rate of immunization ν k as described in c 9 this value to ν k allows us to give an estimate for the rate of immunity loss ω k as described in the following subsection d 2 fix ν compute ω a pre computed immunization rate allows us to formulate a simple optimization problem to estimate both the immunity loss and the transmission rates the stringency index d2 and the approximated infectiousness β voc d3 of each voc allows us to determine a prior estimate for the actual transmission rate of the virus as follows d 1 β k ref voc χ voc k β voc i s k we presume that β k ref is a good estimate to use as a flexible reference for the optimized smooth transmission rate β k during the optimization the immunity loss rate ω k is searched as a smooth time varying sequence not producing abrupt changes such that its value is included into the objective function with a given weight in this way the unknown coefficients are kept between reasonable bounds and the transmission rate sequence is regularized by the measured stringency index and the relative infectiousness of the emerging variants with these considerations we finally define the following cost function to minimize j 2 k 0 t 1 w u ref u k u ˆ k 2 tracking error new cases k 0 t 1 w b ref β k ref β k 2 tracking error β k 0 t 2 w b sm β k 1 β k 2 smooth transmission rate k 0 t 2 w w sm ω k 1 ω k 2 smooth immunity loss rate d 2 k 0 t 1 w ω c ω k 2 immunity loss cost note that variables u ˆ k β k ω k are unknown in k 0 t however their values in k t are not needed as they are not required to compute the state in k t similarly the distance between β t and β t 1 or between ω t and ω t 1 are not relevant these considerations explain the ranges of summations in d 2 the optimization problem to find β k ω k and an updated number of susceptibles s k is formulated as follows problem 3 estimate the susceptible population and the rate of immunity loss consider the following pre computed quantities 1 u k the pre computed number of new cases within 24 h 2 y k the number of infectious people 3 k k the number of infected and deceased people 4 β k ref a reference transmission rate of the pathogen inferred from the stringency index 5 ν k an estimated rate of immunization triggered by vaccination where k 0 t we are looking for 1 s k 0 n the number of susceptible individuals 2 ω k 0 the rate of immunity loss 3 β k β β the actual rate of transmission of the pathogen 4 u ˆ k an instrumental variable reconstructing the number of new cases which solve s k 1 1 ν k ω k s k ω k n k k u ˆ k a 3 satisfy u ˆ k β k y k s k n 4 and minimize d 2 remark 11 the instrumental variable u ˆ k introduces a further degree of freedom in problem 3 which makes the nonlinear gradient based optimization task computationally more tractable namely it promotes finding an initial feasible solution d 3 alternating iterations observe that problem 3 makes use of the immunization rate ν k but provides an estimated immunity loss rate ω k whereas in problem 2 we solve the recursion c 1 to find the immunization rate for a given sequence of immunity loss rate therefore problems 2 and 3 can be solved multiple times one after another such that a problem 2 is solved first with no waning assumed ω 0 or b problem 3 is solved first with a simple vaccination model c 10 scenario a and b are equivalent as the solution of problem 2 with ω 0 generates ν as given in c 10 we note that the proposed iteration of the two problems in succession converged in all our experiments remark 12 the alternating iterations considered here were inspired by the iterative solution of cisneros and werner 2020 for nonlinear model predictive control problems the main similarity between the approaches is the existence of a precomputed parameter trajectory in our case the immunization rate ν which can be initialized e g by 0 and updated by a closed form recursion c 1 for any feasible values of the unknown variables the immunity loss rate ω moreover the unknown variables are computed by an optimization problem 3 which is parameterized by the parameter trajectory a significant difference is the type of the optimization problem cisneros and werner 2020 presumes a convex quadratic program whereas problem 3 is bilinear therefore the existing preliminary convergence results of cisneros and werner 2020 hespe and werner 2021 morato et al 2021 and cisneros 2021 are not applicable here and considering the difficulty of the problem it will be a target of future work to give a proof of convergence for this iteration appendix e supplementary data supplementary material related to this

14686,the widespread occurrence of p arsanilic acid p asa in natural environments poses big threats to the biosphere due to the generation of toxic inorganic arsenic i e as iii and as v especially as iii with higher toxicity and mobility oxidation of p asa or as iii to as v followed by precipitation of total arsenic using fe based advanced oxidation processes demonstrated to be a promising approach for the treatment of arsenic contamination this study for the first time investigated the efficiency and inherent mechanism of p asa and as iii oxidation by fe ii peracetic acid fe ii paa and paa processes p asa was rapidly degraded by the fe ii paa process within 20 s at neutral to acidic phs under different conditions while it was insignificantly degraded by paa oxidation alone lines of evidence suggested that hydroxyl radicals and organic radicals generated from the homolytic oo bond cleavage of paa contributed to the degradation of p asa in the fe ii paa process p asa was mainly oxidized to as v nh4 and p aminophenol by the fe ii paa process wherein the aniline group and its para position were the most vulnerable sites as iii of concern was likely generated as an intermediate during p asa oxidation and it could be readily oxidized to as v by the fe ii paa process as well as paa alone the in depth investigation demonstrated that paa alone was effective in the oxidation of as iii under varied conditions with a stoichiometric molar ratio of 1 1 efficient removal 80 of total arsenic during p asa oxidation by fe ii paa process or during as iii oxidation by paa process with additional fe iii in synthetic or real waters were observed mainly due to the adsorptive interactions of amorphous ferric oxy hydroxide precipitates this study systematically investigates the

aqueous environments due to natural processes and or anthropogenic activities poses serious threats to the ecosystem and human health sharma and sohn 2009 yang et al 2018a arsenic could exist in either inorganic e g arsenite as iii and arsenate as v or organic e g p arsanilic acid p asa form p asa is one of the phenylarsonic acid organics and it has been widely used as an animal feed additive to promote growth and prevent bacterial and parasitic diseases of livestock for several decades liu et al 2013 2015 jones 2007 pergantis et al 1997 it is reported that the feed dosage of p asa to pigs and chicken is around 25 100 mg kg wang and cheng 2015 p asa is hardly metabolized in animal bodies and is excreted intact into animal wastes chen and huang 2012 aschbacher and feil 1991 wherein it finally leaches out and affluxes into surface waters due to high water solubility han et al 2004 although with low toxicity p asa could be degraded to more toxic inorganic species e g as iii and as v especially as iii with higher toxicity and mobility via biotic and abiotic processes chabot et al 2009 jones 2007 hence different methods have been developed to remove p asa from the aqueous solution

2003 joshi et al 2017 mamindy pajany et al 2011 demonstrated good performance for adsorptive p asa removal while the adsorption was sometimes less efficient than those for inorganic arsenic yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 depalma et al 2008 wu et al 2022 additionally it often takes several hours to reach the adsorption equilibrium which is quite time consuming wang et al 2020a comparatively chemical oxidation stood out for the treatment of arsenic contamination in those processes arsenic in p asa was finally oxidized to less toxic as v by reactive species e g hydroxyl radical oh sulfate

2018b wang et al 2020a xie et al 2016 x 2019 xu et al 2007 among the diverse oxidation processes fe based oxidation processes e g ferrate oxidation fenton process and persulfate based fenton like advanced oxidation process aops were the most widely studied mainly due to the multiple roles of fe species as oxidant reductant and coagulant during the reactions zhou et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 p wang et al 2020 xie and cheng 2019 xie et al 2016 for instance wang et al 2020a reported that 98 5 of total arsenic was removed during p asa oxidation by fe ii activated peroxydisulfate fe ii pds process at neutral ph via the oxidative effect of generated reactive radicals and adsorptive effect of ferric oxyhydro oxides in situ formed from fe ii oxidation in addition to persulfate based fenton like aops the fe ii activated peracetic acid fe ii paa process has raised increasing scientific interests and emerged as a promising aop for water treatment carlos et al 2021 dai et al 2023 j kim et al 2019 paa has been widely used as an alternative disinfectant and bleaching agent to traditional chlorine in various industries luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 kitis 2004 paa has also been studied as an oxidant for the removal of micropollutants or as a disinfectant in wastewater treatment since the late 1970s mainly due to its strong oxidation ability especially after activation high disinfection efficiency and little formation of toxic byproducts zhang et al 2020 dunkin et al 2017 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 sun et al 2018a it is reported that multiple reactive species including oh organic radicals e g ch3c o o ch3c o oo and fe iv fe v were generated in the fe ii paa process and accounted for the efficient degradation of micropollutants therein carlos et al 2021 j kim et al 2019 considering the strong oxidation ability of reactive species generated in the fe ii paa process and the adsorption property of ferric hydroxide in situ generated from fe ii oxidation it is hypothesized that the fe ii paa process or even paa alone might be an efficient strategy for p asa as well as as iii as v removal however the information on the removal efficiency of both organic and inorganic arsenic by the fe ii paa process remains unclear so far therefore the objectives of this study were to i investigate the oxidation efficiency of p asa and as iii by paa or fe ii paa treatment ii identify the major contributors that accounted for arsenic degradation iii elucidate the impacts of common water background ions on the degradation of arsenic iv figure out the degradation products of p asa by the fe ii paa process and v explore the effectiveness of the fe ii paa process on the removal of arsenic in real waters the results from this study are expected to

reagent co ltd shanghai china all solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 2 mω cm the stock solution of paa was generated by acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by sulfuric acid and it was stored at 4 c before use the concentration of paa and or h2o2 in the paa stock solution was quantified following the procedures reported in the literature before each experiment wang et al 2020a the stock solution of fe ii was freshly prepared before experiments by dissolving iron ii sulfate feso4 7h2o in deionized di water with continuously bubbling by nitrogen and standardized spectrophotometrically by the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method tamura et al 1974 2 2 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 50 ml glass flasks under constant magnetic stirring at 500 r min at 25 c controlled with a water bath a specific amount of paa was firstly added to the glass beaker in the absence or presence of one of the water constituents hco3 cl so4 2 sio3 2 ca2 mg2 po4 3 and ha specific radical scavengers tba or probes terephthalic acid tpa and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo in di water then the solution ph was adjusted to specific values determined by preliminary tests to ensure the final ph reaching to the desired ph after introducing p asa as iii and or fe ii the change of solution ph during the whole reaction period was within 0 5 ph unit at predetermined time intervals a 0 5 ml sample was collected and quenched with 0 5 ml w t 1 hydroxylamine hydrochloride for subsequent kinetics and product analysis to evaluate the p asa and as iii degradation efficiency in real waters three types of water including groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent were collected and filtered through nylon membranes 0 22 μm pore size oumuni tianjin and stored at 4 c before use the experiments in real waters followed the same procedures as those conducted in di waters to track the total arsenic removal efficiency the ph of the working solution was adjusted to 3 0 following those in batch experiments and oxidized by the fe ii paa process for 5 min or by paa for 15 min then the ph was adjusted to 6 0 for coagulation and precipitation in the case of paa oxidation alone fe2 so4 3 100 μm was additionally added after oxidation as a representative coagulant the supernatant was collected at fixed time intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the precipitates retained by the membrane were also collected for characterization with scanning electron microscopy sem all experiments were performed in triplicate and the average data with standard deviations were presented 2 3 analytical methods p asa and its organic degradation

samples were separated by an xbridge beh c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm waters co in an isocratic mode of elution at 35 1 c the flow rate and injection volumes are 1 0 ml min and 20 μl respectively the

chromatograph ic dionex sunnyvale usa was used for the determination of nh4 released during fe ii paa oxidation of p asa using an ionpac cs 12a cation exchange column 4 250 mm dionex sunnyvale usa

composition of the precipitates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7800f equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of p asa by paa and fe ii paa processes the degradation efficiency of p asa 5 μm by paa 400 μm alone or in the presence of 200 μm fe ii at ph 3 0 was comparatively studied as shown in figure s1 p asa was degraded by 15 within 45 min by paa suggesting that paa alone was ineffective to remove p asa comparatively p asa was rapidly degraded by the fe ii paa process with a removal efficiency of 98 in the first 20 s figure s1 demonstrating the effectiveness of the fe ii paa process for the removal of p asa hence the degradation efficiency of p asa by the fe ii paa process under different operating conditions was further studied the impact of fe ii concentrations on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process was studied fe ii concentrations ranging from 100 to 600 μm were investigated and it fell within the dosage range of coagulants used in traditional 5 15 mg l around 89 270 μm as fe3 jarvis et al 2012 and enhanced coagulation processes 20 150 mg l around 120 900 μm as fe3 gerrity et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 a p asa was rapidly degraded within the first 20 s and then its concentration kept relatively stable as the reaction proceeded in all the cases the removal efficiency of p asa increased from 30 to 98 as fe ii concentration increased from 100 to 400 μm with fe ii paa 0 5 2 while it remained unchanged as fe ii concentration further increased to 600 μm fe ii paa 3 therefore an optimum fe ii dosage of 400 was obtained under investigated conditions considering both the efficiency and cost effectiveness increasing fe ii concentration might produce higher concentrations of reactive species thus leading to the higher degradation efficiency of p asa however a large excess of fe ii e g fe ii paa 10 would be detrimental to the process due to the sufficiently strong competitive consumption of reactive species by fe ii as has been reported previously j kim et al 2019 for instance it is reported that the second order rate constant of fe ii with oh was around 3 2 108 m 1s 1 neyens and baeyens 2003 the impact of paa concentrations 50 500 μm on the degradation of p asa 5 μm at a constant fe ii concentration of 400 μm was shown in fig 1b the removal efficiency of p asa in the first 20 s increased from 60 at a paa concentration of 50 μm to 98 at a paa concentration 200 μm combined with the data in fig 1a the results suggested that a molar ratio of fe ii to paa of 2 1 was optimum to achieve the highest degradation efficiency of p asa under investigated conditions the degradation of p asa over the ph range of 3 0 8 0 by the fe ii paa process was studied as shown in fig 1c the degradation efficiency of p asa gradually decreased with the increase in ph wherein its value was around 98 75 and 40 respectively at ph 3 0 6 0 and 8 0 paa has a pka value of 8 2 koubek et al 1963 hence protonated paa ch3c o ooh prevailed at ph 7 for instance the proportion of protonated paa was around 99 99 99 37 and 61 31 respectively at ph 3 0 6 0 and 8 0 figure s2 since protonated paa is a much stronger oxidant than its deprotonated form ch3c o oo j kim et al 2019 it is expected that the reaction between fe ii and paa would be decreased at higher ph additionally the formation of hydroxo fe complexes at higher ph might also decrease its reactivity toward paa similar to the case in the fenton process babuponnusami and muthukumar 2012 furthermore j kim et al 2019 reported that the reaction between fe ii and oxygen accelerated at higher ph which might competitively consume more fe ii and consequently less fe ii was left for paa the inhibitive effect of ph on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa might be a combined result of the above mentioned reasons however a removal efficiency of around 75 was still obtained at a slight acid condition which is superior to the traditional fenton process that only has a narrow effective ph range i e around ph 3 0 3 2 major contributors for p asa degradation in the fe ii paa process multiple reactive species including oh organic radicals e g ch3c o o and fe iv fe v were reported to be generated in the fe ii paa process and they might contribute to the enhanced degradation of p asa as observed in fig 1 tba was selected as a scavenger of oh due to its high reactivity toward oh apparent second order rate constant k app of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 but not fe iv fe v or organic radicals generated from paa e g ch3c o o wang et al 2021 hence the impact of tba with a concentration of 0 1 m on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process was studied as shown in fig 2 a the degradation efficiency of p asa decreased from 98 without tba to 85 and 75 in the presence of 0 5 and 1 mm tba respectively the removal efficiency of p asa maintained around 75 with further increasing tba concentration to 1 m the results suggested that oh contributed partially to p asa degradation in line well with the high reactivity between them k app of 8 6 109 m 1s 1 tyutereva et al 2020 the paa solution used in this study contained around 87 μm h2o2 which might react with fe ii generating oh however as shown in fig 2b p asa was degraded 15 by h2o2 87 μm in the absence or presence of 400 μm fe ii indicating that the oh generated in fe ii paa process was mainly due to the reaction between fe ii and paa instead of h2o2 terephthalic acid tpa was selected as a oh probe compound and the fluorescence intensity of its product by oh i e hydroxylated tpa htpa was monitored at excitation wavelengths of 315 nm li et al 2004 the peak intensity of htpa at 436 nm rapidly increased upon fe ii reaction with paa while it was indiscernible in the presence of paa alone figure s3 moreover the peak intensity of htpa obtained in the fe ii paa process was around one order of magnitude higher than that obtained in the fe ii h2o2 the same concentration of h2o2 contained in the paa solution process which again confirmed that paa rather than h2o2 was the major initiator for oh generation in fe ii paa process the large excess 200 folds concentrations of tba 1 1000 mm vs p asa 5 μm ensured the complete capture of oh by tba given the mild inhibition of tba to the degradation of p asa by 23 oh was expected to contribute minorly therein other reactive species in addition to oh was also involved in this process it is reported that high valent fe iv fe v species were generated in the fe ii paa process and contributed to the degradation of micropollutants therein j kim et al 2019 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was widely used as a probe compound for fe iv fe v both fe iv and fe v show high reactivity toward pmso with k app of 2 6 103 and 7 8 106 m 1s 1 respectively zhu et al 2020 moreover it is reported that pmso is oxidized to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by fe iv fe v via a two electron transfer pathway wang et al 2018 2019 in contrast pmso is mainly oxidized to hydroxylated and or dimeric products by a radical based reaction pathway yang et al 2022a b mai et al 2022 wang et al 2018 2019 hence the likely role of fe iv fe v in the fe ii paa process could be differentiated from that of oh by the distinct products of their reactions with pmso as shown in fig 2c pmso was rapidly degraded by the fe ii paa process however no discernible generation of pmso2 was observed therein additionally the degradation of pmso was only partially inhibited by the presence of 1 m tba the results suggested that fe iv fe v was unlikely to participate in the degradation of p asa pmso by the fe ii paa process and other reactive oxidants in addition to oh were responsible for the rapid degradation of target compounds organic radicals e g ch3c o o were frequently detected in paa based aops including the fe ii paa process wang et al 2021 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 j 2019 wang et al 2020b and they might lead to the enhanced degradation of p asa therein therefore the generation of ch3c o o in the fe ii paa process was detected following the method reported by wang et al 2021 where 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo was used as a radical probe and the signal for ch3c o o tempo adduct product m z of 216 2 was monitored by hplc ms as shown in figure s4 the peak eluting at 12 3 min with m z of 216 2 was successfully observed in the hplc ms spectrum additionally the peak eluting at 10 8 min with m z of 172 2 was also detected figure s5 which corresponded to the adduct product of tempo with ch3 ch3 tempo generated from the decarboxylation of ch3c o o the results were in line with those reported by wang et al 2021 which confirmed the generation of ch3c o o in the fe ii paa process the above results showed that oh and ch3c o o were likely the major oxidants in the fe ii paa process mostly generated via the homolytic oo bond cleavage of paa 3 3 oxidation products of p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process the oxidation products of p asa by the fe ii paa process at ph 3 0 were detected to enable the quantification of intermediate products the initial p asa concentration was increased from 5 to 20 μm while that of fe ii and paa was maintained at 400 and 200 μm respectively as shown in fig 3 a total of 4 organic products i e p benzoquinone p aminophenol hydroquinone and p nitrobenzene arsenic acid nitrasone and 2 inorganic products i e as v and nh4 were detected from p asa oxidation by the fe ii paa process the evolution kinetics of p asa and those 6 oxidation products were monitored and shown in figure s6 wherein a good mass balance of total arsenic was obtained i e initial p asa residual p asa as v nitrasone p asa was mainly oxidized to as v nh4 and p aminophenol with their concentrations around 17 89 11 24 and 4 09 μm respectively after 5 min oxidation of the aniline group in p asa could lead to the formation of p nitrobenzene arsenic acid the cleavage of aso oh 2 moiety in p asa and further oxidation of its benzene ring and or aniline group by oh and ch3c o o might generate hydroquinone p benzoquinone and p aminophenol the aso oh 2 group cleaved from p asa would be in the form of arsenite as iii h3aso3 and it could be rapidly oxidized to as v by oh and ch3c o o wang et al 2020b and even paa as discussed in below similar products were also detected during p asa oxidation by other processes such as fe ii pds aop wang et al 2020a birnessite wang and cheng 2015 and ferrate oxidation yang et al 2018 the results showed that the aniline group in p asa and its para position were the most vulnerable sites to attack by various oxidants 3 4 impacts of water background constituents on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process p asa degradation kinetics degradation kinetics of p asa by the fe ii paa process in the presence of different water background ions including hco3 0 10 mm cl 0 10 mm and ha 0 5 mgc l was investigated be noted the impact of hco3 was investigated at ph 8 0 to keep the stability of the solution ph while that of cl and ha was studied at ph 3 0 as shown in figure s7 the presence of hco3 and cl at investigated concentrations demonstrated slight impacts on p asa degradation similar results were also observed in other paa involved oxidation processes e g ultraviolet activated paa paa fe iii system with picolinic acid chen et al 2019 kim et al 2020 hco3 and cl could compete with p asa for oh and ch3c o o generating secondary radicals as co3 or cl although co3 and cl are less reactive than oh and ch3c o o they can otherwise facilitate the transfer between oh and ch3c o o chen et al 2019 for instance the presence of hco3 was reported to enhance the transfer of oh to ch3c o o chen et al 2019 hence minimal impacts of hco3 and cl at a concentration of 10 mm on p asa degradation were obtained the presence of ha gradually decreased the degradation efficiency of p asa from 98 without ha to 85 with 5 mgc l ha likely due to its scavenge of oh and or ch3c o o it is reported that ha reacts with oh with a rate constant of k app of 2 104 l mg 1s 1 fang et al 2014 total arsenic removal fe iii was formed from fe ii oxidation by reactive species and it could serve as a coagulant for the removal of residual p asa as well as its oxidation products via the formation of ferric oxy hydroxide species yang et al 2018 therefore the generation of fe iii was expected to decrease the total arsenic level in reacted solutions to further investigate the removal efficiency of total arsenic p asa was firstly oxidized by the fe ii paa process in the presence of common cations i e ca2 and mg2 10 mm anions cl 10 mm so4 2 10 mm po4 3 0 10 mm sio3 2 1 mm and ha 1 mgc l at ph 3 0 for 5 min then the ph of the reaction solution was raised to 6 0 and samples were collected and filtered for quantification of total arsenic as shown in fig 4 the presence of cl so4 2 ca2 and mg2 had no significant impact on the total arsenic removal even at a concentration of 10 mm comparatively the presence of po4 3 0 10 mm sio3 2 1 mm and ha decreased the removal efficiency of total arsenic the results correlated well with the removal of p asa by thefe ii pds aop wang et al 2020a the presence of po4 3 sio3 2 and ha could decrease the surface charge of ferric oxy hydroxides and render them negatively charged wang et al 2020a which may consequently increase the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged ferric oxy hydroxides and arsenic species additionally the similar structure of po4 3 and sio3 2 to as v aso4 3 may also lead to decreased arsenic removal efficiency via competitive adsorption sun et al 2018b chen and huang 2012 overall the results suggested that fe ii paa was an effective process for arsenic removal even in the presence of various water background ions via the dual effects of oxidation and coagulation 3 5 characteristics of the precipitate as discussed above the ferric oxy hydroxide precipitates generated in the fe ii paa process could effectively remove total arsenic after oxidation likely via the adsorption of arsenic on the precipitates the sem micrographs of the precipitate separated from the aqueous phase were shown in fig 5 a the precipitates mainly existed in amorphous form similar to that observed during p asa treatment by the fenton process xie et al 2016 the element mappings of c o n fe and as of the precipitates were shown in fig 5b f respectively it could be easily recognized that as did deposit on the precipitate confirming the adsorptive interaction of arsenic with the precipitates the results suggested that preoxidation of p asa by the fe ii paa process followed by precipitation with ferric precipitates was an effective approach for the treatment of arsenic contamination 3 6 oxidation of as iii by paa and the fe ii paa process results in fig 3 showed that as v was one of the major products of p asa oxidation by the fe ii paa process and it likely resulted from the oxidation of intermediate as iii by hydroxyl organic radicals wei et al 2021 or by paa hence it was expected that paa or the fe ii paa process could also oxidize as iii to as v which might be an overlooked process for the remediation of as iii contamination as shown in fig 6 as iii could be completely oxidized to as v by paa alone and by the fe ii paa process around neutral ph as iii 10 μm was 100 transformed to as v by 10 μm paa in 15 min while that was shortened to 1 min by 10 μm paa in the presence of 20 μm fe ii the results provided solid evidence that both paa and fe ii paa processes could oxidize as iii to as v as iii was hardly oxidized by h2o2 at a concentration equal to that contained in paa solution i e around 5 μm or by oxygen in the air fig 6a suggesting that paa was the dominant oxidant for as iii oxidation increasing fe ii from 5 to 20 μm enhanced the oxidation of as iii to as v by paa while further increasing fe ii to 100 and 500 μm inhibited as iii oxidation fig 6b the result was consistent with those obtained in the case of p asa where a molar ratio of fe ii to paa of 2 1 was optimum for the fe ii paa process high fe ii concentration might lead to the competitive consumption of reactive species by fe ii thus decreasing the utilization efficiency of reactive species by as iii the oxidation of p asa by the fe ii paa process under different conditions was discussed above and it was expected that the oxidation of as iii therein followed a similar trend hence the oxidation of as iii by paa alone was studied in depth in the following section to gain insight into this process 3 7 impacts of operation conditions on the oxidation of as iii by paa oxidation of as iii by paa at a concentration of 5 30 μm was investigated as shown in fig 7 a increasing paa concentration increased the oxidation rates of as iii by paa the half life of as iii oxidation was around 5 0 5 and 0 25 min by the presence of 10 20 and 30 μm paa respectively additionally it was found that only 5 μm of as iii was oxidized to as v by 5 μm paa while all of the 10 μm as iii was transformed to as v at paa concentration 10 μm the results suggested a molar ratio of paa to as iii of 1 1 for the complete oxidation of as iii to as v by paa to verify the hypothesis oxidation of as iii 10 μm by paa at different concentrations 0 30 μm at ph 7 0 for 30 min was investigated as shown in figure s8 the final as v generated increased linearly with paa concentration at paa 10 μm while the complete transformation of as iii to as v was obtained at paa 10 μm the results confirmed a stoichiometry of 1 1 for the reaction of paa with as iii the impact of as iii concentration on its oxidation by paa at a constant concentration of 10 μm was investigated as shown in fig 7b the oxidation rates of as iii by paa increased with the initial concentrations of as iii however as iii was only partially oxidized to as v when its concentration surpassed that of the initial concentration of paa i e 10 μm the result was in line well with that obtained in fig 7b suggesting that a minimum concentration of paa equaled to the initial as iii concentration was required for the complete transformation of as iii to as v oxidation of as iii by paa over the ph range of 4 0 9 0 was examined as shown in fig 7c neutral and alkaline ph favored the oxidation of as iii for instance the half life of as iii was 30 min at ph 4 0 while it was shortened to around 5 and 0 5 min respectively at ph 7 0 and 9 0 a similar trend was also obtained during peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation of as iii which was explained by the lower activation energy of oxygen atom transfer by the peroxide in the presence of oh wang et al 2014 considering the structure similarity of paa to pms and their same reaction pathways with as iii i e oxygen transfer the accelerating effect of oh on as iii oxidation by paa might also result from its impact on the activation energy of the oxygen transfer process the opposite trends of ph on the degradation of p asa by the fe ii paa process fig 1c and as iii by paa fig 7c showed that the fe ii paa process was effective in the removal of p asa and as iii under neutral to acidic conditions while paa was efficient in the removal of as iii at neutral to alkaline phs 3 8 oxidation of as iii and p asa by paa or fe ii paa in real waters oxidation of p asa and as iii by the fe ii paa process in three real waters i e groundwater gw wastewater treatment plant effluent wwtp and surface water sw was studied the quality of the three real waters was shown in table s2 as shown in fig 8 both p asa and as iii were effectively oxidized in real waters with a removal efficiency 85 in all cases suggesting the robust performance for the fe ii paa process the removal efficiency of total arsenic after adjusting the reacted solution ph to 6 0 was shown in fig 8b for p asa and 8d for as iii respectively wherein a removal efficiency of 80 was obtained even in wwtp the results suggested that preoxidation of as iii and p asa by reactive species generated in the fe ii paa process i e oh and ch3c o o followed by coagulation with ferric oxy hydroxide species in situ generated was effective in arsenic remediation in real waters 4 conclusions the paa based oxidation processes have emerged as promising technologies in water treatment this study for the first time demonstrated that paa and fe ii paa processes could effectively oxidize organic p asa and inorganic as iii to less toxic as v meantime realized the removal of total arsenic from the aqueous phase via precipitation by ferric oxy hydroxide in situ formed or extra added the following conclusions could be obtained p asa could be rapidly oxidized by the fe ii paa process under different conditions with higher removal efficiency at a molar ratio of fe ii to paa of 2 1 and under acidic phs hydroxyl radicals and organic radicals generated from homolytic oo bond cleavage of paa were identified as the major oxidant contributing to p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process totally 6 oxidation products including two organic products i e p benzoquinone p aminophenol hydroquinone and nitrosone and 2 inorganic products i e as v and nh4 were detected from p asa oxidation by fe ii paa process among which as v nh4 and p aminophenol prevailed over other products as iii could be readily oxidized to as v by paa with a stoichiometric molar ratio of as iii to paa of 1 1 and alkaline ph favored the oxidation process total arsenic during p asa oxidation by the fe ii paa process or as iii oxidation by paa could be removed by 80 by the adsorption of amorphous ferric precipitates in situ formed or extra added in synthetic waters and or real waters

14686,the widespread occurrence of p arsanilic acid p asa in natural environments poses big threats to the biosphere due to the generation of toxic inorganic arsenic i e as iii and as v especially as iii with higher toxicity and mobility oxidation of p asa or as iii to as v followed by precipitation of total arsenic using fe based advanced oxidation processes demonstrated to be a promising approach for the treatment of arsenic contamination this study for the first time investigated the efficiency and inherent mechanism of p asa and as iii oxidation by fe ii peracetic acid fe ii paa and paa processes p asa was rapidly degraded by the fe ii paa process within 20 s at neutral to acidic phs under different conditions while it was insignificantly degraded by paa oxidation alone lines of evidence suggested that hydroxyl radicals and organic radicals generated from the homolytic oo bond cleavage of paa contributed to the degradation of p asa in the fe ii paa process p asa was mainly oxidized to as v nh4 and p aminophenol by the fe ii paa process wherein the aniline group and its para position were the most vulnerable sites as iii of concern was likely generated as an intermediate during p asa oxidation and it could be readily oxidized to as v by the fe ii paa process as well as paa alone the in depth investigation demonstrated that paa alone was effective in the oxidation of as iii under varied conditions with a stoichiometric molar ratio of 1 1 efficient removal 80 of total arsenic during p asa oxidation by fe ii paa process or during as iii oxidation by paa process with additional fe iii in synthetic or real waters were observed mainly due to the adsorptive interactions of amorphous ferric oxy hydroxide precipitates this study systematically investigates the oxidation of p asa and as iii by the fe ii paa and paa processes which is instructive for the future development of arsenic remediation technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

aqueous environments due to natural processes and or anthropogenic activities poses serious threats to the ecosystem and human health sharma and sohn 2009 yang et al 2018a arsenic could exist in either inorganic e g arsenite as iii and arsenate as v or organic e g p arsanilic acid p asa form p asa is one of the phenylarsonic acid organics and it has been widely used as an animal feed additive to promote growth and prevent bacterial and parasitic diseases of livestock for several decades liu et al 2013 2015 jones 2007 pergantis et al 1997 it is reported that the feed dosage of p asa to pigs and chicken is around 25 100 mg kg wang and cheng 2015 p asa is hardly metabolized in animal bodies and is excreted intact into animal wastes chen and huang 2012 aschbacher and feil 1991 wherein it finally leaches out and affluxes into surface waters due to high water solubility han et al 2004 although with low toxicity p asa could be degraded to more toxic inorganic species e g as iii and as v especially as iii with higher toxicity and mobility via biotic and abiotic processes chabot et al 2009 jones 2007 hence different methods have been developed to remove p asa from the aqueous solution

2003 joshi et al 2017 mamindy pajany et al 2011 demonstrated good performance for adsorptive p asa removal while the adsorption was sometimes less efficient than those for inorganic arsenic yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 depalma et al 2008 wu et al 2022 additionally it often takes several hours to reach the adsorption equilibrium which is quite time consuming wang et al 2020a comparatively chemical oxidation stood out for the treatment of arsenic contamination in those processes arsenic in p asa was finally oxidized to less toxic as v by reactive species e g hydroxyl radical oh sulfate

2018b wang et al 2020a xie et al 2016 x 2019 xu et al 2007 among the diverse oxidation processes fe based oxidation processes e g ferrate oxidation fenton process and persulfate based fenton like advanced oxidation process aops were the most widely studied mainly due to the multiple roles of fe species as oxidant reductant and coagulant during the reactions zhou et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 p wang et al 2020 xie and cheng 2019 xie et al 2016 for instance wang et al 2020a reported that 98 5 of total arsenic was removed during p asa oxidation by fe ii activated peroxydisulfate fe ii pds process at neutral ph via the oxidative effect of generated reactive radicals and adsorptive effect of ferric oxyhydro oxides in situ formed from fe ii oxidation in addition to persulfate based fenton like aops the fe ii activated peracetic acid fe ii paa process has raised increasing scientific interests and emerged as a promising aop for water treatment carlos et al 2021 dai et al 2023 j kim et al 2019 paa has been widely used as an alternative disinfectant and bleaching agent to traditional chlorine in various industries luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 kitis 2004 paa has also been studied as an oxidant for the removal of micropollutants or as a disinfectant in wastewater treatment since the late 1970s mainly due to its strong oxidation ability especially after activation high disinfection efficiency and little formation of toxic byproducts zhang et al 2020 dunkin et al 2017 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 sun et al 2018a it is reported that multiple reactive species including oh organic radicals e g ch3c o o ch3c o oo and fe iv fe v were generated in the fe ii paa process and accounted for the efficient degradation of micropollutants therein carlos et al 2021 j kim et al 2019 considering the strong oxidation ability of reactive species generated in the fe ii paa process and the adsorption property of ferric hydroxide in situ generated from fe ii oxidation it is hypothesized that the fe ii paa process or even paa alone might be an efficient strategy for p asa as well as as iii as v removal however the information on the removal efficiency of both organic and inorganic arsenic by the fe ii paa process remains unclear so far therefore the objectives of this study were to i investigate the oxidation efficiency of p asa and as iii by paa or fe ii paa treatment ii identify the major contributors that accounted for arsenic degradation iii elucidate the impacts of common water background ions on the degradation of arsenic iv figure out the degradation products of p asa by the fe ii paa process and v explore the effectiveness of the fe ii paa process on the removal of arsenic in real waters the results from this study are expected to

reagent co ltd shanghai china all solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 2 mω cm the stock solution of paa was generated by acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by sulfuric acid and it was stored at 4 c before use the concentration of paa and or h2o2 in the paa stock solution was quantified following the procedures reported in the literature before each experiment wang et al 2020a the stock solution of fe ii was freshly prepared before experiments by dissolving iron ii sulfate feso4 7h2o in deionized di water with continuously bubbling by nitrogen and standardized spectrophotometrically by the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method tamura et al 1974 2 2 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 50 ml glass flasks under constant magnetic stirring at 500 r min at 25 c controlled with a water bath a specific amount of paa was firstly added to the glass beaker in the absence or presence of one of the water constituents hco3 cl so4 2 sio3 2 ca2 mg2 po4 3 and ha specific radical scavengers tba or probes terephthalic acid tpa and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo in di water then the solution ph was adjusted to specific values determined by preliminary tests to ensure the final ph reaching to the desired ph after introducing p asa as iii and or fe ii the change of solution ph during the whole reaction period was within 0 5 ph unit at predetermined time intervals a 0 5 ml sample was collected and quenched with 0 5 ml w t 1 hydroxylamine hydrochloride for subsequent kinetics and product analysis to evaluate the p asa and as iii degradation efficiency in real waters three types of water including groundwater surface water and secondary wastewater effluent were collected and filtered through nylon membranes 0 22 μm pore size oumuni tianjin and stored at 4 c before use the experiments in real waters followed the same procedures as those conducted in di waters to track the total arsenic removal efficiency the ph of the working solution was adjusted to 3 0 following those in batch experiments and oxidized by the fe ii paa process for 5 min or by paa for 15 min then the ph was adjusted to 6 0 for coagulation and precipitation in the case of paa oxidation alone fe2 so4 3 100 μm was additionally added after oxidation as a representative coagulant the supernatant was collected at fixed time intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the precipitates retained by the membrane were also collected for characterization with scanning electron microscopy sem all experiments were performed in triplicate and the average data with standard deviations were presented 2 3 analytical methods p asa and its organic degradation

samples were separated by an xbridge beh c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm waters co in an isocratic mode of elution at 35 1 c the flow rate and injection volumes are 1 0 ml min and 20 μl respectively the

composition of the precipitates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7800f equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of p asa by paa and fe ii paa processes the degradation efficiency of p asa 5 μm by paa 400 μm alone or in the presence of 200 μm fe ii at ph 3 0 was comparatively studied as shown in figure s1 p asa was degraded by 15 within 45 min by paa suggesting that paa alone was ineffective to remove p asa comparatively p asa was rapidly degraded by the fe ii paa process with a removal efficiency of 98 in the first 20 s figure s1 demonstrating the effectiveness of the fe ii paa process for the removal of p asa hence the degradation efficiency of p asa by the fe ii paa process under different operating conditions was further studied the impact of fe ii concentrations on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process was studied fe ii concentrations ranging from 100 to 600 μm were investigated and it fell within the dosage range of coagulants used in traditional 5 15 mg l around 89 270 μm as fe3 jarvis et al 2012 and enhanced coagulation processes 20 150 mg l around 120 900 μm as fe3 gerrity et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 a p asa was rapidly degraded within the first 20 s and then its concentration kept relatively stable as the reaction proceeded in all the cases the removal efficiency of p asa increased from 30 to 98 as fe ii concentration increased from 100 to 400 μm with fe ii paa 0 5 2 while it remained unchanged as fe ii concentration further increased to 600 μm fe ii paa 3 therefore an optimum fe ii dosage of 400 was obtained under investigated conditions considering both the efficiency and cost effectiveness increasing fe ii concentration might produce higher concentrations of reactive species thus leading to the higher degradation efficiency of p asa however a large excess of fe ii e g fe ii paa 10 would be detrimental to the process due to the sufficiently strong competitive consumption of reactive species by fe ii as has been reported previously j kim et al 2019 for instance it is reported that the second order rate constant of fe ii with oh was around 3 2 108 m 1s 1 neyens and baeyens 2003 the impact of paa concentrations 50 500 μm on the degradation of p asa 5 μm at a constant fe ii concentration of 400 μm was shown in fig 1b the removal efficiency of p asa in the first 20 s increased from 60 at a paa concentration of 50 μm to 98 at a paa concentration 200 μm combined with the data in fig 1a the results suggested that a molar ratio of fe ii to paa of 2 1 was optimum to achieve the highest degradation efficiency of p asa under investigated conditions the degradation of p asa over the ph range of 3 0 8 0 by the fe ii paa process was studied as shown in fig 1c the degradation efficiency of p asa gradually decreased with the increase in ph wherein its value was around 98 75 and 40 respectively at ph 3 0 6 0 and 8 0 paa has a pka value of 8 2 koubek et al 1963 hence protonated paa ch3c o ooh prevailed at ph 7 for instance the proportion of protonated paa was around 99 99 99 37 and 61 31 respectively at ph 3 0 6 0 and 8 0 figure s2 since protonated paa is a much stronger oxidant than its deprotonated form ch3c o oo j kim et al 2019 it is expected that the reaction between fe ii and paa would be decreased at higher ph additionally the formation of hydroxo fe complexes at higher ph might also decrease its reactivity toward paa similar to the case in the fenton process babuponnusami and muthukumar 2012 furthermore j kim et al 2019 reported that the reaction between fe ii and oxygen accelerated at higher ph which might competitively consume more fe ii and consequently less fe ii was left for paa the inhibitive effect of ph on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa might be a combined result of the above mentioned reasons however a removal efficiency of around 75 was still obtained at a slight acid condition which is superior to the traditional fenton process that only has a narrow effective ph range i e around ph 3 0 3 2 major contributors for p asa degradation in the fe ii paa process multiple reactive species including oh organic radicals e g ch3c o o and fe iv fe v were reported to be generated in the fe ii paa process and they might contribute to the enhanced degradation of p asa as observed in fig 1 tba was selected as a scavenger of oh due to its high reactivity toward oh apparent second order rate constant k app of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 but not fe iv fe v or organic radicals generated from paa e g ch3c o o wang et al 2021 hence the impact of tba with a concentration of 0 1 m on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process was studied as shown in fig 2 a the degradation efficiency of p asa decreased from 98 without tba to 85 and 75 in the presence of 0 5 and 1 mm tba respectively the removal efficiency of p asa maintained around 75 with further increasing tba concentration to 1 m the results suggested that oh contributed partially to p asa degradation in line well with the high reactivity between them k app of 8 6 109 m 1s 1 tyutereva et al 2020 the paa solution used in this study contained around 87 μm h2o2 which might react with fe ii generating oh however as shown in fig 2b p asa was degraded 15 by h2o2 87 μm in the absence or presence of 400 μm fe ii indicating that the oh generated in fe ii paa process was mainly due to the reaction between fe ii and paa instead of h2o2 terephthalic acid tpa was selected as a oh probe compound and the fluorescence intensity of its product by oh i e hydroxylated tpa htpa was monitored at excitation wavelengths of 315 nm li et al 2004 the peak intensity of htpa at 436 nm rapidly increased upon fe ii reaction with paa while it was indiscernible in the presence of paa alone figure s3 moreover the peak intensity of htpa obtained in the fe ii paa process was around one order of magnitude higher than that obtained in the fe ii h2o2 the same concentration of h2o2 contained in the paa solution process which again confirmed that paa rather than h2o2 was the major initiator for oh generation in fe ii paa process the large excess 200 folds concentrations of tba 1 1000 mm vs p asa 5 μm ensured the complete capture of oh by tba given the mild inhibition of tba to the degradation of p asa by 23 oh was expected to contribute minorly therein other reactive species in addition to oh was also involved in this process it is reported that high valent fe iv fe v species were generated in the fe ii paa process and contributed to the degradation of micropollutants therein j kim et al 2019 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was widely used as a probe compound for fe iv fe v both fe iv and fe v show high reactivity toward pmso with k app of 2 6 103 and 7 8 106 m 1s 1 respectively zhu et al 2020 moreover it is reported that pmso is oxidized to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by fe iv fe v via a two electron transfer pathway wang et al 2018 2019 in contrast pmso is mainly oxidized to hydroxylated and or dimeric products by a radical based reaction pathway yang et al 2022a b mai et al 2022 wang et al 2018 2019 hence the likely role of fe iv fe v in the fe ii paa process could be differentiated from that of oh by the distinct products of their reactions with pmso as shown in fig 2c pmso was rapidly degraded by the fe ii paa process however no discernible generation of pmso2 was observed therein additionally the degradation of pmso was only partially inhibited by the presence of 1 m tba the results suggested that fe iv fe v was unlikely to participate in the degradation of p asa pmso by the fe ii paa process and other reactive oxidants in addition to oh were responsible for the rapid degradation of target compounds organic radicals e g ch3c o o were frequently detected in paa based aops including the fe ii paa process wang et al 2021 cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 j 2019 wang et al 2020b and they might lead to the enhanced degradation of p asa therein therefore the generation of ch3c o o in the fe ii paa process was detected following the method reported by wang et al 2021 where 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo was used as a radical probe and the signal for ch3c o o tempo adduct product m z of 216 2 was monitored by hplc ms as shown in figure s4 the peak eluting at 12 3 min with m z of 216 2 was successfully observed in the hplc ms spectrum additionally the peak eluting at 10 8 min with m z of 172 2 was also detected figure s5 which corresponded to the adduct product of tempo with ch3 ch3 tempo generated from the decarboxylation of ch3c o o the results were in line with those reported by wang et al 2021 which confirmed the generation of ch3c o o in the fe ii paa process the above results showed that oh and ch3c o o were likely the major oxidants in the fe ii paa process mostly generated via the homolytic oo bond cleavage of paa 3 3 oxidation products of p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process the oxidation products of p asa by the fe ii paa process at ph 3 0 were detected to enable the quantification of intermediate products the initial p asa concentration was increased from 5 to 20 μm while that of fe ii and paa was maintained at 400 and 200 μm respectively as shown in fig 3 a total of 4 organic products i e p benzoquinone p aminophenol hydroquinone and p nitrobenzene arsenic acid nitrasone and 2 inorganic products i e as v and nh4 were detected from p asa oxidation by the fe ii paa process the evolution kinetics of p asa and those 6 oxidation products were monitored and shown in figure s6 wherein a good mass balance of total arsenic was obtained i e initial p asa residual p asa as v nitrasone p asa was mainly oxidized to as v nh4 and p aminophenol with their concentrations around 17 89 11 24 and 4 09 μm respectively after 5 min oxidation of the aniline group in p asa could lead to the formation of p nitrobenzene arsenic acid the cleavage of aso oh 2 moiety in p asa and further oxidation of its benzene ring and or aniline group by oh and ch3c o o might generate hydroquinone p benzoquinone and p aminophenol the aso oh 2 group cleaved from p asa would be in the form of arsenite as iii h3aso3 and it could be rapidly oxidized to as v by oh and ch3c o o wang et al 2020b and even paa as discussed in below similar products were also detected during p asa oxidation by other processes such as fe ii pds aop wang et al 2020a birnessite wang and cheng 2015 and ferrate oxidation yang et al 2018 the results showed that the aniline group in p asa and its para position were the most vulnerable sites to attack by various oxidants 3 4 impacts of water background constituents on p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process p asa degradation kinetics degradation kinetics of p asa by the fe ii paa process in the presence of different water background ions including hco3 0 10 mm cl 0 10 mm and ha 0 5 mgc l was investigated be noted the impact of hco3 was investigated at ph 8 0 to keep the stability of the solution ph while that of cl and ha was studied at ph 3 0 as shown in figure s7 the presence of hco3 and cl at investigated concentrations demonstrated slight impacts on p asa degradation similar results were also observed in other paa involved oxidation processes e g ultraviolet activated paa paa fe iii system with picolinic acid chen et al 2019 kim et al 2020 hco3 and cl could compete with p asa for oh and ch3c o o generating secondary radicals as co3 or cl although co3 and cl are less reactive than oh and ch3c o o they can otherwise facilitate the transfer between oh and ch3c o o chen et al 2019 for instance the presence of hco3 was reported to enhance the transfer of oh to ch3c o o chen et al 2019 hence minimal impacts of hco3 and cl at a concentration of 10 mm on p asa degradation were obtained the presence of ha gradually decreased the degradation efficiency of p asa from 98 without ha to 85 with 5 mgc l ha likely due to its scavenge of oh and or ch3c o o it is reported that ha reacts with oh with a rate constant of k app of 2 104 l mg 1s 1 fang et al 2014 total arsenic removal fe iii was formed from fe ii oxidation by reactive species and it could serve as a coagulant for the removal of residual p asa as well as its oxidation products via the formation of ferric oxy hydroxide species yang et al 2018 therefore the generation of fe iii was expected to decrease the total arsenic level in reacted solutions to further investigate the removal efficiency of total arsenic p asa was firstly oxidized by the fe ii paa process in the presence of common cations i e ca2 and mg2 10 mm anions cl 10 mm so4 2 10 mm po4 3 0 10 mm sio3 2 1 mm and ha 1 mgc l at ph 3 0 for 5 min then the ph of the reaction solution was raised to 6 0 and samples were collected and filtered for quantification of total arsenic as shown in fig 4 the presence of cl so4 2 ca2 and mg2 had no significant impact on the total arsenic removal even at a concentration of 10 mm comparatively the presence of po4 3 0 10 mm sio3 2 1 mm and ha decreased the removal efficiency of total arsenic the results correlated well with the removal of p asa by thefe ii pds aop wang et al 2020a the presence of po4 3 sio3 2 and ha could decrease the surface charge of ferric oxy hydroxides and render them negatively charged wang et al 2020a which may consequently increase the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged ferric oxy hydroxides and arsenic species additionally the similar structure of po4 3 and sio3 2 to as v aso4 3 may also lead to decreased arsenic removal efficiency via competitive adsorption sun et al 2018b chen and huang 2012 overall the results suggested that fe ii paa was an effective process for arsenic removal even in the presence of various water background ions via the dual effects of oxidation and coagulation 3 5 characteristics of the precipitate as discussed above the ferric oxy hydroxide precipitates generated in the fe ii paa process could effectively remove total arsenic after oxidation likely via the adsorption of arsenic on the precipitates the sem micrographs of the precipitate separated from the aqueous phase were shown in fig 5 a the precipitates mainly existed in amorphous form similar to that observed during p asa treatment by the fenton process xie et al 2016 the element mappings of c o n fe and as of the precipitates were shown in fig 5b f respectively it could be easily recognized that as did deposit on the precipitate confirming the adsorptive interaction of arsenic with the precipitates the results suggested that preoxidation of p asa by the fe ii paa process followed by precipitation with ferric precipitates was an effective approach for the treatment of arsenic contamination 3 6 oxidation of as iii by paa and the fe ii paa process results in fig 3 showed that as v was one of the major products of p asa oxidation by the fe ii paa process and it likely resulted from the oxidation of intermediate as iii by hydroxyl organic radicals wei et al 2021 or by paa hence it was expected that paa or the fe ii paa process could also oxidize as iii to as v which might be an overlooked process for the remediation of as iii contamination as shown in fig 6 as iii could be completely oxidized to as v by paa alone and by the fe ii paa process around neutral ph as iii 10 μm was 100 transformed to as v by 10 μm paa in 15 min while that was shortened to 1 min by 10 μm paa in the presence of 20 μm fe ii the results provided solid evidence that both paa and fe ii paa processes could oxidize as iii to as v as iii was hardly oxidized by h2o2 at a concentration equal to that contained in paa solution i e around 5 μm or by oxygen in the air fig 6a suggesting that paa was the dominant oxidant for as iii oxidation increasing fe ii from 5 to 20 μm enhanced the oxidation of as iii to as v by paa while further increasing fe ii to 100 and 500 μm inhibited as iii oxidation fig 6b the result was consistent with those obtained in the case of p asa where a molar ratio of fe ii to paa of 2 1 was optimum for the fe ii paa process high fe ii concentration might lead to the competitive consumption of reactive species by fe ii thus decreasing the utilization efficiency of reactive species by as iii the oxidation of p asa by the fe ii paa process under different conditions was discussed above and it was expected that the oxidation of as iii therein followed a similar trend hence the oxidation of as iii by paa alone was studied in depth in the following section to gain insight into this process 3 7 impacts of operation conditions on the oxidation of as iii by paa oxidation of as iii by paa at a concentration of 5 30 μm was investigated as shown in fig 7 a increasing paa concentration increased the oxidation rates of as iii by paa the half life of as iii oxidation was around 5 0 5 and 0 25 min by the presence of 10 20 and 30 μm paa respectively additionally it was found that only 5 μm of as iii was oxidized to as v by 5 μm paa while all of the 10 μm as iii was transformed to as v at paa concentration 10 μm the results suggested a molar ratio of paa to as iii of 1 1 for the complete oxidation of as iii to as v by paa to verify the hypothesis oxidation of as iii 10 μm by paa at different concentrations 0 30 μm at ph 7 0 for 30 min was investigated as shown in figure s8 the final as v generated increased linearly with paa concentration at paa 10 μm while the complete transformation of as iii to as v was obtained at paa 10 μm the results confirmed a stoichiometry of 1 1 for the reaction of paa with as iii the impact of as iii concentration on its oxidation by paa at a constant concentration of 10 μm was investigated as shown in fig 7b the oxidation rates of as iii by paa increased with the initial concentrations of as iii however as iii was only partially oxidized to as v when its concentration surpassed that of the initial concentration of paa i e 10 μm the result was in line well with that obtained in fig 7b suggesting that a minimum concentration of paa equaled to the initial as iii concentration was required for the complete transformation of as iii to as v oxidation of as iii by paa over the ph range of 4 0 9 0 was examined as shown in fig 7c neutral and alkaline ph favored the oxidation of as iii for instance the half life of as iii was 30 min at ph 4 0 while it was shortened to around 5 and 0 5 min respectively at ph 7 0 and 9 0 a similar trend was also obtained during peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation of as iii which was explained by the lower activation energy of oxygen atom transfer by the peroxide in the presence of oh wang et al 2014 considering the structure similarity of paa to pms and their same reaction pathways with as iii i e oxygen transfer the accelerating effect of oh on as iii oxidation by paa might also result from its impact on the activation energy of the oxygen transfer process the opposite trends of ph on the degradation of p asa by the fe ii paa process fig 1c and as iii by paa fig 7c showed that the fe ii paa process was effective in the removal of p asa and as iii under neutral to acidic conditions while paa was efficient in the removal of as iii at neutral to alkaline phs 3 8 oxidation of as iii and p asa by paa or fe ii paa in real waters oxidation of p asa and as iii by the fe ii paa process in three real waters i e groundwater gw wastewater treatment plant effluent wwtp and surface water sw was studied the quality of the three real waters was shown in table s2 as shown in fig 8 both p asa and as iii were effectively oxidized in real waters with a removal efficiency 85 in all cases suggesting the robust performance for the fe ii paa process the removal efficiency of total arsenic after adjusting the reacted solution ph to 6 0 was shown in fig 8b for p asa and 8d for as iii respectively wherein a removal efficiency of 80 was obtained even in wwtp the results suggested that preoxidation of as iii and p asa by reactive species generated in the fe ii paa process i e oh and ch3c o o followed by coagulation with ferric oxy hydroxide species in situ generated was effective in arsenic remediation in real waters 4 conclusions the paa based oxidation processes have emerged as promising technologies in water treatment this study for the first time demonstrated that paa and fe ii paa processes could effectively oxidize organic p asa and inorganic as iii to less toxic as v meantime realized the removal of total arsenic from the aqueous phase via precipitation by ferric oxy hydroxide in situ formed or extra added the following conclusions could be obtained p asa could be rapidly oxidized by the fe ii paa process under different conditions with higher removal efficiency at a molar ratio of fe ii to paa of 2 1 and under acidic phs hydroxyl radicals and organic radicals generated from homolytic oo bond cleavage of paa were identified as the major oxidant contributing to p asa degradation by the fe ii paa process totally 6 oxidation products including two organic products i e p benzoquinone p aminophenol hydroquinone and nitrosone and 2 inorganic products i e as v and nh4 were detected from p asa oxidation by fe ii paa process among which as v nh4 and p aminophenol prevailed over other products as iii could be readily oxidized to as v by paa with a stoichiometric molar ratio of as iii to paa of 1 1 and alkaline ph favored the oxidation process total arsenic during p asa oxidation by the fe ii paa process or as iii oxidation by paa could be removed by 80 by the adsorption of amorphous ferric precipitates in situ formed or extra added in synthetic waters and or real waters

14687,perfluorinated compounds pfcs are a group of bio recalcitrant pollutants that remain in waste activated sludge and may subsequently be transferred with sludge to thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp process instead of reduction it is observed previously that the concentration of free pfcs elevated after thp by employing perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa as a representative this study developed a hierarchical scheme to pinpoint the key factors that contribute to free pfoa elevation from the complex sludge transformations according to the results the relative abundance of pfoa in the liquid phase increased by 11 7 22 9 during thp in the solid phase the amide groups reduction and the spatial structure change of proteins weakened the sorption capability of solids for pfoa in the liquid phase the increase of proteins which could bind and form static hindrance to regulate the behavior of pfoa was the main factor to retain pfoa in liquid in contrast other sludge transformations including changes in ph zeta potential ionic condition and specific surface area displayed insignificant impact on the redistribution process the study presents a detailed picture on how sludge transformations would regulate pfcs distribution that ultimately direct the selection of further treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords recalcitrant pollutants

introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps as the receptor for municipal waste and wastewater are the reservoirs and point sources of micropollutants to the environment grandclément et al 2017 of the micropollutants found in wwtps perfluorinated compounds pfcs have attracted intensive concerns in recent years due to their wide application and recalcitrant properties recently thermal hydrolysis has been widely incorporated into the wwtps as a sludge pretreatment step to enhance dewaterability and or biodegradability of wasted activated sludge was barber 2016 lu et al 2020 instead of reduction we commonly observed the increase of free pfcs i e pfoa in the liquid phase after thp in our previous study this would deteriorate the water quality and even threaten the ecological safety of the downstream water when the thp liquid was recycled into the mainstream for denitrification however till now little is known about how thp cause the elevation of free pfcs in treated sludge the distribution of pfcs in sludge is a result of competitive interaction with matters in solid and liquid phases thp treatment would induce complex transformations in both liquid and solid phase of sludge such as changes in total solids ph zeta potential specific surface area dissolved organic constituents ionic condition etc as a result the interactive forces of pfcs with matters in each phase as well as the equilibrium status of pfcs in treated sludge would change accordingly therefore understanding how the interactive forces would change between pfcs and matters in each phase is the key to uncover the mechanism of pfcs redistribution in sludge during thp in the solid phase the abundance of immobilized pfcs relies on two factors i e the mass and adsorption capacity of solids pfcs are characterized with a fully fluorinated hydrophobic alkyl chain attached with one or more hydrophilic head group ledda et al 2018 they can be absorbed by solids via forming hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions within pfcs organics and pfcs charged chemicals respectively kancharla et al 2022 yan et al 2021 it is predictable that pfcs could be released into liquid concurrently with solids solubilization reduction during thp however it remains unclear how thp would alter the adsorption capacity of solids thereby influence the distribution of pfcs in treated sludge in the liquid phase dissolved organic matters doms are reported to influence the behavior of pollutants kothawala et al 2017 during thp the disintegration of solids would greatly elevate the abundance of doms in liquid phase lu et al 2020 while previous studies mainly focused on the overall effects of doms on micropollutants distribution kothawala et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 few studies were about how different fractions of organics would regulate pfcs behavior in the liquid phase in fact the length of carbon chain can influence the intensity of the hydrophobic interaction and the steric hindrance and the charge status is related with the intensity of electrostatic attraction force yan et al 2021 thus the molecular weight and chemical property of doms could also be crucial factors that influence pfcs distribution in the liquid phase perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a typical type of pfcs is widely used in commercial products and industrial processes gupta and saleh 2013 lindstrom et al 2011 the extensive application of pfoa and its precursor perfluorinated chemicals inevitably leads to its environmental release and accumulation in wwtps wang et al 2015 for example the pfoa level in sludge was 23 2 298 ng g dried weight in wwtps in shanghai china wang et al 2015 besides pfoa is highly thermally stable thus it is an ideal representative to study the redistribution of pfcs during thp taking pfoa as a representative this study explored how sludge transformations induced by thp results in the redistribution of pfcs in treated sludge due to the complexity of sludge transformations a hierarchical scheme was developed to sort out potential factors and a series of variable controlled experiments were designed to evaluate the contribution of each factor this study successfully identified the key causes of pfoa redistribution during was thermal hydrolysis and shed light on the mechanism that may ultimately impact the technology selection for was management 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge source and materials waste activated sludge was was collected from a local wastewater treatment plant the basic characteristics and dissolved component constituents of sludge are presented in table 1 detailed methods of performing the basic analysis are described in text s1 standard stock solutions of 13c4 pfoa and pfoa were purchased from wellington laboratories canada with a concentration of 50 μg ml wax cartridges 150 mg 6 ml were purchased from agilent technologies 2 2 pfoa redistribution in sludge after thp pfoa was added into 300 ml was at preselected concentration levels i e 1 ng l 10 ng l 100 ng l 500 ng l and 1000 ng l and then shaken at speed of 90 rpm at room temperature for 24 h to achieve sorption equilibrium a preliminary study showed that the sorption equilibrium could be obtained within 24 h after 24 h of incubation the equilibrium concentration of pfoa was determined the equilibrized sludge was loaded into a thp reactor model 4540 parr instrument company us then heated to 165 5 ºc and maintained for 30 mins after cooling down to room temperature the concentration of pfoa in the liquid phase was determined again each treatment was conducted in triplicate 2 3 mechanism of pfoa redistribution in sludge after thp 2 3 1 sludge transformations and experiments design based on the transformations observed in the sludge table 1 and text s2 an analytical scheme was designed to unravel the mechanism underlying pfoa redistribution during thp treatment fig 1 briefly experiments were first conducted to identify the respective effects of solid and liquid phase transformations on pfoa redistribution second a hierarchical test was developed to sort out the potential factors from complex sludge transformations for the solid phase the reduction in solids and the change in adsorption capacity were considered as the causes of pfoa redistribution the factors that influence solid adsorption capacity was classified into three categories i e chemical constituents physicochemical status and environmental conditions then the specific transformation under each category was identified for the liquid phase it may influence pfoa redistribution via 1 changing the interactive forces between pfoa and absorbents in solids and 2 retaining pfoa in the liquid phase directly by doms the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution will be explored from the two aspects third analytical methodologies and experiments were designed to evaluate the actual contribution of the specific factors on pfoa redistribution during thp lastly the core chemicals that influenced pfoa distribution in each phase were identified and the mechanism that would alter the interactive force as well as pfoa redistribution was proposed 2 3 2 mechanism underlying the effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 2 3 2 1 effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution this experiment was designed to analyze whether the solid transformations would influence pfoa distribution two series of artificial sludge were prepared for this experiment namely wass wasl and thss wasl solid source liquid source wass wasl was the mixture of was solids and was liquid phase thss wasl was consisted of ths solids and was liquid phase detailed methods to prepare thss wasl are described in text s3 the volatile suspended solids vss of the two series of sludges were controlled in the range of 0 51 16 4 g l at eleven different levels by diluting the solids with wasl or adding concentrated sludge solid s pfoa was then added into each artificial sludge with an initial dosage of 1000 ng l and incubated for 24 h till reaching adsorption equilibrium the sorption capacity of each sludge solid was calculated according to the eq 1 1 c s c o c e m where c o a n d c e are the concentration of pfoa in the liquid phase at the initial and equilibrium point ng l respectively c s is the sludge adsorption capability at equilibrium status ng g m is the sludge vss or tss g l 2 3 2 2 identify core chemicals performing pfoa adsorption in the solid phase when organics were removed from sludge solids negligible pfoa was adsorbed by sludge text s4 and fig s1 this demonstrates that it is the organics rather than inorganics that plays the predominate role in binding with pfoa in the solid phase organics can be mainly divided into four types i e protein polysaccharides humic like substances hs and lipids model chemicals of each type were adopted to investigate their binding capability bovine serum albumin cellulose humic substances and cooking oil were used as model chemicals of protein polysaccharide humic like substance and lipid respectively these model chemicals were immobilized with the same amount 0 3 g in cellulose acetate 6 g beads to test the capability of each in binding with pfoa a modified method as described in text s5 was adopted to prepare the cellulose acetate beads xu et al 2020b 1 gram of each type of beads was added into polypropylene flasks which contained 40 ml 1000 ng l pfoa solution after shaken at 150 rpm for 48 h liquid samples were collected to determine the equilibrium concentration of pfoa the fluorescence quenching method text s6 was further adopted to verify the interaction between the core chemicals and pfoa yan et al 2021 2 3 2 3 contribution of solids physicochemical transformations to pfoa redistribution the functional groups of wass and thss were analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to obtain an overall organics transformation in sludge solids during thp in section 2 3 2 2 proteins were demonstrated as the core chemicals functioning in adsorbing pfoa in solid phase the spatial structure of protein would influence its hydrophilic oleophilic property thereby affect its adsorption capacity toward pfoa the amide i region of the protein spectrum 1700 1600 cm 1 was further extracted to characterize the transformation of protein secondary structure using secondary derivative analysis you et al 2017 details of ftir and secondary derivative analysis can be found in text s7 specific surface area determines the availability of contacting sites between pfoa and core chemicals the specific surface area of sludge was analyzed by micropore analyzer micro meritics company usa the morphology of sludge solid was further visualized using filed emission scanning electron microscope jeol 6340 japan to check the surface transformation of sludge solids zeta potential was measured using zetasizer nano zsp malvern uk each sample was analyzed for fifteen times and the average value was presented 2 3 3 mechanism underlying the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 2 3 3 1 effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution were evaluated with five types of sludge i e was ths and three artificial sludges including wass thsl thss wasl and thss thsl solid source liquid source the artificial sludges were prepared by replacing the liquid phase of sludge with the corresponding supernatant text s3 except ths the vss of all other sludge were adjusted to 3 03 gvss l using concentrated sludge the experiment was conducted using polypropylene flasks with 40 ml working volume pfoa was then added to achieve an initial dosage of 1000 ng l the sludge and pfoa mixture were then shaken at a speed of 80 rpm at room temperature for 24 h till sorption equilibrium ten samples were collected from each type of sludge during the whole adsorption process after filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the filtrate was collected for determining pfoa concentration triplicate experiments were performed for each type of sludge 2 3 3 2 identify key factors of liquid phase transformations relating to pfoa redistribution in sludge the liquid acts as the chemical environment of adsorbent that may affect the adsorption immobilized amount of pfoa by solids the factors that may potentially influence pfoa redistribution include ph chemicals constituents valence status of inorganics ions and molecular weight distribution of organics a series of liquid phase modified was were used to analyze the effects of each type of change in liquid phase on pfoa redistribution the detailed experimental design can be found in text s8 in this experiment hmw doms was identified as the key factors influencing pfoa distribution in sludge a modified sorption desorption hysteresis experiment was adopted to unravel how hmw doms would affect pfoa distribution in sludge carmo et al 2000 pan et al 2007 the detailed experimental procedures are described in text s9 besides a supercooled aqueous solubility reduced freundlich equation was used to fit the data eq 2 and the thermodynamic index of irreversibility tii was adopted to evaluate the sorption desorption hysteresis eq 3 carmo et al 2000 pan et al 2007 2 c b k f o c c i c s c l n 3 t i i f r e u n d l i c h 1 n d e s o r b n s o r b in eq 2 c b is the concentration of bound pfoa ng g c i represents

experiments were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filter first and the filtrate was collected to determine pfoa concentration pfoa bound with solid was extracted using wax spe cartridge agilent us according to manufacturer instruction pfoa was quantified using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry lc ms ms installed with c18 column agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 3 0 50 mm 1 8 μm the limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq and recovery rate of spe are 0 02 ng l 0 1 ng l and 89 75 respectively the details of the analytical procedure and the mass balance of pfoa during spe extraction are described in text s10 3 results and discussion 3 1 redistribution of pfoa in sludge after thermal hydrolysis the redistribution of pfoa was investigated by comparing the abundance of free pfoa in sludge before and after thp as shown in fig 2 the concentration of free pfoa was elevated by 11 7 22 9 at the dosage of 1 ng l 1000 ng l after thp this demonstrates thp treatment led to the dissociation of pfoa from sludge solids mass balance shows that the total amount of pfoa was reduced by 6 4 9 7 after thermal hydrolysis the loss of pfoa was partially attributed to its dissolution in the headspace steam of the thp reactor where concentrated pfoa was detected the other possible reason for the reduction of pfoa concentration could be thermal degradation as the temperature of the liner may surpass the decomposition threshold of 200 during the heating process xiao et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 this study aims to investigate the effects of thp on the physical distribution of pfoa sludge therefore the loss of pfoa will not be discussed in the following content in sludge the distribution of pfoa depends on the interactive forces between pfoa and matters within each phase the following content will separately investigate the mechanisms of solid and liquid phase transformations on pfoa redistribution during sludge thp 3 2 mechanism underlying the effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 3 2 1 effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution the amount of pfoa immobilized in wass wassl and thss wassl was compared to unravel the effects of solid transformation on pfoa redistribution as shown in fig 3 a strong negative correlation was observed between ce and solid mass for both was and ths after thp the tss and vss of sludge reduced from 4 89 g l to 3 16 g l and 3 03 g l to 1 47 g l respectively therefore solid reduction was one of the factors contributing to the elevation of free pfoa during thp besides quantity reduction the adsorption capacity of solids also changed due to the physiochemical transformation of solids induced by thp at the same mass level the concentration of free pfoa in thss wasl was always higher than that of wass wassl and the cs value of thss wasl was lower than that of wass wassl fig 3a and c this demonstrates the adsorption capacity of solids decreased after thp treatment during thp the vss tss ratio of sludge decreased from 0 62 to 0 47 and the loss of organics contributed to more than 95 of the tss reduction moreover negligible amount of pfoa could be immobilized by inorganics in the sludge with the organic portion being removed from the sludge solid text s3 and fig s1 taken together these phenomena demonstrate that organics were the predominant components responsible for binding pfoa and their transformations caused the release of pfoa from sludge solids 3 2 2 identify core chemicals in sludge solids absorbing pfoa as demonstrated in 3 2 1 organics are the predominant components functioning in binding with pfoa thus the core chemicals which are responsible for pfoa adsorption will be selected out from organics in sludge solids organics can be mainly classified into protein polysaccharides lipids and humic substances hs according to fig 4 a the reduction of free pfoa was in the order of protein beads 38 4 hs beads 13 2 lipids beads 11 4 polysaccharides beads 6 3 blank beads 5 8 fig 4a in addition the fluorescence of protein was quenched after introducing pfoa fig 4b and this phenomenon was only observed for protein this demonstrates proteins possess the highest capability in adsorbing pfoa the proteinophilic nature of pfoa maybe due to the dual interaction forces established between its functional groups and proteins specifically the perfluorinated chains of pfoa can establish hydrophobic interactions with the side carbon chain aromatic groups of proteins and its carboxylic head can bind with amide groups of protein via electrostatic interactions pérez et al 2013 sznajder katarzyńska et al 2019 wen et al 2016 in addition proteins account for 50 of organic matters in sludge solid phase therefore proteins are the core chemicals performing pfoa adsorption in sludge solids 3 2 3 contribution of core chemicals transformations to solid adsorption capability sludge solids were characterized with ftir spectrum to obtain an overview about the transforms of organic constituents after thp according to fig 5 a the absorption peaks of wass and thss occurred at the same wavelengths but the intensity of each peak was different between the two types of sludge solids in detail the broad band with a peak at 3276 cm 1 is assigned to the overlapping stretching vibration of oh and nh groups the peak at 1636 cm 1 is attributed to the c o stretching in the amide group or amino group and the peak at 1535 cm 1 is due to the nh bending in the amide group or amino group the strong intensity of these peaks suggests the presence of significant amounts of protein after thermal hydrolysis the intensity of the protein related to these peaks all became weaker which is caused by hydrolysis solubilization and the reduction of nitrogen in the sludge solid after reaction lu et al 2018 xu et al 2020a zhuang et al 2017 moreover the relative abundance of protein in sludge solids reduced by 24 7 after thp table 1 these phenomena indicate the reduction of proteins as well as the functional groups which can form interactive force with pfoa is the major chemical transformation of sludge solid during thp since proteins obtained the highest capability in adsorbing binding with pfoa fig 4a the loss of proteins and functional groups could induce the release of pfoa from sludge solids besides mass reduction protein denaturation may also contribute to pfoa redistribution during thp the information of protein secondary structure was obtained via curve fitting of the amide i band i e 1700 1600 cm 1 onsite the original ftir spectra badireddy et al 2010 yin et al 2015 as shown in fig 5b and c the original amide band of both was and ths could be subdivided into six peaks for both types of sludge when the relative abundance of α helix is high and the random coil 1640 1645 cm 1 and β sheet 1630 1640 cm 1 are low the hydrophobicity of protein will weaken with more hydrophobic sites hidden within the molecule hou et al 2015 in this study the α helix β sheet random coil increased from 0 42 to 0 47 after thermal hydrolysis this change implies the decrease in protein hydrophobicity as well as weakening in hydrophobic interactions between pfoa and sludge solids therefore the changes in spatial structure of protein also account for the elevation of free pfoa 3 2 4 contribution of physical status transformations to solid adsorption capacity surface area and electrostatic potential are critical factors determining the adsorption capability of a sorbent the micrograph clearly exhibited the morphology change of sludge solid after thp fig s2 at low resolution magnification 4000 the surface of the wass was smooth while rougher and cotton like structure formed after thp treatment at high resolution magnification 10 000 wass displayed as integrated plates while thss consisted of cracks with smaller size in consistence with sludge morphology the specific surface area of thss 12 61 m2 g was much higher than that of wass 2 97 m2 g theoretically the surface area is positively correlated with the adsorption capacity of a sorbent however the actual amount of pfoa immobilized by wass was higher than that of thss in this study hence the effects of the enlarged surface area were shuttled by other factors in terms of improving the adsorption capacity of sludge solids for pfoa the electrostatic state of sludge was characterized using zeta potential after thermal hydrolysis the zeta potential of sludge increased from 11 43 to 10 58 table 1 the p k a of pfoa is below 0 5 thus pfoa was always negatively charged in both was ph 6 82 and ths ph 6 43 theoretically the increase of zeta potential would enhance the electrostatic attraction and benefit for pfoa adsorption which however was also opposite to the actual observation thus the transformation of zeta potential was not the contributors to pfoa elevation in the liquid phase either 3 3 mechanism underlying the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 3 3 1 effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution four types of artificial sludge i e wass wassl wass thsl thss wassl thss thsl were prepared to investigate the influence of dom on pfoa redistribution during the initial 20 mins 90 of 1 mg l pfoa was immobilized in both wass wassl and thss wassl while the corresponding value for wass thsl and thss thsl was less than 80 fig 6 in addition the equilibrium concentration of pfoa was 5 higher in sludge with thsl as the liquid phase compared to that of wassl fig 6 this phenomenon suggests that matters in the liquid phase of thsl delayed and or interrupted the adsorption of pfoa by sludge solids the mechanism underlying the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution will be explored via revealing the key factors and forces that retaining pfoa in liquid 3 3 2 identify key transformations occurred in the liquid phase relating to pfoa redistribution effects of dissolved lmw compounds on solid adsorption capacity liquid phase as the environment to host sludge solids may affect pfoa distribution via changing the adsorption capacity of sludge solids ionic condition and ph are important factors regulating the strength of electrostatic forces between pfoa and sludge solids as shown in table 1 the ph decreased from 6 84 to 6 43 and the ionic condition represented by salinity increased from 412 11 mg l to 484 67 mg l the value of ce shows no difference between the control group i e was and the lmw thsl group fig s3 which suggests that the transformations of both ph and ionic condition did not influence the adsorption capacity of sludge solids toward pfoa in contrast by magnifying the variation of each factor it was observed that lower ph and higher concentration of divalent trivalent cations would improve pfoa sorption by sludge solids fig s3 this phenomenon suggests that both ph and ionic condition would potentially influence the distribution of pfoa in sludge however in this study the two factors varied in a very narrow range during thp treatment which did not show a significant impact on pfoa redistribution effects of dissolved hmw compounds on pfoa redistribution the sorption capacity of was solids decreased when the liquid phase of was was replaced by hmw thsl besides the value of ce in sludge containing hmw thsl showed minor difference with that of thsl ρ 0 05 while it was significantly higher than the sludge with lmw thsl ρ 0 05 fig s3 in hmw thsl the main components were the dissolved organic matters i e hmw doms this suggests in the liquid phase hmw doms are the key factors relating to pfoa redistribution during thp the desorption isotherms of pfoa were further constructed to unravel how hmw doms would interrupt the immobilization of pfoa in sludge to avoid clustering only selected desorption curves are presented on the graphs as shown in fig 7 the desorption curve deviated from the sorption curve with a general up left shift in direction in addition the thermodynamic index of irreversibility tii value was in the range of 0 33 0 51 which is much higher than the completely reversible value i e tii 0 this implies that the presence of hmw doms can retain pfoa in the liquid phase fig 7 according to table 1 the hmw doms were mainly consisted of proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances hs to identify the core chemicals in the liquid phase influencing pfoa behavior the desorption study was also performed on the model compounds described previously it is interesting to find that only proteins exhibited strong desorption hysteresis effects despite the amount of dissolved protein is much lower than that of hs and polysaccharides this result is consistent with that of compound bead study where proteins exhibited the highest binding capability with pfoa fig 4a therefore the increase of proteins had contributed to the elevation of pfoa in the liquid phase during thp 4 overview of the factors influencing pfoa redistribution after thp and implication according to calculation text s11 the concentration of pfoa in liquid phase was elevated by 11 7 at dosage of 1000 ng l after thp the solid reduction solid phase transformation and liquid phase transformation accounted for 41 1 39 0 and 19 9 of the redistribution process during thp treatment respectively fig s4 the mechanism of pfoa redistribution induced by thp is concluded as follows first solids solubilization was accompanied with pfoa release during thp second the reduction of proteins and amides which could form electrostatic attraction with the carboxylic head of pfoa weakened the sorption capability of solids for pfoa and also contributed to the elevation of free pfoa third the increase of hmw doms could bind and create static hindrance to retain pfoa in the liquid phase during thp meanwhile other transformations including changes in ph cationic ions specific surface area zeta potential was not attributed to the elevation of free pfoa during thp thermal hydrolysis can greatly increase sludge dewaterability and digestibility thus it has been widely adopted for sludge management during thermal hydrolysis we commonly observed the elevation of pfcs in the liquid phase of sludge the liquid and solid phase of sludge are commonly transferred into different system for further dispose therefore the redistribution of pfcs in sludge will greatly influence their fate as well as ecological safety of the post

14687,perfluorinated compounds pfcs are a group of bio recalcitrant pollutants that remain in waste activated sludge and may subsequently be transferred with sludge to thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp process instead of reduction it is observed previously that the concentration of free pfcs elevated after thp by employing perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa as a representative this study developed a hierarchical scheme to pinpoint the key factors that contribute to free pfoa elevation from the complex sludge transformations according to the results the relative abundance of pfoa in the liquid phase increased by 11 7 22 9 during thp in the solid phase the amide groups reduction and the spatial structure change of proteins weakened the sorption capability of solids for pfoa in the liquid phase the increase of proteins which could bind and form static hindrance to regulate the behavior of pfoa was the main factor to retain pfoa in liquid in contrast other sludge transformations including changes in ph zeta potential ionic condition and specific surface area displayed insignificant impact on the redistribution process the study presents a detailed picture on how sludge transformations would regulate pfcs distribution that ultimately direct the selection of further treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords recalcitrant pollutants

introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps as the receptor for municipal waste and wastewater are the reservoirs and point sources of micropollutants to the environment grandclément et al 2017 of the micropollutants found in wwtps perfluorinated compounds pfcs have attracted intensive concerns in recent years due to their wide application and recalcitrant properties recently thermal hydrolysis has been widely incorporated into the wwtps as a sludge pretreatment step to enhance dewaterability and or biodegradability of wasted activated sludge was barber 2016 lu et al 2020 instead of reduction we commonly observed the increase of free pfcs i e pfoa in the liquid phase after thp in our previous study this would deteriorate the water quality and even threaten the ecological safety of the downstream water when the thp liquid was recycled into the mainstream for denitrification however till now little is known about how thp cause the elevation of free pfcs in treated sludge the distribution of pfcs in sludge is a result of competitive interaction with matters in solid and liquid phases thp treatment would induce complex transformations in both liquid and solid phase of sludge such as changes in total solids ph zeta potential specific surface area dissolved organic constituents ionic condition etc as a result the interactive forces of pfcs with matters in each phase as well as the equilibrium status of pfcs in treated sludge would change accordingly therefore understanding how the interactive forces would change between pfcs and matters in each phase is the key to uncover the mechanism of pfcs redistribution in sludge during thp in the solid phase the abundance of immobilized pfcs relies on two factors i e the mass and adsorption capacity of solids pfcs are characterized with a fully fluorinated hydrophobic alkyl chain attached with one or more hydrophilic head group ledda et al 2018 they can be absorbed by solids via forming hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions within pfcs organics and pfcs charged chemicals respectively kancharla et al 2022 yan et al 2021 it is predictable that pfcs could be released into liquid concurrently with solids solubilization reduction during thp however it remains unclear how thp would alter the adsorption capacity of solids thereby influence the distribution of pfcs in treated sludge in the liquid phase dissolved organic matters doms are reported to influence the behavior of pollutants kothawala et al 2017 during thp the disintegration of solids would greatly elevate the abundance of doms in liquid phase lu et al 2020 while previous studies mainly focused on the overall effects of doms on micropollutants distribution kothawala et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 few studies were about how different fractions of organics would regulate pfcs behavior in the liquid phase in fact the length of carbon chain can influence the intensity of the hydrophobic interaction and the steric hindrance and the charge status is related with the intensity of electrostatic attraction force yan et al 2021 thus the molecular weight and chemical property of doms could also be crucial factors that influence pfcs distribution in the liquid phase perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a typical type of pfcs is widely used in commercial products and industrial processes gupta and saleh 2013 lindstrom et al 2011 the extensive application of pfoa and its precursor perfluorinated chemicals inevitably leads to its environmental release and accumulation in wwtps wang et al 2015 for example the pfoa level in sludge was 23 2 298 ng g dried weight in wwtps in shanghai china wang et al 2015 besides pfoa is highly thermally stable thus it is an ideal representative to study the redistribution of pfcs during thp taking pfoa as a representative this study explored how sludge transformations induced by thp results in the redistribution of pfcs in treated sludge due to the complexity of sludge transformations a hierarchical scheme was developed to sort out potential factors and a series of variable controlled experiments were designed to evaluate the contribution of each factor this study successfully identified the key causes of pfoa redistribution during was thermal hydrolysis and shed light on the mechanism that may ultimately impact the technology selection for was management 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge source and materials waste activated sludge was was collected from a local wastewater treatment plant the basic characteristics and dissolved component constituents of sludge are presented in table 1 detailed methods of performing the basic analysis are described in text s1 standard stock solutions of 13c4 pfoa and pfoa were purchased from wellington laboratories canada with a concentration of 50 μg ml wax cartridges 150 mg 6 ml were purchased from agilent technologies 2 2 pfoa redistribution in sludge after thp pfoa was added into 300 ml was at preselected concentration levels i e 1 ng l 10 ng l 100 ng l 500 ng l and 1000 ng l and then shaken at speed of 90 rpm at room temperature for 24 h to achieve sorption equilibrium a preliminary study showed that the sorption equilibrium could be obtained within 24 h after 24 h of incubation the equilibrium concentration of pfoa was determined the equilibrized sludge was loaded into a thp reactor model 4540 parr instrument company us then heated to 165 5 ºc and maintained for 30 mins after cooling down to room temperature the concentration of pfoa in the liquid phase was determined again each treatment was conducted in triplicate 2 3 mechanism of pfoa redistribution in sludge after thp 2 3 1 sludge transformations and experiments design based on the transformations observed in the sludge table 1 and text s2 an analytical scheme was designed to unravel the mechanism underlying pfoa redistribution during thp treatment fig 1 briefly experiments were first conducted to identify the respective effects of solid and liquid phase transformations on pfoa redistribution second a hierarchical test was developed to sort out the potential factors from complex sludge transformations for the solid phase the reduction in solids and the change in adsorption capacity were considered as the causes of pfoa redistribution the factors that influence solid adsorption capacity was classified into three categories i e chemical constituents physicochemical status and environmental conditions then the specific transformation under each category was identified for the liquid phase it may influence pfoa redistribution via 1 changing the interactive forces between pfoa and absorbents in solids and 2 retaining pfoa in the liquid phase directly by doms the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution will be explored from the two aspects third analytical methodologies and experiments were designed to evaluate the actual contribution of the specific factors on pfoa redistribution during thp lastly the core chemicals that influenced pfoa distribution in each phase were identified and the mechanism that would alter the interactive force as well as pfoa redistribution was proposed 2 3 2 mechanism underlying the effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 2 3 2 1 effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution this experiment was designed to analyze whether the solid transformations would influence pfoa distribution two series of artificial sludge were prepared for this experiment namely wass wasl and thss wasl solid source liquid source wass wasl was the mixture of was solids and was liquid phase thss wasl was consisted of ths solids and was liquid phase detailed methods to prepare thss wasl are described in text s3 the volatile suspended solids vss of the two series of sludges were controlled in the range of 0 51 16 4 g l at eleven different levels by diluting the solids with wasl or adding concentrated sludge solid s pfoa was then added into each artificial sludge with an initial dosage of 1000 ng l and incubated for 24 h till reaching adsorption equilibrium the sorption capacity of each sludge solid was calculated according to the eq 1 1 c s c o c e m where c o a n d c e are the concentration of pfoa in the liquid phase at the initial and equilibrium point ng l respectively c s is the sludge adsorption capability at equilibrium status ng g m is the sludge vss or tss g l 2 3 2 2 identify core chemicals performing pfoa adsorption in the solid phase when organics were removed from sludge solids negligible pfoa was adsorbed by sludge text s4 and fig s1 this demonstrates that it is the organics rather than inorganics that plays the predominate role in binding with pfoa in the solid phase organics can be mainly divided into four types i e protein polysaccharides humic like substances hs and lipids model chemicals of each type were adopted to investigate their binding capability bovine serum albumin cellulose humic substances and cooking oil were used as model chemicals of protein polysaccharide humic like substance and lipid respectively these model chemicals were immobilized with the same amount 0 3 g in cellulose acetate 6 g beads to test the capability of each in binding with pfoa a modified method as described in text s5 was adopted to prepare the cellulose acetate beads xu et al 2020b 1 gram of each type of beads was added into polypropylene flasks which contained 40 ml 1000 ng l pfoa solution after shaken at 150 rpm for 48 h liquid samples were collected to determine the equilibrium concentration of pfoa the fluorescence quenching method text s6 was further adopted to verify the interaction between the core chemicals and pfoa yan et al 2021 2 3 2 3 contribution of solids physicochemical transformations to pfoa redistribution the functional groups of wass and thss were analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to obtain an overall organics transformation in sludge solids during thp in section 2 3 2 2 proteins were demonstrated as the core chemicals functioning in adsorbing pfoa in solid phase the spatial structure of protein would influence its hydrophilic oleophilic property thereby affect its adsorption capacity toward pfoa the amide i region of the protein spectrum 1700 1600 cm 1 was further extracted to characterize the transformation of protein secondary structure using secondary derivative analysis you et al 2017 details of ftir and secondary derivative analysis can be found in text s7 specific surface area determines the availability of contacting sites between pfoa and core chemicals the specific surface area of sludge was analyzed by micropore analyzer micro meritics company usa the morphology of sludge solid was further visualized using filed emission scanning electron microscope jeol 6340 japan to check the surface transformation of sludge solids zeta potential was measured using zetasizer nano zsp malvern uk each sample was analyzed for fifteen times and the average value was presented 2 3 3 mechanism underlying the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 2 3 3 1 effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution were evaluated with five types of sludge i e was ths and three artificial sludges including wass thsl thss wasl and thss thsl solid source liquid source the artificial sludges were prepared by replacing the liquid phase of sludge with the corresponding supernatant text s3 except ths the vss of all other sludge were adjusted to 3 03 gvss l using concentrated sludge the experiment was conducted using polypropylene flasks with 40 ml working volume pfoa was then added to achieve an initial dosage of 1000 ng l the sludge and pfoa mixture were then shaken at a speed of 80 rpm at room temperature for 24 h till sorption equilibrium ten samples were collected from each type of sludge during the whole adsorption process after filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the filtrate was collected for determining pfoa concentration triplicate experiments were performed for each type of sludge 2 3 3 2 identify key factors of liquid phase transformations relating to pfoa redistribution in sludge the liquid acts as the chemical environment of adsorbent that may affect the adsorption immobilized amount of pfoa by solids the factors that may potentially influence pfoa redistribution include ph chemicals constituents valence status of inorganics ions and molecular weight distribution of organics a series of liquid phase modified was were used to analyze the effects of each type of change in liquid phase on pfoa redistribution the detailed experimental design can be found in text s8 in this experiment hmw doms was identified as the key factors influencing pfoa distribution in sludge a modified sorption desorption hysteresis experiment was adopted to unravel how hmw doms would affect pfoa distribution in sludge carmo et al 2000 pan et al 2007 the detailed experimental procedures are described in text s9 besides a supercooled aqueous solubility reduced freundlich equation was used to fit the data eq 2 and the thermodynamic index of irreversibility tii was adopted to evaluate the sorption desorption hysteresis eq 3 carmo et al 2000 pan et al 2007 2 c b k f o c c i c s c l n 3 t i i f r e u n d l i c h 1 n d e s o r b n s o r b in eq 2 c b is the concentration of bound pfoa ng g c i represents

experiments were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filter first and the filtrate was collected to determine pfoa concentration pfoa bound with solid was extracted using wax spe cartridge agilent us according to manufacturer instruction pfoa was quantified using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry lc ms ms installed with c18 column agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 3 0 50 mm 1 8 μm the limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq and recovery rate of spe are 0 02 ng l 0 1 ng l and 89 75 respectively the details of the analytical procedure and the mass balance of pfoa during spe extraction are described in text s10 3 results and discussion 3 1 redistribution of pfoa in sludge after thermal hydrolysis the redistribution of pfoa was investigated by comparing the abundance of free pfoa in sludge before and after thp as shown in fig 2 the concentration of free pfoa was elevated by 11 7 22 9 at the dosage of 1 ng l 1000 ng l after thp this demonstrates thp treatment led to the dissociation of pfoa from sludge solids mass balance shows that the total amount of pfoa was reduced by 6 4 9 7 after thermal hydrolysis the loss of pfoa was partially attributed to its dissolution in the headspace steam of the thp reactor where concentrated pfoa was detected the other possible reason for the reduction of pfoa concentration could be thermal degradation as the temperature of the liner may surpass the decomposition threshold of 200 during the heating process xiao et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 this study aims to investigate the effects of thp on the physical distribution of pfoa sludge therefore the loss of pfoa will not be discussed in the following content in sludge the distribution of pfoa depends on the interactive forces between pfoa and matters within each phase the following content will separately investigate the mechanisms of solid and liquid phase transformations on pfoa redistribution during sludge thp 3 2 mechanism underlying the effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 3 2 1 effects of solid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution the amount of pfoa immobilized in wass wassl and thss wassl was compared to unravel the effects of solid transformation on pfoa redistribution as shown in fig 3 a strong negative correlation was observed between ce and solid mass for both was and ths after thp the tss and vss of sludge reduced from 4 89 g l to 3 16 g l and 3 03 g l to 1 47 g l respectively therefore solid reduction was one of the factors contributing to the elevation of free pfoa during thp besides quantity reduction the adsorption capacity of solids also changed due to the physiochemical transformation of solids induced by thp at the same mass level the concentration of free pfoa in thss wasl was always higher than that of wass wassl and the cs value of thss wasl was lower than that of wass wassl fig 3a and c this demonstrates the adsorption capacity of solids decreased after thp treatment during thp the vss tss ratio of sludge decreased from 0 62 to 0 47 and the loss of organics contributed to more than 95 of the tss reduction moreover negligible amount of pfoa could be immobilized by inorganics in the sludge with the organic portion being removed from the sludge solid text s3 and fig s1 taken together these phenomena demonstrate that organics were the predominant components responsible for binding pfoa and their transformations caused the release of pfoa from sludge solids 3 2 2 identify core chemicals in sludge solids absorbing pfoa as demonstrated in 3 2 1 organics are the predominant components functioning in binding with pfoa thus the core chemicals which are responsible for pfoa adsorption will be selected out from organics in sludge solids organics can be mainly classified into protein polysaccharides lipids and humic substances hs according to fig 4 a the reduction of free pfoa was in the order of protein beads 38 4 hs beads 13 2 lipids beads 11 4 polysaccharides beads 6 3 blank beads 5 8 fig 4a in addition the fluorescence of protein was quenched after introducing pfoa fig 4b and this phenomenon was only observed for protein this demonstrates proteins possess the highest capability in adsorbing pfoa the proteinophilic nature of pfoa maybe due to the dual interaction forces established between its functional groups and proteins specifically the perfluorinated chains of pfoa can establish hydrophobic interactions with the side carbon chain aromatic groups of proteins and its carboxylic head can bind with amide groups of protein via electrostatic interactions pérez et al 2013 sznajder katarzyńska et al 2019 wen et al 2016 in addition proteins account for 50 of organic matters in sludge solid phase therefore proteins are the core chemicals performing pfoa adsorption in sludge solids 3 2 3 contribution of core chemicals transformations to solid adsorption capability sludge solids were characterized with ftir spectrum to obtain an overview about the transforms of organic constituents after thp according to fig 5 a the absorption peaks of wass and thss occurred at the same wavelengths but the intensity of each peak was different between the two types of sludge solids in detail the broad band with a peak at 3276 cm 1 is assigned to the overlapping stretching vibration of oh and nh groups the peak at 1636 cm 1 is attributed to the c o stretching in the amide group or amino group and the peak at 1535 cm 1 is due to the nh bending in the amide group or amino group the strong intensity of these peaks suggests the presence of significant amounts of protein after thermal hydrolysis the intensity of the protein related to these peaks all became weaker which is caused by hydrolysis solubilization and the reduction of nitrogen in the sludge solid after reaction lu et al 2018 xu et al 2020a zhuang et al 2017 moreover the relative abundance of protein in sludge solids reduced by 24 7 after thp table 1 these phenomena indicate the reduction of proteins as well as the functional groups which can form interactive force with pfoa is the major chemical transformation of sludge solid during thp since proteins obtained the highest capability in adsorbing binding with pfoa fig 4a the loss of proteins and functional groups could induce the release of pfoa from sludge solids besides mass reduction protein denaturation may also contribute to pfoa redistribution during thp the information of protein secondary structure was obtained via curve fitting of the amide i band i e 1700 1600 cm 1 onsite the original ftir spectra badireddy et al 2010 yin et al 2015 as shown in fig 5b and c the original amide band of both was and ths could be subdivided into six peaks for both types of sludge when the relative abundance of α helix is high and the random coil 1640 1645 cm 1 and β sheet 1630 1640 cm 1 are low the hydrophobicity of protein will weaken with more hydrophobic sites hidden within the molecule hou et al 2015 in this study the α helix β sheet random coil increased from 0 42 to 0 47 after thermal hydrolysis this change implies the decrease in protein hydrophobicity as well as weakening in hydrophobic interactions between pfoa and sludge solids therefore the changes in spatial structure of protein also account for the elevation of free pfoa 3 2 4 contribution of physical status transformations to solid adsorption capacity surface area and electrostatic potential are critical factors determining the adsorption capability of a sorbent the micrograph clearly exhibited the morphology change of sludge solid after thp fig s2 at low resolution magnification 4000 the surface of the wass was smooth while rougher and cotton like structure formed after thp treatment at high resolution magnification 10 000 wass displayed as integrated plates while thss consisted of cracks with smaller size in consistence with sludge morphology the specific surface area of thss 12 61 m2 g was much higher than that of wass 2 97 m2 g theoretically the surface area is positively correlated with the adsorption capacity of a sorbent however the actual amount of pfoa immobilized by wass was higher than that of thss in this study hence the effects of the enlarged surface area were shuttled by other factors in terms of improving the adsorption capacity of sludge solids for pfoa the electrostatic state of sludge was characterized using zeta potential after thermal hydrolysis the zeta potential of sludge increased from 11 43 to 10 58 table 1 the p k a of pfoa is below 0 5 thus pfoa was always negatively charged in both was ph 6 82 and ths ph 6 43 theoretically the increase of zeta potential would enhance the electrostatic attraction and benefit for pfoa adsorption which however was also opposite to the actual observation thus the transformation of zeta potential was not the contributors to pfoa elevation in the liquid phase either 3 3 mechanism underlying the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution 3 3 1 effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution four types of artificial sludge i e wass wassl wass thsl thss wassl thss thsl were prepared to investigate the influence of dom on pfoa redistribution during the initial 20 mins 90 of 1 mg l pfoa was immobilized in both wass wassl and thss wassl while the corresponding value for wass thsl and thss thsl was less than 80 fig 6 in addition the equilibrium concentration of pfoa was 5 higher in sludge with thsl as the liquid phase compared to that of wassl fig 6 this phenomenon suggests that matters in the liquid phase of thsl delayed and or interrupted the adsorption of pfoa by sludge solids the mechanism underlying the effects of liquid phase transformation on pfoa redistribution will be explored via revealing the key factors and forces that retaining pfoa in liquid 3 3 2 identify key transformations occurred in the liquid phase relating to pfoa redistribution effects of dissolved lmw compounds on solid adsorption capacity liquid phase as the environment to host sludge solids may affect pfoa distribution via changing the adsorption capacity of sludge solids ionic condition and ph are important factors regulating the strength of electrostatic forces between pfoa and sludge solids as shown in table 1 the ph decreased from 6 84 to 6 43 and the ionic condition represented by salinity increased from 412 11 mg l to 484 67 mg l the value of ce shows no difference between the control group i e was and the lmw thsl group fig s3 which suggests that the transformations of both ph and ionic condition did not influence the adsorption capacity of sludge solids toward pfoa in contrast by magnifying the variation of each factor it was observed that lower ph and higher concentration of divalent trivalent cations would improve pfoa sorption by sludge solids fig s3 this phenomenon suggests that both ph and ionic condition would potentially influence the distribution of pfoa in sludge however in this study the two factors varied in a very narrow range during thp treatment which did not show a significant impact on pfoa redistribution effects of dissolved hmw compounds on pfoa redistribution the sorption capacity of was solids decreased when the liquid phase of was was replaced by hmw thsl besides the value of ce in sludge containing hmw thsl showed minor difference with that of thsl ρ 0 05 while it was significantly higher than the sludge with lmw thsl ρ 0 05 fig s3 in hmw thsl the main components were the dissolved organic matters i e hmw doms this suggests in the liquid phase hmw doms are the key factors relating to pfoa redistribution during thp the desorption isotherms of pfoa were further constructed to unravel how hmw doms would interrupt the immobilization of pfoa in sludge to avoid clustering only selected desorption curves are presented on the graphs as shown in fig 7 the desorption curve deviated from the sorption curve with a general up left shift in direction in addition the thermodynamic index of irreversibility tii value was in the range of 0 33 0 51 which is much higher than the completely reversible value i e tii 0 this implies that the presence of hmw doms can retain pfoa in the liquid phase fig 7 according to table 1 the hmw doms were mainly consisted of proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances hs to identify the core chemicals in the liquid phase influencing pfoa behavior the desorption study was also performed on the model compounds described previously it is interesting to find that only proteins exhibited strong desorption hysteresis effects despite the amount of dissolved protein is much lower than that of hs and polysaccharides this result is consistent with that of compound bead study where proteins exhibited the highest binding capability with pfoa fig 4a therefore the increase of proteins had contributed to the elevation of pfoa in the liquid phase during thp 4 overview of the factors influencing pfoa redistribution after thp and implication according to calculation text s11 the concentration of pfoa in liquid phase was elevated by 11 7 at dosage of 1000 ng l after thp the solid reduction solid phase transformation and liquid phase transformation accounted for 41 1 39 0 and 19 9 of the redistribution process during thp treatment respectively fig s4 the mechanism of pfoa redistribution induced by thp is concluded as follows first solids solubilization was accompanied with pfoa release during thp second the reduction of proteins and amides which could form electrostatic attraction with the carboxylic head of pfoa weakened the sorption capability of solids for pfoa and also contributed to the elevation of free pfoa third the increase of hmw doms could bind and create static hindrance to retain pfoa in the liquid phase during thp meanwhile other transformations including changes in ph cationic ions specific surface area zeta potential was not attributed to the elevation of free pfoa during thp thermal hydrolysis can greatly increase sludge dewaterability and digestibility thus it has been widely adopted for sludge management during thermal hydrolysis we commonly observed the elevation of pfcs in the liquid phase of sludge the liquid and solid phase of sludge are commonly transferred into different system for further dispose therefore the redistribution of pfcs in sludge will greatly influence their fate as well as ecological safety of the post treatment process this study evaluated the distribution of pfoa in each phase of sludge before and after thp treatment identified the key factors effecting the redistribution at the molecular level and presented a full picture of the mechanism behind thp treatment associated pfoa redistribution the analytical scheme considered all possible transformations that would occur during pre treatments and is applicable to other sludge pre treatment technologies as well in application it would provide methodological reference to forecast the partition of recalcitrant pollutants in was treatment process and direct the selection of sludge treatment technology 5 conclusions employing pfoa as model compound this study investigated the effects of sludge solubilization on pfcs redistribution during thp it was found that thp would lead to the elevation of pfoa in the liquid phase a hierarchical scheme and a series of experiments were developed to unravel the mechanism of pfoa redistribution during thp proteins were demonstrated as the key chemicals responsible for binding and regulating the distribution of pfoa in sludge during thp the reduction of mass amide groups and the spatial structure transformations of protein in the solid phase weakened the sorption capability of sludge solid for pfoa in the liquid phase the increased content of dissolved protein effectively bound and retained pfoa in liquid this study provides a methodological reference for analyzing the distribution of recalcitrant pollutants in sludge and unravels the redistribution mechanism of the

14688,accurate resilience evaluation for water distribution systems generally requires all nodes hydraulic data which are usually obtained from a well calibrated hydraulic model however in reality few utilities maintain a workable hydraulic model making the resilience evaluation far more from practicability under this condition whether resilience evaluation can be realized based on a small amount of monitoring nodes is still a research gap therefore this paper investigates the possibility of accurate resilience evaluation using partial nodes by answering two problems 1 whether the importance of nodes differs in resilience evaluation 2 what proportion of nodes are indispensable in resilience evaluation accordingly the gini index of nodes importance and the error distribution of partial node resilience evaluation are computed and analyzed a database including 192 networks is used results show that the importance of nodes in the resilience evaluation varies the gini index of nodes importance is 0 604 0 106 the proportion of nodes that meet the accuracy requirement of resilience evaluation is 6 5 2 further analysis shows that the importance of nodes is determined by the transmission efficiency between water sources and consumption nodes and the degree of a node s influence on other nodes the optimal proportion of required nodes is controlled by a network s centralization centrality and efficiency these results show that accurate resilience evaluation using partial nodes hydraulic data is feasible and provide some basis for the resilience evaluation

classified into two categories 1 simulation based and 2 graph based measures simulation based approaches are the most commonly utilized method hydraulic model of a wdn is necessary for a simulation based measure gheisi et al 2016 shuang et al 2019 a graph based measure which is an experience based technique using intuitive judgment is the shortcut to quickly produce initial resilience profile meng et al 2018 the reason is that there is a relationship between structural features and performance of wdns torres et al 2017 the structure and connectivity e g redundancy and robustness of wdns affect their resilience pagano et al 2019 the simulation based measure can obtain a comprehensive understanding of a wdn s resilience but it is computationally intensive and has been highly dependent on all nodes hydraulic data assad and bouferguene 2022 since it is not possible to monitor every node in a real world in operation wdn the hydraulic data of all nodes is usually generated by a hydraulic model due to the difficulty and high cost in modeling most water utilities do not have access to well calibrated high precision models especially for large complex wdns despite the large amount of monitoring data zhou et al 2022 the simulation data dependent limits the application of the simulation based measure in the realistic wdns the graph based measure is less dependent on hydraulic information of a network and more computationally efficient overcoming the disadvantages of the simulation based approach anchieta et al 2023 herrera et al 2016 li et al 2023 pagano et al 2019 however primitive topological metrics such as connectivity average node degree robustness spectral gap redundancy clustering coefficient and efficiency average shortest path length etc can only obtain a profile of resilience torres et al 2017 the graph based measure may be regarded as a relatively quick to implement precursor to more detailed analyses but is far from sufficient for a comprehensive assessment of resilience yazdani et al 2011 the graph based measure emphasizes the structure of wdn rather than its function different levels of functional performance may be achieved through similar structures of wdn thus it can be misleading to use topological attribute metrics as surrogate resilience indicators in the design of wdns although lorenz et al 2021b and herrera et al 2016 improved graph based measures by incorporating node demands in the topological resilience index topological characteristics may not be fully representative of hydraulic performances and pipe failure impacts pagano et al 2019 therefore the graph theory based approach is also difficult to meet the needs of the actual wdn for resilience evaluation the simulation based measure is highly data dependent and or requires extensive computational resources and graph based measures have difficulty satisfying the need for the accuracy of resilience evaluation it is found that the hydraulic properties of some critical nodes in wdns can represent the resilience of wdn to mechanical failure prasad and park 2004 atkinson et al 2014 and palod et al 2022 tried to evaluate resilience by using the surplus head of a critical node and proposed a metric named minimum surplus head msh the msh metric reduces the reliance on the full node data obtained from the simulation model but it does not deal well with mechanical failures and needs to be used as an additional measure to achieve satisfactory evaluation performance in fact the use of hydraulic data from some nodes rather than all nodes for resilience evaluation has great practical value as it does not require an accurate hydraulic model of wdns the hydraulic data from partial nodes needed for evaluation can be obtained through monitoring however to the best knowledge of the authors no studies have confirmed this possibility of resilience evaluation for wdn based on partial nodes hydraulic information to prove whether an accurate evaluation of resilience by partial nodes can be achieved or not there are two issues to be resolved first is it theoretically feasible to fill this research gap it is necessary to demonstrate whether there is a significant difference in the importance of all nodes in a wdn additionally the underlying mechanisms of node importance i e the correlation between the node level properties hydraulic and topological and the importance of nodes should be investigated second is it practically feasible answering this problem necessitates investigating the optimal proportion of required nodes oprn for evaluating resilience only a significantly small oprn can reduce the data requirements while remaining operationally practicable correlation analysis also needs to be utilized to investigate its mechanisms i e the correlation between network features hydraulic and topological and oprn accordingly this paper proposes a comprehensive analysis framework for exploring the possibility of accurate resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information the specific objectives of the present study are 1 revealing node importance variation of wdns and its mechanism 2 exploring the oprn of wdns and its mechanism and 3 discussing prospects of this research which provide insights for estimates oprn select suitable monitoring nodes and construct topology metrics to describe wdn the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the method used in this paper section 3 presents and discusses the results of the research section 4 provides prospects of the research finally section 5 draws conclusions 2 methodology the proposed framework fig 1 consists of three parts 1 construction of network dataset and pre analysis in this part a dataset containing 12 baseline networks and 180 network variants is constructed to represent the high variability in attributes of wdns the resilience and network level topological attributes are pre analysis to determine whether it is suitably representative 2 evaluation of difference in node importance the part consists of three modules assessing the node importance analyzing the node level attributes and investigating the mechanisms of node importance to justify the theoretical possibility of the proposed resilience evaluation method 3 exploration of the optimal proportion of required nodes the part consists of three modules determining the optimal proportion of required nodes oprn analyzing the network level attributes and investigating the mechanisms of oprn 2 1 construction of network dataset and pre analysis 2 1 1 construction of dataset to reach a generalized conclusion the size of the wdns database used in the study needs to be sufficient to explore the response mechanism of networks with different functions and structures 12 benchmark networks with various sizes that have appeared in the previous literature hernandez et al 2016 are collected the dimensions of the baseline networks are listed in s4 table s1 the resilience of wdn is often enhanced or and improved by adding redundancy to the network hickford et al 2018 liu and song 2020 by performing an analysis of network variants by pipe addition insights can be gained on the appropriateness of resilience evaluation by partial nodes in the wdn after pipe rehabilitation extension meng et al 2018 to generate a network variant by the model two nodes are randomly chosen in the network and a pipe is added if it does not intersect with other pipes in the network this procedure is repeated until the given number of pipes to be added is reached the number of additional pipes is 1 2 3 4 and 5 of the total number of pipes three different scenarios are generated for each determined number of additional pipes such that each baseline network generates 15 network variants a total of 180 network variants are generated the length of the added pipe is determined by the spatial distance of the nodes and the h w coefficient is a fixed value i e 130 the variable needed to be optimized is only the pipe diameter in the network in the study the modified resilience index mri is used as a metric for resilience evaluation eq 1 in text the mri index can be used to compare different variants of the same network but it remains to be studied whether different networks can be compared therefore the networks in the dataset need to be optimized using resilience metric and cost to ensure that the resilience of networks from the same baseline network is at the same level this means that a network and its variants have the same or similar mri values comparing the performance of various optimization algorithms in the literature the researchers argue that no single algorithm outperforms the others regardless of the conditions and that overall the non dominated ranking genetic algorithm ii nsga ii with minimal parameter tuning remains a good choice as it usually performs best in all problems wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 in this study nsga ii is used as the optimization algorithm and the betweenness centrality of the pipe bc is used as an estimate of the pipe flow to optimize the efficiency of the nsga ii sitzenfrei et al 2020 2021 more specifically the bc values count how often an edge k is a part of the shortest paths between all pairs source node and consumption node the pipe with higher bc is set to a larger diameter the direction and the probability of mutation and crossover are optimized by setting the probability for the diameter of each pipe based on bc 2 1 2 resilience measure the main idea of the simulation based approach is as follows first the global properties of wdn are obtained by aggregating the hydraulic properties of all nodes second the resilience index is designed with global properties the resilience index ri proposed by todini 2000 firstly aggregates the minimum required power ereq input power ein and surplus power esur of the nodes secondly the resilience index is designed as e r e q e i n e s u r the idea of partial node resilience evaluation is to obtain the global properties of wdn by aggregating the hydraulic properties of partial nodes modified resilience index mri is a more common resilience evaluation index which has the advantage that ignoring the input power of the system and overcomes the disadvantage that ri cannot deal with multi source wdn and can be easily extended to evaluate the resilience using partial nodes zhang et al 2022 the mri is defined as the ratio of the surplus power of nodes to the minimum required power at the demand node jayaram and srinivasan 2008 it can be written as 1 mr i s y s i s y s q r e q i h a v a i h r e q i i s y s q r e q i h r e q i where q r e q i is the required demand at node i h a v a i and h r e q i are the available and minimum required head at node i mr i s y s is the resilience index evaluated by all demand nodes in system s y s is the set contains of all demand nodes in wdn similarly the resilience evaluation using partial nodes is performed in eq 2 2 mri par pn i par q req i h ava i h req i i par q req i h req i where par is the subset of partial nodes from set sys pn is the node number ratio of par set to sys set mri par pn is the resilience index evaluated by hydraulic data of partial node the resilience evaluation using the hydraulic modeling platform epanet2 based on the pressure driven hydraulic model rossman 2002 the required demand of node i is specified for each consumption node of the baseline networks and the network variants and the node available demand meets the required demand when the nodal pressure is higher than the minimum required pressure p req and the node available demand is 0 when the nodal pressure is lower than p req otherwise the node available demand is range between 0 and q req i in the research the value of p req is set as 10 m the brief descriptions of hydraulic model are provided in section s1 of the supporting information 2 1 3 graphs generalized from wdn topological attributes of wdns are characterized by measures from graph theory which have been used to analyze the structure and function of wdns hwang and lansey 2017 meng et al 2018 a wdn is represented as a graph with nodes i e connection points of water sources customers and edges i e pipes pumps valves etc of the wdn the graph is mathematically expressed as g v e where v and e represent the set of nodes and edges respectively the adjacency matrix of graph represents the pairwise relationships between node pairs and edges the adjacency matrix is the basis for computing topological attributes and the details on the method used to construct the adjacency matrix can be found in s1 an undirected and unweighted graph is the most used generalization of wdns and the required data on the connectivity of nodes is the easiest to obtain meng et al 2018 a weighted and directed graph that includes information of node and edge weights as well as direction can be used to represent wdns in more detail meng et al 2018 wu and baker 2020 but information of edge direction and weight node weight and others is difficult to collect harpaz et al 2022 for example the undirected and unweighted graph contains information on the relationship between nodes and pipes and the directed graph adds information on the flow direction of pipes the edge weight represents the physical properties of connections such as pipe segments or pumps see table 1 to describe the property of the nodes the weights of nodes are also set based on demand information giustolisi et al 2020 guidotti et al 2017 thus a wdn can form in 6 types of graphs as shown in table 1 which see s1 for more detailed information the 6 types of graphs can be arranged into three classes based on the estimated availability of required data used to construct graph 2 2 evaluation of difference in node importance the main work of this subsection is to analyze the importance of node in the evaluation of resilience from a hydrodynamic point of view in order to analyze the factors affecting the importance of node the node levels attributes are calculated 2 2 1 node importance and sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is one of the most important measures to evaluate the importance of variables saltelli et al 2010 if a sensitivity metric is used to rank model inputs according to their impact on model outputs it is called an importance metric borgonovo and plischke 2016 numerous works have been achieved using sensitivity analysis to identify important components of the system and to evaluate the importance of the system s input variables iooss and lemaître 2015 mr i s y s can be regarded as a function with the required demand of node as the independent variable the interaction relationship of node may affect the resilience of wdn hence the global sensitivity analysis of resilience is chosen for analyzing the influence of nodes on wdn s resilience because the technique can provide detailed description of how individual nodes and their interactions impact resilience of wdn fu et al 2012 huzsvar et al 2020 the global sensitivity coefficient st represents the importance of node the approach proposed by sobol 2001 has demonstrated excellent performance in analyzing the sensitivity of components in wdn the computational cost of the original sa is quite expensive due to the increasing dimensionality saltelli 2002 and saltelli et al 2010 established a new strategy to save computational costs using sobol quasi random sequences in the sa analysis of this study the network resilience is the dependent variable and the node required demand is the independent variable sobol quasi random sequences about q r e q are generated by sampling the distribution of the independent variable q r e q in the sa analysis the hydraulic simulations are performed on each sample of sequence it is assumed that q r e q of the node obeys a normal distribution with a mean of q r e q and a standard deviation of 0 1 q r e q the sensitivity toolkit developed by herman and usher 2017 based on python which includes the sa is used in this paper 2 2 2 node level attribute assessment hydraulic attributes the available power e a v a at each node consist of 2 parts the minimum required power e r e q and the surplus power e s u r q r e q q r e q 1 q r e q 2 q r e q i q r e q n e e 1 e 2 e i e n h r e q h r e q 1 h r e q 2 h r e q i h r e q n h a v a h a v a 1 h a v a 2 h a v a i h a v a n denote the required demand elevation minimum required head and available head at each node respectively define e a v a e r e q e s u r and h s u r as 3 e a v a i q r e q i h a v a i 4 e s u r i q r e q i h a v a i h r e q i 5 e r e q q r e q i e i h r e q i 6 h s u r i h a v a i h r e q i all hydraulic attributes are simulated under normal conditions using a pressure driven model currently the pressure at each node satisfies the minimum required pressure and the required demand at each node equals the available demand q r e q i q a v a i topological attribute node level topological metrics are measures designed to determine the roles of different nodes in the structure of a network according to the literature review lü et al 2016 4 node level topological attributes neighborhood based path to junction based path to source based and iterative refinement centralities are assessed as topological properties of node a brief description of the topological metrics used in this study is listed in table 2 detailed information on attribute definitions and calculation methods is shown in s2 1 the node type and associated hydraulic attributes are one of the most important features to investigate node and entire network topological properties especially for the indicators based on the shortest path yazdani and jeffrey 2012b the shortest path length measures the efficiency of information exchanged meng et al 2018 it has been found that the shortest path length from source node to consumption node has a fundamental interrelation with hydraulic properties such as energy dissipation sitzenfrei et al 2020 the shortest path length between a pair of consumption nodes describes the impact of changes in hydraulic conditions at the node on the other nodes therefore these two types of indicators should be calculated separately wu and baker 2020 it is generally accepted that the shortest path is the most applicable metric for describing water flow paths topologically sitzenfrei et al 2020 however the nodes do not satisfy energy conservation if the water flows only among the shortest path for example some of the pipes locating at longer paths may have no water flowing through them which is inconsistent with the properties of hydraulics lorenz et al 2021a therefore the k shortest path length is also calculated in this paper newman 2001 proposed to adopt the reciprocal of weights to extend closeness centrality where the weights in the network represent the operationalizations of link strength rather than their costs in this study the weight of the network represents the cost energy consumption and the definition by newman 2001 can represent the longest transmission path therefore this definition is adopted in this study as a result the indicators used in this study provide a more comprehensive characterization of possible transmission paths of water flow the betweenness of node generally refers to the number of shortest paths through the node as mentioned earlier non shortest paths also contribute to water transport the random walk betweenness centrality counts all paths in networks and gives more weight to the shortest one newman 2005 the random walk betweenness centrality is also calculated in this paper the two node level metrics that are determined in the analysis to be most useful are defined as follows demand weighted shortest path length to junction l wj a dimensionless weighting based on the node required demand is incorporated into the definition of shortest path length to junction and it is proposed as follows 7 l wj i 1 n cn j cn j i d v i v j w n j j cn j i w n j where d v i v j is the shortest path length also called geodesic distance from node i to node j w n j is the weight of the node j the set of all consumption nodes and source nodes are donated as c n s n respectively n c n n s n are their respective numbers demand weighted shortest path length to source l ws a dimensionless weighting based on the node required demand is incorporated into the definition of the shortest path length to the source and it is proposed as follows 8 l ws i min j sn d v j v i w n i i cn j i w n i and following the same arguments as before 2 3 exploration of optimal proportion of nodes in this subsection optimal proportion of required nodes for wdns to satisfy the need for resilience evaluation is analyzed to analyze the attributes affecting the proportion the network level attributes are calculated 2 3 1 optimal proportion of nodes the error of the resilience evaluated by partial nodes error can be evaluated based on mean absolute percentage error as shown in the following equation 9 e r r o r p n i mr i s y s mr i p a r p n i mr i s y s a genetic algorithm ga is used to search p a r that minimizes e r r o r p n when the ratio of nodes used for resilience evaluation to all nodes is p n i the analysis of the e r r o r p n distribution curve is carried out according to the following steps step i carry out a hydraulic simulation to obtain pressure and water consumption data for each node step ii set the ratio of partial nodes to all consumption nodes as p n i p n i starts from 1 n n is the total number of consumption nodes and search the set of nodes that minimizes e r r o r p n using the ga when running the ga a certain number of special individuals are guaranteed to exist in the population the first p n i δ p n genes of the special individuals are the same as the set of nodes that minimized e r r o r p n i 1 obtained in the previous cycle and only the last δpn genes undergo crossover and variation step iii if p n i 1 then set p n i 1 p n i δ p n and repeat step ii if p n i 1 then end for the network with a large number of nodes a larger step size δ p n is set to obtain the error distribution curve shown in fig 1 the error in resilience evaluation is controlled by the number of nodes participating in the evaluation obviously oprn is closely related to the specified maximal margin of error which is set as 5 in this paper while the error is less than 5 the accuracy of m r i p a r meets the requirements of stakeholders and pn is the optimal proportion of required nodes oprn 2 3 2 network level attribute assessment hydraulic attribute the hydraulic properties of the network are the statistical indicators of the above mentioned node level properties including standard deviation mean and extreme values in addition some hybrid statistical indicators are designed for reflecting the hydraulic properties of the network noted that eq 9 can be rewritten as e r r o r p n i mr i s y s mr i p a r p n i mr i s y s 1 j p a r q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j j s y s q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j j p a r q r e q j h r e q j j s y s q r e q j h r e q j if donate r e s u r j q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j j s y s q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j r e r e q j q r e q j h r e q j i s y s q r e q j h r e q j then 10 e r r o r p n i 1 1 f n s j 1 f n s r e s u r j 1 f n s j 1 f n s r e r e q j where f n s is the node number of set p a r j represent node j according to eq 10 e r r o r p n i is positively related to the number of nodes to ensure an accurate estimation of the mean value of r e s u r and r e r e q then oprn is determined by the minimum size of samples to estimate the mean value of r e s u r and r e r e q it is important to note that the data of r e s u r and r e r e q occur in pairs according to the sampling method of paired data brase and brase 2017 the minimum sample size n of the paired data is usually estimated by z c σ e 2 where e is specified maximal margin of error σ is population standard deviation and z c is critical value from the normal distribution for the desired confidence level c accordingly a statistic variable d is designed and d i r e s u r i r e r e q i then the ratio of the required sample size to estimate the mean value of variable d to the population number is 11 i d 1 n c z α σ d e c t r l 2 where σ d denotes the standard deviation of d and e c t r l m i n 1 r e s u r r e r e q and z α is critical value from the normal distribution for the desired confidence level c e g 1 645 at a confidence level of 90 i d is set as the first hybrid statistical indicator which represents the minimum proportion of nodes to estimate e r r o r p n i σ p s σ p r represent the standard deviation of r e s u r r e r e q respectively which are set as the second and third hybrid statistical indicators topological attribute as mentioned above 6 types of graphs as the basis for analysis of topological attributes are listed in table 3 according to the literature review giudicianni et al 2018 meng et al 2018 7 attributes robustness modularity efficiency assortativity connectivity centralization and centrality are assessed as key topological properties of the network each of these attributes is described using one or more metrics detailed definitions of each specific metric are provided in s3 2 to fully describe the topological characteristics of wdns the topological metrics which are popular in the literature are calculated and others based on domain specific features of wdns are formulated the two network level metrics that are determined in the analysis to be most useful are defined as follows centralization centralization is the degree of variance of node centrality in a network which describe the node s differences in centrality measure the centralization which is donated as s p t is defined as following wasserman and faust 1994 12 s p t i c n p t i p t i 2 n c n where s p t represent network level centralization measure p t i represent the node level measure of node i based on the path to node type t source node is s consumption node is j other parameters are described previously efficiency the network level measure of efficiency is defined by the mean value of node level efficiency the network level measure donated p t is defined as 13 p t 1 n i c n p t i where p t i represents the node level topological measures based on the path to node type t if the node type is source node then n n s n n c n if the node type is consumption node n n c n 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre analysis of wdn in this section a network dataset is described the resilience and topological properties i e average degree and average shortest path length of networks in the dataset are pre analyzed 3 1 1 resilience of wdn in fig 2 the change in the mri of the optimized network as a certain percentage of added pipe is analyzed mri does not change significantly less than 4 with the increase of the number of added pipes this indicates that the optimized network variants can maintain a similar level of resilience to the baseline network providing a baseline for future analysis however there is a significant improvement in the efficiency decreases in average shortest path length fig 2c and connectivity increases in average degree fig 2b of the network when the number of added pipes increases this indicates that the mri metric has no significant correlation with the efficiency connectivity of an unweighted and undirected graph topological metrics such as efficiency cannot fully replace simulation based metrics in evaluating resilience in order to reduce the reliance on simulated data for evaluating resilience using a subset of all nodes to evaluate resilience is a more promising approach than topological surrogate metrics 3 1 2 topological attribute a pre analysis of the network level topological attributes of networks is performed in this subsection the average degree and the average shortest path length of networks are shown in fig 2b and c the distribution of other network level topological attributes are detailed in s5 the average degree of networks fell within a range 2 04 3 77 as the number of added pipes increases the average degree increases for example the average degree of the baseline networks without added pipe is 2 62 which is 3 25 of networks added 5 pipes although the average degree changes with the number of added pipes it is similar to that investigated in the literature giudicianni et al 2018 wéber et al 2020 yazdani and jeffrey 2012a the structure of the wdn is typically ranging between a simple tree network with average node degree of more than two and a two dimensional regular grid with average node degree of less than 4 yazdani and jeffrey 2012a the average degree is able to equalize distribution of flow and pressure under varying demands yazdani et al 2011 the increase in degree of network variants indicates that adding pipes significantly increases the existence of multiple paths resulting in a more uniform flow and pressure in wdn pagano et al 2019 the average shortest path refers to the average shortest path to the water source fig 2 the average shortest path length is 5 76 2 96 with a range of variation 2 58 20 27 as the number of added pipes increases the average shortest path length decreases the average shortest path length provides a view of reachability and efficiency in wdn water transport to some extent yazdani et al 2011 the change of average shortest path length suggests that increasing the number of added pipes can effectively improve the efficiency of the network pre analysis of the topological properties of wdns shows that the network in the database is topologically similar to the realistic network 3 2 analysis of node importance in resilience evaluation 3 2 1 difference of nodes importance the st values of nodes which donate the global sensitivity index of node reflect node importance in the resilience assessment the nodes are ranked by st and st cumulative curve is plotted in fig 3a the st cumulative curve shows that the nodes have a highly uneven distribution of st most nodes have low importance and coexist with a few nodes with high importance inequalities in the distribution of st among the nodes of the wdn can be quantified consistently by evaluating the gini coefficient of the cumulative curve the gini coefficient can be defined as the ratio of the area that lies between the line at 45 and the cumulative curve marked as a over the total area under the line at 45 marked a and b in the diagram i e gini coefficient equal to a a b huang et al 2023 gini coefficient ranges from zero to one zero means absolutely equal while one means completely unequal and a larger value means more inequality huang et al 2023 as shown in fig 3b the gini coefficient is 0 604 0 106 this indicates an unequal distribution of node s st this finding provides a basis for evaluating the resilience via the hydraulic attribute of the partial nodes 3 2 2 mechanisms to node importance the factors controlling the importance of the nodes are analyzed in two ways 1 the hydraulic attributes and 2 the topological attributes the attributes controlling the importance of nodes are analyzed by calculating the correlation between the node level hydraulic attributes or topological attributes and st of the node the significance of correlations is quantified by spearman correlation analysis because node level attributes are not necessarily linearly correlated with the importance of the nodes the spearman correlation analysis a non parametric test measures how effectively a monotonic function can capture the link between two variables box plots of the correlation coefficients of networks in the dataset are shown in figs 4 and 5 each box plot contains 192 correlation coefficients 12 baseline networks and 180 network variants the importance of the node is related to the required demand the required power and the available head of node the correlation coefficients are 0 54 0 54 and 0 52 respectively that is nodes with a high value of the required power required demand and low value of available head are the more important node in resilience assessment according to the findings nodes with higher water consumption have higher st this is related to the assumptions of the analysis method which assumed that the water consumption of node i follows a normal distribution with a mean of q r e q i and a standard deviation of 0 1 q r e q i nodes that consume more water contribute more to the variance of resilience the nodes with higher required energy and lower available heads are among the more unfavorable nodes in wdn these nodes serve as the flaws of the system and their energy profile controls the level of resilience of the network as shown in fig 5 the importance of node is positively correlated with the demand weighted shortest path length to junction l w j and the demand weighted shortest path length to source l w s the metric l w s captures the efficiency of water transmission by measuring the shortest distance between source and consumption nodes according to the results of the previous analysis of the hydrodynamic attributes st is negatively correlated with the available head of the nodes a high available head of the node implies a lower energy loss to reach this node which explains the high positive correlation between l w s and st the metric l w j capture property of how a change of node required demand affects the hydraulic features of other nodes this is a property that is difficult to capture by hydraulic measures obtained from a single simulation the strong positive correlation between g and st comes from the effect of node required demand because the node required demand has a strong correlation with st while the node required demand is a component of measure g the metrics for node level attribute are developed with the following 4 assumptions about the propagation paths of water flow 1 shortest path l w s 2 k shortest paths c k s 3 random walking paths c r w and 4 longest paths c s the highest correlation between l w s and st indicates that the metric based on shortest path performs best in the ranking of the nodes node importance the type and weight of the nodes are important for tailoring metrics for wdn the performance of the metric improved significantly after adjusting by node weight for example the metric g that is metric of node required demand adjusted f has improved the value of analyzing node importance because of the higher correlation between g and st the topological properties of undirected graphs are slightly better than those of directed graphs in ranking nodes by importance with the correlation coefficient between l w s and st being 0 65 for the graph g w 2 d and 0 66 for the graph g w 1 undirected graphs are sufficient for the calculation of the topological attributes to determine the node s importance however the inclusion of directions and weights can be very useful meng et al 2018 3 3 analysis of optimal proportion of required nodes 3 3 1 error distribution curve and oprn the e r r o r distribution curve is calculated for each network in the database the outcome is displayed in fig 6 a the e r r o r is normalized by the min max method the error decreases as the ratio of nodes increases the slope of the error curve is greater when the proportion of nodes is low but it is stable when the proportion of nodes is high as mentioned in section 2 3 oprn is defined as the proportion of nodes with an e r r o r of 5 and is counted separately in each network as shown in fig 6b oprn is 6 5 2 this indicates that the resilience evaluation can be performed with partial nodes in the majority of networks and the accuracy of the resilience evaluation can be controlled within a certain range 5 3 3 2 mechanisms to oprn a pre analysis of the correlation between oprn and network level attributes for the baseline network is carried out the number of links nodes network size and reservoirs are found to be strongly correlated with oprn with spearman coefficients of 0 88 0 91 and 0 71 respectively thus the investigated networks are divided into two groups based on network size node number each group contains 6 baseline networks and their network variants the correlations between the network level attribute metrics and oprn is performed separately for each group and the mean values of correlation coefficient are used to better understand the relationships the correlation results between all hydraulic attributes and oprn are presented in color maps in fig 7 the color of the grid cell shows the strength of the correlation between hydraulic measure and oprn the hydraulic measure symbols are displayed at the bottom of the corresponding column and the statistical methods are displayed on the left of the corresponding row the positive correlation is shown in red and the negative correlation is shown in blue if the absolute value of correlation coefficient is higher than 0 5 the value is text in the corresponding cell for example the left upper panel represents the positive correlation between oprn and the average of node available head the final column represents the hybrid statistical indicators of network hydraulic attributes which are explained in detail in section 2 3 the hydrodynamic factors controlling oprn are found to be i d σ p r and σ p s which are positively proportional to oprn correlation coefficients are 0 83 0 76 and 0 62 respectively this demonstrates that the standard deviation of the normalized required energy and surplus energy of the node influences the value of oprn the larger the standard deviation of required energy and surplus energy the more nodes are required to describe the energy composition of the network and therefore a greater oprn is necessary the correlation results between network level topological attributes and oprn are presented in color maps in fig 8 the color of the grid cell represents the strength of the correlation between network level topological attribute and oprn the topological measure symbols are displayed on the left of the corresponding row and the graph type is displayed at the bottom of the corresponding row the positive correlation is shown in red and the negative correlation is shown in blue the white cell represents that the attributes can not implement for the type of graph if the absolute value of correlation coefficient is higher than 0 5 the value is text in the corresponding cell it can be seen that some attributes of centralization centrality and efficiency are more powerful than the other type of attributes a centralized network measured by s c e with low centrality measured by c b and c r w and efficiency measured by l w j need more node for resilience evaluation the centralization of eigenvector centrality s c e shows a strong positive correlation with oprn in the directed graph s c e measures the importance of node in network by taking into account the degree of node self and the importance of other nodes connected to it soh et al 2010 s c e represents the centralization of this node property a centralized network of s c e requires more nodes to keep satisfactory accuracy of resilience assessment average of node weighted shortest path length to junction l w j which represents the average distance traveled between pairs of nodes shows a strong positive correlation with oprn in the undirected graph the indicator l w j captures the network s ability how changes in node demand affect the other node accounts the efficient communication lower l w j between consumption nodes may lead to an even distribution of network energy then the network requires more nodes to assess the resilience of wdn the performance of topological attribute property recognition oprn on different types of graphs is analyzed the metrics l w j and c b of the graph g w 1 show strong correlations with the oprn correlation coefficients of 0 55 and 0 51 respectively since the graph g w 1 are the most readily available table 1 undirected and unweighted graphs can be the primary type of graph used for estimating oprn meanwhile the metric s c e of the directed graph g w 1 d and oprn are mostly correlated this suggests that the direction and weight of graph offer extra details for estimating oprn if edge weight and direction data are available graphs with directed and weighted can result in more accurate results 4 prospects the feasibility of using partial nodes for resilience evaluation is examined in this study it is demonstrated that satisfactory resilience evaluation results can be obtained by partial nodes hydraulic information this has important implications for the extension of the resilience evaluation to wdn without a hydraulic model after all most water utilities lack an accurate hydraulic model zhou et al 2022 in this paper the mechanisms of node importance and oprn are analyzed nodes that are far from water sources and use more water have a greater impact on wdn resilience in centralized low centrality and low efficiency networks more nodes with hydraulic information are needed to obtain satisfactory resilience assessment results these conclusions provide a basis for establishing accurate models to estimate oprn and select the required nodes the next step is to build a model for estimating the oprn in order to achieve an accurate estimation of oprn the model can be also used to analyze the needed cost for monitoring nodal hydraulic information to perform the resilience evaluation the weighted directed graph carries more information about wdn but is not significantly better than the unweighted undirected graph in this study given the availability the weight and flow direction data the unweighted undirected graph possesses a higher value for use however the inclusion of directions and weights can be very useful in this study some topological metrics are designed specifically for wdns according to the characteristics of wdns and show good properties this provides interesting insights for studying the topological properties of wdns it should be noted that the resilience metrics in this study focus on the hydraulic resilience based on the surplus energy of a wdn walski 2020 argues that the commonly used excess capacity indicators e g network resilience index total surplus head are poor indicators of reliability the mechanisms may be different for other types of hydraulic resilience metrics such as maximum entropy flows tanyimboh and templeman 1993 global resilience metrics diao et al 2016 the metric based on the centrality of the link has better performance because the maximum entropy flows metrics focus on the flow of the pipe therefore further analysis of node importance and oprn is necessary when using other types of resilience metrics for partial node resilience evaluation although the newly proposed framework is used for wdn resilience assessment it could be easily transferable to other network systems 5 conclusion this study explores whether the resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information is feasible by addressing two questions 1 whether the importance of nodes differs in resilience evaluation 2 what proportion of nodes are indispensable in resilience evaluation the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information is theoretically feasible because the importance of nodes differs in resilience evaluation the nodes with large values of the required energy available demand and small values of the available head are more important the topological factors determining the importance of node are the demand weighted shortest path length to junction l w j and the demand weighted shortest path length to source l w s 2 the resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information is practically feasible because only 6 5 2 of nodes in wdns are required this suggests that the number of nodes used for resilience evaluation is sufficiently small to keep satisfactory accuracy of resilience assessment the hydraulic properties that control oprn need to refer to the standard deviation of the normalized required energy and surplus energy of the node the centralization centrality and efficiency are stronger than the other type of attributes a large value of oprn is needed in centralized s c e network with low centrality small c r w and c b and low efficiency with high l w j declaration of competing interest the authors declare

14688,accurate resilience evaluation for water distribution systems generally requires all nodes hydraulic data which are usually obtained from a well calibrated hydraulic model however in reality few utilities maintain a workable hydraulic model making the resilience evaluation far more from practicability under this condition whether resilience evaluation can be realized based on a small amount of monitoring nodes is still a research gap therefore this paper investigates the possibility of accurate resilience evaluation using partial nodes by answering two problems 1 whether the importance of nodes differs in resilience evaluation 2 what proportion of nodes are indispensable in resilience evaluation accordingly the gini index of nodes importance and the error distribution of partial node resilience evaluation are computed and analyzed a database including 192 networks is used results show that the importance of nodes in the resilience evaluation varies the gini index of nodes importance is 0 604 0 106 the proportion of nodes that meet the accuracy requirement of resilience evaluation is 6 5 2 further analysis shows that the importance of nodes is determined by the transmission efficiency between water sources and consumption nodes and the degree of a node s influence on other nodes the optimal proportion of required nodes is controlled by a network s centralization centrality and efficiency these results show that accurate resilience evaluation using partial nodes hydraulic data is feasible and provide some basis for the resilience evaluation orientated selection of monitoring nodes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords resilience node importance node level attribute network level attribute correlation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water distribution networks wdns are designed to maintain their function for long periods e g several decades in order to meet the changing growing of service demand and expected performance of stakeholders which are determined by technology society economy and organization hosseini et al 2016 lee and kim 2020 therefore it is not only meaningful but also essential to increase the resilience of wdns i e add flexibility and adaptability to wdns via system engineering design maintenance updating and integration of new technologies assad and bouferguene 2022 diao et al 2016 ulusoy et al 2022 as a result resilience assessment has received increasing attention in the field of water distribution system research over the past few years a great number of quantitative measures of resilience have been established for decision making in the design process of wdns assad and bouferguene 2022 lee and kim 2020 shuang et al 2019 they are classified into two categories 1 simulation based and 2 graph based measures simulation based approaches are the most commonly utilized method hydraulic model of a wdn is necessary for a simulation based measure gheisi et al 2016 shuang et al 2019 a graph based measure which is an experience based technique using intuitive judgment is the shortcut to quickly produce initial resilience profile meng et al 2018 the reason is that there is a relationship between structural features and performance of wdns torres et al 2017 the structure and connectivity e g redundancy and robustness of wdns affect their resilience pagano et al 2019 the simulation based measure can obtain a comprehensive understanding of a wdn s resilience but it is computationally intensive and has been highly dependent on all nodes hydraulic data assad and bouferguene 2022 since it is not possible to monitor every node in a real world in operation wdn the hydraulic data of all nodes is usually generated by a hydraulic model due to the difficulty and high cost in modeling most water utilities do not have access to well calibrated high precision models especially for large complex wdns despite the large amount of monitoring data zhou et al 2022 the simulation data dependent limits the application of the simulation based measure in the realistic wdns the graph based measure is less dependent on hydraulic information of a network and more computationally efficient overcoming the disadvantages of the simulation based approach anchieta et al 2023 herrera et al 2016 li et al 2023 pagano et al 2019 however primitive topological metrics such as connectivity average node degree robustness spectral gap redundancy clustering coefficient and efficiency average shortest path length etc can only obtain a profile of resilience torres et al 2017 the graph based measure may be regarded as a relatively quick to implement precursor to more detailed analyses but is far from sufficient for a comprehensive assessment of resilience yazdani et al 2011 the graph based measure emphasizes the structure of wdn rather than its function different levels of functional performance may be achieved through similar structures of wdn thus it can be misleading to use topological attribute metrics as surrogate resilience indicators in the design of wdns although lorenz et al 2021b and herrera et al 2016 improved graph based measures by incorporating node demands in the topological resilience index topological characteristics may not be fully representative of hydraulic performances and pipe failure impacts pagano et al 2019 therefore the graph theory based approach is also difficult to meet the needs of the actual wdn for resilience evaluation the simulation based measure is highly data dependent and or requires extensive computational resources and graph based measures have difficulty satisfying the need for the accuracy of resilience evaluation it is found that the hydraulic properties of some critical nodes in wdns can represent the resilience of wdn to mechanical failure prasad and park 2004 atkinson et al 2014 and palod et al 2022 tried to evaluate resilience by using the surplus head of a critical node and proposed a metric named minimum surplus head msh the msh metric reduces the reliance on the full node data obtained from the simulation model but it does not deal well with mechanical failures and needs to be used as an additional measure to achieve satisfactory evaluation performance in fact the use of hydraulic data from some nodes rather than all nodes for resilience evaluation has great practical value as it does not require an accurate hydraulic model of wdns the hydraulic data from partial nodes needed for evaluation can be obtained through monitoring however to the best knowledge of the authors no studies have confirmed this possibility of resilience evaluation for wdn based on partial nodes hydraulic information to prove whether an accurate evaluation of resilience by partial nodes can be achieved or not there are two issues to be resolved first is it theoretically feasible to fill this research gap it is necessary to demonstrate whether there is a significant difference in the importance of all nodes in a wdn additionally the underlying mechanisms of node importance i e the correlation between the node level properties hydraulic and topological and the importance of nodes should be investigated second is it practically feasible answering this problem necessitates investigating the optimal proportion of required nodes oprn for evaluating resilience only a significantly small oprn can reduce the data requirements while remaining operationally practicable correlation analysis also needs to be utilized to investigate its mechanisms i e the correlation between network features hydraulic and topological and oprn accordingly this paper proposes a comprehensive analysis framework for exploring the possibility of accurate resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information the specific objectives of the present study are 1 revealing node importance variation of wdns and its mechanism 2 exploring the oprn of wdns and its mechanism and 3 discussing prospects of this research which provide insights for estimates oprn select suitable monitoring nodes and construct topology metrics to describe wdn the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the method used in this paper section 3 presents and discusses the results of the research section 4 provides prospects of the research finally section 5 draws conclusions 2 methodology the proposed framework fig 1 consists of three parts 1 construction of network dataset and pre analysis in this part a dataset containing 12 baseline networks and 180 network variants is constructed to represent the high variability in attributes of wdns the resilience and network level topological attributes are pre analysis to determine whether it is suitably representative 2 evaluation of difference in node importance the part consists of three modules assessing the node importance analyzing the node level attributes and investigating the mechanisms of node importance to justify the theoretical possibility of the proposed resilience evaluation method 3 exploration of the optimal proportion of required nodes the part consists of three modules determining the optimal proportion of required nodes oprn analyzing the network level attributes and investigating the mechanisms of oprn 2 1 construction of network dataset and pre analysis 2 1 1 construction of dataset to reach a generalized conclusion the size of the wdns database used in the study needs to be sufficient to explore the response mechanism of networks with different functions and structures 12 benchmark networks with various sizes that have appeared in the previous literature hernandez et al 2016 are collected the dimensions of the baseline networks are listed in s4 table s1 the resilience of wdn is often enhanced or and improved by adding redundancy to the network hickford et al 2018 liu and song 2020 by performing an analysis of network variants by pipe addition insights can be gained on the appropriateness of resilience evaluation by partial nodes in the wdn after pipe rehabilitation extension meng et al 2018 to generate a network variant by the model two nodes are randomly chosen in the network and a pipe is added if it does not intersect with other pipes in the network this procedure is repeated until the given number of pipes to be added is reached the number of additional pipes is 1 2 3 4 and 5 of the total number of pipes three different scenarios are generated for each determined number of additional pipes such that each baseline network generates 15 network variants a total of 180 network variants are generated the length of the added pipe is determined by the spatial distance of the nodes and the h w coefficient is a fixed value i e 130 the variable needed to be optimized is only the pipe diameter in the network in the study the modified resilience index mri is used as a metric for resilience evaluation eq 1 in text the mri index can be used to compare different variants of the same network but it remains to be studied whether different networks can be compared therefore the networks in the dataset need to be optimized using resilience metric and cost to ensure that the resilience of networks from the same baseline network is at the same level this means that a network and its variants have the same or similar mri values comparing the performance of various optimization algorithms in the literature the researchers argue that no single algorithm outperforms the others regardless of the conditions and that overall the non dominated ranking genetic algorithm ii nsga ii with minimal parameter tuning remains a good choice as it usually performs best in all problems wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 in this study nsga ii is used as the optimization algorithm and the betweenness centrality of the pipe bc is used as an estimate of the pipe flow to optimize the efficiency of the nsga ii sitzenfrei et al 2020 2021 more specifically the bc values count how often an edge k is a part of the shortest paths between all pairs source node and consumption node the pipe with higher bc is set to a larger diameter the direction and the probability of mutation and crossover are optimized by setting the probability for the diameter of each pipe based on bc 2 1 2 resilience measure the main idea of the simulation based approach is as follows first the global properties of wdn are obtained by aggregating the hydraulic properties of all nodes second the resilience index is designed with global properties the resilience index ri proposed by todini 2000 firstly aggregates the minimum required power ereq input power ein and surplus power esur of the nodes secondly the resilience index is designed as e r e q e i n e s u r the idea of partial node resilience evaluation is to obtain the global properties of wdn by aggregating the hydraulic properties of partial nodes modified resilience index mri is a more common resilience evaluation index which has the advantage that ignoring the input power of the system and overcomes the disadvantage that ri cannot deal with multi source wdn and can be easily extended to evaluate the resilience using partial nodes zhang et al 2022 the mri is defined as the ratio of the surplus power of nodes to the minimum required power at the demand node jayaram and srinivasan 2008 it can be written as 1 mr i s y s i s y s q r e q i h a v a i h r e q i i s y s q r e q i h r e q i where q r e q i is the required demand at node i h a v a i and h r e q i are the available and minimum required head at node i mr i s y s is the resilience index evaluated by all demand nodes in system s y s is the set contains of all demand nodes in wdn similarly the resilience evaluation using partial nodes is performed in eq 2 2 mri par pn i par q req i h ava i h req i i par q req i h req i where par is the subset of partial nodes from set sys pn is the node number ratio of par set to sys set mri par pn is the resilience index evaluated by hydraulic data of partial node the resilience evaluation using the hydraulic modeling platform epanet2 based on the pressure driven hydraulic model rossman 2002 the required demand of node i is specified for each consumption node of the baseline networks and the network variants and the node available demand meets the required demand when the nodal pressure is higher than the minimum required pressure p req and the node available demand is 0 when the nodal pressure is lower than p req otherwise the node available demand is range between 0 and q req i in the research the value of p req is set as 10 m the brief descriptions of hydraulic model are provided in section s1 of the supporting information 2 1 3 graphs generalized from wdn topological attributes of wdns are characterized by measures from graph theory which have been used to analyze the structure and function of wdns hwang and lansey 2017 meng et al 2018 a wdn is represented as a graph with nodes i e connection points of water sources customers and edges i e pipes pumps valves etc of the wdn the graph is mathematically expressed as g v e where v and e represent the set of nodes and edges respectively the adjacency matrix of graph represents the pairwise relationships between node pairs and edges the adjacency matrix is the basis for computing topological attributes and the details on the method used to construct the adjacency matrix can be found in s1 an undirected and unweighted graph is the most used generalization of wdns and the required data on the connectivity of nodes is the easiest to obtain meng et al 2018 a weighted and directed graph that includes information of node and edge weights as well as direction can be used to represent wdns in more detail meng et al 2018 wu and baker 2020 but information of edge direction and weight node weight and others is difficult to collect harpaz et al 2022 for example the undirected and unweighted graph contains information on the relationship between nodes and pipes and the directed graph adds information on the flow direction of pipes the edge weight represents the physical properties of connections such as pipe segments or pumps see table 1 to describe the property of the nodes the weights of nodes are also set based on demand information giustolisi et al 2020 guidotti et al 2017 thus a wdn can form in 6 types of graphs as shown in table 1 which see s1 for more detailed information the 6 types of graphs can be arranged into three classes based on the estimated availability of required data used to construct graph 2 2 evaluation of difference in node importance the main work of this subsection is to analyze the importance of node in the evaluation of resilience from a hydrodynamic point of view in order to analyze the factors affecting the importance of node the node levels attributes are calculated 2 2 1 node importance and sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is one of the most important measures to evaluate the importance of variables saltelli et al 2010 if a sensitivity metric is used to rank model inputs according to their impact on model outputs it is called an importance metric borgonovo and plischke 2016 numerous works have been achieved using sensitivity analysis to identify important components of the system and to evaluate the importance of the system s input variables iooss and lemaître 2015 mr i s y s can be regarded as a function with the required demand of node as the independent variable the interaction relationship of node may affect the resilience of wdn hence the global sensitivity analysis of resilience is chosen for analyzing the influence of nodes on wdn s resilience because the technique can provide detailed description of how individual nodes and their interactions impact resilience of wdn fu et al 2012 huzsvar et al 2020 the global sensitivity coefficient st represents the importance of node the approach proposed by sobol 2001 has demonstrated excellent performance in analyzing the sensitivity of components in wdn the computational cost of the original sa is quite expensive due to the increasing dimensionality saltelli 2002 and saltelli et al 2010 established a new strategy to save computational costs using sobol quasi random sequences in the sa analysis of this study the network resilience is the dependent variable and the node required demand is the independent variable sobol quasi random sequences about q r e q are generated by sampling the distribution of the independent variable q r e q in the sa analysis the hydraulic simulations are performed on each sample of sequence it is assumed that q r e q of the node obeys a normal distribution with a mean of q r e q and a standard deviation of 0 1 q r e q the sensitivity toolkit developed by herman and usher 2017 based on python which includes the sa is used in this paper 2 2 2 node level attribute assessment hydraulic attributes the available power e a v a at each node consist of 2 parts the minimum required power e r e q and the surplus power e s u r q r e q q r e q 1 q r e q 2 q r e q i q r e q n e e 1 e 2 e i e n h r e q h r e q 1 h r e q 2 h r e q i h r e q n h a v a h a v a 1 h a v a 2 h a v a i h a v a n denote the required demand elevation minimum required head and available head at each node respectively define e a v a e r e q e s u r and h s u r as 3 e a v a i q r e q i h a v a i 4 e s u r i q r e q i h a v a i h r e q i 5 e r e q q r e q i e i h r e q i 6 h s u r i h a v a i h r e q i all hydraulic attributes are simulated under normal conditions using a pressure driven model currently the pressure at each node satisfies the minimum required pressure and the required demand at each node equals the available demand q r e q i q a v a i topological attribute node level topological metrics are measures designed to determine the roles of different nodes in the structure of a network according to the literature review lü et al 2016 4 node level topological attributes neighborhood based path to junction based path to source based and iterative refinement centralities are assessed as topological properties of node a brief description of the topological metrics used in this study is listed in table 2 detailed information on attribute definitions and calculation methods is shown in s2 1 the node type and associated hydraulic attributes are one of the most important features to investigate node and entire network topological properties especially for the indicators based on the shortest path yazdani and jeffrey 2012b the shortest path length measures the efficiency of information exchanged meng et al 2018 it has been found that the shortest path length from source node to consumption node has a fundamental interrelation with hydraulic properties such as energy dissipation sitzenfrei et al 2020 the shortest path length between a pair of consumption nodes describes the impact of changes in hydraulic conditions at the node on the other nodes therefore these two types of indicators should be calculated separately wu and baker 2020 it is generally accepted that the shortest path is the most applicable metric for describing water flow paths topologically sitzenfrei et al 2020 however the nodes do not satisfy energy conservation if the water flows only among the shortest path for example some of the pipes locating at longer paths may have no water flowing through them which is inconsistent with the properties of hydraulics lorenz et al 2021a therefore the k shortest path length is also calculated in this paper newman 2001 proposed to adopt the reciprocal of weights to extend closeness centrality where the weights in the network represent the operationalizations of link strength rather than their costs in this study the weight of the network represents the cost energy consumption and the definition by newman 2001 can represent the longest transmission path therefore this definition is adopted in this study as a result the indicators used in this study provide a more comprehensive characterization of possible transmission paths of water flow the betweenness of node generally refers to the number of shortest paths through the node as mentioned earlier non shortest paths also contribute to water transport the random walk betweenness centrality counts all paths in networks and gives more weight to the shortest one newman 2005 the random walk betweenness centrality is also calculated in this paper the two node level metrics that are determined in the analysis to be most useful are defined as follows demand weighted shortest path length to junction l wj a dimensionless weighting based on the node required demand is incorporated into the definition of shortest path length to junction and it is proposed as follows 7 l wj i 1 n cn j cn j i d v i v j w n j j cn j i w n j where d v i v j is the shortest path length also called geodesic distance from node i to node j w n j is the weight of the node j the set of all consumption nodes and source nodes are donated as c n s n respectively n c n n s n are their respective numbers demand weighted shortest path length to source l ws a dimensionless weighting based on the node required demand is incorporated into the definition of the shortest path length to the source and it is proposed as follows 8 l ws i min j sn d v j v i w n i i cn j i w n i and following the same arguments as before 2 3 exploration of optimal proportion of nodes in this subsection optimal proportion of required nodes for wdns to satisfy the need for resilience evaluation is analyzed to analyze the attributes affecting the proportion the network level attributes are calculated 2 3 1 optimal proportion of nodes the error of the resilience evaluated by partial nodes error can be evaluated based on mean absolute percentage error as shown in the following equation 9 e r r o r p n i mr i s y s mr i p a r p n i mr i s y s a genetic algorithm ga is used to search p a r that minimizes e r r o r p n when the ratio of nodes used for resilience evaluation to all nodes is p n i the analysis of the e r r o r p n distribution curve is carried out according to the following steps step i carry out a hydraulic simulation to obtain pressure and water consumption data for each node step ii set the ratio of partial nodes to all consumption nodes as p n i p n i starts from 1 n n is the total number of consumption nodes and search the set of nodes that minimizes e r r o r p n using the ga when running the ga a certain number of special individuals are guaranteed to exist in the population the first p n i δ p n genes of the special individuals are the same as the set of nodes that minimized e r r o r p n i 1 obtained in the previous cycle and only the last δpn genes undergo crossover and variation step iii if p n i 1 then set p n i 1 p n i δ p n and repeat step ii if p n i 1 then end for the network with a large number of nodes a larger step size δ p n is set to obtain the error distribution curve shown in fig 1 the error in resilience evaluation is controlled by the number of nodes participating in the evaluation obviously oprn is closely related to the specified maximal margin of error which is set as 5 in this paper while the error is less than 5 the accuracy of m r i p a r meets the requirements of stakeholders and pn is the optimal proportion of required nodes oprn 2 3 2 network level attribute assessment hydraulic attribute the hydraulic properties of the network are the statistical indicators of the above mentioned node level properties including standard deviation mean and extreme values in addition some hybrid statistical indicators are designed for reflecting the hydraulic properties of the network noted that eq 9 can be rewritten as e r r o r p n i mr i s y s mr i p a r p n i mr i s y s 1 j p a r q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j j s y s q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j j p a r q r e q j h r e q j j s y s q r e q j h r e q j if donate r e s u r j q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j j s y s q r e q j h a v a j h r e q j r e r e q j q r e q j h r e q j i s y s q r e q j h r e q j then 10 e r r o r p n i 1 1 f n s j 1 f n s r e s u r j 1 f n s j 1 f n s r e r e q j where f n s is the node number of set p a r j represent node j according to eq 10 e r r o r p n i is positively related to the number of nodes to ensure an accurate estimation of the mean value of r e s u r and r e r e q then oprn is determined by the minimum size of samples to estimate the mean value of r e s u r and r e r e q it is important to note that the data of r e s u r and r e r e q occur in pairs according to the sampling method of paired data brase and brase 2017 the minimum sample size n of the paired data is usually estimated by z c σ e 2 where e is specified maximal margin of error σ is population standard deviation and z c is critical value from the normal distribution for the desired confidence level c accordingly a statistic variable d is designed and d i r e s u r i r e r e q i then the ratio of the required sample size to estimate the mean value of variable d to the population number is 11 i d 1 n c z α σ d e c t r l 2 where σ d denotes the standard deviation of d and e c t r l m i n 1 r e s u r r e r e q and z α is critical value from the normal distribution for the desired confidence level c e g 1 645 at a confidence level of 90 i d is set as the first hybrid statistical indicator which represents the minimum proportion of nodes to estimate e r r o r p n i σ p s σ p r represent the standard deviation of r e s u r r e r e q respectively which are set as the second and third hybrid statistical indicators topological attribute as mentioned above 6 types of graphs as the basis for analysis of topological attributes are listed in table 3 according to the literature review giudicianni et al 2018 meng et al 2018 7 attributes robustness modularity efficiency assortativity connectivity centralization and centrality are assessed as key topological properties of the network each of these attributes is described using one or more metrics detailed definitions of each specific metric are provided in s3 2 to fully describe the topological characteristics of wdns the topological metrics which are popular in the literature are calculated and others based on domain specific features of wdns are formulated the two network level metrics that are determined in the analysis to be most useful are defined as follows centralization centralization is the degree of variance of node centrality in a network which describe the node s differences in centrality measure the centralization which is donated as s p t is defined as following wasserman and faust 1994 12 s p t i c n p t i p t i 2 n c n where s p t represent network level centralization measure p t i represent the node level measure of node i based on the path to node type t source node is s consumption node is j other parameters are described previously efficiency the network level measure of efficiency is defined by the mean value of node level efficiency the network level measure donated p t is defined as 13 p t 1 n i c n p t i where p t i represents the node level topological measures based on the path to node type t if the node type is source node then n n s n n c n if the node type is consumption node n n c n 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre analysis of wdn in this section a network dataset is described the resilience and topological properties i e average degree and average shortest path length of networks in the dataset are pre analyzed 3 1 1 resilience of wdn in fig 2 the change in the mri of the optimized network as a certain percentage of added pipe is analyzed mri does not change significantly less than 4 with the increase of the number of added pipes this indicates that the optimized network variants can maintain a similar level of resilience to the baseline network providing a baseline for future analysis however there is a significant improvement in the efficiency decreases in average shortest path length fig 2c and connectivity increases in average degree fig 2b of the network when the number of added pipes increases this indicates that the mri metric has no significant correlation with the efficiency connectivity of an unweighted and undirected graph topological metrics such as efficiency cannot fully replace simulation based metrics in evaluating resilience in order to reduce the reliance on simulated data for evaluating resilience using a subset of all nodes to evaluate resilience is a more promising approach than topological surrogate metrics 3 1 2 topological attribute a pre analysis of the network level topological attributes of networks is performed in this subsection the average degree and the average shortest path length of networks are shown in fig 2b and c the distribution of other network level topological attributes are detailed in s5 the average degree of networks fell within a range 2 04 3 77 as the number of added pipes increases the average degree increases for example the average degree of the baseline networks without added pipe is 2 62 which is 3 25 of networks added 5 pipes although the average degree changes with the number of added pipes it is similar to that investigated in the literature giudicianni et al 2018 wéber et al 2020 yazdani and jeffrey 2012a the structure of the wdn is typically ranging between a simple tree network with average node degree of more than two and a two dimensional regular grid with average node degree of less than 4 yazdani and jeffrey 2012a the average degree is able to equalize distribution of flow and pressure under varying demands yazdani et al 2011 the increase in degree of network variants indicates that adding pipes significantly increases the existence of multiple paths resulting in a more uniform flow and pressure in wdn pagano et al 2019 the average shortest path refers to the average shortest path to the water source fig 2 the average shortest path length is 5 76 2 96 with a range of variation 2 58 20 27 as the number of added pipes increases the average shortest path length decreases the average shortest path length provides a view of reachability and efficiency in wdn water transport to some extent yazdani et al 2011 the change of average shortest path length suggests that increasing the number of added pipes can effectively improve the efficiency of the network pre analysis of the topological properties of wdns shows that the network in the database is topologically similar to the realistic network 3 2 analysis of node importance in resilience evaluation 3 2 1 difference of nodes importance the st values of nodes which donate the global sensitivity index of node reflect node importance in the resilience assessment the nodes are ranked by st and st cumulative curve is plotted in fig 3a the st cumulative curve shows that the nodes have a highly uneven distribution of st most nodes have low importance and coexist with a few nodes with high importance inequalities in the distribution of st among the nodes of the wdn can be quantified consistently by evaluating the gini coefficient of the cumulative curve the gini coefficient can be defined as the ratio of the area that lies between the line at 45 and the cumulative curve marked as a over the total area under the line at 45 marked a and b in the diagram i e gini coefficient equal to a a b huang et al 2023 gini coefficient ranges from zero to one zero means absolutely equal while one means completely unequal and a larger value means more inequality huang et al 2023 as shown in fig 3b the gini coefficient is 0 604 0 106 this indicates an unequal distribution of node s st this finding provides a basis for evaluating the resilience via the hydraulic attribute of the partial nodes 3 2 2 mechanisms to node importance the factors controlling the importance of the nodes are analyzed in two ways 1 the hydraulic attributes and 2 the topological attributes the attributes controlling the importance of nodes are analyzed by calculating the correlation between the node level hydraulic attributes or topological attributes and st of the node the significance of correlations is quantified by spearman correlation analysis because node level attributes are not necessarily linearly correlated with the importance of the nodes the spearman correlation analysis a non parametric test measures how effectively a monotonic function can capture the link between two variables box plots of the correlation coefficients of networks in the dataset are shown in figs 4 and 5 each box plot contains 192 correlation coefficients 12 baseline networks and 180 network variants the importance of the node is related to the required demand the required power and the available head of node the correlation coefficients are 0 54 0 54 and 0 52 respectively that is nodes with a high value of the required power required demand and low value of available head are the more important node in resilience assessment according to the findings nodes with higher water consumption have higher st this is related to the assumptions of the analysis method which assumed that the water consumption of node i follows a normal distribution with a mean of q r e q i and a standard deviation of 0 1 q r e q i nodes that consume more water contribute more to the variance of resilience the nodes with higher required energy and lower available heads are among the more unfavorable nodes in wdn these nodes serve as the flaws of the system and their energy profile controls the level of resilience of the network as shown in fig 5 the importance of node is positively correlated with the demand weighted shortest path length to junction l w j and the demand weighted shortest path length to source l w s the metric l w s captures the efficiency of water transmission by measuring the shortest distance between source and consumption nodes according to the results of the previous analysis of the hydrodynamic attributes st is negatively correlated with the available head of the nodes a high available head of the node implies a lower energy loss to reach this node which explains the high positive correlation between l w s and st the metric l w j capture property of how a change of node required demand affects the hydraulic features of other nodes this is a property that is difficult to capture by hydraulic measures obtained from a single simulation the strong positive correlation between g and st comes from the effect of node required demand because the node required demand has a strong correlation with st while the node required demand is a component of measure g the metrics for node level attribute are developed with the following 4 assumptions about the propagation paths of water flow 1 shortest path l w s 2 k shortest paths c k s 3 random walking paths c r w and 4 longest paths c s the highest correlation between l w s and st indicates that the metric based on shortest path performs best in the ranking of the nodes node importance the type and weight of the nodes are important for tailoring metrics for wdn the performance of the metric improved significantly after adjusting by node weight for example the metric g that is metric of node required demand adjusted f has improved the value of analyzing node importance because of the higher correlation between g and st the topological properties of undirected graphs are slightly better than those of directed graphs in ranking nodes by importance with the correlation coefficient between l w s and st being 0 65 for the graph g w 2 d and 0 66 for the graph g w 1 undirected graphs are sufficient for the calculation of the topological attributes to determine the node s importance however the inclusion of directions and weights can be very useful meng et al 2018 3 3 analysis of optimal proportion of required nodes 3 3 1 error distribution curve and oprn the e r r o r distribution curve is calculated for each network in the database the outcome is displayed in fig 6 a the e r r o r is normalized by the min max method the error decreases as the ratio of nodes increases the slope of the error curve is greater when the proportion of nodes is low but it is stable when the proportion of nodes is high as mentioned in section 2 3 oprn is defined as the proportion of nodes with an e r r o r of 5 and is counted separately in each network as shown in fig 6b oprn is 6 5 2 this indicates that the resilience evaluation can be performed with partial nodes in the majority of networks and the accuracy of the resilience evaluation can be controlled within a certain range 5 3 3 2 mechanisms to oprn a pre analysis of the correlation between oprn and network level attributes for the baseline network is carried out the number of links nodes network size and reservoirs are found to be strongly correlated with oprn with spearman coefficients of 0 88 0 91 and 0 71 respectively thus the investigated networks are divided into two groups based on network size node number each group contains 6 baseline networks and their network variants the correlations between the network level attribute metrics and oprn is performed separately for each group and the mean values of correlation coefficient are used to better understand the relationships the correlation results between all hydraulic attributes and oprn are presented in color maps in fig 7 the color of the grid cell shows the strength of the correlation between hydraulic measure and oprn the hydraulic measure symbols are displayed at the bottom of the corresponding column and the statistical methods are displayed on the left of the corresponding row the positive correlation is shown in red and the negative correlation is shown in blue if the absolute value of correlation coefficient is higher than 0 5 the value is text in the corresponding cell for example the left upper panel represents the positive correlation between oprn and the average of node available head the final column represents the hybrid statistical indicators of network hydraulic attributes which are explained in detail in section 2 3 the hydrodynamic factors controlling oprn are found to be i d σ p r and σ p s which are positively proportional to oprn correlation coefficients are 0 83 0 76 and 0 62 respectively this demonstrates that the standard deviation of the normalized required energy and surplus energy of the node influences the value of oprn the larger the standard deviation of required energy and surplus energy the more nodes are required to describe the energy composition of the network and therefore a greater oprn is necessary the correlation results between network level topological attributes and oprn are presented in color maps in fig 8 the color of the grid cell represents the strength of the correlation between network level topological attribute and oprn the topological measure symbols are displayed on the left of the corresponding row and the graph type is displayed at the bottom of the corresponding row the positive correlation is shown in red and the negative correlation is shown in blue the white cell represents that the attributes can not implement for the type of graph if the absolute value of correlation coefficient is higher than 0 5 the value is text in the corresponding cell it can be seen that some attributes of centralization centrality and efficiency are more powerful than the other type of attributes a centralized network measured by s c e with low centrality measured by c b and c r w and efficiency measured by l w j need more node for resilience evaluation the centralization of eigenvector centrality s c e shows a strong positive correlation with oprn in the directed graph s c e measures the importance of node in network by taking into account the degree of node self and the importance of other nodes connected to it soh et al 2010 s c e represents the centralization of this node property a centralized network of s c e requires more nodes to keep satisfactory accuracy of resilience assessment average of node weighted shortest path length to junction l w j which represents the average distance traveled between pairs of nodes shows a strong positive correlation with oprn in the undirected graph the indicator l w j captures the network s ability how changes in node demand affect the other node accounts the efficient communication lower l w j between consumption nodes may lead to an even distribution of network energy then the network requires more nodes to assess the resilience of wdn the performance of topological attribute property recognition oprn on different types of graphs is analyzed the metrics l w j and c b of the graph g w 1 show strong correlations with the oprn correlation coefficients of 0 55 and 0 51 respectively since the graph g w 1 are the most readily available table 1 undirected and unweighted graphs can be the primary type of graph used for estimating oprn meanwhile the metric s c e of the directed graph g w 1 d and oprn are mostly correlated this suggests that the direction and weight of graph offer extra details for estimating oprn if edge weight and direction data are available graphs with directed and weighted can result in more accurate results 4 prospects the feasibility of using partial nodes for resilience evaluation is examined in this study it is demonstrated that satisfactory resilience evaluation results can be obtained by partial nodes hydraulic information this has important implications for the extension of the resilience evaluation to wdn without a hydraulic model after all most water utilities lack an accurate hydraulic model zhou et al 2022 in this paper the mechanisms of node importance and oprn are analyzed nodes that are far from water sources and use more water have a greater impact on wdn resilience in centralized low centrality and low efficiency networks more nodes with hydraulic information are needed to obtain satisfactory resilience assessment results these conclusions provide a basis for establishing accurate models to estimate oprn and select the required nodes the next step is to build a model for estimating the oprn in order to achieve an accurate estimation of oprn the model can be also used to analyze the needed cost for monitoring nodal hydraulic information to perform the resilience evaluation the weighted directed graph carries more information about wdn but is not significantly better than the unweighted undirected graph in this study given the availability the weight and flow direction data the unweighted undirected graph possesses a higher value for use however the inclusion of directions and weights can be very useful in this study some topological metrics are designed specifically for wdns according to the characteristics of wdns and show good properties this provides interesting insights for studying the topological properties of wdns it should be noted that the resilience metrics in this study focus on the hydraulic resilience based on the surplus energy of a wdn walski 2020 argues that the commonly used excess capacity indicators e g network resilience index total surplus head are poor indicators of reliability the mechanisms may be different for other types of hydraulic resilience metrics such as maximum entropy flows tanyimboh and templeman 1993 global resilience metrics diao et al 2016 the metric based on the centrality of the link has better performance because the maximum entropy flows metrics focus on the flow of the pipe therefore further analysis of node importance and oprn is necessary when using other types of resilience metrics for partial node resilience evaluation although the newly proposed framework is used for wdn resilience assessment it could be easily transferable to other network systems 5 conclusion this study explores whether the resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information is feasible by addressing two questions 1 whether the importance of nodes differs in resilience evaluation 2 what proportion of nodes are indispensable in resilience evaluation the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information is theoretically feasible because the importance of nodes differs in resilience evaluation the nodes with large values of the required energy available demand and small values of the available head are more important the topological factors determining the importance of node are the demand weighted shortest path length to junction l w j and the demand weighted shortest path length to source l w s 2 the resilience evaluation based on partial nodes hydraulic information is practically feasible because only 6 5 2 of nodes in wdns are required this suggests that the number of nodes used for resilience evaluation is sufficiently small to keep satisfactory accuracy of resilience assessment the hydraulic properties that control oprn need to refer to the standard deviation of the normalized required energy and surplus energy of the node the centralization centrality and efficiency are stronger than the other type of attributes a large value of oprn is needed in centralized s c e network with low centrality small c r w and c b and low efficiency with high l w j declaration of competing interest the authors declare

14689,single bleaching powder disinfection is a highly prevalent practice to disinfect source water for marine aquaculture to prevent diseases however due to the decay of active chlorine and the presence of disinfectant resistance bacteria drb the effects of bleaching powder on prokaryotic community compositions pccs and function in marine water remain unknown in the present study the source water in a canvas pond was treated with the normal dose of bleaching powder and the impact on pccs and functional profiles was investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the bleaching powder strongly altered the pccs within 0 5 h but they began to recover at 16 h eventually achieving 76 similarity with the initial time at 72 h this extremely rapid recovery was primarily driven by the decay of bacillus and the regrowth of pseudoalteromonas both of which are drb abundant community not only help pccs recover but also provide larger functional redundancy than rare community during the recovery of pccs stochastic processes drove the community assembly after 72 h five out of seven identified disinfectant resistance genes related to efflux pump systems were highly enriched primarily in staphylococcus and bacillus however 15 out of the 16 identified antibiotic resistance genes args remained unchanged compared to the initial time indicating that bleaching powder does not contribute to args removal overall the findings demonstrate that single bleaching powder disinfection cannot successfully meet the objective of disease prevention in marine aquaculture water due to the extremely rapid recovery of pccs hence secondary disinfection or novel disinfection strategies should be explored for source water disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bleaching powder disinfection prokaryotic communities disinfectant resistance bacteria marine aquaculture water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disinfection of source water is vital for seawater shrimp farming because pathogens such as bacteria intestinal parasites and viruses pose a severe threat to the aquaculture industry lotz 1997 to prevent the outbreak of diseases and eliminate pathogens chemical disinfectants including bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite caocl2 chlorine dioxide clo2 and sodium hypochlorite naocl are routinely used to disinfect aquaculture water before pumping it to rearing ponds gräslund and bengtsson 2001 li et al 2021a van haute et al 2017 amidst various disinfectants bleaching powder is commonly used due to its strong oxidizing power inexpensive cost and convenient application duan et al 2020 it can directly inactivate microbes by damaging cell membranes altering enzyme activity or disrupting nucleic acids sharma and bhattacharya 2017 despite the fact that these disinfectants are excellent in controlling bacteria shrimp disease induced by pathogens continues to be a major problem in shrimp farming ali et al 2018 moreover it is becoming more evident that disinfectants can also disturb the balance of the microbial communities in the rearing water which is crucial for maintaining the stability of aquaculture ecosystems zhao et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of impacts of disinfection on microbial communities in source water is important for optimizing disinfection operations for shrimp farming currently shifts in prokaryotic communities including prokaryotic community compositions pccs and function have been extensively reported in the disinfected drinking water distribution systems dwds jing et al 2023 potgieter et al 2018 indicating a significant reduction in the growth richness and biodiversity of microbes however the bacterial compositions remained unchanged within a stable chlorinated dwds pinto et al 2012 suggesting that the response of pccs to disinfection may rely on bacterial profiling and the residual chlorine concentration due to the presence of disinfectant resistance bacteria drb it is now generally accepted that bacterial communities in dwds may respond to a disinfectant by retaining the same composition resistance returning to its pre disturbance composition or function recovery and speeding up the rate at which this return happens resilience allison and martiny 2008 gomez alvarez et al 2016 shade et al 2012 in general disinfection can lower the number of viable bacteria in the water but cannot eradicate them therefore as disinfectants degrade the microbial communities may recover bertelli et al 2018 duan et al 2020 gomez alvarez et al 2016 the regrowth of bacteria after water chlorination can be observed after 24 h in dwds bertelli et al 2018 suggesting a rapid recovery of pccs in environment bacteria with varying abundances in the community have divergent roles in response to disturbance i e disinfection jiao et al 2019 but mechanisms dominated the recovery after disinfection are largely unknown while disinfection is often untargeted some bacteria may survive owing to resistance and or high post treatment fitness distinct bacterial taxa usually respond differently to disinfection resulting in a diverse potential to recover allison and martiny 2008 in natural ecosystems the microbial communities typically constitute a few abundant species and a large number of rare species each of which plays a specific function in coping with environmental perturbations lynch and neufeld 2015 ning et al 2019 the characteristics and ecological roles of abundant and rare bacteria may be fundamentally different abundant bacteria can contribute to the bulk of biomass and nutrient cycling of microbial communities but rare taxa can provide a vast pool of genetic diversity and functional redundancy to preserve microbial diversity and enhance its resistance or resilience baltar et al 2015 pedrós alió 2012 rare taxa might be metabolically more active than abundant bacteria and thus some rare taxa may possess critical ecological functions campbell et al 2011 jones and lennon 2010 a recent study in freshwater demonstrated that abundant and rare taxa may respond distinctly to chlorine disinfection zhao et al 2020 while the responses of abundant and rare taxa in marine water to single bleaching powder disinfection are still unclear disentangling the roles of abundant and rare bacteria in the disinfection process may provide a better understanding of the recovery of pccs single bleaching powder disinfection is extensively used in shrimp farming practices and the disinfected water is directly pumped into ponds for shrimp rearing after 3 days guo et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 the recovery of pccs after bleaching powder disinfection may significantly lower the disinfection impact putting shrimp farming at risk however the extent to which the pccs recover in this single brief disinfection process is currently unknown therefore the present study was carried out to investigate the recovery of pccs when bleaching powder was used for practical source water disinfection in a shrimp farming pond specifically this study aimed to elucidate 1 patterns of the prokaryotic community recovery 2 the involvement of abundant and rare taxa in the recovery process and 3 the impact of bleaching powder on disinfectant resistance genes drgs and antibiotic resistance genes args by analyzing the impacts of bleaching powder on the pccs it is feasible to deduce the effects of bleaching powder on disease prevention which is also advantageous for guiding the application strategy of bleaching powder in practical shrimp farming 2 materials and methods 2 1 disinfection experiments and sample collection the experiment was conducted in november 2021 at the xiangshan xinyuan agricultural shrimp farm in ningbo 29 477 n 121 869 e zhejiang province china before the experiment seawater was treated with natural deposition and sand filtration then pumped into a canvas pond 10 m in length 6 m in width 4 m in depth fig 1 a the canvas pond was covered by plastic sheds to maintain a consistent temperature seawater in the pond was then disinfected using a typical dose of 120 ppm bleaching powder 28 32 percent of active chlorine initiated by calcium hypochlorite calcium hydroxide and calcium chloride the disinfection effects of bleaching powder are primarily due to the strong oxidative of calcium hypochlorite to ensure the even distribution of bleaching powder in the canvas pond the water circulation system was opened prior to adding the bleaching powder and kept running for 10 min after addition as a conventional factory practice the disinfected seawater is utilized after 72 h as it is widely accepted that bleaching powder will be completely degraded at that time therefore samples were collected for 72 h to simulate the factory production during the 12 sampling time a total of 60 samples were collected using a niskin water sampler with 5 samples collected at each time initial time pre disinfection 0 5 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 12 h 16 h 24 h 32 h 48 h 60 h and 72 h after disinfection fig 1a for each sample about 2 l of surface water was promptly filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size polycarbonate membrane 47 mm diameter millipore usa then stored at 80 c for dna extraction 2 2 bacterial enumeration and water quality analysis the water sample was serially diluted from 10 1 to 10 7 for microbial enumeration and an appropriate dilution was then inoculated into a 2216e agar plate in triplicate and incubated at 27 c for 5 days the bacterial colonies were then counted from the countable plate active chlorine in collected samples was quantified using a pocket colorimeter ii with dpd powder pillows hach company loveland co usa waak et al 2019 an additional 1 l of water was collected for water quality analyses including ammonia nitrite nitrate and phosphate according to the standard methods gb17378 4 2007 water temperature in this canvas pond with plastic sheds is relative stable at 19 5 c 2 3 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing the spineasy dna kit mp bio usa for soil was used to extract total dna from the 60 samples the purified dna was quantified using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies de usa the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primers 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 hai et al 2014 and 806r 5 ggactc anvgggtwtctaat 3 caporaso et al 2011 for each sample triplicate pcr systems were set up for amplification with the following conditions initial denaturation at 95 c for 3 min 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 45 s and final extension at 72 c for 10 min then the triplicate amplifications of each sample were pooled and purified with a pcr fragment purification kit from takara japan before quantification using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent usa lastly the pcr products were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa generating 250 bp paired end reads 2 4 data processing the qiime2 software package was used to process raw 16s rrna amplicon sequences bolyen et al 2019 the dada2 pipeline was used to denoise the sequencing data generating a table of amplicon sequence variants asvs callahan et al 2016 the representative sequences of each asv were selected by the default method and taxonomically classified against the silva 138 database quast et al 2012 asvs characterized as mitochondria chloroplasts and unclassified sequences were deleted and to minimize the bias features with a frequency less than 2 were discarded after that one sample was dropped due to insufficient sequence depth finally the asv abundance table was rarefied to the lowest sequence depth of 14 100 the raw sequence data have been submitted to the genome sequence archive in national genomics data center https bigd big ac cn gsa beijing institute of genomics china national center for bioinformation chinese academy of sciences under accession number cra010059 2 5 statistical analyses the asvs were collapsed to their respective taxonomic ranks in qiime2 to determine the pccs the average relative abundances of all phylum taxa were estimated across all samples additionally for proteobacteria and firmicutes further relative abundance analysis was conducted from class to genus level to evaluate the contribution of microbes to the recovery of the pccs following disinfection the asvs were classified into abundant and rare taxa according to their relative abundance campbell et al 2011 specifically asvs with relative abundances greater than 0 1 in one sample were defined as abundant taxa whereas asvs with less than 0 01 relative abundance across all samples were rare taxa alonso sáez et al 2015 jiao and lu 2020 to determine the compositions of potential pathogens before and after disinfection the representative asv sequences were aligned against the aquatic environmental pathogen genetic database http pathogen umehd com dong et al 2021a and those with more than 99 similarity with the database were classified as pathogens to identify drb after disinfection asvs with relative abundance greater than 1 in 0 5 h or 72 h were considered as drb wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 the β diversity of the total abundant and rare communities was determined by the bray curtis dissimilarity and visualized using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis by ggplot2 package in r valero mora 2010 the differences between prokaryotic communities in initial time and the other sampling time were evaluated based on bray curtis dissimilarity using analysis of similarity anosim in the vegan r package oksanen et al 2018 the community recovery was calculated as the difference in bray curtis similarity 1 bray curtis dissimilarity between each sampling time and the initial time the differences were then evaluated by the mann whitney u test phylogenetic diversity were calculated by qiime2 and visualized by ggplot2 package in r valero mora 2010 community assembly processes are critical in determining pccs during the recovery process after disinfection a null model analysis ning et al 2019 was conducted using the approach described by ning et al to gain insights into these processes to evaluate the relative importance of stochastic processes the stochasticity ratio st was calculated by comparing the ratio of the mean expected similarity of the null communities to the observed similarity the null communities were generated by a null model algorithm ning et al 2019 which randomized the observed community 1000 times the st ratio was then tested using the tnst function in the nst package in r ning et al 2019 the st value greater than 0 5 denotes stochastic processes while a value less than 0 5 indicates deterministic processes 2 6 prediction of functional compositions from prokaryotic communities tax4fun2 an r based tool was used to determine the community functional redundancy index fri for each kegg pathway wemheuer et al 2018 the fri is a functional diversity metric that takes into account both the evolutionary relationships between species and the percentage of species that can carry out a specific function it can be calculated as either an absolute fri afri which is normalized by the average phylogenetic distance of all prokaryotes in the tax4fun2 reference tree or a relative fri rfri which is normalized by the average phylogenetic distance of the community examined in a particular survey the asv table generated by qiime2 was further processed by picrust2 douglas et al 2020 to predict the functional compositions of the prokaryotic communities the picrust2 can generate kegg orthologs kos enzyme classification numbers ecs and metacyc pathway abundances from asv table and the 16s rrna gene sequences the drgs and args were selected as described in previous work li et al 2021b tong et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 and the relative abundance of these genes were acquired from the predicted gene families then the differences in drgs and args between the initial stage and 72 h were analyzed using stamp software inoue et al 2016 the co occurrence network analysis was performed by using spearman s rank correlations between bacterial genera and drgs in the r psych package to examine the relationship between them galafassi et al 2021 only strong spearman s ρ 0 6 and significant fdr adjusted p 0 05 correlations were retained and imported into the r igraph package csardi and nepusz 2005 to generate a gml file the gephi v0 9 2 software was used to visualize the networks bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 active chlorine concentration and abundance of culturable bacteria the active chlorine in the water increased significantly after disinfection reaching its peak after 8 h with a concentration of 5 70 mg l fig 1b after that it decreased gradually reaching the value before bleaching powder addition in 72 h the bacterial number were examined during this short term single disinfection fig 1c at the initial stage the total bacterial count was 2 43 106 cfu ml but it underwent an inactivation rate of over 99 1 at 8 h which could be attributed to the relatively high active chlorine concentration at that time the bacterial count was the lowest at 16 h with a value of 1 07 104 cfu ml after that the bacteria grew rapidly and reached 4 43 106 cfu ml at 72 h which was significantly higher than the initial count as to environmental factors concentrations of ammonia and nitrite decreased after disinfection whereas nitrate and phosphate remained rather steady for 72 h fig s1 3 2 prokaryotic community compositions and recovery patterns after disinfection the pccs changed dramatically within 0 5 h and then the compositions began to recover after 16 h fig 2 a these changes were mainly attributed to gammaproteobacteria and bacilli figs 2a s2 before disinfection the pccs were dominated by gammaproteobacteria with an average relative abundance of 67 0 however its relative abundance dropped sharply to 16 29 within 0 5 h and remained at a low level 4 41 32 63 until 12 h after 16 h it started increasing gradually and recovered to 51 21 in 72 h the relative abundance of bacilli exhibited an inverse trend to that of gammaproteobacteria increasing from an initial 1 24 to 36 33 and 49 18 after 0 5 and 2 h respectively and then slowly declining to 24 32 after 72 h at the family level fig s3 the alteromonadaceae 52 57 dominated the pccs in the initial stage but declined drastically after 0 5 h and was constrained at an extremely low level until 60 h before attaining its final relative abundance of 25 56 in 72 h the relative abundance of bacillaceae increased significantly from 0 5 h to 12 h before declining to a level similar to that of the initial stage after 72 h furthermore changes in alteromonadaceae and bacillaceae were primarily induced by pseudoalteromonas 0 24 19 52 and bacillus 0 44 32 84 fig s4 respectively the observed changes in these bacteria were significantly correlated with the active chlorine concentration fig s5 in comparison to rare taxa the abundant taxa dominated the recovery of pccs fig 2a for abundant taxa significant linear regressions were found between the active chlorine concentration and the proportions from initially abundant taxa r2 0 540 p 0 010 and rare taxa r2 0 610 p 0 005 fig 2b respectively however for rare taxa no such significant linear relationships were found these findings implied that active chlorine concentrations were strongly associated with the changes of abundant taxa which were less stochastic than rare taxa the drb at 0 5 h were belonged to bacillus 23 59 vitellibacter 10 44 maritalea 10 27 and vibrio 7 30 table s1 while staphylococcus 22 65 pseudoalteromonas 8 65 and alteromonas 6 52 were identified as drb at 72 h table s1 among them staphylococcus pseudoalteromonas vibrio pseudomonas and actinobacillus were also identified as potential pathogens fig 2c a total of 93 asvs identified as potential pathogens were found at the initial time accounting for 12 95 of all sequences as opposed to 159 asvs found after 72 h making up 22 14 of all sequences fig 2c the potential pathogens mainly came from 8 genera including staphylococcus 0 17 22 66 pseudoalteromonas 0 24 19 52 cutibacterium 0 14 16 17 vibrio 0 45 16 82 streptococcus 0 11 7 87 acinetobacter 0 25 5 94 mycobacterium 0 06 3 28 and pseudomonas 0 30 2 75 the potential pathogens such as cutibacterium and acinetobacter reached the highest level within 12 to 24 h after disinfection also the relative abundance of vibrio was constant after 48 h while staphylococcus was much more abundant after 32 h figs 2c s4 3 3 prokaryotic community structure and recovery patterns nmds analysis revealed that the total and abundant communities followed a similar successional pattern moving along the inverse of nmds axis 1 before 12 h and subsequently returning to the initial state at 72 h fig 3 a on the other hand an opposite pattern was observed in the rare community anosim analysis showed that prokaryotic communities in each sampling time were significant different from the initial community table s2 additionally changes in bray curtis dissimilarity of the total community were also consistent with those of the abundant community fig 3b the recovery degree of pccs was evaluated as an average difference of bray curtis similarity to the initial time fig 3c overall the total community recovered steadily and reached a high degree of similarity with the initial stage 76 at 72 h indicating that the water pccs attained a high level of recovery before being utilized for shrimp farming the abundant community followed the same trajectory as the total community and had recovered to over 77 similarity after 72 h whereas the recovery of the rare community remained at a consistently low level of 20 phylogenetic diversity increased rapidly after 0 5 h and reached a significant level p 0 006 after 4 h eventually recovering to the initial state at 72 h fig 3d these findings suggested that following disinfection the pccs underwent a rapid recovery process mainly driven by the abundant community 3 4 effects of disinfection on the community assembly processes in the initial stage the st values of the total community were less than 0 5 suggesting that it was governed by deterministic processes fig 4 a after disinfection stochastic processes were dominant in driving the assembly of total abundant and rare communities indicating that stochastic processes play a major role in the reconstruction and recovery process of the prokaryotic communities the st values for the abundant community were lower than those of the rare community indicating that it was less impacted by the stochastic processes when the st of each community were fitted to their corresponding richness the goodness of fit of the rare community r2 0 285 p 0 001 was significantly higher than that of the abundant community r2 0 008 p 0 052 fig 4b confirming that changes in the richness of abundant taxa were less stochastic than rare taxa 3 5 prediction of prokaryotic functional profiles after disinfection based on the bray curtis dissimilarity of the predicted gene table nmds analysis showed that the recovery of total community function followed a similar pattern as the abundant community fig 5 a indicating that the abundant community mainly dominated the recovery of prokaryotic community function anosim analysis showed that prokaryotic community function in each sampling time were significant different from the initial community table s3 also in comparison to the rare community the abundant community offered higher functional redundancy to facilitate the recovery of total community function after disinfection fig 5b the function of total r2 0 405 p 0 001 and abundant r2 0 504 p 0 001 communities aligned well with the composition of total and abundant communities fig s6 suggesting that the recovery of prokaryotic community function is consistent with the recovery of pccs dominated by abundant taxa 3 6 impact of disinfection on drgs and args a total of 15 drgs were found to be significantly different between the initial time and 72 h fig 6 a the number of unique drgs detected was quite high for efflux pump systems 7 genes followed by extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion genes 5 genes at 72 h 5 out of 7 efflux pump system genes namely abca lmrs mdea nora and norb were enriched conversely for eps 4 out of 5 genes including argh phha serb and thrc were downregulated at 72 h the abundance of two biofilm formation related genes sdia and tral changed significantly between the initial time and 72 h the co occurrence network revealed that drgs especially mdea norb tral and lmrs were typically associated with staphylococcus bacillus and pseudoalteromonas fig 6b these taxa mainly belonged to the phyla of bacilli 17 nodes and gammaproteobacteria 16 nodes the potential pathogen staphylococcus had the largest number of correlations with four drgs mdea norb tral and lmrs fig 6b for args 16 args were detected before and after disinfection fig s7a which were affiliated with aminoglycosides 4 β lactams 4 phenicols 2 sulfonamides 2 tetracyclines 2 quinolones 1 and glycopeptides 1 only two args sul1 and vana exhibited significant changes p 0 05 after 0 5 h fig s7b with the former exhibiting a slight increase and the latter displaying a considerable decrease except for meca which was substantially enriched at 72 h all detected args exhibited similar relative abundances compared to the initial time fig s7c these findings imply that disinfection cannot effectively remove args instead some might be enriched during the disinfection process 4 discussion the effectiveness of chlorine containing disinfectants in water safety and disease control is widely accepted bertelli et al 2018 and the associated environmental risks and effects on the microbial communities in freshwater ecosystems have been thoroughly assessed sanawar et al 2017 wang et al 2021 in marine aquaculture water the diverse bacteria in water vary in their susceptibility to disinfectants the residual bacteria after disinfection may affect the final shrimp farming and therefore should be carefully monitored 4 1 the rapid recovery of microbiomes dominated by bacillus and pseudoalteromonas although active chlorine degrades quickly in water fig 1 bleaching powder can still destroy the structure and function of prokaryotic communities however we observed an extremely rapid recovery of pccs after 16 h which was dominated by gammaproteobacteria and bacilli in dwds the relative abundance of proteobacteria was found to be increased with the chlorination of drinking water shi et al 2013 gammaproteobacteria were also reported to be naturally chosen in freshwater habitats due to uv radiation santos et al 2012 similarly a positive correlation between the relative abundance of proteobacteria and chlorine dosage was also reported in the drinking water biofilm mi et al 2015 however the present results were in contrast to these findings as gammaproteobacteria were killed within the initial 0 5 h indicating their sensitivity to disinfection as confirmed in a previous study li et al 2020 proteobacteria the vast majority of which are gram negative are the largest division and most diverse taxa among prokaryotes gupta 2000 it has been observed that some proteobacteria exhibit a high fitness for disinfection chiao et al 2014 and this may be the reason gammaproteobacteria were able to regrow quickly after 16 h the decay and regrowth of gammaproteobacteria were primarily induced by pseudoalteromonas pseudoalteromonas which is ubiquitous in the marine environment was found to be enriched after disinfection in aquaculture water sanawar et al 2017 earlier reports on genome of pseudoalteromonas revealed the presence of a considerable number of proteins e g alkyl hydroperoxide reductase superoxide dismutase yu et al 2013 which can aid it in overcoming oxidative stress induced by disinfectants changes of bacilli exhibited an opposite trend to gammaproteobacteria and this can be attributed to the dramatically increase of bacillus bacterial resistance is the primary driver of changes in relative abundance with bacillus being a well known drb capable of producing intracellular spore to resist disinfection bachmann and edyvean 2005 morente et al 2013 chemical disinfectants need to reactive transport through the spore coat in order to reach the cortex and spore core to damage the vital components secondary disinfection using chlorine dioxide is considered as an efficient option to control spores of bacillus cho et al 2006 in farming practice shrimp disease continues to occur after disinfection and in many cases the disease was induced by residual pathogens it was found that the residual bacteria may be more virulent after disinfection wang et al 2021 in the present study several potential pathogens including staphylococcus pseudoalteromonas cutibacterium and vibrio continued to maintain a high level of abundance even after 72 h members of the staphylococcus are gram positive bacteria that have been proven to be disinfection resistant mckinney and pruden 2012 owing to their thick peptidoglycan coating which shields the cells from disinfection nevertheless the abundance of staphylococcus was not high enough to pose a considerable risk as previously reported sanawar et al 2017 pseudomonas is one of the typical drb genera due to their high eps secretion capacity freitas et al 2011 which was found to be more abundant after ozone disinfection cui et al 2020 and it also emerged as a prominent drb in the present study cutibacterium is a gram positive bacterium with the ability to form biofilms making it well suited to cope with disinfection kuehnast et al 2018 vibrio is a notorious pathogen in shrimp farming that can cause significant economic losses for the industry hoang et al 2022 zheng and bossier 2023 however bleaching powder cannot adequately remove vibrio in 72 h implying that it cannot effectively prevent vibrio infections vibrio parahaemolyticus is commonly found in marine waters worldwide and has been frequently detected in shrimp in our previous studies dong et al 2021b huang et al 2022 and other aquaculture system sorée et al 2023 this bacterium is a major pathogen responsible for foodborne infections primarily associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood leading to acute gastroenteritis in humans su and liu 2007 inadequate disinfection may lead to the proliferation of v parahaemolyticus during subsequent farming practice posing a threat to shrimp quality and human health in dwds microbial communities recovered quickly after disinfection gomez alvarez et al 2016 shaw et al 2015 indicating that the total microbial communities have strong resilience after disturbance in the present study both the high recovery degree of pccs and the function structure were determined by the abundant community the dominant roles of abundant taxa in maintaining community recovery were also reported in agro soil microbiomes jiao et al 2019 harmful algal bloom processes zhang et al 2020 and microcosms with pollutants jiao et al 2017 one explanation for this pattern is that abundant taxa are active with high growth rates while most bacteria are rare due to low growth abundant taxa can adapt to changing conditions by employing a diverse variety of niches and resources whereas rare taxa are more severely influenced by stochasticity jiao et al 2019 as supported by the present findings fig 2b rare taxa may act as a seed bank and might become more prominent abundant taxa to aid the rapid recovery of abundant community in response to environmental disturbances lynch and neufeld 2015 overall the findings highlight the dominant role of abundant taxa in the recovery of pccs and the community function while rare taxa may change more stochasticity in response to disinfection 4 2 ecological stochasticity governed the assembly of prokaryotic communities after disinfection the st ratios are commonly used to evaluate the significance of ecological stochasticity on the assembly of microbial communities ning et al 2019 in our study deterministic processes dominate the initial community assembly but stochastic processes take over immediately after disinfection in the ecological model stochastic processes constitute dispersal speciation and ecological drift stegen et al 2013 in the canvas pond the dispersal effect for microbes can be neglected due to its small size moreover speciation namely the evolution of new species vellend 2016 has limited impact on community assembly during this extremely short period ecological drift derives from random changes in microbial relative abundances which can result from stochastic death birth emigration and immigration vellend 2016 the initial mass mortality of bacteria following the addition of bleaching powder as well as the subsequent regrowth of bacteria contributed to the high levels of ecological drift in community assembly furthermore stochasticity of the rare community was significantly higher than that of the abundant community fig 4 implying that disinfection may primarily alter the relative abundance of rare taxa while affecting the absolute abundance of abundant taxa to a greater extent given that the assembly of pccs after disinfection is stochasticity we can add probiotics to establish aquatic prokaryotic communities which will facilitate subsequent shrimp farming practice for a long time it has been hypothesized that the establishment of the early community is heavily influenced by stochasticity which is critical to understand the observed patterns of microbial abundances in a stable microbial community to test this hypothesis the present study provides an ideal model that integrates the roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in the early assembly stage of prokaryotic communities water microbiomes were nearly destroyed after disinfection and the prokaryotic communities in 0 5 h can be treated as the early community as that in 72 h the strong stochasticity in 0 5 h provided supports for this hypothesis which has been validated in various ecosystems dini andreote et al 2015 martiny et al 2003 we speculated that not only drift but also weak competition between microbes can be a key factor contributing to stochasticity in the early stages of prokaryotic communities 4 3 response of drgs and args to disinfection in the present study the abundant community offers a substantially higher level of functional redundancy for the total prokaryotic communities in contrast to our findings traditionally rare taxa are presumed to serve as nearly limitless reservoirs of genetic and functional diversity contributing to species richness in natural environments carlospedrós 2012 lynch and neufeld 2015 however disinfection is a more powerful and thorough disturbance to microbial communities than natural disturbances and the recovery of microbial communities is more akin to a reconstruction process it was speculated that rare taxa cannot provide an effective response to such a thorough community change in a short time i e 72 h in the present study therefore an abundant rather than rare community may provide more functional diversity and redundancy during prokaryotic community rebuilding according to the pccs a large number of drb remained abundant after disinfection the efflux pumps can be the most rapid and effective resistance mechanism for bacteria to cope with external stress du et al 2018 2015 the considerable rise of the relative abundance of efflux pumps genes particularly lmrs mdea and norb may aid drb to survive the disinfection however bleaching powder can suppress the eps secretion fig 6 which was consistent with a previous study finding that uv h2o2 gac disinfection can reduce enzymatic activity to inhibit eps production huo et al 2021 the co occurrence network revealed that staphylococcus was strongly associated with the efflux pump genes which was ever found in previous studies hassanzadeh et al 2020 tong et al 2021 numerous efflux pump genes were initially identified in staphylococcus tong et al 2021 and staphylococcus aureus a major pathogen has more than 30 putative efflux pumps kuroda et al 2001 due to the considerable public health concern induced by s aureus the application of antibiotics and disinfection may potentially contribute the spread of efflux pump genes as s aureus may not be effectively removed by disinfection to mitigate possible concerns arising from args disinfection measures like chlorination uv and bleaching powder are being utilized more often to improve water quality in dwds and aquaculture to maintain a sanitary environment duan et al 2020 huo et al 2021 sanawar et al 2017 the relative abundance of most args evaluated in this study was not significantly different from the initial time suggesting that bleaching powder does not contribute to args removal previous studies have also reported that chlorination based disinfectants were ineffective in removing args in other water bodies yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 notably args can be horizontally transferred between bacterial hosts including drb and pathogens leading to the continuous persistence of args a previous investigation demonstrated that exposure to disinfectants promotes arg transfer within escherichia coli strains and across genera from e coli to salmonella enterica jin et al 2020 in this study a substantial number of drb in the water might have hindered the effective removal of args at present the potential public health risks associated with the presence of these args in shrimp aquaculture remain uncertain nevertheless the findings of this study indicate that disinfection by bleaching powder has a limited impact on lowering args it is worth noting that the functional profiles in this study were generated from picrust2 prediction which while less precise than metagenomic data can still provide insights into recovery patterns of community function after disinfection 5 conclusions the present study focused on the effects of single bleaching powder disinfection on prokaryotic communities in marine water in contrast to previous studies that mainly focused on dwds wastewater treatment and other freshwater habitats the findings revealed that although pccs were dramatically changed in 0 5 h by bleaching powder both pccs and their functional profiles recovered quickly within 72 h this rapid recovery was primarily attributed to the decay of bacillus and the subsequent resurgence of pseudoalteromonas compared to rare community abundant community played pivotal roles in promoting the recovery of pccs and provided greater functional redundancy aiding in the restoration of community functions args and pathogens such as staphylococcus and pseudoalteromonas cannot be efficiently removed by single bleaching powder disinfection because of the decay of active chlorine and the presence of drb moreover the high level of recovery of pccs after 3 days implied that a single bleaching powder disinfection was ineffective to achieve the goal of disease prevention in shrimp farming thus secondary disinfection or developing novel disinfection technologies is imperative to replace the existing widely used disinfectant measures moreover the stochasticity of the recovery processes suggests that incorporating probiotics into the disinfectant water may aid in creating a more favorable

14689,single bleaching powder disinfection is a highly prevalent practice to disinfect source water for marine aquaculture to prevent diseases however due to the decay of active chlorine and the presence of disinfectant resistance bacteria drb the effects of bleaching powder on prokaryotic community compositions pccs and function in marine water remain unknown in the present study the source water in a canvas pond was treated with the normal dose of bleaching powder and the impact on pccs and functional profiles was investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the bleaching powder strongly altered the pccs within 0 5 h but they began to recover at 16 h eventually achieving 76 similarity with the initial time at 72 h this extremely rapid recovery was primarily driven by the decay of bacillus and the regrowth of pseudoalteromonas both of which are drb abundant community not only help pccs recover but also provide larger functional redundancy than rare community during the recovery of pccs stochastic processes drove the community assembly after 72 h five out of seven identified disinfectant resistance genes related to efflux pump systems were highly enriched primarily in staphylococcus and bacillus however 15 out of the 16 identified antibiotic resistance genes args remained unchanged compared to the initial time indicating that bleaching powder does not contribute to args removal overall the findings demonstrate that single bleaching powder disinfection cannot successfully meet the objective of disease prevention in marine aquaculture water due to the extremely rapid recovery of pccs hence secondary disinfection or novel disinfection strategies should be explored for source water disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bleaching powder disinfection prokaryotic communities disinfectant resistance bacteria marine aquaculture water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disinfection of source water is vital for seawater shrimp farming because pathogens such as bacteria intestinal parasites and viruses pose a severe threat to the aquaculture industry lotz 1997 to prevent the outbreak of diseases and eliminate pathogens chemical disinfectants including bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite caocl2 chlorine dioxide clo2 and sodium hypochlorite naocl are routinely used to disinfect aquaculture water before pumping it to rearing ponds gräslund and bengtsson 2001 li et al 2021a van haute et al 2017 amidst various disinfectants bleaching powder is commonly used due to its strong oxidizing power inexpensive cost and convenient application duan et al 2020 it can directly inactivate microbes by damaging cell membranes altering enzyme activity or disrupting nucleic acids sharma and bhattacharya 2017 despite the fact that these disinfectants are excellent in controlling bacteria shrimp disease induced by pathogens continues to be a major problem in shrimp farming ali et al 2018 moreover it is becoming more evident that disinfectants can also disturb the balance of the microbial communities in the rearing water which is crucial for maintaining the stability of aquaculture ecosystems zhao et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of impacts of disinfection on microbial communities in source water is important for optimizing disinfection operations for shrimp farming currently shifts in prokaryotic communities including prokaryotic community compositions pccs and function have been extensively reported in the disinfected drinking water distribution systems dwds jing et al 2023 potgieter et al 2018 indicating a significant reduction in the growth richness and biodiversity of microbes however the bacterial compositions remained unchanged within a stable chlorinated dwds pinto et al 2012 suggesting that the response of pccs to disinfection may rely on bacterial profiling and the residual chlorine concentration due to the presence of disinfectant resistance bacteria drb it is now generally accepted that bacterial communities in dwds may respond to a disinfectant by retaining the same composition resistance returning to its pre disturbance composition or function recovery and speeding up the rate at which this return happens resilience allison and martiny 2008 gomez alvarez et al 2016 shade et al 2012 in general disinfection can lower the number of viable bacteria in the water but cannot eradicate them therefore as disinfectants degrade the microbial communities may recover bertelli et al 2018 duan et al 2020 gomez alvarez et al 2016 the regrowth of bacteria after water chlorination can be observed after 24 h in dwds bertelli et al 2018 suggesting a rapid recovery of pccs in environment bacteria with varying abundances in the community have divergent roles in response to disturbance i e disinfection jiao et al 2019 but mechanisms dominated the recovery after disinfection are largely unknown while disinfection is often untargeted some bacteria may survive owing to resistance and or high post treatment fitness distinct bacterial taxa usually respond differently to disinfection resulting in a diverse potential to recover allison and martiny 2008 in natural ecosystems the microbial communities typically constitute a few abundant species and a large number of rare species each of which plays a specific function in coping with environmental perturbations lynch and neufeld 2015 ning et al 2019 the characteristics and ecological roles of abundant and rare bacteria may be fundamentally different abundant bacteria can contribute to the bulk of biomass and nutrient cycling of microbial communities but rare taxa can provide a vast pool of genetic diversity and functional redundancy to preserve microbial diversity and enhance its resistance or resilience baltar et al 2015 pedrós alió 2012 rare taxa might be metabolically more active than abundant bacteria and thus some rare taxa may possess critical ecological functions campbell et al 2011 jones and lennon 2010 a recent study in freshwater demonstrated that abundant and rare taxa may respond distinctly to chlorine disinfection zhao et al 2020 while the responses of abundant and rare taxa in marine water to single bleaching powder disinfection are still unclear disentangling the roles of abundant and rare bacteria in the disinfection process may provide a better understanding of the recovery of pccs single bleaching powder disinfection is extensively used in shrimp farming practices and the disinfected water is directly pumped into ponds for shrimp rearing after 3 days guo et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 the recovery of pccs after bleaching powder disinfection may significantly lower the disinfection impact putting shrimp farming at risk however the extent to which the pccs recover in this single brief disinfection process is currently unknown therefore the present study was carried out to investigate the recovery of pccs when bleaching powder was used for practical source water disinfection in a shrimp farming pond specifically this study aimed to elucidate 1 patterns of the prokaryotic community recovery 2 the involvement of abundant and rare taxa in the recovery process and 3 the impact of bleaching powder on disinfectant resistance genes drgs and antibiotic resistance genes args by analyzing the impacts of bleaching powder on the pccs it is feasible to deduce the effects of bleaching powder on disease prevention which is also advantageous for guiding the application strategy of bleaching powder in practical shrimp farming 2 materials and methods 2 1 disinfection experiments and sample collection the experiment was conducted in november 2021 at the xiangshan xinyuan agricultural shrimp farm in ningbo 29 477 n 121 869 e zhejiang province china before the experiment seawater was treated with natural deposition and sand filtration then pumped into a canvas pond 10 m in length 6 m in width 4 m in depth fig 1 a the canvas pond was covered by plastic sheds to maintain a consistent temperature seawater in the pond was then disinfected using a typical dose of 120 ppm bleaching powder 28 32 percent of active chlorine initiated by calcium hypochlorite calcium hydroxide and calcium chloride the disinfection effects of bleaching powder are primarily due to the strong oxidative of calcium hypochlorite to ensure the even distribution of bleaching powder in the canvas pond the water circulation system was opened prior to adding the bleaching powder and kept running for 10 min after addition as a conventional factory practice the disinfected seawater is utilized after 72 h as it is widely accepted that bleaching powder will be completely degraded at that time therefore samples were collected for 72 h to simulate the factory production during the 12 sampling time a total of 60 samples were collected using a niskin water sampler with 5 samples collected at each time initial time pre disinfection 0 5 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 12 h 16 h 24 h 32 h 48 h 60 h and 72 h after disinfection fig 1a for each sample about 2 l of surface water was promptly filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size polycarbonate membrane 47 mm diameter millipore usa then stored at 80 c for dna extraction 2 2 bacterial enumeration and water quality analysis the water sample was serially diluted from 10 1 to 10 7 for microbial enumeration and an appropriate dilution was then inoculated into a 2216e agar plate in triplicate and incubated at 27 c for 5 days the bacterial colonies were then counted from the countable plate active chlorine in collected samples was quantified using a pocket colorimeter ii with dpd powder pillows hach company loveland co usa waak et al 2019 an additional 1 l of water was collected for water quality analyses including ammonia nitrite nitrate and phosphate according to the standard methods gb17378 4 2007 water temperature in this canvas pond with plastic sheds is relative stable at 19 5 c 2 3 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing the spineasy dna kit mp bio usa for soil was used to extract total dna from the 60 samples the purified dna was quantified using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies de usa the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primers 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 hai et al 2014 and 806r 5 ggactc anvgggtwtctaat 3 caporaso et al 2011 for each sample triplicate pcr systems were set up for amplification with the following conditions initial denaturation at 95 c for 3 min 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 45 s and final extension at 72 c for 10 min then the triplicate amplifications of each sample were pooled and purified with a pcr fragment purification kit from takara japan before quantification using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent usa lastly the pcr products were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa generating 250 bp paired end reads 2 4 data processing the qiime2 software package was used to process raw 16s rrna amplicon sequences bolyen et al 2019 the dada2 pipeline was used to denoise the sequencing data generating a table of amplicon sequence variants asvs callahan et al 2016 the representative sequences of each asv were selected by the default method and taxonomically classified against the silva 138 database quast et al 2012 asvs characterized as mitochondria chloroplasts and unclassified sequences were deleted and to minimize the bias features with a frequency less than 2 were discarded after that one sample was dropped due to insufficient sequence depth finally the asv abundance table was rarefied to the lowest sequence depth of 14 100 the raw sequence data have been submitted to the genome sequence archive in national genomics data center https bigd big ac cn gsa beijing institute of genomics china national center for bioinformation chinese academy of sciences under accession number cra010059 2 5 statistical analyses the asvs were collapsed to their respective taxonomic ranks in qiime2 to determine the pccs the average relative abundances of all phylum taxa were estimated across all samples additionally for proteobacteria and firmicutes further relative abundance analysis was conducted from class to genus level to evaluate the contribution of microbes to the recovery of the pccs following disinfection the asvs were classified into abundant and rare taxa according to their relative abundance campbell et al 2011 specifically asvs with relative abundances greater than 0 1 in one sample were defined as abundant taxa whereas asvs with less than 0 01 relative abundance across all samples were rare taxa alonso sáez et al 2015 jiao and lu 2020 to determine the compositions of potential pathogens before and after disinfection the representative asv sequences were aligned against the aquatic environmental pathogen genetic database http pathogen umehd com dong et al 2021a and those with more than 99 similarity with the database were classified as pathogens to identify drb after disinfection asvs with relative abundance greater than 1 in 0 5 h or 72 h were considered as drb wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 the β diversity of the total abundant and rare communities was determined by the bray curtis dissimilarity and visualized using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis by ggplot2 package in r valero mora 2010 the differences between prokaryotic communities in initial time and the other sampling time were evaluated based on bray curtis dissimilarity using analysis of similarity anosim in the vegan r package oksanen et al 2018 the community recovery was calculated as the difference in bray curtis similarity 1 bray curtis dissimilarity between each sampling time and the initial time the differences were then evaluated by the mann whitney u test phylogenetic diversity were calculated by qiime2 and visualized by ggplot2 package in r valero mora 2010 community assembly processes are critical in determining pccs during the recovery process after disinfection a null model analysis ning et al 2019 was conducted using the approach described by ning et al to gain insights into these processes to evaluate the relative importance of stochastic processes the stochasticity ratio st was calculated by comparing the ratio of the mean expected similarity of the null communities to the observed similarity the null communities were generated by a null model algorithm ning et al 2019 which randomized the observed community 1000 times the st ratio was then tested using the tnst function in the nst package in r ning et al 2019 the st value greater than 0 5 denotes stochastic processes while a value less than 0 5 indicates deterministic processes 2 6 prediction of functional compositions from prokaryotic communities tax4fun2 an r based tool was used to determine the community functional redundancy index fri for each kegg pathway wemheuer et al 2018 the fri is a functional diversity metric that takes into account both the evolutionary relationships between species and the percentage of species that can carry out a specific function it can be calculated as either an absolute fri afri which is normalized by the average phylogenetic distance of all prokaryotes in the tax4fun2 reference tree or a relative fri rfri which is normalized by the average phylogenetic distance of the community examined in a particular survey the asv table generated by qiime2 was further processed by picrust2 douglas et al 2020 to predict the functional compositions of the prokaryotic communities the picrust2 can generate kegg orthologs kos enzyme classification numbers ecs and metacyc pathway abundances from asv table and the 16s rrna gene sequences the drgs and args were selected as described in previous work li et al 2021b tong et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 and the relative abundance of these genes were acquired from the predicted gene families then the differences in drgs and args between the initial stage and 72 h were analyzed using stamp software inoue et al 2016 the co occurrence network analysis was performed by using spearman s rank correlations between bacterial genera and drgs in the r psych package to examine the relationship between them galafassi et al 2021 only strong spearman s ρ 0 6 and significant fdr adjusted p 0 05 correlations were retained and imported into the r igraph package csardi and nepusz 2005 to generate a gml file the gephi v0 9 2 software was used to visualize the networks bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 active chlorine concentration and abundance of culturable bacteria the active chlorine in the water increased significantly after disinfection reaching its peak after 8 h with a concentration of 5 70 mg l fig 1b after that it decreased gradually reaching the value before bleaching powder addition in 72 h the bacterial number were examined during this short term single disinfection fig 1c at the initial stage the total bacterial count was 2 43 106 cfu ml but it underwent an inactivation rate of over 99 1 at 8 h which could be attributed to the relatively high active chlorine concentration at that time the bacterial count was the lowest at 16 h with a value of 1 07 104 cfu ml after that the bacteria grew rapidly and reached 4 43 106 cfu ml at 72 h which was significantly higher than the initial count as to environmental factors concentrations of ammonia and nitrite decreased after disinfection whereas nitrate and phosphate remained rather steady for 72 h fig s1 3 2 prokaryotic community compositions and recovery patterns after disinfection the pccs changed dramatically within 0 5 h and then the compositions began to recover after 16 h fig 2 a these changes were mainly attributed to gammaproteobacteria and bacilli figs 2a s2 before disinfection the pccs were dominated by gammaproteobacteria with an average relative abundance of 67 0 however its relative abundance dropped sharply to 16 29 within 0 5 h and remained at a low level 4 41 32 63 until 12 h after 16 h it started increasing gradually and recovered to 51 21 in 72 h the relative abundance of bacilli exhibited an inverse trend to that of gammaproteobacteria increasing from an initial 1 24 to 36 33 and 49 18 after 0 5 and 2 h respectively and then slowly declining to 24 32 after 72 h at the family level fig s3 the alteromonadaceae 52 57 dominated the pccs in the initial stage but declined drastically after 0 5 h and was constrained at an extremely low level until 60 h before attaining its final relative abundance of 25 56 in 72 h the relative abundance of bacillaceae increased significantly from 0 5 h to 12 h before declining to a level similar to that of the initial stage after 72 h furthermore changes in alteromonadaceae and bacillaceae were primarily induced by pseudoalteromonas 0 24 19 52 and bacillus 0 44 32 84 fig s4 respectively the observed changes in these bacteria were significantly correlated with the active chlorine concentration fig s5 in comparison to rare taxa the abundant taxa dominated the recovery of pccs fig 2a for abundant taxa significant linear regressions were found between the active chlorine concentration and the proportions from initially abundant taxa r2 0 540 p 0 010 and rare taxa r2 0 610 p 0 005 fig 2b respectively however for rare taxa no such significant linear relationships were found these findings implied that active chlorine concentrations were strongly associated with the changes of abundant taxa which were less stochastic than rare taxa the drb at 0 5 h were belonged to bacillus 23 59 vitellibacter 10 44 maritalea 10 27 and vibrio 7 30 table s1 while staphylococcus 22 65 pseudoalteromonas 8 65 and alteromonas 6 52 were identified as drb at 72 h table s1 among them staphylococcus pseudoalteromonas vibrio pseudomonas and actinobacillus were also identified as potential pathogens fig 2c a total of 93 asvs identified as potential pathogens were found at the initial time accounting for 12 95 of all sequences as opposed to 159 asvs found after 72 h making up 22 14 of all sequences fig 2c the potential pathogens mainly came from 8 genera including staphylococcus 0 17 22 66 pseudoalteromonas 0 24 19 52 cutibacterium 0 14 16 17 vibrio 0 45 16 82 streptococcus 0 11 7 87 acinetobacter 0 25 5 94 mycobacterium 0 06 3 28 and pseudomonas 0 30 2 75 the potential pathogens such as cutibacterium and acinetobacter reached the highest level within 12 to 24 h after disinfection also the relative abundance of vibrio was constant after 48 h while staphylococcus was much more abundant after 32 h figs 2c s4 3 3 prokaryotic community structure and recovery patterns nmds analysis revealed that the total and abundant communities followed a similar successional pattern moving along the inverse of nmds axis 1 before 12 h and subsequently returning to the initial state at 72 h fig 3 a on the other hand an opposite pattern was observed in the rare community anosim analysis showed that prokaryotic communities in each sampling time were significant different from the initial community table s2 additionally changes in bray curtis dissimilarity of the total community were also consistent with those of the abundant community fig 3b the recovery degree of pccs was evaluated as an average difference of bray curtis similarity to the initial time fig 3c overall the total community recovered steadily and reached a high degree of similarity with the initial stage 76 at 72 h indicating that the water pccs attained a high level of recovery before being utilized for shrimp farming the abundant community followed the same trajectory as the total community and had recovered to over 77 similarity after 72 h whereas the recovery of the rare community remained at a consistently low level of 20 phylogenetic diversity increased rapidly after 0 5 h and reached a significant level p 0 006 after 4 h eventually recovering to the initial state at 72 h fig 3d these findings suggested that following disinfection the pccs underwent a rapid recovery process mainly driven by the abundant community 3 4 effects of disinfection on the community assembly processes in the initial stage the st values of the total community were less than 0 5 suggesting that it was governed by deterministic processes fig 4 a after disinfection stochastic processes were dominant in driving the assembly of total abundant and rare communities indicating that stochastic processes play a major role in the reconstruction and recovery process of the prokaryotic communities the st values for the abundant community were lower than those of the rare community indicating that it was less impacted by the stochastic processes when the st of each community were fitted to their corresponding richness the goodness of fit of the rare community r2 0 285 p 0 001 was significantly higher than that of the abundant community r2 0 008 p 0 052 fig 4b confirming that changes in the richness of abundant taxa were less stochastic than rare taxa 3 5 prediction of prokaryotic functional profiles after disinfection based on the bray curtis dissimilarity of the predicted gene table nmds analysis showed that the recovery of total community function followed a similar pattern as the abundant community fig 5 a indicating that the abundant community mainly dominated the recovery of prokaryotic community function anosim analysis showed that prokaryotic community function in each sampling time were significant different from the initial community table s3 also in comparison to the rare community the abundant community offered higher functional redundancy to facilitate the recovery of total community function after disinfection fig 5b the function of total r2 0 405 p 0 001 and abundant r2 0 504 p 0 001 communities aligned well with the composition of total and abundant communities fig s6 suggesting that the recovery of prokaryotic community function is consistent with the recovery of pccs dominated by abundant taxa 3 6 impact of disinfection on drgs and args a total of 15 drgs were found to be significantly different between the initial time and 72 h fig 6 a the number of unique drgs detected was quite high for efflux pump systems 7 genes followed by extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion genes 5 genes at 72 h 5 out of 7 efflux pump system genes namely abca lmrs mdea nora and norb were enriched conversely for eps 4 out of 5 genes including argh phha serb and thrc were downregulated at 72 h the abundance of two biofilm formation related genes sdia and tral changed significantly between the initial time and 72 h the co occurrence network revealed that drgs especially mdea norb tral and lmrs were typically associated with staphylococcus bacillus and pseudoalteromonas fig 6b these taxa mainly belonged to the phyla of bacilli 17 nodes and gammaproteobacteria 16 nodes the potential pathogen staphylococcus had the largest number of correlations with four drgs mdea norb tral and lmrs fig 6b for args 16 args were detected before and after disinfection fig s7a which were affiliated with aminoglycosides 4 β lactams 4 phenicols 2 sulfonamides 2 tetracyclines 2 quinolones 1 and glycopeptides 1 only two args sul1 and vana exhibited significant changes p 0 05 after 0 5 h fig s7b with the former exhibiting a slight increase and the latter displaying a considerable decrease except for meca which was substantially enriched at 72 h all detected args exhibited similar relative abundances compared to the initial time fig s7c these findings imply that disinfection cannot effectively remove args instead some might be enriched during the disinfection process 4 discussion the effectiveness of chlorine containing disinfectants in water safety and disease control is widely accepted bertelli et al 2018 and the associated environmental risks and effects on the microbial communities in freshwater ecosystems have been thoroughly assessed sanawar et al 2017 wang et al 2021 in marine aquaculture water the diverse bacteria in water vary in their susceptibility to disinfectants the residual bacteria after disinfection may affect the final shrimp farming and therefore should be carefully monitored 4 1 the rapid recovery of microbiomes dominated by bacillus and pseudoalteromonas although active chlorine degrades quickly in water fig 1 bleaching powder can still destroy the structure and function of prokaryotic communities however we observed an extremely rapid recovery of pccs after 16 h which was dominated by gammaproteobacteria and bacilli in dwds the relative abundance of proteobacteria was found to be increased with the chlorination of drinking water shi et al 2013 gammaproteobacteria were also reported to be naturally chosen in freshwater habitats due to uv radiation santos et al 2012 similarly a positive correlation between the relative abundance of proteobacteria and chlorine dosage was also reported in the drinking water biofilm mi et al 2015 however the present results were in contrast to these findings as gammaproteobacteria were killed within the initial 0 5 h indicating their sensitivity to disinfection as confirmed in a previous study li et al 2020 proteobacteria the vast majority of which are gram negative are the largest division and most diverse taxa among prokaryotes gupta 2000 it has been observed that some proteobacteria exhibit a high fitness for disinfection chiao et al 2014 and this may be the reason gammaproteobacteria were able to regrow quickly after 16 h the decay and regrowth of gammaproteobacteria were primarily induced by pseudoalteromonas pseudoalteromonas which is ubiquitous in the marine environment was found to be enriched after disinfection in aquaculture water sanawar et al 2017 earlier reports on genome of pseudoalteromonas revealed the presence of a considerable number of proteins e g alkyl hydroperoxide reductase superoxide dismutase yu et al 2013 which can aid it in overcoming oxidative stress induced by disinfectants changes of bacilli exhibited an opposite trend to gammaproteobacteria and this can be attributed to the dramatically increase of bacillus bacterial resistance is the primary driver of changes in relative abundance with bacillus being a well known drb capable of producing intracellular spore to resist disinfection bachmann and edyvean 2005 morente et al 2013 chemical disinfectants need to reactive transport through the spore coat in order to reach the cortex and spore core to damage the vital components secondary disinfection using chlorine dioxide is considered as an efficient option to control spores of bacillus cho et al 2006 in farming practice shrimp disease continues to occur after disinfection and in many cases the disease was induced by residual pathogens it was found that the residual bacteria may be more virulent after disinfection wang et al 2021 in the present study several potential pathogens including staphylococcus pseudoalteromonas cutibacterium and vibrio continued to maintain a high level of abundance even after 72 h members of the staphylococcus are gram positive bacteria that have been proven to be disinfection resistant mckinney and pruden 2012 owing to their thick peptidoglycan coating which shields the cells from disinfection nevertheless the abundance of staphylococcus was not high enough to pose a considerable risk as previously reported sanawar et al 2017 pseudomonas is one of the typical drb genera due to their high eps secretion capacity freitas et al 2011 which was found to be more abundant after ozone disinfection cui et al 2020 and it also emerged as a prominent drb in the present study cutibacterium is a gram positive bacterium with the ability to form biofilms making it well suited to cope with disinfection kuehnast et al 2018 vibrio is a notorious pathogen in shrimp farming that can cause significant economic losses for the industry hoang et al 2022 zheng and bossier 2023 however bleaching powder cannot adequately remove vibrio in 72 h implying that it cannot effectively prevent vibrio infections vibrio parahaemolyticus is commonly found in marine waters worldwide and has been frequently detected in shrimp in our previous studies dong et al 2021b huang et al 2022 and other aquaculture system sorée et al 2023 this bacterium is a major pathogen responsible for foodborne infections primarily associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood leading to acute gastroenteritis in humans su and liu 2007 inadequate disinfection may lead to the proliferation of v parahaemolyticus during subsequent farming practice posing a threat to shrimp quality and human health in dwds microbial communities recovered quickly after disinfection gomez alvarez et al 2016 shaw et al 2015 indicating that the total microbial communities have strong resilience after disturbance in the present study both the high recovery degree of pccs and the function structure were determined by the abundant community the dominant roles of abundant taxa in maintaining community recovery were also reported in agro soil microbiomes jiao et al 2019 harmful algal bloom processes zhang et al 2020 and microcosms with pollutants jiao et al 2017 one explanation for this pattern is that abundant taxa are active with high growth rates while most bacteria are rare due to low growth abundant taxa can adapt to changing conditions by employing a diverse variety of niches and resources whereas rare taxa are more severely influenced by stochasticity jiao et al 2019 as supported by the present findings fig 2b rare taxa may act as a seed bank and might become more prominent abundant taxa to aid the rapid recovery of abundant community in response to environmental disturbances lynch and neufeld 2015 overall the findings highlight the dominant role of abundant taxa in the recovery of pccs and the community function while rare taxa may change more stochasticity in response to disinfection 4 2 ecological stochasticity governed the assembly of prokaryotic communities after disinfection the st ratios are commonly used to evaluate the significance of ecological stochasticity on the assembly of microbial communities ning et al 2019 in our study deterministic processes dominate the initial community assembly but stochastic processes take over immediately after disinfection in the ecological model stochastic processes constitute dispersal speciation and ecological drift stegen et al 2013 in the canvas pond the dispersal effect for microbes can be neglected due to its small size moreover speciation namely the evolution of new species vellend 2016 has limited impact on community assembly during this extremely short period ecological drift derives from random changes in microbial relative abundances which can result from stochastic death birth emigration and immigration vellend 2016 the initial mass mortality of bacteria following the addition of bleaching powder as well as the subsequent regrowth of bacteria contributed to the high levels of ecological drift in community assembly furthermore stochasticity of the rare community was significantly higher than that of the abundant community fig 4 implying that disinfection may primarily alter the relative abundance of rare taxa while affecting the absolute abundance of abundant taxa to a greater extent given that the assembly of pccs after disinfection is stochasticity we can add probiotics to establish aquatic prokaryotic communities which will facilitate subsequent shrimp farming practice for a long time it has been hypothesized that the establishment of the early community is heavily influenced by stochasticity which is critical to understand the observed patterns of microbial abundances in a stable microbial community to test this hypothesis the present study provides an ideal model that integrates the roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in the early assembly stage of prokaryotic communities water microbiomes were nearly destroyed after disinfection and the prokaryotic communities in 0 5 h can be treated as the early community as that in 72 h the strong stochasticity in 0 5 h provided supports for this hypothesis which has been validated in various ecosystems dini andreote et al 2015 martiny et al 2003 we speculated that not only drift but also weak competition between microbes can be a key factor contributing to stochasticity in the early stages of prokaryotic communities 4 3 response of drgs and args to disinfection in the present study the abundant community offers a substantially higher level of functional redundancy for the total prokaryotic communities in contrast to our findings traditionally rare taxa are presumed to serve as nearly limitless reservoirs of genetic and functional diversity contributing to species richness in natural environments carlospedrós 2012 lynch and neufeld 2015 however disinfection is a more powerful and thorough disturbance to microbial communities than natural disturbances and the recovery of microbial communities is more akin to a reconstruction process it was speculated that rare taxa cannot provide an effective response to such a thorough community change in a short time i e 72 h in the present study therefore an abundant rather than rare community may provide more functional diversity and redundancy during prokaryotic community rebuilding according to the pccs a large number of drb remained abundant after disinfection the efflux pumps can be the most rapid and effective resistance mechanism for bacteria to cope with external stress du et al 2018 2015 the considerable rise of the relative abundance of efflux pumps genes particularly lmrs mdea and norb may aid drb to survive the disinfection however bleaching powder can suppress the eps secretion fig 6 which was consistent with a previous study finding that uv h2o2 gac disinfection can reduce enzymatic activity to inhibit eps production huo et al 2021 the co occurrence network revealed that staphylococcus was strongly associated with the efflux pump genes which was ever found in previous studies hassanzadeh et al 2020 tong et al 2021 numerous efflux pump genes were initially identified in staphylococcus tong et al 2021 and staphylococcus aureus a major pathogen has more than 30 putative efflux pumps kuroda et al 2001 due to the considerable public health concern induced by s aureus the application of antibiotics and disinfection may potentially contribute the spread of efflux pump genes as s aureus may not be effectively removed by disinfection to mitigate possible concerns arising from args disinfection measures like chlorination uv and bleaching powder are being utilized more often to improve water quality in dwds and aquaculture to maintain a sanitary environment duan et al 2020 huo et al 2021 sanawar et al 2017 the relative abundance of most args evaluated in this study was not significantly different from the initial time suggesting that bleaching powder does not contribute to args removal previous studies have also reported that chlorination based disinfectants were ineffective in removing args in other water bodies yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 notably args can be horizontally transferred between bacterial hosts including drb and pathogens leading to the continuous persistence of args a previous investigation demonstrated that exposure to disinfectants promotes arg transfer within escherichia coli strains and across genera from e coli to salmonella enterica jin et al 2020 in this study a substantial number of drb in the water might have hindered the effective removal of args at present the potential public health risks associated with the presence of these args in shrimp aquaculture remain uncertain nevertheless the findings of this study indicate that disinfection by bleaching powder has a limited impact on lowering args it is worth noting that the functional profiles in this study were generated from picrust2 prediction which while less precise than metagenomic data can still provide insights into recovery patterns of community function after disinfection 5 conclusions the present study focused on the effects of single bleaching powder disinfection on prokaryotic communities in marine water in contrast to previous studies that mainly focused on dwds wastewater treatment and other freshwater habitats the findings revealed that although pccs were dramatically changed in 0 5 h by bleaching powder both pccs and their functional profiles recovered quickly within 72 h this rapid recovery was primarily attributed to the decay of bacillus and the subsequent resurgence of pseudoalteromonas compared to rare community abundant community played pivotal roles in promoting the recovery of pccs and provided greater functional redundancy aiding in the restoration of community functions args and pathogens such as staphylococcus and pseudoalteromonas cannot be efficiently removed by single bleaching powder disinfection because of the decay of active chlorine and the presence of drb moreover the high level of recovery of pccs after 3 days implied that a single bleaching powder disinfection was ineffective to achieve the goal of disease prevention in shrimp farming thus secondary disinfection or developing novel disinfection technologies is imperative to replace the existing widely used disinfectant measures moreover the stochasticity of the recovery processes suggests that incorporating probiotics into the disinfectant water may aid in creating a more favorable
