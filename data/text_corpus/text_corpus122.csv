610,multivariate calibration of large scale hydrologic models the necessity and value of a pareto optimal approach akash koppa mekonnen gebremichael william w g yeh department of civil and environmental engineering university of california los angeles ca 90095 usa department of civil and environmental engineering university of california los angeles ca 90095 usa department of civil and environmental engineering university of california los angeles ca 90095 usa corresponding author multivariate calibration using measurements of multiple water balance components has emerged as a potential solution for improving the performance and realism of large scale hydrologic models in this study we develop a novel multivariate calibration framework to rigorously test whether incorporation of multiple water balance components into calibration can result in sufficiently accurate behavioral solutions for all model responses unlike previous studies we use bayesian calibration to formally define limits of acceptability or error thresholds in order to distinguish behavioral solutions for each of the incorporated fluxes we apply the framework in the mississippi river basin for the calibration of a large scale distributed hydrologic model noah mp with different combinations of model responses evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and streamflow sf the results of the study show that incorporation of additional fluxes and soil moisture a storage variable is not always valuable due to significant trade offs in accuracy among the model responses in our experiments only et and sf could be simulated simultaneously to a reasonable degree of accuracy in addition we quantify the trade offs in accuracy between the model responses using the concept of pareto optimality we find that combining et with other fluxes entails higher trade offs in accuracy compared to either sm or sf unlike deterministic calibration with the developed framework we are able to identify deficiencies in model parameterization that lead to significant trade offs in accuracy especially between et and sm we find that the parameters which are insensitive to individual model responses can influence the trade off relationship between them keywords multivariate calibration bayesian calibration large scale hydrologic modelling pareto optimality 1 introduction the widespread use of large scale hydrologic and land surface models lsms in snow christensen and lettenmaier 2007 li et al 2017 drought leng et al 2015 sheffield et al 2004 and climate change middelkoop et al 2001 cuo et al 2013 studies necessitates critical examination of the adopted calibration methodologies the general approach of calibrating the models with measurements of a single flux typically streamflow is considered inadequate for such studies that require other water balance components to be simulated accurately rakovec et al 2016a evaluate the performance of the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm calibrated with streamflow sf against observed evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and total water storage tws the study concludes that calibrating hydrologic models with only streamflow may not be sufficient for accurate simulation of other water balance components wanders et al 2014 calibrate the lisflood hydrologic model with remotely sensed soil moisture datasets the results of the study show that calibrating the hydrologic model with only soil moisture negatively affects the accuracy of the corresponding streamflow simulation compared to streamflow calibrated model results lópez lópez et al 2017 confirm the findings of the other studies calibrating a hydrologic model with only et or sm adversely affects the accuracy of streamflow simulation compared to streamflow calibrated model results in zink et al 2018 a land surface model calibrated with land surface temperature leads to higher errors in streamflow simulations compared to a streamflow calibrated model incorporating multiple fluxes and other water balance components into the calibration process has emerged as a consensus solution to address the adverse effects of single objective calibration a number of different methods have been employed to calibrate hydrologic and land surface models with multiple fluxes including stepwise calibration lópez lópez et al 2017 sutanudjaja et al 2013 ensemble kalman filter wanders et al 2014 and simultaneous calibration by combining objective functions rientjes et al 2013 rakovec et al 2016b zink et al 2018 irrespective of the calibration strategy adopted all the studies report improvements in the simulation of the added flux or storage component while maintaining the accuracy of the primary variable of interest the improvements are also consistent across different water balance components incorporated into calibration including evapotranspiration rientjes et al 2013 lópez lópez et al 2017 zink et al 2018 soil moisture sutanudjaja et al 2013 wanders et al 2014 and total water storage rakovec et al 2016b although the enumerated studies provide evidence in favor of multivariate calibration we identify shortcomings in these approaches that hinder comprehensive quantification of the value of incorporating additional fluxes first multivariate calibration studies do not define any limits of acceptability or error thresholds to determine whether the model can simultaneously reproduce the incorporated water balance components such as et sm sf and tws to a sufficient degree of accuracy to illustrate the importance of defining limits of acceptability consider the results of rakovec et al 2016b wherein the addition of tws estimates into calibration along with streamflow reduce the root mean square error rmse of tws simulations at negligible cost to the accuracy of streamflow simulation a closer analysis of the results reveals that despite reduction in the rmse of tws the absolute value of rmse is still significantly large fig 3 in rakovec et al 2016b whereas the rmse of standardized anomalies of streamflow has a median of approximately 0 5 the rmse of tws is approximately 0 8 reduced from 0 9 for the sf calibrated model without defining a threshold for acceptable error it is difficult to assess whether the reported reduction in tws error is sufficient evidence to conclude that the incorporation of an additional flux actually improves the realism of the model second most studies consider the relationship among different water balance components to be complementary but all the results with the exception of wanders et al 2014 point towards a trade off relationship by definition a complementary relationship would mean that incorporation of additional fluxes and other water balance components improves the accuracy of all the incorporated fluxes the objective functions of calibration and the calibration methodologies such as stepwise calibration are constructed to reflect the assumption of a complementary relationship even in wanders et al 2014 the improvement in sf accuracy when sm is incorporated compared with a streamflow calibrated model is limited to small catchments in addition the results of multivariate calibration rarely are compared with results of models calibrated only with the additional flux such a comparison would help in quantifying the potential trade offs in simulating the two water balance components accurately for example in rakovec et al 2016b the model is not calibrated with only tws which would help understand the trade off in tws accuracy required to achieve acceptable sf accuracy in studies where all the calibration cases are reported there are significant trade offs among the different fluxes or state variables considered for calibration rientjes et al 2013 even in zink et al 2018 where the objective function is designed to produce a compromise solution between the sf and et fluxes there is no discussion of either the magnitude of trade off in the accuracy of et or of whether such trade offs are within acceptable limits third the trade off relationship among the simulated water balance components implicit in the results of multivariate calibration studies may be a consequence of deficiencies in model structure and parameterizations fenicia et al 2007 hogue et al 2006 however in the calibration strategies adopted in most studies including the assumption of a complementary relationship among the fluxes and or other water balance components combining objectives and lack of a definition of error thresholds prevent any meaningful diagnoses of the model for example the limitations of the stepwise calibration methodology for identifying deficiencies in model structure and parameterizations are well known fenicia et al 2007 additionally most multivariate calibration studies are deterministic and hence are inappropriate for studying the differences in optimal parameter sets between univariate and multivariate calibration cases as they do not address the issue of equifinality beven 1996 2001 even in studies that use stochastic methods such as ensemble kalman filter wanders et al 2014 there is little discussion on how parameters behave between different calibration cases in this study we combine a formal bayesian calibration approach with the concept of pareto optimality to address the issues detailed above we utilize a formal bayesian calibration approach to define the limits of acceptability or error thresholds in order to distinguish between behavioral and non behavioral solutions beven 2006 vrugt et al 2009a for each of the incorporated water balance components behavioral solutions are model parameter sets that result in errors that are within a defined threshold or limit with respect to a specific simulated response for example et or sm if a trade off relationship does exist among the incorporated water balance components as opposed to a complementary relationship the concept of pareto optimality would help in understanding the extent to which the accuracy of a particular water balance component can be improved without affecting to an unreasonable degree the accuracy of other water balance components in addition pareto optimal solutions are unbiased by any subjective weights given to any particular flux or water balance component over another unlike simultaneous calibration strategies gupta et al 1998 hence we use pareto optimality based calibration to create a set of non dominated solutions that characterize the trade offs among the incorporated variables we develop a multivariate calibration framework that combines behavioral solutions from bayesian calibration and multivariate calibration solutions to address the following research questions 1 does incorporation of multiple fluxes and other water balance components into calibration produce parameter distributions that are behavioral with respect to all water balance components considered for calibration 2 for a given large scale hydrologic model what is the extent of trade off if any in accurate simulations of multiple water balance components considered for calibration 3 can behavioral and multivariate calibration solutions help identify deficiencies in hydrologic model parameterization that lead to trade offs in the accurate simulations of multiple variables 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual framework consider a hydrologic model 1 o μ θ i where o is a matrix consisting of model output or responses such as evapotranspiration soil moisture streamflow etc i is a matrix consisting of model input meteorological forcings such as precipitation air temperature etc μ represents the mathematical structure of the hydrologic model typically a deterministic or stochastic function such that μ i o and θis a vector of model parameters kavetski et al 2006 given a matrix of observations o a measure l can be defined as 2 l e θ o θ o s where e is the error residual matrix l is a measure or metric that preserves the information contained in the residuals such as mean absolute error or root mean square error and s is some scalar quantity that represents the value of l assuming that the model structure μ and the upper and lower limits of the parameters θ are fixed the feasible bounds for eq 2 termed as the objective space can be defined gupta et al 1998 a conceptual representation of a feasible objective space for two objectives l 1 and l 2 is shown in fig 1 in traditional model calibration an optimal parameter set θ is identified by minimizing eq 2 l 1 l θ 1 and l 2 l θ 2 are the optimal values for objective 1 and 2 in fig 1 using formal or informal bayesian approaches it is also possible to identify sets of parameters θ b that result in behavioral solutions based on a defined cut off threshold vrugt et al 2009a l 1 b l θ 1 b are behavioral solutions for objective 1 represented by the objective space to the left of the cut off threshold e 1 and l 2 b l θ 2 b are the behavioral solutions for objective 2 represented by the objective space below e2 in fig 1 to quantify the trade offs among multiple objectives l 1 and l 2in this example the concept of pareto optimality can be used this results in a set of parameters θ p that give rise to non dominated or pareto optimal solutions for the objectives considered l 1 2 p l θ 1 2 p are the pareto optimal solutions for two objectives represented by the points along the red line in fig 1 in this study the measure l is the root mean square error rmse and the model responses o considered for calibration are evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and streamflow sf to address the first research question we test the following hypothesis 3 l 1 2 n p b l 1 2 n p l 1 b l 2 b l n b where l 1 2 n p is the non dominated or pareto optimal solutions for n objectives l 1 b l 2 b l n b is the intersection of behavioral solutions for n objectives blue space in fig 1 for two objectives l 1 2 n p b are solutions that are both non dominated and behavioral with respect to n objectives blue points in fig 1 and represents an empty set in other words for incorporation of multiple water balance components in hydrologic model calibration to be considered valuable it should be possible to identify a set of parameters that result in both pareto optimal and behavioral solutions for all the water balance components considered in calibration we note that in defining the hypothesis we have considered only non dominated or pareto optimal solutions in the multi objective space blue points in fig 1 however any solution within the behavioral limits non dominated or dominated can be considered as valid multivariate calibration solution in such cases the hypothesis to be tested reduces to l 1 b l 2 b l n b in other words the intersection of behavioral solutions for n objectives in the multivariate space blue space in fig 1 must be a non empty set in this study we only focus on the pareto optimal solutions to test the hypothesis eq 3 and analyze the trade off among accurate simulations of multiple water balance components in addition the behavioral solutions from bayesian calibration and the pareto optimal solutions are discrete unlike the representation in fig 1 therefore the probability of finding an intersection between the two is extremely low hence the non dominated solutions l 1 2 n p that lie within the error thresholds or limits of acceptability e1 e2 en are considered as l 1 2 n p b fig 1 provides an example for two objectives we test the above hypothesis eq 3 for different pairs of model responses n 2 1 et and sm 2 et and sf and 3 sm and sf in summary the developed multivariate calibration methodology consists of the following steps 1 define the limits of acceptability or cutoff error thresholds rmse in this study for the model responses incorporated into calibration et sm and sf in this study 2 determine the pareto optimal solutions for the combination of model responses et sm et sf sm sf in this study 3 test the hypothesis eq 3 and diagnose deficiencies in model parameterization using behavioral and the pareto optimal solutions fig 2 2 2 defining limits of acceptability for individual model responses to define the limits of acceptability e1 and e2 we adopt a formal bayesian approach to derive the posterior distribution of model error rmse and parameters for individual model responses et sm and sf specifically we utilize the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream markov chain monte carlo mcmc scheme vrugt et al 2009b 2008 that has been applied to bayesian or uncertainty based calibration of hydrologic shafii et al 2014 and hydrogeologic laloy et al 2013 models there is a specific reason for using dream in this study unlike informal bayesian approaches such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 the definition of cutoff thresholds to distinguish behavioral solutions is not subjective instead of rejecting solutions based on a subjectively defined threshold dream uses a formal likelihood function to assign probabilities to all the solutions that form the final converged posterior distribution as a result a specific quantile of the sampled probability distribution can be considered the cutoff threshold for distinguishing behavioral solutions vrugt et al 2009a in this study we assume no apriori knowledge about the value of error rmse thresholds for any of the model responses et sm and sf instead we determine a set of limits of acceptability corresponding to 10 25 50 75 90 95 and 99 quantiles from the posterior distribution of rmse derived using dream for et sm and sf note that the likelihood function in dream considers error residuals and not rmse to determine the posterior distribution of parameters recent advances such as approximate bayesian computation has enabled the use of summary statistics and error metrics such as rmse for diagnostic model calibration vrugt and sadegh 2013 sadegh and vrugt 2014 and evaluation gupta et al 2008 we do not use these methods in this study as they require apriori definition of the limits of acceptability similar to glue we note that the dream solutions in this study are derived using residual and likelihood based fitting methods whereas the pareto optimal solutions are derived using rmse as the objective function described below 2 3 pareto optimal solutions for combination of model responses the value of using the concept of pareto optimality for calibration of hydrologic models is well documented gupta et al 1998 studies have focused on identifying the best objective functions for improving streamflow calibration efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 developing systematic multi objective calibration frameworks madsen 2003 and analyzing the resulting pareto fronts khu and madsen 2005 multi objective methods have been applied at small scales to constrain land surface model parameters gupta et al 1999 and evaluate model performance and parameter behavior hogue et al 2006 however the utility of such an approach for multivariate calibration and diagnosis of large scale hydrologic models has received relatively less attention in this study we use a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 and rmse as the objective function to derive non dominated solutions for the following combinations of model responses 1 et and sm et sm 2 et and sf et sf and 3 sm and sf sm sf 2 4 hypothesis testing trade off analysis and model diagnosis to understand whether the models can accurately simulate multiple water balance components we combine the behavioral solutions from dream and the pareto optimal solutions from amalgam as detailed above specifically we test the hypothesis defined in eq 3 the set of non dominated solutions derived for different combinations of water balance components et sm et sf and sm sf is a non empty set for a particular behavioral limit 10 25 50 75 90 95 and 99 quantiles from the posterior distribution of rmse if a particular combination of water balance components has at least one pareto optimal point within a stricter definition of error threshold compared to another combination then the model is better at simulating the former combination of water balance components together for example consider that the et sm combination has at least one pareto optimal solution within the 50 quantile error thresholds on the other hand consider that the et sf combination has at least one pareto optimal solution within the 25 quantile error thresholds in such a case it can be concluded that it is valuable to incorporate et and sf together compared to et and sm to study the trade off in the accuracy of the simulated model responses we analyze the pareto front qualitatively and quantitatively qualitatively a well defined pareto front implies that the incorporated model water balance components exhibit a trade off relationship as opposed to a complementary relationship quantitatively the range of the objectives and the slope of the pareto front can help compare different pareto fronts in order to understand the trade off relationship between the different combinations of water balance components specifically we define magnitude of trade off as the increase in the error of a specific model response required to affect a unit decrease in the error of the additional water balance component we calculate and compare the average maximum and minimum magnitude of trade off for each of the three multivariate calibration cases from the slopes of the pareto front to diagnose the reasons for trade offs in accuracy among different model responses we study the differences in model parameter distributions among 1 behavioral solutions of individual responses 2 behavioral solutions of individual model responses and behavioral pareto optimal solutions and 3 behavioral solutions of individual responses and pareto optimal solutions that are not behavioral for any model response we compare the empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdfs and quantiles of parameters to help identify parameters that most affect model behavior when additional water balance components are incorporated we quantify the difference between the pdfs of the parameters using hellinger s distance h a statistical distance measure defined as 4 h p q 1 2 i 1 k p 1 q i 2 where p p 1 p 2 pk and q q 1 q 2 qk are discrete probability distributions we determine the kolmogorov smirnov ks test statistic to compare the ecdfs of different parameter distributions the ks test statistic determines the maximum distance between two ecdfs in addition we examine how well the objective functions in the pareto optimal solutions are correlated with the corresponding parameter sets this will help us map the changes in parameter values along the pareto front and identify parameters that influence the trade off relationship between the objectives 3 experiment design 3 1 study area and time period to simulate large scale hydrologic studies we choose the mississippi basin in the united states as the study region the basin covers an area of about 3 3 million sq km and six usgs huc 2 hydrologic unit code basins fig 3 the average temperature over the basin is about 12 c and the annual average rainfall is estimated as 800 mm cai et al 2014 cai et al 2014 also classify the ohio and tennessee regions as wet regions the missouri basin as dry and the upper mississippi region as a transitional region between wet and dry we use historical data from the year 2004 for calibration and data from the year 2005 for validation employing a monthly time step 72 streamflow data points and approximately 63 000 et and sm data points are used for calibration the reasons for selecting a single year for calibration and validation of the model are two fold 1 the study is a calibration experiment that does not seek to produce the best performing hydrologic model for the mississippi river basin rather the primary aim is to rigorously test whether large scale hydrologic models can behaviorally simulate multiple water balance components and study the reasons behind the trade offs if any among accurate simulations of multiple water balance components 2 the forward hydrologic model used in the study is computationally expensive 3 2 observational data to simulate studies that use a sparse network of streamflow gauges for the calibration of hydrologic models we use the computed monthly runoff for the six huc 2 basins sourced from usgs for calibrating the hydrologic model with remotely sensed et we use monthly estimates from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 we select gleam et based on the findings of koppa and gebremichael 2017 in which gleam avhrr and modis et datasets were ranked using a framework based on the budyko hypothesis a semi empirical model that describes long term water and energy balance of catchments budyko 1974 the spatial resolution of the gleam dataset is 0 25 0 25 we use monthly soil moisture estimates from esa cci dorigo et al 2017 for calibrating the hydrologic model with sm the esa cci dataset is selected based on the availability of data for the study period the spatial resolution of the esa cci dataset is 0 25 0 25 we note that the esa cci soil moisture measurements correspond to the top 5 cm of the soil layer but the top soil layer of the hydrologic model detailed below is 10 cm although the unit of measurement is m3 m3 this difference in soil layer depths may lead to systematic bias and needs to be corrected we adjust the values of simulated soil moisture to match the statistics of the observed dataset based on lópez lópez et al 2017 as 5 s m s i m σ s m o b s σ s m s i m s m s i m s m s i m s m o b s where s m s i m is the scaled simulated soil moisture σ s m o b s and σ s m s i m are the standard deviations of the observed and simulated soil moisture smsim is the simulated soil moisture to be scaled and s m o b s and s m s i m are the means of the observed and simulated soil moisture 3 3 setup of the hydrologic model to replicate studies that use spatially distributed models we choose the noah mp multi parameterization land surface model lsm niu et al 2011 driven through nasa s land information system lis kumar et al 2006 the noah mp model builds on the original noah lsm by incorporating a dynamic groundwater model improved representation of vegetation canopy and snow pack cai et al 2014 provide a detailed description and a comprehensive evaluation of the model over the mississippi river basin all the static input datasets required for running the noah mp model are sourced from nasa s lis data portal https portal nccs nasa gov lisdata the important static input datasets are the land cover map sourced from usgs the soil texture map from statsgo sourced from usda and the elevation map from gtopo30 sourced from usgs albedo greenness fraction and temperature are sourced from ncep reanalysis the meteorological forcings required by the noah mp model include precipitation air temperature surface pressure specific humidity wind speed and radiation all meteorological forcings are derived from global data assimilation system gdas from the environmental modeling center emc of the national center for environment protection ncep derber et al 1991 the spatial resolution of the dataset is 0 47 0 47 the meteorological inputs are interpolated onto the model grid using bilinear interpolation to minimize the adverse effects of mismatch in the spatial resolution of the model and the reference datasets samaniego et al 2010 2017 the noah mp model is set up for the mississippi river basin at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 similar to the resolution of gleam et and esa cci sm the noah mp model is spun up for a period of 68 years by looping through the year 2003 until the groundwater and soil moisture storage reach equilibrium the model time step is three hours the number of soil layers in the model is four with thicknesses 10 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 100 cm specific noah mp model physics options selected for different processes are detailed in table 1 the noah mp model contains 71 standard parameters present in user defined tables and 139 hard coded parameters present in the model code the noah mp model output has been found to be sensitive to about two thirds of the 71 standard parameters cuntz et al 2016 as the study is a calibration experiment involving multiple calibration cases we keep the parameter dimension of the calibration problem manageable by selecting five of the most sensitive parameters from the cuntz et al 2016 study the selected parameters are two surface runoff related parameters refdk and refkdt the exponent in the brooks corey equation bb soil porosity maxsmc and hydraulic conductivity at saturation satdk of the five parameters bb maxsmc and satdk are related to soil texture based on cuntz et al 2016 et is sensitive to bb and maxsmc parameters sf surface and subsurface runoff combined is sensitive to all the five parameters with higher sensitivity to refdk and refkdt parameters according to cai et al 2014 sm exhibits higher sensitivity to maxsmc satdk as there are twelve soil texture classes the total number of parameters selected for calibration in the noah mp hydrologic model is 38 table 2 presents a detailed breakdown of the parameters with maximum and minimum values used for calibration we select the minimum and maximum values of the parameters from literature maxsmc and satdk values from cai et al 2014 bb and refdk values from cosby et al 1984 and refkdt values from mendoza et al 2015 we subjectively adjust the minimum and maximum values to improve the rate of convergence of the calibration algorithms 3 4 setup of dream and amalgam algorithms dream is a multi chain markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation algorithm that automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution en route to the target distribution it is designed for increasing the sampling efficiency of complex high dimensional parameter spaces while maintaining detailed balance and ergodicity vrugt 2016 in this study we use the mt dream zs version of dream which utilizes multi try sampling mt snooker updating and sampling from an archive of past states to improve the rate of convergence and make use of parallel computing resources specific configuration options and parameters of the mt dream zs algorithm used in this study are detailed in table 4 we select the laplacian likelihood based on the findings of schoups and vrugt 2010 residual errors in rainfall runoff models of humid basins like the mississippi basin in fig 4 d most basins are within aridity index of 1 0 are better represented by a laplacian distribution than a gaussian distribution the likelihood function is used to summarize the distance between the model simulations and the corresponding reference estimates for et and sm variables error residuals determined at all 0 25 0 25 grid cells and time steps monthly across the entire mississippi river basin all six huc 2 basins together are used to determine the likelihood function similarly sf error residuals are determined using simulated and observed runoff at all six huc 2 basins and all months of the calibration period on a workstation with 16 processors mt dream zs required approximately 16 days 14 500 iterations to converge to a solution for each of the model responses et sm and sf with each iteration of the noah mp model taking around 20 minutes to complete the multi objective calibration algorithm amalgam combines the strengths of multiple evolutionary algorithms to improve the speed and efficiency of finding the pareto optimal solutions for multi objective optimization problems vrugt and robinson 2007 in the current implementation four search algorithms are run simultaneously in amalgam differential evolution storn and price 1997 particle swarm optimization kennedy and eberhart 2001 adaptive metropolis haario et al 2001 and nsga ii deb et al 2002 in amalgam offspring creation is adaptive the best performing algorithms in the present generation are weighted more in the creation of offspring for the next generation specific configuration options and parameter values of the amalgam algorithm used in this study are detailed in table 3 as stated in the methodology section the objective function is the root mean square error metric for et and sm rmse is estimated by calculating the error between the modeled and the observed quantities at each 0 25 0 25 grid cell inside the entire mississippi river basin and at each time step each month of the year 2004 for sf error residuals calculated for all six huc 2 basins and twelve months are used for estimating rmse in other words the calibration of the noah mp model is carried out for the entire mississippi river basin using a single objective function laplacian likelihood in the case of dream and rmse in the case of amalgam and not for the individual huc 2 basins on a 16 processor workstation each of the three multi objective calibration scenarios et and sm et and sf sm and sf required around 10 days 9000 iterations to arrive at the final pareto front 4 results and discussion first we setup a synthetic numerical experiment to test whether the univariate calibration algorithm dream can uncover the true parameter values with one year of calibration data for et sm and sf variables next we present the results of the noah mp model validation for the three model responses under consideration evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and streamflow sf to help understand the impact of calibrating the noah mp model with a single water balance component et sm and sf on other model responses and to define the limits of acceptability we present the results of the posterior distributions of model errors rmse from dream we then test the central hypothesis of this study eq 3 by combining the limits of acceptability and the multivariate calibration solutions from amalgam next we address the second research question by analyzing the trade offs among accurate simulations of et sm and sf as represented by the pareto fronts finally we show how the developed multivariate calibration framework can help diagnose deficiencies in model parameterization 4 1 synthetic experiment a synthetic numerical experiment is setup in the study domain fig 3 to test whether the dream bayesian calibration algorithm can successfully uncover the true parameter values that were used to generate the observations the duration of the experiment is one year first we use the noah mp model to generate synthetic observations of et sm and sf using a predetermined set of parameter values for this we select the same set of five parameters that are used for the real case study table 2 we use the mean of the parameter ranges as the true value for each individual parameter table 3 for example the true parameter value of refdk is chosen as 4 0e 06 the noah mp model is run using the true parameter values and the meteorological forcing for the year 2004 to generate synthetic observations of et sm and sf these synthetic observations of et sm and sf are then used to calibrate the noah mp hydrologic model without knowing the true parameter values the configuration and computational budget of the dream algorithm is consistent with that of the real case study table 4 we compare the resulting parameter distributions from the three calibration cases et sm and sf to test whether the calibrated values converge to the true parameter values table 3 presents the results of the synthetic numerical experiment from table 3 it is evident that the calibration of the noah mp model using the synthetic observations converges to the true values for all three cases et sm and sf for the streamflow related parameters refdk and refkdt calibration with synthetic et and sf observations produced the best convergence in terms of mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution of the other parameters the highest variance is seen in the parameter bb although the mean of the posterior distributions are close to the true parameter value the standard deviation is high all the calibration cases et sm and sf converge to the true parameter values for maxsmc and satdk values in the subsequent sections we present the results of the application of the calibration framework for the mississippi river basin 4 2 validation of the noah mp hydrologic model to ascertain whether the noah mp model and the parameters considered for calibration can simulate et sm and sf accurately we evaluate the model for the year 2005 for this we select a parameter set from the dream solutions that results in the lowest rmse value for each of the model responses et sm and sf thus having three parameter sets each representing a benchmark for et sm and sf variables we present a time series comparison of observed and simulated monthly et sm and sf for the six huc 2 sub catchments fig 4a when the noah mp model is calibrated with gleam et top panel it is evident that the model performs very well in simulating the observed et values and seasonality one exception is the underestimation of et in the summer months for all regions except the ohio region the results are consistent across the six huc 2 hydrologic regions in the calibration first 12 data points and validation time periods remaining 12 data points the close match between modeled and observed et is reflected in the scatter plots of the annual totals of et as well fig 4b relatively higher variance is observed in the sm simulations when the noah mp model is calibrated with esa cci soil moisture middle panel the simulated soil moisture for all the regions is quantitatively consistent with the observed sm values for the top soil layer however we see some discrepancy in the seasonality of soil moisture between the simulated and observed soil moisture it is especially pronounced in the last six months of 2005 in the tennessee region middle panel fifth column and the first few months of 2004 in the arkansas white region middle panel first column in the missouri region middle panel third column the model simulates the observed seasonality but is unable to capture the peaks in the observed sm perfectly in the upper mississippi region middle panel sixth column the model has difficulty in simulating the timing of the troughs may and june of 2004 and 2005 seen in the observed sm similar to the et results the annual average sm consistently matches the observed values for all six huc 2 basins fig 4b the results for streamflow simulated by the sf calibrated noah mp model present a more consistent picture bottom panel they show that the model generally performs well for all six huc 2 catchments however similar to soil moisture results there are some inconsistencies in simulating the seasonality of the last six months of 2005 especially in the arkansas white red bottom panel first column the ohio bottom panel fourth column and the upper mississippi bottom panel sixth column regions the model also performs well in the lower mississippi and missouri regions but the peaks are higher in 2004 june and july compared with the observed streamflow time series at annual timescales the sf calibrated noah mp model overestimates sf for the year 2005 in the ohio basin june to october 2005 we see that the errors in evapotranspiration and streamflow are comparable to the results of the ma et al 2017 study for the six huc 2 sub basins considered in this study ma et al 2017 report a rmse of about 10 mm month whereas the rmse in this study is about 18 mm month the average rmse of et calculated over the entire us by ma et al 2017 is about 10 mm month which matches the rmse of the time series of et presented in fig 4 about 10 mm month we note that the ma et al 2017 study does not calibrate the noah mp model in addition the ma et al 2017 uses fluxnet et data as reference observations for calculating the rmse 4 3 posterior distributions of model errors we present the posterior distribution of model response errors rmse using probability density and empirical cumulative distribution functions pdf and ecdf fig 5 the pdfs and cdfs of three model responses et top panel sm middle panel and sf bottom panel are constructed for three calibration objectives et green sm orange and sf blue first we analyze the impact of calibrating the noah mp hydrologic model with only streamflow blue on et top panel and sm middle panel our results confirm the findings of previous studies calibrating a hydrologic model with only sf adversely affects the accuracy of other model responses rakovec et al 2016a b while the 50 quantile of the et error increases by about 15 mm month the sm error increases by around 0 1 m3 m3 the same conclusion can be extended for univariate calibration with other variables et and sm for example when the noah mp model is calibrated with sm orange the errors in et top panel and sf bottom panel are very high some results stand out from fig 5 1 the error distribution of sf produced with the et calibrated model is close to the error distribution of sf from the sf calibrated model green and blue plots in bottom panel this finding reinforces the results of previous studies that use et for calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 lópez lópez et al 2017 zink et al 2018 however the absolute difference between the 50 quantiles is still around 20 mm month indicating a significant impact on sf accuracy due to univariate calibration of the model with et 2 similarly sf calibration seems to produce lower errors for sm compared to et middle panel but the absolute errors are still very high 3 neither sm nor sf calibration can simulate et with reasonable accuracy as seen by the disparate error distributions top panel in fact both sm and sf produce similar error distributions for et evident by the ecdfs blue and orange for comparison the rmse of et and sf are higher than the mean monthly water balance closure error seen in the reference dataset about 9 mm month therefore the rmse values of et and sf are not significantly biased by the errors in the reference datasets as represented by the water balance closure error we derive the limits of acceptability for et sm and sf from the posterior distributions of rmse the error thresholds are defined at 10 25 50 75 90 95 and 99 quantiles table 5 the table shows that the range of the quantiles is quite low for et about 4 mm month between the 10 and 95 quantiles and sm about 0 02 m3 m3 between the 10 and 95 quantiles this is reflected in the well defined posterior distributions of et and sm errors when the model is calibrated with et fig 5 green top panel and sm fig 5 orange middle panel in the case of sf the difference between the 10 and 95 quantiles is about 17 mm month this discrepancy maybe due to the higher number of data points available for calibrating et and sm spatially distributed reference datasets compared to sf point data 4 4 hypothesis testing using dream and amalgam solutions to address the first research question we test the hypothesis that the intersection of behavioral from dream and non dominated solutions from amalgam is a non empty set eq 3 we present the pareto fronts of the rmse of different combinations of model responses et sm et sf sm sf along with different limits of acceptability table 6 in fig 6 as stated in the methodology section multivariate calibration with evolutionary algorithms such as amalgam may result in pareto fronts with lesser numbers of non dominated solutions compared with the initial population size in this study we focus only on the pareto optimal solutions red stars in fig 6 the non dominated or pareto optimal solutions are also used to analyze the pareto fronts and quantify the trade offs next section we present the number of pareto optimal solutions of different combinations of model responses that lie within specific rmse thresholds in table 6 for the combination of et and sm model responses fig 6a we see that the hypothesis eq 3 fails for all defined error thresholds except for the 95 and 99 quantiles table 6 for specific values even at the 95 quantile where the et and sm error thresholds are quite high 30 6 mm month for et and 0 126 m3 m3 for sm only 12 points in the multivariate space can be classified as behavioral we note that the points near the tails of the pareto front are well within individual error thresholds of et and sm therefore we conclude that the noah mp model is unable to simultaneously simulate both et and sm with reasonable accuracy even though the incorporation of et and sm can improve the errors in both the variables it does not result in improving the realism of the model itself lending credence to assertion that the relationship between et and sm may not be complementary the results are consistent with those of univariate calibration using dream wherein the distributions of the et and sm calibrated model responses have considerable discrepancies between them compare et calibrated et and sm calibrated et top panel of fig 5 and sm calibrated sm and et calibrated sm middle panel of fig 5 in contrast to et and sm the model performs very well in simulating both et and sf accurately fig 6b even at a stricter error threshold of 50 quantile of individual et and sf errors table 5 around 12 points out of the 29 pareto optimal points can be classified as behavioral table 6 at the error threshold of the 95 quantile all 29 pareto optimal solutions are behavioral this along with the fact that the range of errors in the pareto front is quite small shows that the relationship between et and sf can be considered complementary in other words the incorporation of et into sf calibration can improve et simulation while maintaining the accuracy of sf within reasonable error thresholds as seen in fig 5 the presence of a complementary relationship between et and sf is hinted in the posterior distributions pdf and ecdf of et and sf errors sf calibrated sf blue and et calibrated sf green in the bottom panel this result also provides support for studies that incorporate et and sf into calibration such as zink et al 2018 where incorporation of et improved et error by 8 while the nse of sf reduced by 6 which could be within the limits of acceptability for the combination of sm and sf flux the hypothesis fails for the lower error thresholds 10 50 quantiles at higher quantiles 75 and greater where the absolute value of the sf error threshold is greater than 32 mm month table 5 relatively more pareto optimal solutions are classified as behavioral compared to the et sm combination this relative improvement in performance also is reflected in the posterior distribution of individual model response errors middle panel in fig 5 we see that the error distribution of sf calibrated sm blue is closer to the sm calibrated sm orange compared with the et calibrated sm green this combined with the results of the et sm pareto front shows that incorporation of a storage component such as sm may not lead to improved model performance for multiple water balance components compared with the incorporation of et the performance of the sf sm combination is in line with the findings of wanders et al 2014 where there are improvements in sf and sm performance when sm is incorporated into calibration this also highlights the advantages of defining limits of acceptability and casting multivariate calibration as a trade off problem similarly the results show the drawbacks of assuming a complementary relationship between the model responses for example in rakovec et al 2016b the incorporation of tws improves the rmse normalized of tws from 0 9 to 0 8 with low impact to sf performance however without the specification of an error threshold it cannot be determined whether the rmse of 0 8 is behavioral in other words the solution may lie on the pareto front but may still be outside the limits of acceptability therefore the realism of the model may not have improved to a sufficient degree due to the incorporation of an additional water balance component 4 5 understanding the trade offs using pareto fronts the results of the hypothesis tests could be a consequence of the nature of trade offs between the objectives of multivariate calibration as represented by the pareto fronts fig 6 in this section we address research question 2 and diagnose the results of hypothesis testing we analyze the characteristics of the trade offs in accurately simulating the three combinations of model responses incorporated into calibration 1 et sm 2 et sf and 3 sm sf a visual analysis of the pareto fronts fig 6 reveals that the et sm and sm sf fronts are relatively well defined compared to the et sf pareto front the ill defined et sf pareto front could be an indication that the relationship between et and sf is complementary as opposed to a trade off relationship we compare the number of non dominated solutions in the multivariate space to test whether these numbers reflect the conclusions of the visual analysis we see that the et sm front has the highest number of non dominated solutions 123 solutions followed by sm sf 74 solutions and then et sf 29 solutions the higher number of non dominated or pareto optimal solutions in the et sm front can also indicate a strong trade off relationship between the et and sm model responses compared with other combinations this qualitatively seems to confirm the conclusions drawn from testing the central hypothesis of this study first it is consistently more difficult to accurately simulate et and sm together compared with other combinations on the other end of the spectrum the et and sf fluxes are more complementary to each other considering 1 the ill defined shape of the pareto front and 2 the lesser number 29 of pareto optimal solutions in the case of sm and sf model responses fig 6c the higher accuracy of the sf calibrated hydrologic model in simulating sm compared with an et calibrated model middle panel in fig 5 translates to a lesser number of non dominated solutions compared with the et and sm combination however the number of pareto optimal solutions is not a quantitative measure of the trade off among the water balance components as they depend on the optimization algorithm used next we analyze the accuracy trade offs in simulating the combination of model responses quantitatively first we compare the range of the objective functions in each of the three multivariate calibration cases in the case of et and sf the range of the two objectives is very small compared with other combinations for example the rmse of et flux ranges from 25 5 mm month to 41 7 mm month in the et sm combination whereas in the et sf combination the range is between 22 5 mm month and 28 9 mm month similarly the range of sf in the et sf combination 25 2 34 1 mm month is lower than in the sm sf combination 24 1 81 3 mm month also the sm range is lower in the sm sf combination 0 07 to 0 14 m3 m3 compared to the et sm combination 0 08 0 24 m3 m3 lower ranges of the objectives in the et sf combination imply that both et and sf can be simulated together to a reasonable degree of accuracy lower ranges also may point toward a lower trade off between two objectives however due to differences in the units of the objective functions and different ranges across the three pareto fronts more analysis is required to draw conclusions finally we compare the magnitude of trade offs defined in the methodology section across the pareto fronts of the three calibration cases et sm et sf and sm sf to enable comparison of the trade offs across the three pareto fronts we normalize the errors in each of the model responses et sm and sf by the maximum error determined over all three combinations to derive the trade off matrix table 7 we fit a second degree polynomial to the non dominated points red stars in fig 6 of the three combinations of model responses et sm r 2 0 92 et sf r 2 0 82 and sm sf r 2 0 96 next we divide the pareto fronts into 15 equally spaced segments we then calculate the average maximum and minimum trade offs from either the slopes or the inverse of the slopes of the 15 segments for each combination of the three model responses for the combination of et and sm first row second column in table 7 the average increase in the error of et required to affect a unit decrease in the error of sm is 2 0 units for the same improvement the sf error trade off is only 0 7 units implying a larger trade off in the et sm combination compared with the sm sf combination for soil moisture confirming this conclusion we see that the average trade off in et accuracy required to improve sf is much lower than the trade off required to improve sm it is interesting to note that there is a higher trade off in sf accuracy to achieve a unit improvement in et compared to the trade off in sm accuracy to achieve the same improvement in et first column in table 7 however as fig 6 shows more et sf multivariate calibration solutions are behavioral compared to et sm solutions and the range of errors is much lower in the et sf combination 4 6 model diagnosis unlike deterministic calibration where a single optimal parameter set is derived the multivariate calibration framework developed in this study enables the examination of parameter behavior among multiple calibration objectives hogue et al 2006 demonstrated the advantages of pareto calibration for studying model performance and parameter behavior in this study we explore the advantages of combining behavioral solutions from bayesian calibration and pareto optimal solutions from multivariate calibration for model diagnosis the objective is to identify parameters that can explain the significant trade offs in accuracy among the multiple fluxes and storage variable incorporated into calibration specifically we try to investigate the reasons behind the higher magnitude of trade offs in the et sm and et sf cases we first compare the posterior probability distributions of calibrated parameters for the univariate calibration cases et sm and sf to identify the parameters that govern the performance of the noah mp model with respect to the et sm and sf responses fig 7 presents a comparison of the ecdfs of the five parameters considered for calibration in this study refdk refkdt bb maxsmc and satdk we note that the ecdfs for parameters bb maxsmc and satdk have been constructed by aggregating parameter solutions from all 12 soil classes table 2 to keep the analysis consistent with multivariate calibration results presented later we only consider behavioral solutions that are within a threshold of the 50 quantile the ecdfs of the runoff parameters refdk and refkdt explain the performance of the noah mp model with respect to streamflow for different univariate calibration cases we see that the ecdfs of both refdk and refkdt for the sm calibrated model orange are quite different from the sf calibrated model blue leading to relatively poor performance fig 5 we see that the refdk parameter distribution from the et calibrated model green is closer to the refdk parameter distribution from the sf calibrated model blue compared to the sm calibrated model orange on the other hand the refkdt parameter distributions from the et calibrated and sm calibrated models are considerably different from the sf calibrated model this shows that the relatively better performance of the et calibrated model for the sf flux compared to the sm calibrated model is more influenced by the refdk parameter we quantify these differences between the parameter pdfs using the hellinger s distance for pdfs eq 4 and the distance between their ecdfs using the kolmogorov smirnov ks test statistic the distance measures are presented in the form of a heat map in which each grid cell represents the statistical distance between the corresponding parameter distributions for example the first grid cell in the first panel of fig 8 a represents the hellinger s distance between the pdfs of the refdk parameter generated from the et calibrated model first column and the sf calibrated model first row the three rows in each panel correspond to the univariate calibration objectives et sm and sf and the six columns correspond to both the univariate and multivariate calibration objectives et sm et sf and sm sf we see that the hellinger s distance between the refdk distributions generated from the et calibrated model and the sf calibrated model third column and third row is less than the distance between the distributions generated from the sm calibrated model and the sf calibrated model third column and second row this difference is more pronounced in the ks statistic heat map fig 8b as far as et is concerned the inability of both the sm and sf calibrated models to accurately simulate et can be attributed to differences in the posterior distributions of the bb and maxsmc parameters as pointed out by cuntz et al 2016 the runoff parameters also can influence the et and sm results as they affect the model s water balance this fact is evident in the case of sm performance for which the parameter distributions from both the sm calibrated and sf calibrated models for bb maxsmc and satdk are similar however there is a large difference in the distributions of the runoff parameters refdk and refkdt fig 8 the analysis of posterior distributions of parameters from univariate calibration presented above agrees with the results of sensitivity analysis of the noah mp model parameters cuntz et al 2016 as land surface models are highly complex in terms of parameterization the same conclusions may not hold when multiple fluxes and state variables are incorporated into calibration we calculate the correlation between the objective functions rmse for the combinations of model responses et sm et sf and sm sf and the corresponding parameters refdk rekdt bb maxsmc and satdk in other words we map the behavior of the parameters along the pareto front from table 8 it is clear that most parameters show opposite correlation for the pair of objectives for the combination of et and sm objectives parameters refdk and bb show strong correlation with both et positive and sm negative errors this may indicate that these parameters are more responsible for the higher trade off in accuracy slope of the pareto curve between et and sm seen in fig 6 most parameters have almost equal magnitude but different signs of correlation with the objective functions except for refkdt in the et sf combination it is clear that the magnitude of correlation between the objective functions and the parameters are significantly lower than the correlations for the et sm combination this clearly reflects the lesser trade off and better simultaneous simulations of et and sf compared with et and sm it is interesting to note the higher correlation for the refdk parameter compared with refkdt considering that the difference between the et calibrated and sf calibrated refkdt parameters was higher than the refdk parameter this shows that the parameters that govern model performance for individual water balance component may not correspond to the parameters that affect the trade off among the combination of water balance components also it highlights the advantage of employing pareto based calibration a similar conclusion can be drawn when sm and sf are combined we see that the trade offs are governed by bb and maxsmc parameters and not the refdk or refkdt variables that govern the performance of sf next we compare the parameter distributions of behavioral multivariate calibration solutions of the et sf combination with parameter distributions of models calibrated with only et and sf behavioral solutions with respect to both incorporated model responses are derived at the 50 quantile threshold table 5 as the number of et sf pareto optimal solutions within the 50 behavioral threshold are few 12 we use both the pareto optimal and dominated solutions 40 to derive the ecdfs of the five parameters we note that the forty pareto optimal and dominated solutions used for deriving the parameter distributions are behavioral within 50 error quantile and therefore can be considered as valid multivariate calibration solutions in addition we stress here that unlike dream the parameter distributions derived from multivariate calibration are not true posterior distributions therefore we intend to use the analysis of parameter distributions from multivariate calibration only as a tool to investigate difference in parameter values between univariate and multivariate calibration solutions first we compare the distance between behavioral et sf and sf calibrated solutions we see that the parameter distribution of the refkdt parameter in the et sf calibrated model is much closer to the refkdt distribution in the sf calibrated model fifth column and first row in fig 8 compared with the refkdt distribution in the et calibrated model fifth column and third row in fig 8 however the hellinger s distance and ks statistic between the et calibrated and sf calibrated models first column and first row in fig 8 for the refdk parameter is smaller compared to the distance between behavioral et sf solutions and the sf calibrated model fifth column and first row in fig 8 in fact the incorporation of et and sf into the calibration only improves the refkdt parameter distribution and all other parameters show greater distances compared with parameters derived from models calibrated with only et or sf this shows that the surface runoff parameter refkdt is very dominant in governing the behavioral simulation of both the et and sf fluxes finally we try to determine the reasons for the poor combined simulation of the et sm and sm sf variables to do this we compare the multivariate calibration solutions from the et sm and sm sf calibration cases that are not behavioral with respect to any of the individual fluxes or storage variable in models calibrated with only the individual fluxes or storage variable et sm and sf considering the case of the et sm combination we see that the incorporation of both the et and sm responses reduce the distances between the distributions of parameters that govern et fourth column and third row for bb maxsmc and satdk in fig 8 compared with the sm calibrated model fourth column and second row for bb maxsmc and satdk in fig 8 however the distributions of the refdk variable which seem to influence the trade off in accuracy between the et and sm variable table 8 deviate significantly from the sf calibrated model compare hellinger s distance between the et sm combination and sf and the et sm combination and et for the refdk parameter in fig 8 this shows that a surface runoff parameter such as refdk can influence the combined simulation of et and sm we can draw a similar conclusion in the case of sm sf where the incorporation of sm and sf improves the performance of the runoff parameters refdk and refkdt compared with the sm calibrated model however the parameter that seems to influence the trade off more maxsmc shows degradation compared with the sm calibrated model it is interesting to note that the combination of sm and sf adversely affects a soil moisture parameter even though sm has been incorporated 5 conclusions and future work with the rise in availability of satellite based measurements of hydrologic fluxes and states lettenmaier et al 2015 multivariate calibration is widely seen as a promising solution for improving the performance and realism of large scale hydrologic models however most multivariate calibration studies do not formally define any acceptable error thresholds to help one conclude whether incorporation of additional water balance components into calibration improves either the performance or the realism of a hydrologic model in addition apriori assumptions such as complementary relationships between the different water balance components and deterministic calibration approaches hinder rigorous testing and diagnosis of hydrologic models as called for by beven 2018 in this study we develop a framework for multivariate calibration by combining bayesian and pareto optimality based calibration methodologies this framework can be used to test whether models simultaneously can simulate multiple water balance components accurately by accepting or rejecting parameter solutions based on a defined error threshold applying the framework to a large scale distributed hydrologic model noah mp we find that the model simulates different combinations of different fluxes and a storage variable et and sm et and sf and sm and sf with varying degrees of acceptability while et and sf can be simulated accurately we find that accurately simulating either et or sf along with sm is associated with significant trade offs analyzing the trade offs between the model responses table 7 we find that the higher trade offs are mainly due to the fact that et cannot be simulated accurately by calibrating the model with the other fluxes or storage variable however calibrating the model with et produces lower error for sf fig 5 this highlights the advantage of using a pareto based calibration approach which does not assume any subjective weights in its objectives unlike deterministic calibration methodologies we use parameter distributions from dream and amalgam to identify the parameters that cause significant trade offs in accuracy between simulated fluxes and a storage variable in addition to sensitive parameters that influence the behavioral simulation of model responses we identify parameters that influence the trade offs for example in the case of the noah mp model tested in this study we see that the runoff parameter refdk and the exponent in the brooks corey equation bb influence the trade off between et and sm this not only shows the advantages of framing multivariate calibration as a pareto optimality problem but also highlights the fact that relatively insensitive parameters such as refdk for et and sm can exert a big influence on the accurate simulation of multiple water balance components we note that the results and conclusions we present in this study are for a specific combination of hydrologic model input datasets reference data and model parameters for a different hydrologic model or calibration approach the value of incorporating different water balance components and the relationship between them may be different for example the time period considered for calibration is one year and the study area is the mississippi river basin the calibrated parameters may not be applicable to a river basin with different physical characteristics and hydroclimatic conditions the higher errors in the simulated water balance components fig 4 may be due to the chosen calibration period of one year this is especially true for streamflow as only 72 data points six basins and 12 months were used for calibration as opposed to around 60 000 data points all the grid cells for et and sm increasing the calibration period or the number of parameters may lead to improved accuracy in the simulation of the water balance components and hence lower behavioral thresholds and improved pareto optimal solutions however the multivariate calibration framework developed in this study is model and data independent and can be used to analyze the value of every flux or state variable under consideration future work involves extending the current study in several ways first we wish to incorporate more than two water balance components into the calibration to see if it changes the nature of trade offs for example in the case of et and sm it would be interesting to see if incorporating sf reduces the overall trade offs in accuracy among the water balance components as refdk is a runoff related parameter that affects the trade off between et and sm incorporating sf could lead to better discovery of refdk second incorporating estimates of total water storage tws could yield better performance than the near surface soil moisture estimates used in this study third applying the developed framework to different hydrologic models and conducting inter model comparison studies would help in model selection finally the developed framework can help in the development testing and diagnosis of new hydrologic models and model hypotheses

due to differences in retrieval algorithms and sensors kidd and huffman 2011 gebregiorgis and hossain 2014 thus necessitating the need for validating the chosen et and sm datasets with ground based measurements we compare the gleam estimates with ground based flux tower measurements from the ameriflux network https ameriflux lbl gov a scatter plot of gleam versus ameriflux et for 2004 shows that gleam is capable of representing the et flux in all the sub basins to a fair degree of accuracy fig a1 a the rmse of gleam data is estimated to be 21 4 mm month for validating esa cci sm data we make use of near surface soil moisture measurements from the tamu north american soil moisture database nasmdb quiring et al 2016 for the study period sm sensors from only three of the six sub basins are

satellite based datasets are used together in multivariate calibration we quantify the error in the closure of water balance fig a1c and a1d first we compare the annual et over the six huc 2 catchments in the study area with the difference between precipitation p and runoff q for the years 2000 2009 from fig a1c it is evident that the errors in the closure of water balance are quite low for most of the catchments the exceptions are three years in the lower mississippi and tennessee regions in which inter annual storage soil moisture and groundwater changes may play an important role importantly the water balance closure errors for the calibration and validation periods are low across all the regions including the lower mississippi and tennessee regions the mean annual water balance closure error from reference datasets p et q averaged over the entire mississippi basin is about 108 mm year 9 mm month when the water balance components are summed over the entire basin the water balance closure error is approximately 640 mm 53 mm month we also make sure that the reference datasets do not exceed catchment scale water and energy limits as described by the budyko

that all catchments are closely clustered around the budyko curve except for the missouri region all catchments are also within the energy and water limits dotted lines in fig a1d

environmental engineering university of california los angeles ca 90095 usa corresponding author multivariate calibration using measurements of multiple water balance components has emerged as a potential solution for improving the performance and realism of large scale hydrologic models in this study we develop a novel multivariate calibration framework to rigorously test whether incorporation of multiple water balance components into calibration can result in sufficiently accurate behavioral solutions for all model responses unlike previous studies we use bayesian calibration to formally define limits of acceptability or error thresholds in order to distinguish behavioral solutions for each of the incorporated fluxes we apply the framework in the mississippi river basin for the calibration of a large scale distributed hydrologic model noah mp with different combinations of model responses evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and streamflow sf the results of the study show that incorporation of additional fluxes and soil moisture a storage variable is not always valuable due to significant trade offs in accuracy among the model responses in our experiments only et and sf could be simulated simultaneously to a reasonable degree of accuracy in addition we quantify the trade offs in accuracy between the model responses using the concept of pareto optimality we find that combining et with other fluxes entails higher trade offs in accuracy compared to either sm or sf unlike deterministic calibration with the developed framework we are able to identify deficiencies in model parameterization that lead to significant trade offs in accuracy especially between et and sm we find that the parameters which are insensitive to individual model responses can influence the trade off relationship between them keywords multivariate calibration bayesian calibration large scale hydrologic modelling pareto optimality 1 introduction the widespread use of large scale hydrologic and land surface models lsms in snow christensen and lettenmaier 2007 li et al 2017 drought leng et al 2015 sheffield et al 2004 and climate change middelkoop et al 2001 cuo et al 2013 studies necessitates critical examination of the adopted calibration methodologies the general approach of calibrating the models with measurements of a single flux typically streamflow is considered inadequate for such studies that require other water balance components to be simulated accurately rakovec et al 2016a evaluate the performance of the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm calibrated with streamflow sf against observed evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and total water storage tws the study concludes that calibrating hydrologic models with only streamflow may not be sufficient for accurate simulation of other water balance components wanders et al 2014 calibrate the lisflood hydrologic model with remotely sensed soil moisture datasets the results of the study show that calibrating the hydrologic model with only soil moisture negatively affects the accuracy of the corresponding streamflow simulation compared to streamflow calibrated model results lópez lópez et al 2017 confirm the findings of the other studies calibrating a hydrologic model with only et or sm adversely affects the accuracy of streamflow simulation compared to streamflow calibrated model results in zink et al 2018 a land surface model calibrated with land surface temperature leads to higher errors in streamflow simulations compared to a streamflow calibrated model incorporating multiple fluxes and other water balance components into the calibration process has emerged as a consensus solution to address the adverse effects of single objective calibration a number of different methods have been employed to calibrate hydrologic and land surface models with multiple fluxes including stepwise calibration lópez lópez et al 2017 sutanudjaja et al 2013 ensemble kalman filter wanders et al 2014 and simultaneous calibration by combining objective functions rientjes et al 2013 rakovec et al 2016b zink et al 2018 irrespective of the calibration strategy adopted all the studies report improvements in the simulation of the added flux or storage component while maintaining the accuracy of the primary variable of interest the improvements are also consistent across different water balance components incorporated into calibration including evapotranspiration rientjes et al 2013 lópez lópez et al 2017 zink et al 2018 soil moisture sutanudjaja et al 2013 wanders et al 2014 and total water storage rakovec et al 2016b although the enumerated studies provide evidence in favor of multivariate calibration we identify shortcomings in these approaches that hinder comprehensive quantification of the value of incorporating additional fluxes first multivariate calibration studies do not define any limits of acceptability or error thresholds to determine whether the model can simultaneously reproduce the incorporated water balance components such as et sm sf and tws to a sufficient degree of accuracy to illustrate the importance of defining limits of acceptability consider the results of rakovec et al 2016b wherein the addition of tws estimates into calibration along with streamflow reduce the root mean square error rmse of tws simulations at negligible cost to the accuracy of streamflow simulation a closer analysis of the results reveals that despite reduction in the rmse of tws the absolute value of rmse is still significantly large fig 3 in rakovec et al 2016b whereas the rmse of standardized anomalies of streamflow has a median of approximately 0 5 the rmse of tws is approximately 0 8 reduced from 0 9 for the sf calibrated model without defining a threshold for acceptable error it is difficult to assess whether the reported reduction in tws error is sufficient evidence to conclude that the incorporation of an additional flux actually improves the realism of the model second most studies consider the relationship among different water balance components to be complementary but all the results with the exception of wanders et al 2014 point towards a trade off relationship by definition a complementary relationship would mean that incorporation of additional fluxes and other water balance components improves the accuracy of all the incorporated fluxes the objective functions of calibration and the calibration methodologies such as stepwise calibration are constructed to reflect the assumption of a complementary relationship even in wanders et al 2014 the improvement in sf accuracy when sm is incorporated compared with a streamflow calibrated model is limited to small catchments in addition the results of multivariate calibration rarely are compared with results of models calibrated only with the additional flux such a comparison would help in quantifying the potential trade offs in simulating the two water balance components accurately for example in rakovec et al 2016b the model is not calibrated with only tws which would help understand the trade off in tws accuracy required to achieve acceptable sf accuracy in studies where all the calibration cases are reported there are significant trade offs among the different fluxes or state variables considered for calibration rientjes et al 2013 even in zink et al 2018 where the objective function is designed to produce a compromise solution between the sf and et fluxes there is no discussion of either the magnitude of trade off in the accuracy of et or of whether such trade offs are within acceptable limits third the trade off relationship among the simulated water balance components implicit in the results of multivariate calibration studies may be a consequence of deficiencies in model structure and parameterizations fenicia et al 2007 hogue et al 2006 however in the calibration strategies adopted in most studies including the assumption of a complementary relationship among the fluxes and or other water balance components combining objectives and lack of a definition of error thresholds prevent any meaningful diagnoses of the model for example the limitations of the stepwise calibration methodology for identifying deficiencies in model structure and parameterizations are well known fenicia et al 2007 additionally most multivariate calibration studies are deterministic and hence are inappropriate for studying the differences in optimal parameter sets between univariate and multivariate calibration cases as they do not address the issue of equifinality beven 1996 2001 even in studies that use stochastic methods such as ensemble kalman filter wanders et al 2014 there is little discussion on how parameters behave between different calibration cases in this study we combine a formal bayesian calibration approach with the concept of pareto optimality to address the issues detailed above we utilize a formal bayesian calibration approach to define the limits of acceptability or error thresholds in order to distinguish between behavioral and non behavioral solutions beven 2006 vrugt et al 2009a for each of the incorporated water balance components behavioral solutions are model parameter sets that result in errors that are within a defined threshold or limit with respect to a specific simulated response for example et or sm if a trade off relationship does exist among the incorporated water balance components as opposed to a complementary relationship the concept of pareto optimality would help in understanding the extent to which the accuracy of a particular water balance component can be improved without affecting to an unreasonable degree the accuracy of other water balance components in addition pareto optimal solutions are unbiased by any subjective weights given to any particular flux or water balance component over another unlike simultaneous calibration strategies gupta et al 1998 hence we use pareto optimality based calibration to create a set of non dominated solutions that characterize the trade offs among the incorporated variables we develop a multivariate calibration framework that combines behavioral solutions from bayesian calibration and multivariate calibration solutions to address the following research questions 1 does incorporation of multiple fluxes and other water balance components into calibration produce parameter distributions that are behavioral with respect to all water balance components considered for calibration 2 for a given large scale hydrologic model what is the extent of trade off if any in accurate simulations of multiple water balance components considered for calibration 3 can behavioral and multivariate calibration solutions help identify deficiencies in hydrologic model parameterization that lead to trade offs in the accurate simulations of multiple variables 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual framework consider a hydrologic model 1 o μ θ i where o is a matrix consisting of model output or responses such as evapotranspiration soil moisture streamflow etc i is a matrix consisting of model input meteorological forcings such as precipitation air temperature etc μ represents the mathematical structure of the hydrologic model typically a deterministic or stochastic function such that μ i o and θis a vector of model parameters kavetski et al 2006 given a matrix of observations o a measure l can be defined as 2 l e θ o θ o s where e is the error residual matrix l is a measure or metric that preserves the information contained in the residuals such as mean absolute error or root mean square error and s is some scalar quantity that represents the value of l assuming that the model structure μ and the upper and lower limits of the parameters θ are fixed the feasible bounds for eq 2 termed as the objective space can be defined gupta et al 1998 a conceptual representation of a feasible objective space for two objectives l 1 and l 2 is shown in fig 1 in traditional model calibration an optimal parameter set θ is identified by minimizing eq 2 l 1 l θ 1 and l 2 l θ 2 are the optimal values for objective 1 and 2 in fig 1 using formal or informal bayesian approaches it is also possible to identify sets of parameters θ b that result in behavioral solutions based on a defined cut off threshold vrugt et al 2009a l 1 b l θ 1 b are behavioral solutions for objective 1 represented by the objective space to the left of the cut off threshold e 1 and l 2 b l θ 2 b are the behavioral solutions for objective 2 represented by the objective space below e2 in fig 1 to quantify the trade offs among multiple objectives l 1 and l 2in this example the concept of pareto optimality can be used this results in a set of parameters θ p that give rise to non dominated or pareto optimal solutions for the objectives considered l 1 2 p l θ 1 2 p are the pareto optimal solutions for two objectives represented by the points along the red line in fig 1 in this study the measure l is the root mean square error rmse and the model responses o considered for calibration are evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and streamflow sf to address the first research question we test the following hypothesis 3 l 1 2 n p b l 1 2 n p l 1 b l 2 b l n b where l 1 2 n p is the non dominated or pareto optimal solutions for n objectives l 1 b l 2 b l n b is the intersection of behavioral solutions for n objectives blue space in fig 1 for two objectives l 1 2 n p b are solutions that are both non dominated and behavioral with respect to n objectives blue points in fig 1 and represents an empty set in other words for incorporation of multiple water balance components in hydrologic model calibration to be considered valuable it should be possible to identify a set of parameters that result in both pareto optimal and behavioral solutions for all the water balance components considered in calibration we note that in defining the hypothesis we have considered only non dominated or pareto optimal solutions in the multi objective space blue points in fig 1 however any solution within the behavioral limits non dominated or dominated can be considered as valid multivariate calibration solution in such cases the hypothesis to be tested reduces to l 1 b l 2 b l n b in other words the intersection of behavioral solutions for n objectives in the multivariate space blue space in fig 1 must be a non empty set in this study we only focus on the pareto optimal solutions to test the hypothesis eq 3 and analyze the trade off among accurate simulations of multiple water balance components in addition the behavioral solutions from bayesian calibration and the pareto optimal solutions are discrete unlike the representation in fig 1 therefore the probability of finding an intersection between the two is extremely low hence the non dominated solutions l 1 2 n p that lie within the error thresholds or limits of acceptability e1 e2 en are considered as l 1 2 n p b fig 1 provides an example for two objectives we test the above hypothesis eq 3 for different pairs of model responses n 2 1 et and sm 2 et and sf and 3 sm and sf in summary the developed multivariate calibration methodology consists of the following steps 1 define the limits of acceptability or cutoff error thresholds rmse in this study for the model responses incorporated into calibration et sm and sf in this study 2 determine the pareto optimal solutions for the combination of model responses et sm et sf sm sf in this study 3 test the hypothesis eq 3 and diagnose deficiencies in model parameterization using behavioral and the pareto optimal solutions fig 2 2 2 defining limits of acceptability for individual model responses to define the limits of acceptability e1 and e2 we adopt a formal bayesian approach to derive the posterior distribution of model error rmse and parameters for individual model responses et sm and sf specifically we utilize the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream markov chain monte carlo mcmc scheme vrugt et al 2009b 2008 that has been applied to bayesian or uncertainty based calibration of hydrologic shafii et al 2014 and hydrogeologic laloy et al 2013 models there is a specific reason for using dream in this study unlike informal bayesian approaches such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 the definition of cutoff thresholds to distinguish behavioral solutions is not subjective instead of rejecting solutions based on a subjectively defined threshold dream uses a formal likelihood function to assign probabilities to all the solutions that form the final converged posterior distribution as a result a specific quantile of the sampled probability distribution can be considered the cutoff threshold for distinguishing behavioral solutions vrugt et al 2009a in this study we assume no apriori knowledge about the value of error rmse thresholds for any of the model responses et sm and sf instead we determine a set of limits of acceptability corresponding to 10 25 50 75 90 95 and 99 quantiles from the posterior distribution of rmse derived using dream for et sm and sf note that the likelihood function in dream considers error residuals and not rmse to determine the posterior distribution of parameters recent advances such as approximate bayesian computation has enabled the use of summary statistics and error metrics such as rmse for diagnostic model calibration vrugt and sadegh 2013 sadegh and vrugt 2014 and evaluation gupta et al 2008 we do not use these methods in this study as they require apriori definition of the limits of acceptability similar to glue we note that the dream solutions in this study are derived using residual and likelihood based fitting methods whereas the pareto optimal solutions are derived using rmse as the objective function described below 2 3 pareto optimal solutions for combination of model responses the value of using the concept of pareto optimality for calibration of hydrologic models is well documented gupta et al 1998 studies have focused on identifying the best objective functions for improving streamflow calibration efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 developing systematic multi objective calibration frameworks madsen 2003 and analyzing the resulting pareto fronts khu and madsen 2005 multi objective methods have been applied at small scales to constrain land surface model parameters gupta et al 1999 and evaluate model performance and parameter behavior hogue et al 2006 however the utility of such an approach for multivariate calibration and diagnosis of large scale hydrologic models has received relatively less attention in this study we use a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 and rmse as the objective function to derive non dominated solutions for the following combinations of model responses 1 et and sm et sm 2 et and sf et sf and 3 sm and sf sm sf 2 4 hypothesis testing trade off analysis and model diagnosis to understand whether the models can accurately simulate multiple water balance components we combine the behavioral solutions from dream and the pareto optimal solutions from amalgam as detailed above specifically we test the hypothesis defined in eq 3 the set of non dominated solutions derived for different combinations of water balance components et sm et sf and sm sf is a non empty set for a particular behavioral limit 10 25 50 75 90 95 and 99 quantiles from the posterior distribution of rmse if a particular combination of water balance components has at least one pareto optimal point within a stricter definition of error threshold compared to another combination then the model is better at simulating the former combination of water balance components together for example consider that the et sm combination has at least one pareto optimal solution within the 50 quantile error thresholds on the other hand consider that the et sf combination has at least one pareto optimal solution within the 25 quantile error thresholds in such a case it can be concluded that it is valuable to incorporate et and sf together compared to et and sm to study the trade off in the accuracy of the simulated model responses we analyze the pareto front qualitatively and quantitatively qualitatively a well defined pareto front implies that the incorporated model water balance components exhibit a trade off relationship as opposed to a complementary relationship quantitatively the range of the objectives and the slope of the pareto front can help compare different pareto fronts in order to understand the trade off relationship between the different combinations of water balance components specifically we define magnitude of trade off as the increase in the error of a specific model response required to affect a unit decrease in the error of the additional water balance component we calculate and compare the average maximum and minimum magnitude of trade off for each of the three multivariate calibration cases from the slopes of the pareto front to diagnose the reasons for trade offs in accuracy among different model responses we study the differences in model parameter distributions among 1 behavioral solutions of individual responses 2 behavioral solutions of individual model responses and behavioral pareto optimal solutions and 3 behavioral solutions of individual responses and pareto optimal solutions that are not behavioral for any model response we compare the empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdfs and quantiles of parameters to help identify parameters that most affect model behavior when additional water balance components are incorporated we quantify the difference between the pdfs of the parameters using hellinger s distance h a statistical distance measure defined as 4 h p q 1 2 i 1 k p 1 q i 2 where p p 1 p 2 pk and q q 1 q 2 qk are discrete probability distributions we determine the kolmogorov smirnov ks test statistic to compare the ecdfs of different parameter distributions the ks test statistic determines the maximum distance between two ecdfs in addition we examine how well the objective functions in the pareto optimal solutions are correlated with the corresponding parameter sets this will help us map the changes in parameter values along the pareto front and identify parameters that influence the trade off relationship between the objectives 3 experiment design 3 1 study area and time period to simulate large scale hydrologic studies we choose the mississippi basin in the united states as the study region the basin covers an area of about 3 3 million sq km and six usgs huc 2 hydrologic unit code basins fig 3 the average temperature over the basin is about 12 c and the annual average rainfall is estimated as 800 mm cai et al 2014 cai et al 2014 also classify the ohio and tennessee regions as wet regions the missouri basin as dry and the upper mississippi region as a transitional region between wet and dry we use historical data from the year 2004 for calibration and data from the year 2005 for validation employing a monthly time step 72 streamflow data points and approximately 63 000 et and sm data points are used for calibration the reasons for selecting a single year for calibration and validation of the model are two fold 1 the study is a calibration experiment that does not seek to produce the best performing hydrologic model for the mississippi river basin rather the primary aim is to rigorously test whether large scale hydrologic models can behaviorally simulate multiple water balance components and study the reasons behind the trade offs if any among accurate simulations of multiple water balance components 2 the forward hydrologic model used in the study is computationally expensive 3 2 observational data to simulate studies that use a sparse network of streamflow gauges for the calibration of hydrologic models we use the computed monthly runoff for the six huc 2 basins sourced from usgs for calibrating the hydrologic model with remotely sensed et we use monthly estimates from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 we select gleam et based on the findings of koppa and gebremichael 2017 in which gleam avhrr and modis et datasets were ranked using a framework based on the budyko hypothesis a semi empirical model that describes long term water and energy balance of catchments budyko 1974 the spatial resolution of the gleam dataset is 0 25 0 25 we use monthly soil moisture estimates from esa cci dorigo et al 2017 for calibrating the hydrologic model with sm the esa cci dataset is selected based on the availability of data for the study period the spatial resolution of the esa cci dataset is 0 25 0 25 we note that the esa cci soil moisture measurements correspond to the top 5 cm of the soil layer but the top soil layer of the hydrologic model detailed below is 10 cm although the unit of measurement is m3 m3 this difference in soil layer depths may lead to systematic bias and needs to be corrected we adjust the values of simulated soil moisture to match the statistics of the observed dataset based on lópez lópez et al 2017 as 5 s m s i m σ s m o b s σ s m s i m s m s i m s m s i m s m o b s where s m s i m is the scaled simulated soil moisture σ s m o b s and σ s m s i m are the standard deviations of the observed and simulated soil moisture smsim is the simulated soil moisture to be scaled and s m o b s and s m s i m are the means of the observed and simulated soil moisture 3 3 setup of the hydrologic model to replicate studies that use spatially distributed models we choose the noah mp multi parameterization land surface model lsm niu et al 2011 driven through nasa s land information system lis kumar et al 2006 the noah mp model builds on the original noah lsm by incorporating a dynamic groundwater model improved representation of vegetation canopy and snow pack cai et al 2014 provide a detailed description and a comprehensive evaluation of the model over the mississippi river basin all the static input datasets required for running the noah mp model are sourced from nasa s lis data portal https portal nccs nasa gov lisdata the important static input datasets are the land cover map sourced from usgs the soil texture map from statsgo sourced from usda and the elevation map from gtopo30 sourced from usgs albedo greenness fraction and temperature are sourced from ncep reanalysis the meteorological forcings required by the noah mp model include precipitation air temperature surface pressure specific humidity wind speed and radiation all meteorological forcings are derived from global data assimilation system gdas from the environmental modeling center emc of the national center for environment protection ncep derber et al 1991 the spatial resolution of the dataset is 0 47 0 47 the meteorological inputs are interpolated onto the model grid using bilinear interpolation to minimize the adverse effects of mismatch in the spatial resolution of the model and the reference datasets samaniego et al 2010 2017 the noah mp model is set up for the mississippi river basin at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 similar to the resolution of gleam et and esa cci sm the noah mp model is spun up for a period of 68 years by looping through the year 2003 until the groundwater and soil moisture storage reach equilibrium the model time step is three hours the number of soil layers in the model is four with thicknesses 10 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 100 cm specific noah mp model physics options selected for different processes are detailed in table 1 the noah mp model contains 71 standard parameters present in user defined tables and 139 hard coded parameters present in the model code the noah mp model output has been found to be sensitive to about two thirds of the 71 standard parameters cuntz et al 2016 as the study is a calibration experiment involving multiple calibration cases we keep the parameter dimension of the calibration problem manageable by selecting five of the most sensitive parameters from the cuntz et al 2016 study the selected parameters are two surface runoff related parameters refdk and refkdt the exponent in the brooks corey equation bb soil porosity maxsmc and hydraulic conductivity at saturation satdk of the five parameters bb maxsmc and satdk are related to soil texture based on cuntz et al 2016 et is sensitive to bb and maxsmc parameters sf surface and subsurface runoff combined is sensitive to all the five parameters with higher sensitivity to refdk and refkdt parameters according to cai et al 2014 sm exhibits higher sensitivity to maxsmc satdk as there are twelve soil texture classes the total number of parameters selected for calibration in the noah mp hydrologic model is 38 table 2 presents a detailed breakdown of the parameters with maximum and minimum values used for calibration we select the minimum and maximum values of the parameters from literature maxsmc and satdk values from cai et al 2014 bb and refdk values from cosby et al 1984 and refkdt values from mendoza et al 2015 we subjectively adjust the minimum and maximum values to improve the rate of convergence of the calibration algorithms 3 4 setup of dream and amalgam algorithms dream is a multi chain markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation algorithm that automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution en route to the target distribution it is designed for increasing the sampling efficiency of complex high dimensional parameter spaces while maintaining detailed balance and ergodicity vrugt 2016 in this study we use the mt dream zs version of dream which utilizes multi try sampling mt snooker updating and sampling from an archive of past states to improve the rate of convergence and make use of parallel computing resources specific configuration options and parameters of the mt dream zs algorithm used in this study are detailed in table 4 we select the laplacian likelihood based on the findings of schoups and vrugt 2010 residual errors in rainfall runoff models of humid basins like the mississippi basin in fig 4 d most basins are within aridity index of 1 0 are better represented by a laplacian distribution than a gaussian distribution the likelihood function is used to summarize the distance between the model simulations and the corresponding reference estimates for et and sm variables error residuals determined at all 0 25 0 25 grid cells and time steps monthly across the entire mississippi river basin all six huc 2 basins together are used to determine the likelihood function similarly sf error residuals are determined using simulated and observed runoff at all six huc 2 basins and all months of the calibration period on a workstation with 16 processors mt dream zs required approximately 16 days 14 500 iterations to converge to a solution for each of the model responses et sm and sf with each iteration of the noah mp model taking around 20 minutes to complete the multi objective calibration algorithm amalgam combines the strengths of multiple evolutionary algorithms to improve the speed and efficiency of finding the pareto optimal solutions for multi objective optimization problems vrugt and robinson 2007 in the current implementation four search algorithms are run simultaneously in amalgam differential evolution storn and price 1997 particle swarm optimization kennedy and eberhart 2001 adaptive metropolis haario et al 2001 and nsga ii deb et al 2002 in amalgam offspring creation is adaptive the best performing algorithms in the present generation are weighted more in the creation of offspring for the next generation specific configuration options and parameter values of the amalgam algorithm used in this study are detailed in table 3 as stated in the methodology section the objective function is the root mean square error metric for et and sm rmse is estimated by calculating the error between the modeled and the observed quantities at each 0 25 0 25 grid cell inside the entire mississippi river basin and at each time step each month of the year 2004 for sf error residuals calculated for all six huc 2 basins and twelve months are used for estimating rmse in other words the calibration of the noah mp model is carried out for the entire mississippi river basin using a single objective function laplacian likelihood in the case of dream and rmse in the case of amalgam and not for the individual huc 2 basins on a 16 processor workstation each of the three multi objective calibration scenarios et and sm et and sf sm and sf required around 10 days 9000 iterations to arrive at the final pareto front 4 results and discussion first we setup a synthetic numerical experiment to test whether the univariate calibration algorithm dream can uncover the true parameter values with one year of calibration data for et sm and sf variables next we present the results of the noah mp model validation for the three model responses under consideration evapotranspiration et soil moisture sm and streamflow sf to help understand the impact of calibrating the noah mp model with a single water balance component et sm and sf on other model responses and to define the limits of acceptability we present the results of the posterior distributions of model errors rmse from dream we then test the central hypothesis of this study eq 3 by combining the limits of acceptability and the multivariate calibration solutions from amalgam next we address the second research question by analyzing the trade offs among accurate simulations of et sm and sf as represented by the pareto fronts finally we show how the developed multivariate calibration framework can help diagnose deficiencies in model parameterization 4 1 synthetic experiment a synthetic numerical experiment is setup in the study domain fig 3 to test whether the dream bayesian calibration algorithm can successfully uncover the true parameter values that were used to generate the observations the duration of the experiment is one year first we use the noah mp model to generate synthetic observations of et sm and sf using a predetermined set of parameter values for this we select the same set of five parameters that are used for the real case study table 2 we use the mean of the parameter ranges as the true value for each individual parameter table 3 for example the true parameter value of refdk is chosen as 4 0e 06 the noah mp model is run using the true parameter values and the meteorological forcing for the year 2004 to generate synthetic observations of et sm and sf these synthetic observations of et sm and sf are then used to calibrate the noah mp hydrologic model without knowing the true parameter values the configuration and computational budget of the dream algorithm is consistent with that of the real case study table 4 we compare the resulting parameter distributions from the three calibration cases et sm and sf to test whether the calibrated values converge to the true parameter values table 3 presents the results of the synthetic numerical experiment from table 3 it is evident that the calibration of the noah mp model using the synthetic observations converges to the true values for all three cases et sm and sf for the streamflow related parameters refdk and refkdt calibration with synthetic et and sf observations produced the best convergence in terms of mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution of the other parameters the highest variance is seen in the parameter bb although the mean of the posterior distributions are close to the true parameter value the standard deviation is high all the calibration cases et sm and sf converge to the true parameter values for maxsmc and satdk values in the subsequent sections we present the results of the application of the calibration framework for the mississippi river basin 4 2 validation of the noah mp hydrologic model to ascertain whether the noah mp model and the parameters considered for calibration can simulate et sm and sf accurately we evaluate the model for the year 2005 for this we select a parameter set from the dream solutions that results in the lowest rmse value for each of the model responses et sm and sf thus having three parameter sets each representing a benchmark for et sm and sf variables we present a time series comparison of observed and simulated monthly et sm and sf for the six huc 2 sub catchments fig 4a when the noah mp model is calibrated with gleam et top panel it is evident that the model performs very well in simulating the observed et values and seasonality one exception is the underestimation of et in the summer months for all regions except the ohio region the results are consistent across the six huc 2 hydrologic regions in the calibration first 12 data points and validation time periods remaining 12 data points the close match between modeled and observed et is reflected in the scatter plots of the annual totals of et as well fig 4b relatively higher variance is observed in the sm simulations when the noah mp model is calibrated with esa cci soil moisture middle panel the simulated soil moisture for all the regions is quantitatively consistent with the observed sm values for the top soil layer however we see some discrepancy in the seasonality of soil moisture between the simulated and observed soil moisture it is especially pronounced in the last six months of 2005 in the tennessee region middle panel fifth column and the first few months of 2004 in the arkansas white region middle panel first column in the missouri region middle panel third column the model simulates the observed seasonality but is unable to capture the peaks in the observed sm perfectly in the upper mississippi region middle panel sixth column the model has difficulty in simulating the timing of the troughs may and june of 2004 and 2005 seen in the observed sm similar to the et results the annual average sm consistently matches the observed values for all six huc 2 basins fig 4b the results for streamflow simulated by the sf calibrated noah mp model present a more consistent picture bottom panel they show that the model generally performs well for all six huc 2 catchments however similar to soil moisture results there are some inconsistencies in simulating the seasonality of the last six months of 2005 especially in the arkansas white red bottom panel first column the ohio bottom panel fourth column and the upper mississippi bottom panel sixth column regions the model also performs well in the lower mississippi and missouri regions but the peaks are higher in 2004 june and july compared with the observed streamflow time series at annual timescales the sf calibrated noah mp model overestimates sf for the year 2005 in the ohio basin june to october 2005 we see that the errors in evapotranspiration and streamflow are comparable to the results of the ma et al 2017 study for the six huc 2 sub basins considered in this study ma et al 2017 report a rmse of about 10 mm month whereas the rmse in this study is about 18 mm month the average rmse of et calculated over the entire us by ma et al 2017 is about 10 mm month which matches the rmse of the time series of et presented in fig 4 about 10 mm month we note that the ma et al 2017 study does not calibrate the noah mp model in addition the ma et al 2017 uses fluxnet et data as reference observations for calculating the rmse 4 3 posterior distributions of model errors we present the posterior distribution of model response errors rmse using probability density and empirical cumulative distribution functions pdf and ecdf fig 5 the pdfs and cdfs of three model responses et top panel sm middle panel and sf bottom panel are constructed for three calibration objectives et green sm orange and sf blue first we analyze the impact of calibrating the noah mp hydrologic model with only streamflow blue on et top panel and sm middle panel our results confirm the findings of previous studies calibrating a hydrologic model with only sf adversely affects the accuracy of other model responses rakovec et al 2016a b while the 50 quantile of the et error increases by about 15 mm month the sm error increases by around 0 1 m3 m3 the same conclusion can be extended for univariate calibration with other variables et and sm for example when the noah mp model is calibrated with sm orange the errors in et top panel and sf bottom panel are very high some results stand out from fig 5 1 the error distribution of sf produced with the et calibrated model is close to the error distribution of sf from the sf calibrated model green and blue plots in bottom panel this finding reinforces the results of previous studies that use et for calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 lópez lópez et al 2017 zink et al 2018 however the absolute difference between the 50 quantiles is still around 20 mm month indicating a significant impact on sf accuracy due to univariate calibration of the model with et 2 similarly sf calibration seems to produce lower errors for sm compared to et middle panel but the absolute errors are still very high 3 neither sm nor sf calibration can simulate et with reasonable accuracy as seen by the disparate error distributions top panel in fact both sm and sf produce similar error distributions for et evident by the ecdfs blue and orange for comparison the rmse of et and sf are higher than the mean monthly water balance closure error seen in the reference dataset about 9 mm month therefore the rmse values of et and sf are not significantly biased by the errors in the reference datasets as represented by the water balance closure error we derive the limits of acceptability for et sm and sf from the posterior distributions of rmse the error thresholds are defined at 10 25 50 75 90 95 and 99 quantiles table 5 the table shows that the range of the quantiles is quite low for et about 4 mm month between the 10 and 95 quantiles and sm about 0 02 m3 m3 between the 10 and 95 quantiles this is reflected in the well defined posterior distributions of et and sm errors when the model is calibrated with et fig 5 green top panel and sm fig 5 orange middle panel in the case of sf the difference between the 10 and 95 quantiles is about 17 mm month this discrepancy maybe due to the higher number of data points available for calibrating et and sm spatially distributed reference datasets compared to sf point data 4 4 hypothesis testing using dream and amalgam solutions to address the first research question we test the hypothesis that the intersection of behavioral from dream and non dominated solutions from amalgam is a non empty set eq 3 we present the pareto fronts of the rmse of different combinations of model responses et sm et sf sm sf along with different limits of acceptability table 6 in fig 6 as stated in the methodology section multivariate calibration with evolutionary algorithms such as amalgam may result in pareto fronts with lesser numbers of non dominated solutions compared with the initial population size in this study we focus only on the pareto optimal solutions red stars in fig 6 the non dominated or pareto optimal solutions are also used to analyze the pareto fronts and quantify the trade offs next section we present the number of pareto optimal solutions of different combinations of model responses that lie within specific rmse thresholds in table 6 for the combination of et and sm model responses fig 6a we see that the hypothesis eq 3 fails for all defined error thresholds except for the 95 and 99 quantiles table 6 for specific values even at the 95 quantile where the et and sm error thresholds are quite high 30 6 mm month for et and 0 126 m3 m3 for sm only 12 points in the multivariate space can be classified as behavioral we note that the points near the tails of the pareto front are well within individual error thresholds of et and sm therefore we conclude that the noah mp model is unable to simultaneously simulate both et and sm with reasonable accuracy even though the incorporation of et and sm can improve the errors in both the variables it does not result in improving the realism of the model itself lending credence to assertion that the relationship between et and sm may not be complementary the results are consistent with those of univariate calibration using dream wherein the distributions of the et and sm calibrated model responses have considerable discrepancies between them compare et calibrated et and sm calibrated et top panel of fig 5 and sm calibrated sm and et calibrated sm middle panel of fig 5 in contrast to et and sm the model performs very well in simulating both et and sf accurately fig 6b even at a stricter error threshold of 50 quantile of individual et and sf errors table 5 around 12 points out of the 29 pareto optimal points can be classified as behavioral table 6 at the error threshold of the 95 quantile all 29 pareto optimal solutions are behavioral this along with the fact that the range of errors in the pareto front is quite small shows that the relationship between et and sf can be considered complementary in other words the incorporation of et into sf calibration can improve et simulation while maintaining the accuracy of sf within reasonable error thresholds as seen in fig 5 the presence of a complementary relationship between et and sf is hinted in the posterior distributions pdf and ecdf of et and sf errors sf calibrated sf blue and et calibrated sf green in the bottom panel this result also provides support for studies that incorporate et and sf into calibration such as zink et al 2018 where incorporation of et improved et error by 8 while the nse of sf reduced by 6 which could be within the limits of acceptability for the combination of sm and sf flux the hypothesis fails for the lower error thresholds 10 50 quantiles at higher quantiles 75 and greater where the absolute value of the sf error threshold is greater than 32 mm month table 5 relatively more pareto optimal solutions are classified as behavioral compared to the et sm combination this relative improvement in performance also is reflected in the posterior distribution of individual model response errors middle panel in fig 5 we see that the error distribution of sf calibrated sm blue is closer to the sm calibrated sm orange compared with the et calibrated sm green this combined with the results of the et sm pareto front shows that incorporation of a storage component such as sm may not lead to improved model performance for multiple water balance components compared with the incorporation of et the performance of the sf sm combination is in line with the findings of wanders et al 2014 where there are improvements in sf and sm performance when sm is incorporated into calibration this also highlights the advantages of defining limits of acceptability and casting multivariate calibration as a trade off problem similarly the results show the drawbacks of assuming a complementary relationship between the model responses for example in rakovec et al 2016b the incorporation of tws improves the rmse normalized of tws from 0 9 to 0 8 with low impact to sf performance however without the specification of an error threshold it cannot be determined whether the rmse of 0 8 is behavioral in other words the solution may lie on the pareto front but may still be outside the limits of acceptability therefore the realism of the model may not have improved to a sufficient degree due to the incorporation of an additional water balance component 4 5 understanding the trade offs using pareto fronts the results of the hypothesis tests could be a consequence of the nature of trade offs between the objectives of multivariate calibration as represented by the pareto fronts fig 6 in this section we address research question 2 and diagnose the results of hypothesis testing we analyze the characteristics of the trade offs in accurately simulating the three combinations of model responses incorporated into calibration 1 et sm 2 et sf and 3 sm sf a visual analysis of the pareto fronts fig 6 reveals that the et sm and sm sf fronts are relatively well defined compared to the et sf pareto front the ill defined et sf pareto front could be an indication that the relationship between et and sf is complementary as opposed to a trade off relationship we compare the number of non dominated solutions in the multivariate space to test whether these numbers reflect the conclusions of the visual analysis we see that the et sm front has the highest number of non dominated solutions 123 solutions followed by sm sf 74 solutions and then et sf 29 solutions the higher number of non dominated or pareto optimal solutions in the et sm front can also indicate a strong trade off relationship between the et and sm model responses compared with other combinations this qualitatively seems to confirm the conclusions drawn from testing the central hypothesis of this study first it is consistently more difficult to accurately simulate et and sm together compared with other combinations on the other end of the spectrum the et and sf fluxes are more complementary to each other considering 1 the ill defined shape of the pareto front and 2 the lesser number 29 of pareto optimal solutions in the case of sm and sf model responses fig 6c the higher accuracy of the sf calibrated hydrologic model in simulating sm compared with an et calibrated model middle panel in fig 5 translates to a lesser number of non dominated solutions compared with the et and sm combination however the number of pareto optimal solutions is not a quantitative measure of the trade off among the water balance components as they depend on the optimization algorithm used next we analyze the accuracy trade offs in simulating the combination of model responses quantitatively first we compare the range of the objective functions in each of the three multivariate calibration cases in the case of et and sf the range of the two objectives is very small compared with other combinations for example the rmse of et flux ranges from 25 5 mm month to 41 7 mm month in the et sm combination whereas in the et sf combination the range is between 22 5 mm month and 28 9 mm month similarly the range of sf in the et sf combination 25 2 34 1 mm month is lower than in the sm sf combination 24 1 81 3 mm month also the sm range is lower in the sm sf combination 0 07 to 0 14 m3 m3 compared to the et sm combination 0 08 0 24 m3 m3 lower ranges of the objectives in the et sf combination imply that both et and sf can be simulated together to a reasonable degree of accuracy lower ranges also may point toward a lower trade off between two objectives however due to differences in the units of the objective functions and different ranges across the three pareto fronts more analysis is required to draw conclusions finally we compare the magnitude of trade offs defined in the methodology section across the pareto fronts of the three calibration cases et sm et sf and sm sf to enable comparison of the trade offs across the three pareto fronts we normalize the errors in each of the model responses et sm and sf by the maximum error determined over all three combinations to derive the trade off matrix table 7 we fit a second degree polynomial to the non dominated points red stars in fig 6 of the three combinations of model responses et sm r 2 0 92 et sf r 2 0 82 and sm sf r 2 0 96 next we divide the pareto fronts into 15 equally spaced segments we then calculate the average maximum and minimum trade offs from either the slopes or the inverse of the slopes of the 15 segments for each combination of the three model responses for the combination of et and sm first row second column in table 7 the average increase in the error of et required to affect a unit decrease in the error of sm is 2 0 units for the same improvement the sf error trade off is only 0 7 units implying a larger trade off in the et sm combination compared with the sm sf combination for soil moisture confirming this conclusion we see that the average trade off in et accuracy required to improve sf is much lower than the trade off required to improve sm it is interesting to note that there is a higher trade off in sf accuracy to achieve a unit improvement in et compared to the trade off in sm accuracy to achieve the same improvement in et first column in table 7 however as fig 6 shows more et sf multivariate calibration solutions are behavioral compared to et sm solutions and the range of errors is much lower in the et sf combination 4 6 model diagnosis unlike deterministic calibration where a single optimal parameter set is derived the multivariate calibration framework developed in this study enables the examination of parameter behavior among multiple calibration objectives hogue et al 2006 demonstrated the advantages of pareto calibration for studying model performance and parameter behavior in this study we explore the advantages of combining behavioral solutions from bayesian calibration and pareto optimal solutions from multivariate calibration for model diagnosis the objective is to identify parameters that can explain the significant trade offs in accuracy among the multiple fluxes and storage variable incorporated into calibration specifically we try to investigate the reasons behind the higher magnitude of trade offs in the et sm and et sf cases we first compare the posterior probability distributions of calibrated parameters for the univariate calibration cases et sm and sf to identify the parameters that govern the performance of the noah mp model with respect to the et sm and sf responses fig 7 presents a comparison of the ecdfs of the five parameters considered for calibration in this study refdk refkdt bb maxsmc and satdk we note that the ecdfs for parameters bb maxsmc and satdk have been constructed by aggregating parameter solutions from all 12 soil classes table 2 to keep the analysis consistent with multivariate calibration results presented later we only consider behavioral solutions that are within a threshold of the 50 quantile the ecdfs of the runoff parameters refdk and refkdt explain the performance of the noah mp model with respect to streamflow for different univariate calibration cases we see that the ecdfs of both refdk and refkdt for the sm calibrated model orange are quite different from the sf calibrated model blue leading to relatively poor performance fig 5 we see that the refdk parameter distribution from the et calibrated model green is closer to the refdk parameter distribution from the sf calibrated model blue compared to the sm calibrated model orange on the other hand the refkdt parameter distributions from the et calibrated and sm calibrated models are considerably different from the sf calibrated model this shows that the relatively better performance of the et calibrated model for the sf flux compared to the sm calibrated model is more influenced by the refdk parameter we quantify these differences between the parameter pdfs using the hellinger s distance for pdfs eq 4 and the distance between their ecdfs using the kolmogorov smirnov ks test statistic the distance measures are presented in the form of a heat map in which each grid cell represents the statistical distance between the corresponding parameter distributions for example the first grid cell in the first panel of fig 8 a represents the hellinger s distance between the pdfs of the refdk parameter generated from the et calibrated model first column and the sf calibrated model first row the three rows in each panel correspond to the univariate calibration objectives et sm and sf and the six columns correspond to both the univariate and multivariate calibration objectives et sm et sf and sm sf we see that the hellinger s distance between the refdk distributions generated from the et calibrated model and the sf calibrated model third column and third row is less than the distance between the distributions generated from the sm calibrated model and the sf calibrated model third column and second row this difference is more pronounced in the ks statistic heat map fig 8b as far as et is concerned the inability of both the sm and sf calibrated models to accurately simulate et can be attributed to differences in the posterior distributions of the bb and maxsmc parameters as pointed out by cuntz et al 2016 the runoff parameters also can influence the et and sm results as they affect the model s water balance this fact is evident in the case of sm performance for which the parameter distributions from both the sm calibrated and sf calibrated models for bb maxsmc and satdk are similar however there is a large difference in the distributions of the runoff parameters refdk and refkdt fig 8 the analysis of posterior distributions of parameters from univariate calibration presented above agrees with the results of sensitivity analysis of the noah mp model parameters cuntz et al 2016 as land surface models are highly complex in terms of parameterization the same conclusions may not hold when multiple fluxes and state variables are incorporated into calibration we calculate the correlation between the objective functions rmse for the combinations of model responses et sm et sf and sm sf and the corresponding parameters refdk rekdt bb maxsmc and satdk in other words we map the behavior of the parameters along the pareto front from table 8 it is clear that most parameters show opposite correlation for the pair of objectives for the combination of et and sm objectives parameters refdk and bb show strong correlation with both et positive and sm negative errors this may indicate that these parameters are more responsible for the higher trade off in accuracy slope of the pareto curve between et and sm seen in fig 6 most parameters have almost equal magnitude but different signs of correlation with the objective functions except for refkdt in the et sf combination it is clear that the magnitude of correlation between the objective functions and the parameters are significantly lower than the correlations for the et sm combination this clearly reflects the lesser trade off and better simultaneous simulations of et and sf compared with et and sm it is interesting to note the higher correlation for the refdk parameter compared with refkdt considering that the difference between the et calibrated and sf calibrated refkdt parameters was higher than the refdk parameter this shows that the parameters that govern model performance for individual water balance component may not correspond to the parameters that affect the trade off among the combination of water balance components also it highlights the advantage of employing pareto based calibration a similar conclusion can be drawn when sm and sf are combined we see that the trade offs are governed by bb and maxsmc parameters and not the refdk or refkdt variables that govern the performance of sf next we compare the parameter distributions of behavioral multivariate calibration solutions of the et sf combination with parameter distributions of models calibrated with only et and sf behavioral solutions with respect to both incorporated model responses are derived at the 50 quantile threshold table 5 as the number of et sf pareto optimal solutions within the 50 behavioral threshold are few 12 we use both the pareto optimal and dominated solutions 40 to derive the ecdfs of the five parameters we note that the forty pareto optimal and dominated solutions used for deriving the parameter distributions are behavioral within 50 error quantile and therefore can be considered as valid multivariate calibration solutions in addition we stress here that unlike dream the parameter distributions derived from multivariate calibration are not true posterior distributions therefore we intend to use the analysis of parameter distributions from multivariate calibration only as a tool to investigate difference in parameter values between univariate and multivariate calibration solutions first we compare the distance between behavioral et sf and sf calibrated solutions we see that the parameter distribution of the refkdt parameter in the et sf calibrated model is much closer to the refkdt distribution in the sf calibrated model fifth column and first row in fig 8 compared with the refkdt distribution in the et calibrated model fifth column and third row in fig 8 however the hellinger s distance and ks statistic between the et calibrated and sf calibrated models first column and first row in fig 8 for the refdk parameter is smaller compared to the distance between behavioral et sf solutions and the sf calibrated model fifth column and first row in fig 8 in fact the incorporation of et and sf into the calibration only improves the refkdt parameter distribution and all other parameters show greater distances compared with parameters derived from models calibrated with only et or sf this shows that the surface runoff parameter refkdt is very dominant in governing the behavioral simulation of both the et and sf fluxes finally we try to determine the reasons for the poor combined simulation of the et sm and sm sf variables to do this we compare the multivariate calibration solutions from the et sm and sm sf calibration cases that are not behavioral with respect to any of the individual fluxes or storage variable in models calibrated with only the individual fluxes or storage variable et sm and sf considering the case of the et sm combination we see that the incorporation of both the et and sm responses reduce the distances between the distributions of parameters that govern et fourth column and third row for bb maxsmc and satdk in fig 8 compared with the sm calibrated model fourth column and second row for bb maxsmc and satdk in fig 8 however the distributions of the refdk variable which seem to influence the trade off in accuracy between the et and sm variable table 8 deviate significantly from the sf calibrated model compare hellinger s distance between the et sm combination and sf and the et sm combination and et for the refdk parameter in fig 8 this shows that a surface runoff parameter such as refdk can influence the combined simulation of et and sm we can draw a similar conclusion in the case of sm sf where the incorporation of sm and sf improves the performance of the runoff parameters refdk and refkdt compared with the sm calibrated model however the parameter that seems to influence the trade off more maxsmc shows degradation compared with the sm calibrated model it is interesting to note that the combination of sm and sf adversely affects a soil moisture parameter even though sm has been incorporated 5 conclusions and future work with the rise in availability of satellite based measurements of hydrologic fluxes and states lettenmaier et al 2015 multivariate calibration is widely seen as a promising solution for improving the performance and realism of large scale hydrologic models however most multivariate calibration studies do not formally define any acceptable error thresholds to help one conclude whether incorporation of additional water balance components into calibration improves either the performance or the realism of a hydrologic model in addition apriori assumptions such as complementary relationships between the different water balance components and deterministic calibration approaches hinder rigorous testing and diagnosis of hydrologic models as called for by beven 2018 in this study we develop a framework for multivariate calibration by combining bayesian and pareto optimality based calibration methodologies this framework can be used to test whether models simultaneously can simulate multiple water balance components accurately by accepting or rejecting parameter solutions based on a defined error threshold applying the framework to a large scale distributed hydrologic model noah mp we find that the model simulates different combinations of different fluxes and a storage variable et and sm et and sf and sm and sf with varying degrees of acceptability while et and sf can be simulated accurately we find that accurately simulating either et or sf along with sm is associated with significant trade offs analyzing the trade offs between the model responses table 7 we find that the higher trade offs are mainly due to the fact that et cannot be simulated accurately by calibrating the model with the other fluxes or storage variable however calibrating the model with et produces lower error for sf fig 5 this highlights the advantage of using a pareto based calibration approach which does not assume any subjective weights in its objectives unlike deterministic calibration methodologies we use parameter distributions from dream and amalgam to identify the parameters that cause significant trade offs in accuracy between simulated fluxes and a storage variable in addition to sensitive parameters that influence the behavioral simulation of model responses we identify parameters that influence the trade offs for example in the case of the noah mp model tested in this study we see that the runoff parameter refdk and the exponent in the brooks corey equation bb influence the trade off between et and sm this not only shows the advantages of framing multivariate calibration as a pareto optimality problem but also highlights the fact that relatively insensitive parameters such as refdk for et and sm can exert a big influence on the accurate simulation of multiple water balance components we note that the results and conclusions we present in this study are for a specific combination of hydrologic model input datasets reference data and model parameters for a different hydrologic model or calibration approach the value of incorporating different water balance components and the relationship between them may be different for example the time period considered for calibration is one year and the study area is the mississippi river basin the calibrated parameters may not be applicable to a river basin with different physical characteristics and hydroclimatic conditions the higher errors in the simulated water balance components fig 4 may be due to the chosen calibration period of one year this is especially true for streamflow as only 72 data points six basins and 12 months were used for calibration as opposed to around 60 000 data points all the grid cells for et and sm increasing the calibration period or the number of parameters may lead to improved accuracy in the simulation of the water balance components and hence lower behavioral thresholds and improved pareto optimal solutions however the multivariate calibration framework developed in this study is model and data independent and can be used to analyze the value of every flux or state variable under consideration future work involves extending the current study in several ways first we wish to incorporate more than two water balance components into the calibration to see if it changes the nature of trade offs for example in the case of et and sm it would be interesting to see if incorporating sf reduces the overall trade offs in accuracy among the water balance components as refdk is a runoff related parameter that affects the trade off between et and sm incorporating sf could lead to better discovery of refdk second incorporating estimates of total water storage tws could yield better performance than the near surface soil moisture estimates used in this study third applying the developed framework to different hydrologic models and conducting inter model comparison studies would help in model selection finally the developed framework can help in the development testing and diagnosis of new hydrologic models and model hypotheses

due to differences in retrieval algorithms and sensors kidd and huffman 2011 gebregiorgis and hossain 2014 thus necessitating the need for validating the chosen et and sm datasets with ground based measurements we compare the gleam estimates with ground based flux tower measurements from the ameriflux network https ameriflux lbl gov a scatter plot of gleam versus ameriflux et for 2004 shows that gleam is capable of representing the et flux in all the sub basins to a fair degree of accuracy fig a1 a the rmse of gleam data is estimated to be 21 4 mm month for validating esa cci sm data we make

satellite based datasets are used together in multivariate calibration we quantify the error in the closure of water balance fig a1c and a1d first we compare the annual et over the six huc 2 catchments in the study area with the difference between precipitation p and runoff q for the years 2000 2009 from fig a1c it is evident that the errors in the closure of water balance are quite low for most of the catchments the exceptions are three years in the lower mississippi and tennessee regions in which inter annual storage soil moisture and groundwater changes may play an important role importantly the water balance closure errors for the calibration and validation periods are low across all the regions including the lower mississippi and tennessee regions the mean annual water balance closure error from reference datasets p et q averaged over the entire mississippi basin is about 108 mm year 9 mm month when the water balance components are summed over the entire basin the water balance closure error is approximately 640 mm 53 mm month we also make sure that the reference datasets do not exceed catchment scale water and energy limits as described by the budyko

that all catchments are closely clustered around the budyko curve except for the missouri region all catchments are also within the energy and water limits dotted lines in fig a1d 
611,the relationship between capillary pressure and wetting fluid saturation is one of the most important functions required for the modelling of immiscible displacement within porous media commonly time consuming laboratory experiments or computationally expensive pore scale numerical simulations are performed to estimate capillary pressure saturation relationships for a given porous media in this research we introduce analytical pore network approach apna a new method to forecast capillary pressure saturation relationships in porous media apna is a fully coupled analytical model that is derived using the concept of representative elementary volume rev and underpinned by geometrical analysis of the studied pore network using pore scale images collected by a range of imaging modalities e g thin section photomicrograph x ray micro computed tomography confocal microscopy etc in comparison to conventional laboratory measurements and numerical simulation techniques apna is trivial to implement and is capable of providing rapid estimates of capillary pressure saturation relationships for a broad range of porous materials we validated apna against empirical capillary pressure

plays a central role in characterizing the dynamics of immiscible displacement within porous media it is one of the key properties required for modeling numerous economically and scientifically

to conventional theory it is assumed that the fluid fluid interface instantaneously reaches an equilibrium state during immiscible displacement fatt 1956 hassanizadeh and gray 1993 for such equilibrium or quasi static conditions the capillary pressure is considered to be a monotonic function of wetting phase saturation only the empirical relationship describing the dependence of capillary pressure pc on wetting phase saturation is given by 1 p n p w p c s w where pn and pw are the pressure of the non wetting fluid and wetting fluid respectively traditionally the capillary pressure saturation relationship is determined using the mercury intrusion capillary pressure method micp washburn 1921 the porous plate method gilliland and maloney 1994 or the centrifuge method hassler and brunner 1945 these experimental techniques are often carried out within the oil industry as part of special core analysis special core analysis scal lin et al 2018 armstrong et al 2012 despite being widely used these experimental methodologies are subject to practical limitations being logistically challenging to perform time consuming expensive and in the case of micp destructive in nature as an alternative to experimental techniques pore scale modelling can be utilized to predict capillary pressure saturation relationship for a given porous media pore scale simulation techniques can be broadly classified into pore network modelling approaches pnm fatt 1956 bakke and øren 1997 reeves and celia 1996 joekar niasar et al 2009 and direct numerical simulation approaches dns rabbani et al 2016 2017 2018a 2018b ferrari and lunati 2013 shams et al 2018 watson et al 2018 the two paradigms differ in the quantities of required input data memory and processor demand during computation and predictive capabilities in the dns the navier stokes equation coupled with the interface tracking algorithm is solved directly on pore scale images akai et al 2018 in contrast the pore geometry is idealized to a simple configuration and assumptions are made regarding pore filling events in pnm blunt 2001 though dns describes the fluid flow behavior in porous media with high fidelity it is often prohibitively computationally expensive and memory intensive limiting its application to smaller flow domains pnm is a simpler modelling paradigm and holds the attraction of enabling fluid flow simulations through a larger flow domain capturing the relevant physics sufficiently well to predict constitutive relationships required to upscale towards macroscopic multiphase fluid flow behavior based upon the concept of the representative elementary volume rev and geometric analysis of the static pore network we introduce a novel method to predict capillary pressure saturation relationships for porous media called analytical pore network approach apna as the name implies apna analytically generates the pore network of given porous media by only utilizing the average pore properties rather than complete pore size distribution moreover in apna pore space is represented with a simple idealized geometry making it akin to pnm approach the analytical formulation of apna allows it to simulate the capillary pressure saturation trend faster than the traditional methods and is free from numerical instabilities associated with numerical solvers moreover being analytical in nature apna is relatively trivial to implement offering solutions to capillary pressure saturation profiles that are highly reproducible due to flexibility associated with apna it can be considered as a multi scale approach being capable of predicting capillary pressure saturation behavior at the pore to core scale 2 analytical pore network approach apna development 2 1 mathematical model for the mathematical derivation of the apna we start with the concept of representative elementary volume rev according to rev concepts there exists a scale at which heterogeneities in measured properties within a porous media become statistically homogenous and immune to boundary effects to form an effective continuum medium hill 1963 the minimum volume at which this statistical homogenization occurs at is the minimum representative element of the porous medium for a given property it is important to note that in the previous study by joekar niasar et al 2010 using the pnm approach it has been demonstrated that rev exists for capillary pressure saturation relationship in porous media see fig 1 using rev concepts as shown in özdemir and özgüç 1997 it can be stated that 2 r e v where rev is the porosity defined as ratio of void volume to the total volume of rev and is the porosity of the represented porous media multiplying both sides with respect to the saturation of each contained fluid phase leads to 3 v i v s i for i n w where v i v and si are the contained fluid volumes within the rev the total volume of rev and fluid saturations for each fluid phase hosted within the porous media respectively the subscripts n and w refer to non wetting fluid and wetting fluid to determine v i and v one can represent rev with a hypothesized homogenous porous medium as shown in fig 2 the hypothesized homogenous rev is composed of spherical grains of size rg pore bodies of size rb and pore throats of size rt depicted in fig 3 a including these parameters in eq 3 yields 4 n b r b 3 n t r t 3 n g r g 3 n b r b 3 n t r t 3 s i s i in eq 4 nb nt ng and si are the number of pore bodies pore throats and grains in hypothesized homogenous rev as well as saturations of each of its contained fluid phases furthermore it can be assumed that for a hypothesized homogeneous rev nb xbng and nt xtng this allows us to eliminate nb nt and ng from eq 4 where 5 x b r b 3 x t r t 3 r g 3 x b r b 3 x t r t 3 s i s i in the hypothesized rev presented above adjacent spherical grains produce inwardly concave pore walls and pore throats for the sake of parsimony we represent this pore throat geometry using simplified converging diverging channels as displayed in fig 3 b using trigonometry the relationship between rb and rt can be deduced as 6 r b r t 1 tan β where β is the orientation angle between pore throat and pore body see fig 2b substituting the above equation into eq 5 results in 7 r t s i 1 tan β r g 3 s i x b x t 1 tan β 3 s i x b x t 1 tan β 3 3 eq 7 relates the properties of the hypothesized rev with the properties of the real porous media according to the delaunay triangulation theorem it is known that ng 2nb and nt 3nb eguchi 2019 therefore using delaunay tessellation one can show that for a pore network xb 1 2 and xt 3 2 this modifies eq 7 as 8 r t s i 1 tan β r g 3 s i 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s i 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 3 subsequently we upscale move from rev to complete porous media and evaluate changes in pore throat size r t occupied by the fluid fluid interface as it moves through the porous medium during drainage when the non wetting fluid invades the porous medium and displaces the wetting fluid r t progressively decreases with sw as illustrated in fig 4 the finite difference method can be used to compute r t as the saturation of fluids changes from sw swi to sw 1 where swr is the irreducible wetting phase saturation 9 r t s n r t s n 1 δ r t δ s n 1 s n s n 1 in eq 9 s n 1 is the saturation of non wetting fluid at the previous step the corresponding saturation of fluids can be computed as 10 s w s w 1 1 s w r t 11 s n 1 s w in eq 10 t are the number of steps value of t will depend upon number of data points the user requires it is important to note that the estimation of r t s n depends upon t with larger values resulting in more accurate estimates of r t s n using eq 9 furthermore to estimate δ r t δ s n 1 in eq 9 we assume that δ r t δ s n is mathematically similar to δ r t δ s n joekar niasar et al 2010 and as a result δ r t δ s n can be directly computed from eq 8 12 δ r t δ s n s n 1 tan β r g 3 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 4 3 incorporating eq 12 into eq 9 results in 13 r t s n r t s n 1 s n 1 1 tan β r g 3 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 4 3 s n s n 1 in above eq 13 we assume that sn sn attributable to upscaling of results at s w s w r r t s n 1 equates to the smallest pore throat within the studied porous medium rtmin in the analysis above we ignored variations in pore shape associated with porous media as we assumed that pore bodies and pore throats are spherical with circular cross sections however in reality porous media is composed of highly angular pores grooves edges and tortuous pathways that can have a strong impact on the capillary pressure saturation profile in order to take account of the porous media roughness we introduce a roughness coefficient fr sw that is related to the effective pore throat size r t as 14 r t f r s w r t from the pore scale perspective under drainage conditions the fluid fluid interface penetrates into the porous media via piston like displacement joekar niasar et al 2009 using heuristic evaluation for piston like displacements it can be hypothesized that fr sw varies with sw as 15 f r s w 1 s w a 1 s w 2 exp s w in above equation a is the rugosity parameter that will depend on the type of porous media the schematic of fr as a function of sw is illustrated in fig 5 though eq 15 is hypothetical it can be justified from the pore scale configuration of the fluid fluid interface in a single angular capillary initially as interface enters the angular capillary its shape is quite regular however as the displacement proceeds it will start to distort according to the geometry of pore rabbani et al 2016 and therefore fr sw increase with a decrease in sw notably at maximum fr sw the interface is almost similar to the geometry of capillary as shown in fig 5 consequently it can be conjectured that the maximum fr sw corresponds to the entry capillary pressure in many previous investigations ma et al 1996 mason and morrow 1991 it has been demonstrated that angularity of capillaries plays an important role in dictating the entry capillary pressure therefore we expect fr sw to be maximum when the interface has attained the entry capillary pressure after reaching the entry capillary pressure the interface regains its regular form and breaks into individual arc meniscus as shown in fig 5 meaning that fr sw declines the behavior of fr sw in response to variations in a are depicted in fig 6 including f r s w 1 s w a 1 s w 2 exp s w in eq 14 results in 16 r t r t s n s w a 1 s w 2 exp s w the variables required to solve eqs 13 and 16 are β rg rtmin and a β can be computed via eq 6 by replacing rt with the mean pore throat of studied porous media and rb with the mean pore body of porous media overall β and rtmin can be readily determined from pore scale images or experiments for example thin section photomicrographs x ray micro ct volume images confocal microscopy it is important to note that in the case of determination of input parameters via digital images our method apna will be highly susceptible to the image resolution saxena et al 2017 high resolution images will tend to produce more accurate results during segmentation of images one can apply morphological concept introduced by silin and patzek 2006 to achieve more robust results as their method does not involve image thinning procedure in order to compute rg one can use a guess value in eq 13 and then minimize eq 17 to obtain rg 17 r g min r t r t s n 0 5 r t 2 for a we suggest reader to start with initial value of a 2 and then calculate δ r t δ s w for all saturations if for any saturation value δ r t δ s w 0 recalculate eq 16 and 17 with smaller values a until for all saturations δ r t δ s w 0 integrating eq 16 into the young laplace equation we can find pc sw for drainage conditions 18 p c s w 2 σ cos θ r t where σ is the interfacial tension along the fluid fluid interface and θ is the contact angle formed between the interface and the pore wall in the case of imbibition when wetting fluid is displacing the non wetting fluid the mathematical model remains almost similar to drainage conditions except for minor modifications saturation of fluids are modified as 19 s w s w 1 s w r s w i t 20 s n 1 s w in eq 19 swr is the saturation of wetting fluid at the residual saturation of non wetting fluid it is important to note that t in case of imbibition should be similar to that used for drainage displacement during imbibition corner flow is the dominant pore scale invasion protocol therefore the roughness coefficient fr sw for the imbibition case can be modified as 21 f r s w 1 s w 1 a 1 s w 1 2 exp 1 s w the schematic of eq 21 showing variation in fr as a result of sw for the corner flow mechanism is depicted in fig 7 it is important to note similar to the drainage condition the expression shown in fig 7 is hypothetical being heuristically derived initially during corner flow the individual arc meniscus moves away from the vertex of the angular capillary until they coalesce therefore we see decline in fr as sw increases in fig 7 as explained in ma et al 1996 and mason and morrow 1991 after arc interfaces coalesce the probability of the non wetting phase to get trapped increases moreover it is known from the literature that trapping of non wetting phase during imbibition is closely associated with the angularity of pores as a consequence fr sw increases with sw after the individual arc meniscus coalesce including eq 21 in eq 14 modifies the effective pore throat size r t as shown in eq 22 22 r t r t s n s w 1 a 1 s w 1 2 exp 1 s w it is important to note that in eq 22 r t and a values will remain similar to drainage conditions as during imbibition it is the pore body that controls the displacement dynamics rather than pore throat using eq 6 r t is converted to corresponding effective pore body size r b 23 r b r t 1 tan β finally including eq 21 in the young laplace equation results in pc sw for imbibition conditions 24 p c s w 2 σ cos θ r b it is important to note that at present apna is able to satisfactorily forecast capillary pressure fluid saturation relationship for any porous media with monomodal pore size distribution and uniform wetting conditions however it is unable to provide capillary pressure analysis for porous media with non gaussian pore size distributions such as microporous carbonates faulted samples or laminated sediments moreover apna does not account for fractional or mixed wettability systems 2 2 computation procedure the computation procedure for apna is detailed below 1 using eq 10 and 11 determine the sw and sn values from sw swi to sw 1 with desired t 2 the main variables required to solve apna are β rg rtmin and a respectively β can be calculated using eq 6 which includes average pore throat rt and average pore body size rb of real porous media overall β and rtmin can be readily determined either through experiments or pore scale images 3 compute r t s n and r t using eq 13 and 16 4 initially use guess value of rg and a 2 and then update rg using eq 17 5 compute δ r t δ s w if for any saturation value δ r t δ s w 0 repeat step 3 and 4 with smaller a value until δ r t δ s w 0 for all saturations 6 use eq 18 to derive pc sw curve 7 in case of imbibition eqs 19 and 20 is used to calculate saturation values of both fluids from sw swi to sw swr with t value similar to step 1 8 compute r t from eq 22 with r t s n and a values similar to the one in drainage case 9 finally from eqs 23 and 24 one can obtain pc sw curve for imbibition case we also performed sensitivity analysis for the introduced pc sw model apna the results are shown in fig 8 3 validation validation of apna was conducted by comparing the results for the analytical solution presented in section 2 with experimental data obtained from the literature figs 9 and 10 shows comparison between apna and mercury injection capillary pressure micp data of various berea sandstone samples with differing grain textural properties under drainage and imbibition conditions as presented in churcher et al 1991 the input parameters required to compute apna in figs 9 and 10 were obtained from churcher et al 1991 and are presented in table 1 overall it can be demonstrated from figs 9 and 10 that the results obtained by apna are in close agreement with the equivalent experimental data with difference between apna s results and the experimental dataset being less than an order of magnitude the close inspection of figs 9 and 10 further suggests that the agreement between apna and micp during imbibition is not as good as apparent during drainage we believe this can be related to quasi static assumptions made during the derivation of apna in imbibition ganglion dynamics can play a critical role in controlling the capillary pressure curves however apna which follows similar concepts as the traditional quasi static pnm is unable to cover the aspects of ganglion dynamics rücker et al 2015 the work conducted by bultreys et al 2016 clearly indicates that the traditional quasi static pnm fails in a conceptual way for imbibition apna was further evaluated using well known capillary pressure model known as thomeer s hyperbola model thomeer 1960 the thomeer s empirical equation can be written as 25 v b v e x p f g log p c p d in above equation pd represents the displacement pressure pc when sw 1 vb fractional bulk mercury saturation v fractional bulk mercury saturation at infinite pc and fg is the pore geometric factor in thomeer s empirical model fg is illustrative of textural properties of porous media it is a fitting parameter that reflects the breadth of pore size distribution that is further an indication of sorting of particles in porous media doveton 2014 large the fg values demonstrates that porous media is relatively poorly sorted doveton 2014 sivila 2013 through curve fitting we determined fg for apna and micp capillary pressure results shown in fig 9 it is important to note that while performing curve fitting v was assumed to be equal to porosity of respective porous media the values of fg for different types of berea sand stone can be seen in table 2 it can be noticed from table 2 that although for the case of berea 1 berea 2 and orange berea where the fg value of apna matches well with the fg value of micp there is a disparity in the results of brea 3 this mismatch in the case of berea 3 can be ascribed to overestimation of pd computed using apna in other words the pore size distribution estimated using apna is more uniform than reality in fig 11 apna is evaluated against capillary pressure data involving displacement of water by air in sand packs os 20 schroth et al 1996 os 30 schroth et al 1996 gb 1 hilpert and miller 2001 and gb 2 culligan et al 2004 these sands vary in pore size distribution the input parameters required to compute apna for fig 11 were obtained from the above cited literature and are given in tables 3 overall it can be demonstrated that the results obtained by apna are in close agreement with the equivalent experimental data with difference between apna results and experimental data being less than an order of magnitude figs 9 11 4 comparison between apna and pore network modelling pnm in this section we will be comparing apna against capillary pressure results obtained from pore network modelling pnm alyafei et al 2016 from sandstones imaged using x ray micro computed tomography the input variables for apna were directly estimated from the micro ct images of rock samples the micro ct images of clashach dodington and bentheimer sandstones were obtained from resources 2019 the input variables were computed using avizo fire 9 2 and are shown in table 4 it is important to note that to compute β we employed geometric mean of the pore throat distribution and geometric mean of the pore body distribution moreover due to the limited resolution of x ray micro computed tomography scans as stated in alyafei et al 2016 we assumed rtmin 10 10 9 m the comparison between apna pnm and micp results from alyafei et al 2016 is presented in fig 12 for the clashach dodington and bentheimer sandstones it can be noted from fig 12 that during initial phase of displacement there is considerable difference between the results obtained by pnm and the equivalent micp dataset conversely apna is able to capture the initial pc sw trend more accurately we attribute the improved accuracy of apna over conventional pnm approaches for capillary pressure estimation relates to the analytical nature of apna making it free from numerical instabilities whilst providing flexibility for users to tune required input parameters to specific cases in the case of bentheimer apna is not able to capture the vertical asymptote very well at small sw values this can be attributed to inability of x ray micro computed tomography to resolve pores that whose feature resolution fall below a the attainable voxel resolution for a given scan importantly the mismatch at small sw values is also present in pnm results for each rock sample we also computed p c s w shown in fig 13 in many applications such as reservoir simulation and solving buckley leverett equation the classical macroscopic scale immiscible displacement model it is p c s w rather than pc sw that plays a critical role while the profile of p c s w is smooth and continuous for micp pnm displays highly irregular and discontinuous trend that can be ascribed to numerical inaccuracy in contrast to pnm apna trend is much closer and consistent with micp data therefore overall it can be concluded from the results depicted in figs 12 and 13 that apna is a promising technique and can be considered an additional way to the traditional pore network modeling approach for estimating capillary pressure saturation relationships in porous media the detailed comparison between apna and pnm is presented in table 5 5 discussion and conclusion in this work we have introduced the analytical pore network modelling approach apna a novel method to predict capillary pressure saturation relationships for a range of porous media as name implies apna is analytical method that is derived by performing geometrical analysis and using theory of multiphase flow through porous media the principle benefits of the presented model are that it is trivial to solve using static pore network and rock textural data readily obtainable from pore scale images of real rock samples providing rapid estimates of capillary pressure saturation for real porous media we have compared our model with experimentally derived micp measurements of capillary pressure demonstrating a close match between the apna and the experimental dataset moreover we have provided a comparison between apna and conventional pore network modelling pnm based estimates of capillary pressure with our analytical solution performing favorably compared to the output of pnm when compared to the benchmark micp dataset it should be noted that the analytical solution presented herein contains some limitations at present apna is unable to reliably forecast capillary pressure fluid saturation relationships for rocks with multimodal pore networks e g microporous carbonates faulted samples or laminated sands or mixed wettability systems there are also practical limitations in obtaining pore network and grain textural properties from pore scale images in cases where the pore size falls below the resolution of conventional imaging systems e g 700 nm for x ray micro ct 50 nm for x ray nano ct and 20 nm focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy though such limitations are also inherent to image based pnm approaches 6 future work improving apna further to capture pc sw behavior of porous media with multi model pore size distribution that is prevalent in carbonate rocks it is known from literature joekar niasar and majid hassanizadeh 2011 abidoye and das 2014 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 that under dynamic conditions the pc sw trend can vary significantly with fluid properties such as flow rate and viscosity etc though in this research apna was limited to predict equilibrium capillary pressure saturation relationship we will be extending the capabilities of apna further to capture dynamic capillary pressure saturation profile coupling apna with the modern data science methodologies such as machine learning integrating apna with reservoir simulators this will allow pc sw to automatically update according to the porous media properties rather than each time adding new pc sw curve in the simulator acknowledgment the financial assistance of qatar foundation texas engineering experimental station total e p and the qatar national research fund nprp10 0104 170104

611,the relationship between capillary pressure and wetting fluid saturation is one of the most important functions required for the modelling of immiscible displacement within porous media commonly time consuming laboratory experiments or computationally expensive pore scale numerical simulations are performed to estimate capillary pressure saturation relationships for a given porous media in this research we introduce analytical pore network approach apna a new method to forecast capillary pressure saturation relationships in porous media apna is a fully coupled analytical model that is derived using the concept of representative elementary volume rev and underpinned by geometrical analysis of the studied pore network using pore scale images collected by a range of imaging modalities e g thin section photomicrograph x ray micro computed tomography confocal microscopy etc in comparison to conventional laboratory measurements and numerical simulation techniques apna is trivial to implement and is capable of providing rapid estimates of capillary pressure saturation relationships for a broad range of porous materials we validated apna against empirical capillary pressure

plays a central role in characterizing the dynamics of immiscible displacement within porous media it is one of the key properties required for modeling numerous economically and scientifically significant phenomena such as hydrocarbon recovery from petroleum reservoirs lake and mitchell 2006 carbon dioxide sequestration juanes et al 2006 paper pulp drying pounder and ahrens 1987 rainwater infiltration through vadose zone hassanizadeh et al 2002 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 membrane permeation mendez et al 2010 and salt precipitation bergstad et al 2018 dashtian et al 2018 according to conventional theory it is assumed that the fluid fluid interface instantaneously reaches an equilibrium state during immiscible displacement fatt 1956 hassanizadeh and gray 1993 for such equilibrium or quasi static conditions the capillary pressure is considered to be a monotonic function of wetting phase saturation only the empirical relationship describing the dependence of capillary pressure pc on wetting phase saturation is given by 1 p n p w p c s w where pn and pw are the pressure of the non wetting fluid and wetting fluid respectively traditionally the capillary pressure saturation relationship is determined using the mercury intrusion capillary pressure method micp washburn 1921 the porous plate method gilliland and maloney 1994 or the centrifuge method hassler and brunner 1945 these experimental techniques are often carried out within the oil industry as part of special core analysis special core analysis scal lin et al 2018 armstrong et al 2012 despite being widely used these experimental methodologies are subject to practical limitations being logistically challenging to perform time consuming expensive and in the case of micp destructive in nature as an alternative to experimental techniques pore scale modelling can be utilized to predict capillary pressure saturation relationship for a given porous media pore scale simulation techniques can be broadly classified into pore network modelling approaches pnm fatt 1956 bakke and øren 1997 reeves and celia 1996 joekar niasar et al 2009 and direct numerical simulation approaches dns rabbani et al 2016 2017 2018a 2018b ferrari and lunati 2013 shams et al 2018 watson et al 2018 the two paradigms differ in the quantities of required input data memory and processor demand during computation and predictive capabilities in the dns the navier stokes equation coupled with the interface tracking algorithm is solved directly on pore scale images akai et al 2018 in contrast the pore geometry is idealized to a simple configuration and assumptions are made regarding pore filling events in pnm blunt 2001 though dns describes the fluid flow behavior in porous media with high fidelity it is often prohibitively computationally expensive and memory intensive limiting its application to smaller flow domains pnm is a simpler modelling paradigm and holds the attraction of enabling fluid flow simulations through a larger flow domain capturing the relevant physics sufficiently well to predict constitutive relationships required to upscale towards macroscopic multiphase fluid flow behavior based upon the concept of the representative elementary volume rev and geometric analysis of the static pore network we introduce a novel method to predict capillary pressure saturation relationships for porous media called analytical pore network approach apna as the name implies apna analytically generates the pore network of given porous media by only utilizing the average pore properties rather than complete pore size distribution moreover in apna pore space is represented with a simple idealized geometry making it akin to pnm approach the analytical formulation of apna allows it to simulate the capillary pressure saturation trend faster than the traditional methods and is free from numerical instabilities associated with numerical solvers moreover being analytical in nature apna is relatively trivial to implement offering solutions to capillary pressure saturation profiles that are highly reproducible due to flexibility associated with apna it can be considered as a multi scale approach being capable of predicting capillary pressure saturation behavior at the pore to core scale 2 analytical pore network approach apna development 2 1 mathematical model for the mathematical derivation of the apna we start with the concept of representative elementary volume rev according to rev concepts there exists a scale at which heterogeneities in measured properties within a porous media become statistically homogenous and immune to boundary effects to form an effective continuum medium hill 1963 the minimum volume at which this statistical homogenization occurs at is the minimum representative element of the porous medium for a given property it is important to note that in the previous study by joekar niasar et al 2010 using the pnm approach it has been demonstrated that rev exists for capillary pressure saturation relationship in porous media see fig 1 using rev concepts as shown in özdemir and özgüç 1997 it can be stated that 2 r e v where rev is the porosity defined as ratio of void volume to the total volume of rev and is the porosity of the represented porous media multiplying both sides with respect to the saturation of each contained fluid phase leads to 3 v i v s i for i n w where v i v and si are the contained fluid volumes within the rev the total volume of rev and fluid saturations for each fluid phase hosted within the porous media respectively the subscripts n and w refer to non wetting fluid and wetting fluid to determine v i and v one can represent rev with a hypothesized homogenous porous medium as shown in fig 2 the hypothesized homogenous rev is composed of spherical grains of size rg pore bodies of size rb and pore throats of size rt depicted in fig 3 a including these parameters in eq 3 yields 4 n b r b 3 n t r t 3 n g r g 3 n b r b 3 n t r t 3 s i s i in eq 4 nb nt ng and si are the number of pore bodies pore throats and grains in hypothesized homogenous rev as well as saturations of each of its contained fluid phases furthermore it can be assumed that for a hypothesized homogeneous rev nb xbng and nt xtng this allows us to eliminate nb nt and ng from eq 4 where 5 x b r b 3 x t r t 3 r g 3 x b r b 3 x t r t 3 s i s i in the hypothesized rev presented above adjacent spherical grains produce inwardly concave pore walls and pore throats for the sake of parsimony we represent this pore throat geometry using simplified converging diverging channels as displayed in fig 3 b using trigonometry the relationship between rb and rt can be deduced as 6 r b r t 1 tan β where β is the orientation angle between pore throat and pore body see fig 2b substituting the above equation into eq 5 results in 7 r t s i 1 tan β r g 3 s i x b x t 1 tan β 3 s i x b x t 1 tan β 3 3 eq 7 relates the properties of the hypothesized rev with the properties of the real porous media according to the delaunay triangulation theorem it is known that ng 2nb and nt 3nb eguchi 2019 therefore using delaunay tessellation one can show that for a pore network xb 1 2 and xt 3 2 this modifies eq 7 as 8 r t s i 1 tan β r g 3 s i 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s i 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 3 subsequently we upscale move from rev to complete porous media and evaluate changes in pore throat size r t occupied by the fluid fluid interface as it moves through the porous medium during drainage when the non wetting fluid invades the porous medium and displaces the wetting fluid r t progressively decreases with sw as illustrated in fig 4 the finite difference method can be used to compute r t as the saturation of fluids changes from sw swi to sw 1 where swr is the irreducible wetting phase saturation 9 r t s n r t s n 1 δ r t δ s n 1 s n s n 1 in eq 9 s n 1 is the saturation of non wetting fluid at the previous step the corresponding saturation of fluids can be computed as 10 s w s w 1 1 s w r t 11 s n 1 s w in eq 10 t are the number of steps value of t will depend upon number of data points the user requires it is important to note that the estimation of r t s n depends upon t with larger values resulting in more accurate estimates of r t s n using eq 9 furthermore to estimate δ r t δ s n 1 in eq 9 we assume that δ r t δ s n is mathematically similar to δ r t δ s n joekar niasar et al 2010 and as a result δ r t δ s n can be directly computed from eq 8 12 δ r t δ s n s n 1 tan β r g 3 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 4 3 incorporating eq 12 into eq 9 results in 13 r t s n r t s n 1 s n 1 1 tan β r g 3 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 s n 1 1 2 3 2 1 tan β 3 4 3 s n s n 1 in above eq 13 we assume that sn sn attributable to upscaling of results at s w s w r r t s n 1 equates to the smallest pore throat within the studied porous medium rtmin in the analysis above we ignored variations in pore shape associated with porous media as we assumed that pore bodies and pore throats are spherical with circular cross sections however in reality porous media is composed of highly angular pores grooves edges and tortuous pathways that can have a strong impact on the capillary pressure saturation profile in order to take account of the porous media roughness we introduce a roughness coefficient fr sw that is related to the effective pore throat size r t as 14 r t f r s w r t from the pore scale perspective under drainage conditions the fluid fluid interface penetrates into the porous media via piston like displacement joekar niasar et al 2009 using heuristic evaluation for piston like displacements it can be hypothesized that fr sw varies with sw as 15 f r s w 1 s w a 1 s w 2 exp s w in above equation a is the rugosity parameter that will depend on the type of porous media the schematic of fr as a function of sw is illustrated in fig 5 though eq 15 is hypothetical it can be justified from the pore scale configuration of the fluid fluid interface in a single angular capillary initially as interface enters the angular capillary its shape is quite regular however as the displacement proceeds it will start to distort according to the geometry of pore rabbani et al 2016 and therefore fr sw increase with a decrease in sw notably at maximum fr sw the interface is almost similar to the geometry of capillary as shown in fig 5 consequently it can be conjectured that the maximum fr sw corresponds to the entry capillary pressure in many previous investigations ma et al 1996 mason and morrow 1991 it has been demonstrated that angularity of capillaries plays an important role in dictating the entry capillary pressure therefore we expect fr sw to be maximum when the interface has attained the entry capillary pressure after reaching the entry capillary pressure the interface regains its regular form and breaks into individual arc meniscus as shown in fig 5 meaning that fr sw declines the behavior of fr sw in response to variations in a are depicted in fig 6 including f r s w 1 s w a 1 s w 2 exp s w in eq 14 results in 16 r t r t s n s w a 1 s w 2 exp s w the variables required to solve eqs 13 and 16 are β rg rtmin and a β can be computed via eq 6 by replacing rt with the mean pore throat of studied porous media and rb with the mean pore body of porous media overall β and rtmin can be readily determined from pore scale images or experiments for example thin section photomicrographs x ray micro ct volume images confocal microscopy it is important to note that in the case of determination of input parameters via digital images our method apna will be highly susceptible to the image resolution saxena et al 2017 high resolution images will tend to produce more accurate results during segmentation of images one can apply morphological concept introduced by silin and patzek 2006 to achieve more robust results as their method does not involve image thinning procedure in order to compute rg one can use a guess value in eq 13 and then minimize eq 17 to obtain rg 17 r g min r t r t s n 0 5 r t 2 for a we suggest reader to start with initial value of a 2 and then calculate δ r t δ s w for all saturations if for any saturation value δ r t δ s w 0 recalculate eq 16 and 17 with smaller values a until for all saturations δ r t δ s w 0 integrating eq 16 into the young laplace equation we can find pc sw for drainage conditions 18 p c s w 2 σ cos θ r t where σ is the interfacial tension along the fluid fluid interface and θ is the contact angle formed between the interface and the pore wall in the case of imbibition when wetting fluid is displacing the non wetting fluid the mathematical model remains almost similar to drainage conditions except for minor modifications saturation of fluids are modified as 19 s w s w 1 s w r s w i t 20 s n 1 s w in eq 19 swr is the saturation of wetting fluid at the residual saturation of non wetting fluid it is important to note that t in case of imbibition should be similar to that used for drainage displacement during imbibition corner flow is the dominant pore scale invasion protocol therefore the roughness coefficient fr sw for the imbibition case can be modified as 21 f r s w 1 s w 1 a 1 s w 1 2 exp 1 s w the schematic of eq 21 showing variation in fr as a result of sw for the corner flow mechanism is depicted in fig 7 it is important to note similar to the drainage condition the expression shown in fig 7 is hypothetical being heuristically derived initially during corner flow the individual arc meniscus moves away from the vertex of the angular capillary until they coalesce therefore we see decline in fr as sw increases in fig 7 as explained in ma et al 1996 and mason and morrow 1991 after arc interfaces coalesce the probability of the non wetting phase to get trapped increases moreover it is known from the literature that trapping of non wetting phase during imbibition is closely associated with the angularity of pores as a consequence fr sw increases with sw after the individual arc meniscus coalesce including eq 21 in eq 14 modifies the effective pore throat size r t as shown in eq 22 22 r t r t s n s w 1 a 1 s w 1 2 exp 1 s w it is important to note that in eq 22 r t and a values will remain similar to drainage conditions as during imbibition it is the pore body that controls the displacement dynamics rather than pore throat using eq 6 r t is converted to corresponding effective pore body size r b 23 r b r t 1 tan β finally including eq 21 in the young laplace equation results in pc sw for imbibition conditions 24 p c s w 2 σ cos θ r b it is important to note that at present apna is able to satisfactorily forecast capillary pressure fluid saturation relationship for any porous media with monomodal pore size distribution and uniform wetting conditions however it is unable to provide capillary pressure analysis for porous media with non gaussian pore size distributions such as microporous carbonates faulted samples or laminated sediments moreover apna does not account for fractional or mixed wettability systems 2 2 computation procedure the computation procedure for apna is detailed below 1 using eq 10 and 11 determine the sw and sn values from sw swi to sw 1 with desired t 2 the main variables required to solve apna are β rg rtmin and a respectively β can be calculated using eq 6 which includes average pore throat rt and average pore body size rb of real porous media overall β and rtmin can be readily determined either through experiments or pore scale images 3 compute r t s n and r t using eq 13 and 16 4 initially use guess value of rg and a 2 and then update rg using eq 17 5 compute δ r t δ s w if for any saturation value δ r t δ s w 0 repeat step 3 and 4 with smaller a value until δ r t δ s w 0 for all saturations 6 use eq 18 to derive pc sw curve 7 in case of imbibition eqs 19 and 20 is used to calculate saturation values of both fluids from sw swi to sw swr with t value similar to step 1 8 compute r t from eq 22 with r t s n and a values similar to the one in drainage case 9 finally from eqs 23 and 24 one can obtain pc sw curve for imbibition case we also performed sensitivity analysis for the introduced pc sw model apna the results are shown in fig 8 3 validation validation of apna was conducted by comparing the results for the analytical solution presented in section 2 with experimental data obtained from the literature figs 9 and 10 shows comparison between apna and mercury injection capillary pressure micp data of various berea sandstone samples with differing grain textural properties under drainage and imbibition conditions as presented in churcher et al 1991 the input parameters required to compute apna in figs 9 and 10 were obtained from churcher et al 1991 and are presented in table 1 overall it can be demonstrated from figs 9 and 10 that the results obtained by apna are in close agreement with the equivalent experimental data with difference between apna s results and the experimental dataset being less than an order of magnitude the close inspection of figs 9 and 10 further suggests that the agreement between apna and micp during imbibition is not as good as apparent during drainage we believe this can be related to quasi static assumptions made during the derivation of apna in imbibition ganglion dynamics can play a critical role in controlling the capillary pressure curves however apna which follows similar concepts as the traditional quasi static pnm is unable to cover the aspects of ganglion dynamics rücker et al 2015 the work conducted by bultreys et al 2016 clearly indicates that the traditional quasi static pnm fails in a conceptual way for imbibition apna was further evaluated using well known capillary pressure model known as thomeer s hyperbola model thomeer 1960 the thomeer s empirical equation can be written as 25 v b v e x p f g log p c p d in above equation pd represents the displacement pressure pc when sw 1 vb fractional bulk mercury saturation v fractional bulk mercury saturation at infinite pc and fg is the pore geometric factor in thomeer s empirical model fg is illustrative of textural properties of porous media it is a fitting parameter that reflects the breadth of pore size distribution that is further an indication of sorting of particles in porous media doveton 2014 large the fg values demonstrates that porous media is relatively poorly sorted doveton 2014 sivila 2013 through curve fitting we determined fg for apna and micp capillary pressure results shown in fig 9 it is important to note that while performing curve fitting v was assumed to be equal to porosity of respective porous media the values of fg for different types of berea sand stone can be seen in table 2 it can be noticed from table 2 that although for the case of berea 1 berea 2 and orange berea where the fg value of apna matches well with the fg value of micp there is a disparity in the results of brea 3 this mismatch in the case of berea 3 can be ascribed to overestimation of pd computed using apna in other words the pore size distribution estimated using apna is more uniform than reality in fig 11 apna is evaluated against capillary pressure data involving displacement of water by air in sand packs os 20 schroth et al 1996 os 30 schroth et al 1996 gb 1 hilpert and miller 2001 and gb 2 culligan et al 2004 these sands vary in pore size distribution the input parameters required to compute apna for fig 11 were obtained from the above cited literature and are given in tables 3 overall it can be demonstrated that the results obtained by apna are in close agreement with the equivalent experimental data with difference between apna results and experimental data being less than an order of magnitude figs 9 11 4 comparison between apna and pore network modelling pnm in this section we will be comparing apna against capillary pressure results obtained from pore network modelling pnm alyafei et al 2016 from sandstones imaged using x ray micro computed tomography the input variables for apna were directly estimated from the micro ct images of rock samples the micro ct images of clashach dodington and bentheimer sandstones were obtained from resources 2019 the input variables were computed using avizo fire 9 2 and are shown in table 4 it is important to note that to compute β we employed geometric mean of the pore throat distribution and geometric mean of the pore body distribution moreover due to the limited resolution of x ray micro computed tomography scans as stated in alyafei et al 2016 we assumed rtmin 10 10 9 m the comparison between apna pnm and micp results from alyafei et al 2016 is presented in fig 12 for the clashach dodington and bentheimer sandstones it can be noted from fig 12 that during initial phase of displacement there is considerable difference between the results obtained by pnm and the equivalent micp dataset conversely apna is able to capture the initial pc sw trend more accurately we attribute the improved accuracy of apna over conventional pnm approaches for capillary pressure estimation relates to the analytical nature of apna making it free from numerical instabilities whilst providing flexibility for users to tune required input parameters to specific cases in the case of bentheimer apna is not able to capture the vertical asymptote very well at small sw values this can be attributed to inability of x ray micro computed tomography to resolve pores that whose feature resolution fall below a the attainable voxel resolution for a given scan importantly the mismatch at small sw values is also present in pnm results for each rock sample we also computed p c s w shown in fig 13 in many applications such as reservoir simulation and solving buckley leverett equation the classical macroscopic scale immiscible displacement model it is p c s w rather than pc sw that plays a critical role while the profile of p c s w is smooth and continuous for micp pnm displays highly irregular and discontinuous trend that can be ascribed to numerical inaccuracy in contrast to pnm apna trend is much closer and consistent with micp data therefore overall it can be concluded from the results depicted in figs 12 and 13 that apna is a promising technique and can be considered an additional way to the traditional pore network modeling approach for estimating capillary pressure saturation relationships in porous media the detailed comparison between apna and pnm is presented in table 5 5 discussion and conclusion in this work we have introduced the analytical pore network modelling approach apna a novel method to predict capillary pressure saturation relationships for a range of porous media as name implies apna is analytical method that is derived by performing geometrical analysis and using theory of multiphase flow through porous media the principle benefits of the presented model are that it is trivial to solve using static pore network and rock textural data readily obtainable from pore scale images of real rock samples providing rapid estimates of capillary pressure saturation for real porous media we have compared our model with experimentally derived micp measurements of capillary pressure demonstrating a close match between the apna and the experimental dataset moreover we have provided a comparison between apna and conventional pore network modelling pnm based estimates of capillary pressure with our analytical solution performing favorably compared to the output of pnm when compared to the benchmark micp dataset it should be noted that the analytical solution presented herein contains some limitations at present apna is unable to reliably forecast capillary pressure fluid saturation relationships for rocks with multimodal pore networks e g microporous carbonates faulted samples or laminated sands or mixed wettability systems there are also practical limitations in obtaining pore network and grain textural properties from pore scale images in cases where the pore size falls below the resolution of conventional imaging systems e g 700 nm for x ray micro ct 50 nm for x ray nano ct and 20 nm focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy though such limitations are also inherent to image based pnm approaches 6 future work improving apna further to capture pc sw behavior of porous media with multi model pore size distribution that is prevalent in carbonate rocks it is known from literature joekar niasar and majid hassanizadeh 2011 abidoye and das 2014 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 that under dynamic conditions the pc sw trend can vary significantly with fluid properties such as flow rate and viscosity etc though in this research apna was limited to predict equilibrium capillary pressure saturation relationship we will be extending the capabilities of apna further to capture dynamic capillary pressure saturation profile coupling apna with the modern data science methodologies such as machine learning integrating apna with reservoir simulators this will allow pc sw to automatically update according to the porous media properties rather than each time adding new pc sw curve in the simulator acknowledgment the financial assistance of qatar foundation texas engineering experimental station total e p and the qatar national research fund nprp10 0104 170104

612,computer simulations of groundwater flow and solute transport are often burdened by long runtimes the simulations are necessarily complex to capture the system dynamics and finely discretized spatial and temporal domains are often needed for solution accuracy and stability model reduction allows for the approximation of system state by solving equations in a reduced dimensional space proper orthogonal decomposition pod is an effective way to reduce the dimensionality of systems of differential equations that are discretized by finite difference or finite element methods if the problems are nonlinear in nature the discrete empirical interpolation method deim has been shown to supplement pod by further reducing the dimension of nonlinear calculations here the combined pod deim approach is shown to work on a problem of 2 dimensional groundwater flow with solute transport exhibiting nonlinear sorption the application is restricted to largely dispersive problems low peclet number results show areas of high concentration are effectively identified with mean errors less than 2 of the full model keywords model reduction solute transport proper orthogonal decomposition discrete empirical interpolation nonlinear differential equations 1 introduction groundwater flow and solute transport models often present a high demand on computational resources the groundwater flow component and solute transport component must be solved separately and are often coupled together either the flow or the transport component may be nonlinear if representing unconfined conditions or nonlinear sorption reaction respectively nonlinear problems require additional solver iterations for each time step the solution dimensionality of these models is determined by the number of cells in the finite difference or finite element mesh as the modelled region becomes larger and or spatial discretization becomes finer the number of cells can be in the millions added computational demand arises when modeling transient conditions for a long time horizon the highest degree of complexity occurs when density dependence is considered and the flow and transport solutions must have yet another additional iteration between the two component solutions at each time step one consequence of modeling complex systems with high fidelity models is that completing one simulation can take hours or even days even with a substantial number of modern cpus any type of problem that involves running a high dimensional groundwater flow and solute transport model thousands of times e g parameter estimation monte carlo or management optimizations can be impractical or even infeasible the option to use a lower fidelity model that has fewer cells and or time steps may be appealing but is often accompanied by large reductions in accuracy model reduction techniques are a way to reduce the dimension of solution space at each time step thereby reducing total runtimes of the simulation model so that many types of problems become solvable in a reasonable amount of time with acceptable reduced model error while being a new field of research model reduction for groundwater flow models has been well studied a popular model reduction technique for groundwater flow is to use proper orthogonal decomposition pod to identify a lower dimensional basis on which to project the high dimensional model mcphee and yeh 2008 many variations of pod based model reduction have been proposed in the literature for linear confined groundwater flow problems boyce et al 2015 boyce and yeh 2014 mcphee and yeh 2008 pasetto et al 2013 siade et al 2012 vermeulen et al 2004a 2004b alternatively there are other methods of surrogate modeling such as data driven approaches which also achieve the desired outcome of a reduced model but do not intrinsically represent the known physics of the system being simulated these other methods are reviewed in asher et al 2015 an additional reduced modeling technique is needed to address the problematic nature of pod based model reduction on nonlinear problems in which there are still calculations that scale up with the dimension of the full model the discrete empirical interpolation method deim was introduced to formulate a reduced model with a solution complexity that scaled only with reduced dimensions chaturantabut and sorensen 2010 pod and deim have been combined in a shallow groundwater context to show the effectiveness of the dual reduction approach ştefănescu and navon 2013 recent developments have also allowed for model reduction for nonlinear unconfined groundwater flow by supplementing a pod based reduced model with deim to approximate nonlinear calculations stanko et al 2016 this recent work not only showed the effectiveness of the dual approach but also implemented it within the commonly used software modflow harbaugh 2005 specifically modflow owhm hanson et al 2014 the combined approach serves to reduce the dimension of nonlinear operations while sacrificing acceptable increases in error and with error bounds that are tractable chaturantabut and sorensen 2010 in contrast to the concept of model reduction for groundwater flow model reduction research for solute transport is in its very early stages robinson et al 2012 has shown that similar pod based model reduction techniques can work for linear solute transport models solving the advection dispersion equation in that work a small 1 m2 two dimensional finite element model with linear sorption was reduced and solved within the finite element heat and mass transfer fehm code research in pod reduced modeling for advection dispersion has shown sensitivity to snapshot selection and better performance with a randomly generated realization of heterogeneous media when compared to the zonal approach li and hu 2013 rizzo et al 2018 further demonstrated the effectiveness of a pod based approach to model reduction of linear solute transport models with enhancements such as an adaptive snapshot splitting technique which showed improved performance with low peclet numbers additional work has demonstrated successful pod based model reduction on a variable density flow and transport problem li et al 2013 but this work suggested the need for a modified approach like deim to address mathematical nonlinearities that cause significant errors in long term predictions with pod based reduced models since deim has been effective in reducing various nonlinear models tezduyar et al 2008 chaturantabut and sorensen 2011 dimitriu et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 it is a likely candidate for modeling nonlinear solute transport when coupled with groundwater flow one of the benefits of a dual model reduction approach to a coupled flow and transport model is the reduction in number of nonlinear operations too many of which can hinder the application of such models it is also likely that repeated calculations of solute concentration in areas of low concentration within a large groundwater flow model are not necessary for problems involving a contaminant plume or seawater intrusion the location of a high concentration region within a much larger groundwater domain is desired model reduction via pod and deim may help approximate concentrations in these areas while maintaining high computational efficiency the following section provides the derivation of pod deim for an advection dispersion equation that includes nonlinear sorption this study then applies this method to one dimensional 1 d and two dimensional 2 d nonlinear solute transport simulations to date this is the only known application of pod deim reduced models to nonlinear solute transport 2 methodology the following methodology introduces the equations for groundwater flow and solute transport reduced modeling by pod and deim will be derived for the transport equation the implementation of these methods within the commonly used mt3dms software zheng and wang 1999 framework as updated by bedekar et al 2016 will be described all variable definitions are compiled in table 1 with the following convention uppercase letters for scalar variables bold lowercase for one dimensional vectors bold uppercase for two dimensional matrices 2 1 groundwater flow the groundwater flow equations that are employed in this method are the unadulterated versions that are described in harbaugh 2005 modflow 2005 is used to generate a steady flow field as input to the transport model in more advance simulations this would be an iterative process however to address the specific intention of nonlinear solute transport model reduction the flow system is assumed to be steady and need only be generated once and provided to the transport simulation as a flow velocity field for this experiment the groundwater flow equations are not reduced as they were in stanko et al 2016 instead the full flow solution is retained to isolate the solute transport reduction process 2 2 solute transport solute transport is modeled by way of the advection dispersion reaction equation as it is incorporated into the updated software mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 the newer version of mt3d provides several additional features not present in the original mt3dms software the new software corrects a small error that caused mass to not be conserved in some cases facilitates solute transport calculations in additional groundwater flow packages as well as in the unsaturated zone and adds flexibility to the solution scheme by manipulating the way some terms are incorporated into the solution scheme implementing the reduced modeling approach within this code ensures its usefulness for the latest generation of simulation programs 2 2 1 governing equation the following equation is a full three dimensional representation of advection dispersion and reaction of a single solute in a groundwater flow system as presented in zheng 2009 with units representing the current application 1 θ c k t x i θ d i j c k x j x i θ v i c k q s c s k q s c k r n where θ porosity of the subsurface medium dimensionless ck dissolved

negative 1 day c s k concentration of the source or sink flux for species k g m3 rn chemical reaction terms g m3 day eq 1 is modified by expanding the time derivative and reaction term and simplified by dropping the species index henceforth assuming only one species of solute is present to obtain eq 2 eq 4 zheng and wang 1999 2 θ c t ρ b c t x i θ d i j c x j x i θ ν i c q s c s q s c λ 1 θ c λ 2 ρ b c where c and c are concentrations of the dissolved and sorbed phases respectively q s is the rate of change in transient groundwater storage λ1θc and λ 2 ρ b c are terms representing first order reaction with reaction rates λ1 and λ2 for the dissolved and sorbed phases respectively and ρ b is the bulk density of the porous media in g m3 the translation of eq 2 is a mass balance at any given time between dissolve sorbed mass and the difference between mass inflow and mass outflow controlled by advection dispersion reaction and sources sinks it is assumed that local equilibrium exists for any sorption or reaction zheng and wang 1999 for this research the freundlich isotherm is employed to simulate equilibrium nonlinear sorption as c k f c a where kf is the freundlich constant and a is the freundlich exponent eq 2 can be re written as 3 r θ c t x θ ν x c y θ ν y c z θ ν z c l c where l c represents all terms not related to advection i e dispersion sources reactions derivatives in eq 3 are approximated in space and time by an implicit finite difference algorithm with an upstream weighting scheme details of the derivations are provided in zheng and wang 1999 the retardation factor for systems simulating freundlich sorption is r 1 ρ b θ a k f c a 1 when the discretized transport equation is formulated for each node in the model the result is a system of equations represented in matrix form eq 4 the continuous concentration variable c becomes a vector of concentrations at each finite difference cell c the coefficient matrix a c is a sparse banded matrix that depends on the solute concentrations for simulations involving nonlinear sorption or reaction because the matrix a c is a function of c and it is multiplied by the vector c eq 4 is a nonlinear equation also because c t 1 is time dependent a c is also time dependent and is reformed at each time step using updated values of c the number of diagonals in a c depends on the spatial dimensions of the simulation 1 d 2 d or 3d as well as the treatment cross terms in the dispersion tensor for the purposes of this study a new mt3d usgs feature that lumps cross dispersion terms which could also be omitted into the right hand side vector is not used 4 a c c t 1 b an important consideration in advection dispersion modeling is the peclet number pe which is defined in eq 5 5 p e v δ x d where v is the magnitude of seepage velocity of groundwater flow δx is the length of one model cell and d is the magnitude of dispersion coefficient the peclet number is an indicator for the amount of advection relative to dispersion large peclet numbers pe 2 represent an advection dominated simulation which can suffer from numerical errors zheng and bennett 2002 simulations in this study are restricted to dispersion dominated cases pe 1 to avoid these problematic errors 2 3 model reduction model reduction of the advection dispersion equations is achieved by projecting the full system of equations onto a lower dimensional subspace by the methods first presented for groundwater flow in vermeulen et al 2004a in summary a smaller system with fewer unknown variables is formed that captures most of the dynamics of the original system as measured by the principal vectors obtained through singular value decomposition svd the intel fortran preconditioned jacobi svd algorithm https software intel com en us mkl developer reference fortran singular value decomposition lapack driver routines is used in this study in order to build the reduced system a collection of full system snapshots must be obtained then truncated svd is applied to the snapshots and galerkin projection is employed to reduce the dimension of the original system in addition a second set of snapshots is used to represent the nonlinearities of the model which for this study is the entire matrix calculation a c c t 1 svd and galerkin projection are both performed again on the nonlinear snapshots and the dual reduced model is formed in this section these steps are explained in more detail 2 3 1 snapshot selection snapshots are defined as a full spatial representation of the system state at an instant of time a selection of snapshots is needed for both pod and deim methods for pod snapshots of the vector c obtained when eq 4 is solved by any of the solution techniques native to the mt3d usgs software are preserved at selected times and added to the snapshot set φ c for deim snapshots of the nonlinear calculation in eq 4 a c c t 1 which is equivalent the right hand side vector b are retained in φ b the snapshot times are identical for φ c and φ b the snapshot selection procedure includes selecting which simulation variables e g aquifer parameters and boundary condition values to use for each sample of the full model and the times at which the solution is added to the snapshot set the performance of a projection based reduced model is highly sensitive to the snapshot set used to construct the reduced basis siade et al 2010 2 3 2 proper orthogonal decomposition proper orthogonal decomposition pod is a method used to decompose a matrix into orthogonal components first singular value decomposition is performed on φ c then a number of singular values that account for nearly all e g 99 or 99 9 of the matrix information also called energy can be selected and the remaining singular values are truncated and discarded the percent energy criterion is used to define the number of singular values retained which translates to the first reduced dimension r the matrix p r n r with r n is composed of the eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest singular values the full state space vector c r n 1 can now be approximated as pc r where c r r r 1 substituting this approximation into eq 4 yields 6 a c pc r t 1 b 2 3 3 galerkin projection the galerkin projection technique involves the translation from full model space to reduced model space to achieve this reduction eq 6 is premultiplied by p t to obtain eq 7 which is a reduced system of equations herein called the pod reduced model while the dimension of some calculations is reduced in the pod reduced model of eq 7 the calculation p t a c needs to be computed at each time step since the entries of a c depend on the changing concentration field and scales with the original full dimension of n 7 p t a c pc r t 1 p t b 2 3 4 discrete empirical interpolation method the discrete empirical interpolation method deim is a method used to capture nonlinear dynamics of a system of partial differential equations through a finite set of interpolation indices the discrete empirical interpolation method is implemented specifically to reduce the nonlinear term s dependency on the full dimension of the original model n to approximate nonlinearities in a reduced space a nonlinear projection basis d is obtained via pod on φ b the initial deim approximation eq 8 is made by approximating the nonlinear operation a c c t 1 with a linear operation 8 a c c t 1 dz where z r d 1 is a vector of unknown coefficients since eq 8 is overdetermined only d equations are required to solve for z the retained rows of the system are the interpolation indices that are selected through the process described in stefanescu and navon 2013 the selection algorithm for the interpolation indices chooses points that have the largest residual error when iteratively reconstructing the basis with an additional column of d in each iteration algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode for selecting the interpolation indices and the steps involved in the deim procedure to reformulate eq 8 as a well determined system of equations z r n d is defined as a diminished permutation matrix which retains only the d columns of a full permutation matrix d n corresponding to the interpolation indices d premultiplying eq 8 by z t eq 9 retains only the rows of a c and d that correspond to interpolation points 9 z t a c c t 1 z t dz eq 9 can now be inverted to solve for z eq 10 and subsequently substituted back into eq 8 to obtain the final approximation of the nonlinear term eq 11 finally galerkin projection can be applied again as in eq 7 to achieve a new reduced model herein called the pod deim reduced model eq 12 10 z z t d 1 z t a c c t 1 11 a c c t 1 d z t d 1 z t a c c t 1 12 p t d z t d 1 z t a c pc r t 1 p t b r n n d d d d n n r r 1 r 1 all calculations dependent on the dimension n p t d z t d 1 can be precomputed and the precomputation of ztd 1 is executed with lu decomposition the final pod deim reduced model eq 12 is solved for c r t 1 at each time step entirely within the reduced dimension in other words there are no nonlinear operations that must be carried out in the full n space during the simulation and the complexity of the pod deim reduced model solution scales only with dimensions r and d note that since a c is a sparse matrix that results from finite difference discretization the complexity of a c p scales with the dimension r not n 2 4 error and uncertainty the error for any reduced model is henceforth defined as the difference between the original full model solution and the reduced model solution this error is calculated for both the concentration solution in the full model dimension as well as the result of the nonlinear operation a c c which is the same as the vector b for the governing equation under consideration absolute error is presented in concentration units root mean squared errors rmse and normalized root mean squared error nrmse are calculated for each case so the errors can be weighted by the span of concentration values eq 13 13 n r m s e f u l l r e d u c e d 2 n c m a x c m i n r m s e c m a x c m i n where 2 is the euclidean norm to account for various numerical inaccuracies a statistical experiment is designed such that uncertain components of the reduced modeling methodology are varied randomly to assess their significance this research employs a random draw from a uniform distribution of mass loading rates and a random log normal hydraulic conductivity field the field was generated with the python package pyemu white et al 2016 using ordinary kriging and an exponential variogram range 304 and contribution 1 0 the accuracy of the reduced model always depends on the snapshot set and number of principal vectors retained after truncation given that this uncertainty experiment shows the range of accuracies attainable with an already constructed reduced model assuming the snapshot set is sufficient an optimal snapshot set might achieve superior accuracy but this is beyond the scope of this study 3 one dimensional test case the first test of the pod deim methodology was implemented within mt3d usgs and tested on a simple one dimensional 1 d model eq 14 describes the 1 d transport governing equation as modified from eq 2 where change in groundwater storage is zero q s 0 for steady flow mass loading qc replaces the flux term qscs and the dispersion coefficient d is treated as constant in this 1 d model the aquifer is assumed to me homogeneous and isotropic 14 r c t ν x c x d 2 c x 2 q c λ 1 θ c λ 2 ρ b c 3 1 1 d model design the 1 d model consists of 100 finite difference cells each 1 m in length in the parlance of model terms these are represented as one row by 100 columns each cell has a depth of 10 m and constant head cells are assigned at the left h x 0 10 0 m t and right h x 100 9 0 m t boundaries the flow field is simulated as steady state to isolate system changes due to solute concentration only the simulation runs for 100 days in one model stress period and a time step of 1 day initial concentration is specified as 1 0 g m 3 and a source mass loading takes place at x 30 table 2 summarizes the model setup with additional parameter settings the concentrations in the simulation represent a solute plume that has formed by way of both advection and dispersion after 100 days of mass loading the plume at 100 days is shown in fig 1 for the full model after 100 days concentrations range from the minimum initial concentration of 1 0 g m 3 to a maximum of about 62 g m 3at the solute source x 30 m 3 2 1 d reduced model to mitigate the potential effect of snapshot selection on the reduced model solution a sufficient number of snapshots need to be used snapshots cannot be placed too far apart or they might misrepresent the nonlinear dynamics of the system for this problem it was found experimentally that taking snapshots every 10 days achieved a good compromise between these objectives snapshots are thus taken every 10th time step for each variation of model forcings the sole forcing in this case is the mass loading rate qc to achieve the goal of the reduced model effectively solving for concentration with varying qc snapshots are taken for a range of mass loading rates 25 75 100 300 500 since there are 21 snapshots in each simulation there are a total of 105 snapshots in each snapshot set one snapshot set φ c is composed of solute concentration vectors c at each time step the other φ b is composed of the right hand side vector b for each time step a basis is generated for each of the snapshot sets φ c and φ b using truncated svd for the pod basis the reduced dimension is specified after performing svd on φ c by truncating the singular values at a percent energy of 99 95 the result is a basis p with a reduced dimension of r 18 for linear calculations only this would represent a dimension reduction from 100 to 18 for the nonlinear basis d the reduced dimension is specified directly as d 42 and the 42 singular vectors associated with the 42 largest singular values are thus retained from truncated svd on φ b for nonlinear calculations this represents a dimension reduction from 100 to 42 the combination of reduced dimensions of r 18 and d 42 was found experimentally by performing a combinatorial search and selecting the combination that yielded small maximum error while keeping the reduced dimensions small results of this search are shown in fig 2 it is evident that good solutions maximum error near 0 1 g m3 are available with any combination of pod reduced dimensions r greater than 18 and deim reduced dimensions d greater than 42 3 3 1 d result initial results related to the performance of the reduced model are compiled for a mass loading rate of qc 200 g m 3 monitoring locations were applied at x 20 40 60 and 80 m to capture the accuracy at various extents of the solute plume a single full model run was evaluated to determine reference concentrations for reduced model comparison breakthrough curves for solute concentration over time matched well for the reduced model fig 3 shows the breakthrough curve comparisons for the four monitoring locations since the reduced model s concentrations are very close to the full model errors on the order of 1 the reduced model plume is visually indistinguishable from the full model plume therefore the reduced model result is presented as a difference in concentration between the full and reduced model c f c r on the left side of fig 4 the error can be seen propagating over space and time but never exceeds 0 1 g m 3 the oscillatory behavior of the error is common for projection based reduced models and it is not problematic if the magnitude of the error is consistently below an acceptable threshold the locations of the maximum error 0 07 g m 3 is located near the source location x 30 m during the beginning of the simulation on the right side of fig 4 the distribution of concentrations over the entire spatial domain at 50 and 100 days is shown to be very similar for the full and reduced model the errors are all acceptable for models intended to be quick approximations moreover the reduced model produced good solutions for a range of mass loading rates and the mass budget at each time step as well as the cumulative mass budget confirm that mass is being conserved analysis of reduced model error in the 1 d case can help direct the implementation of pod deim in more complex cases the location and timing of the errors reveals the performance of the reduced model at the times and locations that are of specific interest to the modeler for instance the modeler may be more interested in capturing the peak concentration at a specific point in which case the breakthrough curves of fig 3 would be most important conversely it may be more important to model the overall mass of solute in a plume in which case overall average error metrics would suffice a summary of error metrics for the 1 d test case are in table 3 for this case both high and low concentrations match well throughout the domain and all error statistics are within acceptable ranges of numerical approximations in comparison the errors are slightly larger with the traditional pod approach which doesn t address the nonlinearity 4 two dimensional test case the methodology is next applied to a regional scale two dimensional 2 d model the model is designed such that complexities are introduced only to sufficiently represent a realistic problem scale and not to accurately represent any specific real world conditions the 2 d snapshot selection reduced basis construction and reduced model evaluation are presented in this section 4 1 2 d model design the 2 d model simulates a contaminant leak and the resulting plume migration the model domain is 9300 m by 14 500 m and is composed of one layer 144 rows and 92 columns creating a full model dimension of 13 248 cells the single layer has a depth of 100 m and each cubic cell is 100 m on each side representing a volume of 106 m3 of porous media the contaminant leaks over a horizontal extent of 2000 m at y 4 000 m and from x 4 000 m tox 6 000 m the model runs for 5000 days with a specified constant mass loading rate for each cell simulating the leak the solute plume migrates down the hydraulic gradient toward a well field composed of four extraction wells for the flow solution the injection rate of the contaminant leak is 100 m3 day and the extraction rate is 1000 m3 day for all of the wells in the well field both implemented with the modflow well package wel the flow field is determined by a single steady state modflow solution with constant head boundaries chd to the north 40 m and to the south 4 m and a drain drn set to 4 m in the lower left corner the flow model features chd drn and wel are shown in fig 5 a along with the concentration plume at the end of the simulation hydraulic head contours of the steady flow field are shown in fig 5b along with a randomly generated hydraulic conductivity field using ordinary kriging and an exponential variogram with range 304 and contribution 1 0 additional model parameter values are specified in table 4 it is assumed that the transport parameters are homogeneous and independent of the variations in hydraulic conductivity nonlinear sorption parameters were chosen to introduce a reasonable amount of contaminant retardation that increases nonlinearly as concentration increases according to the freundlich isotherm 4 2 2 d reduced model the snapshot selection for the 2 d test case involved substantial trial and error snapshots must be spaced far enough apart to capture changes in concentration substantially larger than model errors to avoid incorporating numerical noise into the basis conversely snapshots must not be too far apart or a smooth dynamic response might not be captured for the 2 d model this balance was achieved experimentally and snapshots were taken every 6 days for the reduced model to be robust with respect to the magnitude of concentrations snapshots were taken for several simulations with various mass loading rates altogether five simulations were run at various mass loading rates 1000 1100 1200 1300 and 1500 g day intended to span a range of uncertainty in the boundary condition 835 snapshots were taken for each simulation for a total of 4175 snapshots the large snapshot set was devised to avoid the well known issue of reduced model sensitivity to snapshot selection scheme with an optimal snapshot selection algorithm it is likely that a much smaller snapshot set would be sufficient for the first reduced basis p that represents the pod based reduced model the dimension of the system was reduced from 13 248 to 10 r 10 capturing 99 5 of the system energy while reducing the dimension of the system by three orders of magnitude for the second nonlinear basis d the deim based reduced model used a reduced dimension of d 286 capturing over 99 98 of the nonlinear system energy while reducing the dimension of the nonlinear calculations by two orders of magnitude since a combinatorial search for an optimal pair of reduced dimensions for the 2 d model was not feasible for the entire reduced dimension space an abbreviated search was conducted and is shown in fig 6 fig 6 addresses the sensitivity of the reduced model accuracy to the selection of pod and deim basis vectors beyond a reduced dimension of r 12 for the pod step there is no further improvement in accuracy regardless of the number of deim points used the reduced dimensions were determined experimentally to be the smallest such dimensions that produced a reduced model solution with the lowest possible error 4 3 2 d result the pod deim reduced model performance is demonstrated on a simulation with a mass loading rate of 1250 g day the concentration distribution of the full model plume after 5000 days is shown in fig 5 concentration contours for both the full model and the reduced model are compared in fig 7 in the context of the model domain the full and reduced concentration contours match very well for a closer look at the change in concentration over time four observation locations positioned in row column 44 38 49 48 53 57 and 60 53 shown in fig 7 produce breakthrough curves for the full and reduced model fig 8 slight errors in concentration are evident by the deviation of the reduced model black lines curves from the center line of the full model colored lines curves with respect to the magnitude of the full model concentrations being approximated the maximum errors are less than 2 a more complete picture of the error can be shown by comparing the snapshots collected from both the full and reduced models the rmse for concentration in each model cell captured in the snapshots is presented in fig 9 the largest errors occur in a row of cells just below the source of the mass loading but these cells still have an rmse less than 2 g m3 for the nonlinear snapshots the result fig 10 is similar but due to the large magnitude of values in the snapshots it is presented in terms of nrmse the locations of the 286 interpolation points are also shown in fig 10 as black dots most of the points are clustered around the plume location and some are scattered along the trajectory of the plume one point is kept slightly above the mass loading boundary which represents the upgradient background concentration the pod deim reduced model was also tested on 50 simulations with randomly generated mass loading rates that span those included in the snapshot set i e 1000 1500 g m3 both the full model and the pod deim reduced model with r 10 and d 286 were run and compared for each sample the statistics of errors in the snapshot sets compiled over all 50 samples and compared to the single reduced model are shown in table 5 the mean nrmse and percent error are similar for both sets of snapshots the mean rmse over the entire model domain is also captured for each snapshot time and presented in fig 11 a nearly 100 of all snapshot times have an rmse less than 1 g m3 with a maximum rmse of 0 42 g m3 in fig 11b the maximum reduced error for each of the 50 samples is compared to the maximum simulated concentration which reflects the mass loading rate imposed the samples with the lowest error were near the middle of the concentration range incorporated in the snapshots additionally there is larger error associated with larger concentrations which could be due to the larger mass loading interval used between snapshots taken for 1300 and 1500 g day 5 discussion selection of the reduced dimensions r and d for the 1 d model show that the reduction potential for such a simple model is limited a dimension reduction from 100 to 42 implies 42 out of a possible 100 interpolation points are used to obtain a good reduced model fig 2 conversely for the 2 d model a dimension reduction from 13 248 to 286 implies 286 out of a possible 13 248 about 2 interpolation points are used for an accurate 2 d reduced model considering that the solute plume in the 1 d model covers a significant portion of the model domain the amount of the model domain that needs to be incorporated into the pod deim reduced model via the reduced dimension d may depend on the spatial extent of the changing concentrations though the dynamics between the specification of the two reduced dimensions is model specific it is clear for the 1 d test case that d 42 is necessary for accurate reduced model solutions given d 42 a range of values for r produce acceptable error and that error generally decreases monotonically with increasing r while the 1 d model does show the concept of pod deim model reduction can work with acceptable error for a nonlinear solute transport problem in practice there would never be a need for a reduced version of such a simple model thereby necessitating a more complex 2 d test case the results of the 2 d test case demonstrate the effectiveness of the pod deim reduced model on a regional scale solute transport simulation with nonlinear sorption the reduced dimensions were three orders of magnitude less than the full dimension for the initial pod on the snapshots of concentration and two orders of magnitude less than the full dimension for deim on the nonlinear snapshots though the selection of the reduced dimensions is problem dependent and requires some trial and error at least 99 9 energy is preserved when constructing both the pod and the deim bases p and d the location of the deim points are automatically chosen and demonstrate good coverage of the solute plume s spatial extent as expected points corresponding to locations with negligible changes in concentration are not used it was found that adding additional deim points beyond 286 did not significantly reduce the error fig 6 as they may be providing too much redundant linearly dependent information the pod deim reduced models developed with the methods of this research are robust to uncertainties in mass loading rates and the underlying flow field this means that if the exact leakage rate of a contaminant was unknown any number of mass loading rates within the range of those used to construct the snapshot set can be simulated and the reduced model would perform well the analysis of 50 random samples of mass loading rates shows that accuracy is best near the middle of the range used to construct the snapshot set fig 11b therefore the snapshot set should be designed to adequately bracket the range of uncertainty uncertainty in the steady flow field was examined by generating a stochastic hydraulic conductivity field the variation in magnitude and direction of the velocity vectors presents additional complexity to the solute transport model the sufficient accuracy of the reduced model under these conditions implies that the automatic selection of deim points works to capture both advection and dispersion in various directions additional sources of uncertainty could be captured in the snapshot sets by varying other model inputs such as transport parameters the results for both the 1 d and 2 d models exhibit high sensitivity to the snapshot set the numerical results for each reduced model substantially depend on what is captured in the snapshot set the snapshot set size is determined by a how many snapshots are taken for each simulation and b how many simulations are performed over the range of stresses mass loading rate in this case being captured the sensitivity is also related to the values chosen for the stresses in each simulation if the magnitude of these stresses span a large range there may be a need for more simulations in the snapshot set than if they span a small range these findings related to the snapshot set sensitivity highlight the potential benefit of an optimal snapshot selection method however good reduced model performance has been demonstrated even without optimal snapshots suggesting that an optimal snapshot selection could only further improve the performance rudimentary timing analysis shows that the pod deim reduced model is always faster than the full model however due to optimized solver options for the full model and a generic reduced model solver timing of the full and reduced models is not directly comparable even so the reduced model for the 2 d test case reduces run time to an average of about 3 5 min compared to about 10 min for the full model performed on an intel r core tm i7 2 8 ghz it is important to note that for these experiments it is the order of magnitude of the problem dimensions that signifies the substantial improvement of the reduced model with respect to the full model the speedup of the reduced model is also limited by the overhead of the software such as extensive file read and write routines to account for this cpu time was also compared for the cumulative time spent in the full model solver 419 s and the generic reduced model solver 22 s for a speedup of about 95 in contrast 0 14 s of cpu time were needed for the deim calculations in eq 12 that are precomputed once for each simulation if an optimal solver was designed for the reduced model as it was for the full model zheng and wang 1999 reduced model runtime could be substantially reduced while optimizing the code for speed was not the focus of this research the successful reduced model implementation within commonly used software provides an avenue for broader applications of pod deim primarily the reduction of the problem dimensions by two and three orders of magnitude presents a major step toward faster nonlinear solute transport simulations 6 conclusion in conclusion this research demonstrates the feasibility of using pod and deim to reduce a solute transport model with nonlinear sorption and largely dispersive behavior low peclet number while the application of pod deim to this type of solute transport is the primary contribution of this work a secondary contribution is the modification of the mt3d usgs software the implementation of this research within the mt3d framework provides flexibility for the application of pod deim since many solute transport models that have been published to date utilize that software the methods were tested on a simple 1 d model and a more complex heterogenous 2 d model an explicit trade off between the two reduced dimensions was presented for each case for the regional scale 2 d model the reduced dimensions were three and two orders of magnitude less than the full model dimensions for the pod and deim reduction routines respectively while the speedup of the reduced model is limited by the overhead of the software this dimension reduction for nonlinear solute transport models is demonstrated for the first time the application of the reduced modeling methodology also demonstrated a sensitivity to snapshot selection but accurate reduced models were produced even without an optimal snapshot selection overall this study represents a step toward being able to reduce very large complex regional groundwater flow and solute transport simulations future research in this field might involve reduced modeling strategies for the combination of nonlinear groundwater flow and nonlinear solute transport since this is the common case for many modern models used for planning and management purposes acknowledgments we wish to thank the four anonymous reviewers for their

612,computer simulations of groundwater flow and solute transport are often burdened by long runtimes the simulations are necessarily complex to capture the system dynamics and finely discretized spatial and temporal domains are often needed for solution accuracy and stability model reduction allows for the approximation of system state by solving equations in a reduced dimensional space proper orthogonal decomposition pod is an effective way to reduce the dimensionality of systems of differential equations that are discretized by finite difference or finite element methods if the problems are nonlinear in nature the discrete empirical interpolation method deim has been shown to supplement pod by further reducing the dimension of nonlinear calculations here the combined pod deim approach is shown to work on a problem of 2 dimensional groundwater flow with solute transport exhibiting nonlinear sorption the application is restricted to largely dispersive problems low peclet number results show areas of high concentration are effectively identified with mean errors less than 2 of the full model keywords model reduction solute transport proper orthogonal decomposition discrete empirical interpolation nonlinear differential equations 1 introduction groundwater flow and solute transport models often present a high demand on computational resources the groundwater flow component and solute transport component must be solved separately and are often coupled together either the flow or the transport component may be nonlinear if representing unconfined conditions or nonlinear sorption reaction respectively nonlinear problems require additional solver iterations for each time step the solution dimensionality of these models is determined by the number of cells in the finite difference or finite element mesh as the modelled region becomes larger and or spatial discretization becomes finer the number of cells can be in the millions added computational demand arises when modeling transient conditions for a long time horizon the highest degree of complexity occurs when density dependence is considered and the flow and transport solutions must have yet another additional iteration between the two component solutions at each time step one consequence of modeling complex systems with high fidelity models is that completing one simulation can take hours or even days even with a substantial number of modern cpus any type of problem that involves running a high dimensional groundwater flow and solute transport model thousands of times e g parameter estimation monte carlo or management optimizations can be impractical or even infeasible the option to use a lower fidelity model that has fewer cells and or time steps may be appealing but is often accompanied by large reductions in accuracy model reduction techniques are a way to reduce the dimension of solution space at each time step thereby reducing total runtimes of the simulation model so that many types of problems become solvable in a reasonable amount of time with acceptable reduced model error while being a new field of research model reduction for groundwater flow models has been well studied a popular model reduction technique for groundwater flow is to use proper orthogonal decomposition pod to identify a lower dimensional basis on which to project the high dimensional model mcphee and yeh 2008 many variations of pod based model reduction have been proposed in the literature for linear confined groundwater flow problems boyce et al 2015 boyce and yeh 2014 mcphee and yeh 2008 pasetto et al 2013 siade et al 2012 vermeulen et al 2004a 2004b alternatively there are other methods of surrogate modeling such as data driven approaches which also achieve the desired outcome of a reduced model but do not intrinsically represent the known physics of the system being simulated these other methods are reviewed in asher et al 2015 an additional reduced modeling technique is needed to address the problematic nature of pod based model reduction on nonlinear problems in which there are still calculations that scale up with the dimension of the full model the discrete empirical interpolation method deim was introduced to formulate a reduced model with a solution complexity that scaled only with reduced dimensions chaturantabut and sorensen 2010 pod and deim have been combined in a shallow groundwater context to show the effectiveness of the dual reduction approach ştefănescu and navon 2013 recent developments have also allowed for model reduction for nonlinear unconfined groundwater flow by supplementing a pod based reduced model with deim to approximate nonlinear calculations stanko et al 2016 this recent work not only showed the effectiveness of the dual approach but also implemented it within the commonly used software modflow harbaugh 2005 specifically modflow owhm hanson et al 2014 the combined approach serves to reduce the dimension of nonlinear operations while sacrificing acceptable increases in error and with error bounds that are tractable chaturantabut and sorensen 2010 in contrast to the concept of model reduction for groundwater flow model reduction research for solute transport is in its very early stages robinson et al 2012 has shown that similar pod based model reduction techniques can work for linear solute transport models solving the advection dispersion equation in that work a small 1 m2 two dimensional finite element model with linear sorption was reduced and solved within the finite element heat and mass transfer fehm code research in pod reduced modeling for advection dispersion has shown sensitivity to snapshot selection and better performance with a randomly generated realization of heterogeneous media when compared to the zonal approach li and hu 2013 rizzo et al 2018 further demonstrated the effectiveness of a pod based approach to model reduction of linear solute transport models with enhancements such as an adaptive snapshot splitting technique which showed improved performance with low peclet numbers additional work has demonstrated successful pod based model reduction on a variable density flow and transport problem li et al 2013 but this work suggested the need for a modified approach like deim to address mathematical nonlinearities that cause significant errors in long term predictions with pod based reduced models since deim has been effective in reducing various nonlinear models tezduyar et al 2008 chaturantabut and sorensen 2011 dimitriu et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 it is a likely candidate for modeling nonlinear solute transport when coupled with groundwater flow one of the benefits of a dual model reduction approach to a coupled flow and transport model is the reduction in number of nonlinear operations too many of which can hinder the application of such models it is also likely that repeated calculations of solute concentration in areas of low concentration within a large groundwater flow model are not necessary for problems involving a contaminant plume or seawater intrusion the location of a high concentration region within a much larger groundwater domain is desired model reduction via pod and deim may help approximate concentrations in these areas while maintaining high computational efficiency the following section provides the derivation of pod deim for an advection dispersion equation that includes nonlinear sorption this study then applies this method to one dimensional 1 d and two dimensional 2 d nonlinear solute transport simulations to date this is the only known application of pod deim reduced models to nonlinear solute transport 2 methodology the following methodology introduces the equations for groundwater flow and solute transport reduced modeling by pod and deim will be derived for the transport equation the implementation of these methods within the commonly used mt3dms software zheng and wang 1999 framework as updated by bedekar et al 2016 will be described all variable definitions are compiled in table 1 with the following convention uppercase letters for scalar variables bold lowercase for one dimensional vectors bold uppercase for two dimensional matrices 2 1 groundwater flow the groundwater flow equations that are employed in this method are the unadulterated versions that are described in harbaugh 2005 modflow 2005 is used to generate a steady flow field as input to the transport model in more advance simulations this would be an iterative process however to address the specific intention of nonlinear solute transport model reduction the flow system is assumed to be steady and need only be generated once and provided to the transport simulation as a flow velocity field for this experiment the groundwater flow equations are not reduced as they were in stanko et al 2016 instead the full flow solution is retained to isolate the solute transport reduction process 2 2 solute transport solute transport is modeled by way of the advection dispersion reaction equation as it is incorporated into the updated software mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 the newer version of mt3d provides several additional features not present in the original mt3dms software the new software corrects a small error that caused mass to not be conserved in some cases facilitates solute transport calculations in additional groundwater flow packages as well as in the unsaturated zone and adds flexibility to the solution scheme by manipulating the way some terms are incorporated into the solution scheme implementing the reduced modeling approach within this code ensures its usefulness for the latest generation of simulation programs 2 2 1 governing equation the following equation is a full three dimensional representation of advection dispersion and reaction of a single solute in a groundwater flow system as presented in

3 are approximated in space and time by an implicit finite difference algorithm with an upstream weighting scheme details of the derivations are provided in zheng and wang 1999 the retardation factor for systems simulating freundlich sorption is r 1 ρ b θ a k f c a 1 when the discretized transport equation is formulated for each node in the model the result is a system of equations represented in matrix form eq 4 the continuous concentration variable c becomes a vector of concentrations at each finite difference cell c the coefficient matrix a c is a sparse banded matrix that depends on the solute concentrations for simulations involving nonlinear sorption or reaction because the matrix a c is a function of c and it is multiplied by the vector c eq 4 is a nonlinear equation also because c t 1 is time dependent a c is also time dependent and is reformed at each time step using updated values of c the number of diagonals in a c depends on the spatial dimensions of the simulation 1 d 2 d or 3d as well as the treatment cross terms in the dispersion tensor for the purposes of this study a new mt3d usgs feature that lumps cross dispersion terms which could also be omitted into the right hand side vector is not used 4 a c c t 1 b an important consideration in advection dispersion modeling is the peclet number pe which is defined in eq 5 5 p e v δ x d where v is the magnitude of seepage velocity of groundwater flow δx is the length of one model cell and d is the magnitude of dispersion coefficient the peclet number is an indicator for the amount of advection relative to dispersion large peclet numbers pe 2 represent an advection dominated simulation which can suffer from numerical errors zheng and bennett 2002 simulations in this study are restricted to dispersion dominated cases pe 1 to avoid these problematic errors 2 3 model reduction model reduction of the advection dispersion equations is achieved by projecting the full system of equations onto a lower dimensional subspace by the methods first presented for groundwater flow in vermeulen et al 2004a in summary a smaller system with fewer unknown variables is formed that captures most of the dynamics of the original system as measured by the principal vectors obtained through singular value decomposition svd the intel fortran preconditioned jacobi svd algorithm https software intel com en us mkl developer reference fortran singular value decomposition lapack driver routines is used in this study in order to build the reduced system a collection of full system snapshots must be obtained then truncated svd is applied to the snapshots and galerkin projection is employed to reduce the dimension of the original system in addition a second set of snapshots is used to represent the nonlinearities of the model which for this study is the entire matrix calculation a c c t 1 svd and galerkin projection are both performed again on the nonlinear snapshots and the dual reduced model is formed in this section these steps are explained in more detail 2 3 1 snapshot selection snapshots are defined as a full spatial representation of the system state at an instant of time a selection of snapshots is needed for both pod and deim methods for pod snapshots of the vector c obtained when eq 4 is solved by any of the solution techniques native to the mt3d usgs software are preserved at selected times and added to the snapshot set φ c for deim snapshots of the nonlinear calculation in eq 4 a c c t 1 which is equivalent the right hand side vector b are retained in φ b the snapshot times are identical for φ c and φ b the snapshot selection procedure includes selecting which simulation variables e g aquifer parameters and boundary condition values to use for each sample of the full model and the times at which the solution is added to the snapshot set the performance of a projection based reduced model is highly sensitive to the snapshot set used to construct the reduced basis siade et al 2010 2 3 2 proper orthogonal decomposition proper orthogonal decomposition pod is a method used to decompose a matrix into orthogonal components first singular value decomposition is performed on φ c then a number of singular values that account for nearly all e g 99 or 99 9 of the matrix information also called energy can be selected and the remaining singular values are truncated and discarded the percent energy criterion is used to define the number of singular values retained which translates to the first reduced dimension r the matrix p r n r with r n is composed of the eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest singular values the full state space vector c r n 1 can now be approximated as pc r where c r r r 1 substituting this approximation into eq 4 yields 6 a c pc r t 1 b 2 3 3 galerkin projection the galerkin projection technique involves the translation from full model space to reduced model space to achieve this reduction eq 6 is premultiplied by p t to obtain eq 7 which is a reduced system of equations herein called the pod reduced model while the dimension of some calculations is reduced in the pod reduced model of eq 7 the calculation p t a c needs to be computed at each time step since the entries of a c depend on the changing concentration field and scales with the original full dimension of n 7 p t a c pc r t 1 p t b 2 3 4 discrete empirical interpolation method the discrete empirical interpolation method deim is a method used to capture nonlinear dynamics of a system of partial differential equations through a finite set of interpolation indices the discrete empirical interpolation method is implemented specifically to reduce the nonlinear term s dependency on the full dimension of the original model n to approximate nonlinearities in a reduced space a nonlinear projection basis d is obtained via pod on φ b the initial deim approximation eq 8 is made by approximating the nonlinear operation a c c t 1 with a linear operation 8 a c c t 1 dz where z r d 1 is a vector of unknown coefficients since eq 8 is overdetermined only d equations are required to solve for z the retained rows of the system are the interpolation indices that are selected through the process described in stefanescu and navon 2013 the selection algorithm for the interpolation indices chooses points that have the largest residual error when iteratively reconstructing the basis with an additional column of d in each iteration algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode for selecting the interpolation indices and the steps involved in the deim procedure to reformulate eq 8 as a well determined system of equations z r n d is defined as a diminished permutation matrix which retains only the d columns of a full permutation matrix d n corresponding to the interpolation indices d premultiplying eq 8 by z t eq 9 retains only the rows of a c and d that correspond to interpolation points 9 z t a c c t 1 z t dz eq 9 can now be inverted to solve for z eq 10 and subsequently substituted back into eq 8 to obtain the final approximation of the nonlinear term eq 11 finally galerkin projection can be applied again as in eq 7 to achieve a new reduced model herein called the pod deim reduced model eq 12 10 z z t d 1 z t a c c t 1 11 a c c t 1 d z t d 1 z t a c c t 1 12 p t d z t d 1 z t a c pc r t 1 p t b r n n d d d d n n r r 1 r 1 all calculations dependent on the dimension n p t d z t d 1 can be precomputed and the precomputation of ztd 1 is executed with lu decomposition the final pod deim reduced model eq 12 is solved for c r t 1 at each time step entirely within the reduced dimension in other words there are no nonlinear operations that must be carried out in the full n space during the simulation and the complexity of the pod deim reduced model solution scales only with dimensions r and d note that since a c is a sparse matrix that results from finite difference discretization the complexity of a c p scales with the dimension r not n 2 4 error and uncertainty the error for any reduced model is henceforth defined as the difference between the original full model solution and the reduced model solution this error is calculated for both the concentration solution in the full model dimension as well as the result of the nonlinear operation a c c which is the same as the vector b for the governing equation under consideration absolute error is presented in concentration units root mean squared errors rmse and normalized root mean squared error nrmse are calculated for each case so the errors can be weighted by the span of concentration values eq 13 13 n r m s e f u l l r e d u c e d 2 n c m a x c m i n r m s e c m a x c m i n where 2 is the euclidean norm to account for various numerical inaccuracies a statistical experiment is designed such that uncertain components of the reduced modeling methodology are varied randomly to assess their significance this research employs a random draw from a uniform distribution of mass loading rates and a random log normal hydraulic conductivity field the field was generated with the python package pyemu white et al 2016 using ordinary kriging and an exponential variogram range 304 and contribution 1 0 the accuracy of the reduced model always depends on the snapshot set and number of principal vectors retained after truncation given that this uncertainty experiment shows the range of accuracies attainable with an already constructed reduced model assuming the snapshot set is sufficient an optimal snapshot set might achieve superior accuracy but this is beyond the scope of this study 3 one dimensional test case the first test of the pod deim methodology was implemented within mt3d usgs and tested on a simple one dimensional 1 d model eq 14 describes the 1 d transport governing equation as modified from eq 2 where change in groundwater storage is zero q s 0 for steady flow mass loading qc replaces the flux term qscs and the dispersion coefficient d is treated as constant in this 1 d model the aquifer is assumed to me homogeneous and isotropic 14 r c t ν x c x d 2 c x 2 q c λ 1 θ c λ 2 ρ b c 3 1 1 d model design the 1 d model consists of 100 finite difference cells each 1 m in length in the parlance of model terms these are represented as one row by 100 columns each cell has a depth of 10 m and constant head cells are assigned at the left h x 0 10 0 m t and right h x 100 9 0 m t boundaries the flow field is simulated as steady state to isolate system changes due to solute concentration only the simulation runs for 100 days in one model stress period and a time step of 1 day initial concentration is specified as 1 0 g m 3 and a source mass loading takes place at x 30 table 2 summarizes the model setup with additional parameter settings the concentrations in the simulation represent a solute plume that has formed by way of both advection and dispersion after 100 days of mass loading the plume at 100 days is shown in fig 1 for the full model after 100 days concentrations range from the minimum initial concentration of 1 0 g m 3 to a maximum of about 62 g m 3at the solute source x 30 m 3 2 1 d reduced model to mitigate the potential effect of snapshot selection on the reduced model solution a sufficient number of snapshots need to be used snapshots cannot be placed too far apart or they might misrepresent the nonlinear dynamics of the system for this problem it was found experimentally that taking snapshots every 10 days achieved a good compromise between these objectives snapshots are thus taken every 10th time step for each variation of model forcings the sole forcing in this case is the mass loading rate qc to achieve the goal of the reduced model effectively solving for concentration with varying qc snapshots are taken for a range of mass loading rates 25 75 100 300 500 since there are 21 snapshots in each simulation there are a total of 105 snapshots in each snapshot set one snapshot set φ c is composed of solute concentration vectors c at each time step the other φ b is composed of the right hand side vector b for each time step a basis is generated for each of the snapshot sets φ c and φ b using truncated svd for the pod basis the reduced dimension is specified after performing svd on φ c by truncating the singular values at a percent energy of 99 95 the result is a basis p with a reduced dimension of r 18 for linear calculations only this would represent a dimension reduction from 100 to 18 for the nonlinear basis d the reduced dimension is specified directly as d 42 and the 42 singular vectors associated with the 42 largest singular values are thus retained from truncated svd on φ b for nonlinear calculations this represents a dimension reduction from 100 to 42 the combination of reduced dimensions of r 18 and d 42 was found experimentally by performing a combinatorial search and selecting the combination that yielded small maximum error while keeping the reduced dimensions small results of this search are shown in fig 2 it is evident that good solutions maximum error near 0 1 g m3 are available with any combination of pod reduced dimensions r greater than 18 and deim reduced dimensions d greater than 42 3 3 1 d result initial results related to the performance of the reduced model are compiled for a mass loading rate of qc 200 g m 3 monitoring locations were applied at x 20 40 60 and 80 m to capture the accuracy at various extents of the solute plume a single full model run was evaluated to determine reference concentrations for reduced model comparison breakthrough curves for solute concentration over time matched well for the reduced model fig 3 shows the breakthrough curve comparisons for the four monitoring locations since the reduced model s concentrations are very close to the full model errors on the order of 1 the reduced model plume is visually indistinguishable from the full model plume therefore the reduced model result is presented as a difference in concentration between the full and reduced model c f c r on the left side of fig 4 the error can be seen propagating over space and time but never exceeds 0 1 g m 3 the oscillatory behavior of the error is common for projection based reduced models and it is not problematic if the magnitude of the error is consistently below an acceptable threshold the locations of the maximum error 0 07 g m 3 is located near the source location x 30 m during the beginning of the simulation on the right side of fig 4 the distribution of concentrations over the entire spatial domain at 50 and 100 days is shown to be very similar for the full and reduced model the errors are all acceptable for models intended to be quick approximations moreover the reduced model produced good solutions for a range of mass loading rates and the mass budget at each time step as well as the cumulative mass budget confirm that mass is being conserved analysis of reduced model error in the 1 d case can help direct the implementation of pod deim in more complex cases the location and timing of the errors reveals the performance of the reduced model at the times and locations that are of specific interest to the modeler for instance the modeler may be more interested in capturing the peak concentration at a specific point in which case the breakthrough curves of fig 3 would be most important conversely it may be more important to model the overall mass of solute in a plume in which case overall average error metrics would suffice a summary of error metrics for the 1 d test case are in table 3 for this case both high and low concentrations match well throughout the domain and all error statistics are within acceptable ranges of numerical approximations in comparison the errors are slightly larger with the traditional pod approach which doesn t address the nonlinearity 4 two dimensional test case the methodology is next applied to a regional scale two dimensional 2 d model the model is designed such that complexities are introduced only to sufficiently represent a realistic problem scale and not to accurately represent any specific real world conditions the 2 d snapshot selection reduced basis construction and reduced model evaluation are presented in this section 4 1 2 d model design the 2 d model simulates a contaminant leak and the resulting plume migration the model domain is 9300 m by 14 500 m and is composed of one layer 144 rows and 92 columns creating a full model dimension of 13 248 cells the single layer has a depth of 100 m and each cubic cell is 100 m on each side representing a volume of 106 m3 of porous media the contaminant leaks over a horizontal extent of 2000 m at y 4 000 m and from x 4 000 m tox 6 000 m the model runs for 5000 days with a specified constant mass loading rate for each cell simulating the leak the solute plume migrates down the hydraulic gradient toward a well field composed of four extraction wells for the flow solution the injection rate of the contaminant leak is 100 m3 day and the extraction rate is 1000 m3 day for all of the wells in the well field both implemented with the modflow well package wel the flow field is determined by a single steady state modflow solution with constant head boundaries chd to the north 40 m and to the south 4 m and a drain drn set to 4 m in the lower left corner the flow model features chd drn and wel are shown in fig 5 a along with the concentration plume at the end of the simulation hydraulic head contours of the steady flow field are shown in fig 5b along with a randomly generated hydraulic conductivity field using ordinary kriging and an exponential variogram with range 304 and contribution 1 0 additional model parameter values are specified in table 4 it is assumed that the transport parameters are homogeneous and independent of the variations in hydraulic conductivity nonlinear sorption parameters were chosen to introduce a reasonable amount of contaminant retardation that increases nonlinearly as concentration increases according to the freundlich isotherm 4 2 2 d reduced model the snapshot selection for the 2 d test case involved substantial trial and error snapshots must be spaced far enough apart to capture changes in concentration substantially larger than model errors to avoid incorporating numerical noise into the basis conversely snapshots must not be too far apart or a smooth dynamic response might not be captured for the 2 d model this balance was achieved experimentally and snapshots were taken every 6 days for the reduced model to be robust with respect to the magnitude of concentrations snapshots were taken for several simulations with various mass loading rates altogether five simulations were run at various mass loading rates 1000 1100 1200 1300 and 1500 g day intended to span a range of uncertainty in the boundary condition 835 snapshots were taken for each simulation for a total of 4175 snapshots the large snapshot set was devised to avoid the well known issue of reduced model sensitivity to snapshot selection scheme with an optimal snapshot selection algorithm it is likely that a much smaller snapshot set would be sufficient for the first reduced basis p that represents the pod based reduced model the dimension of the system was reduced from 13 248 to 10 r 10 capturing 99 5 of the system energy while reducing the dimension of the system by three orders of magnitude for the second nonlinear basis d the deim based reduced model used a reduced dimension of d 286 capturing over 99 98 of the nonlinear system energy while reducing the dimension of the nonlinear calculations by two orders of magnitude since a combinatorial search for an optimal pair of reduced dimensions for the 2 d model was not feasible for the entire reduced dimension space an abbreviated search was conducted and is shown in fig 6 fig 6 addresses the sensitivity of the reduced model accuracy to the selection of pod and deim basis vectors beyond a reduced dimension of r 12 for the pod step there is no further improvement in accuracy regardless of the number of deim points used the reduced dimensions were determined experimentally to be the smallest such dimensions that produced a reduced model solution with the lowest possible error 4 3 2 d result the pod deim reduced model performance is demonstrated on a simulation with a mass loading rate of 1250 g day the concentration distribution of the full model plume after 5000 days is shown in fig 5 concentration contours for both the full model and the reduced model are compared in fig 7 in the context of the model domain the full and reduced concentration contours match very well for a closer look at the change in concentration over time four observation locations positioned in row column 44 38 49 48 53 57 and 60 53 shown in fig 7 produce breakthrough curves for the full and reduced model fig 8 slight errors in concentration are evident by the deviation of the reduced model black lines curves from the center line of the full model colored lines curves with respect to the magnitude of the full model concentrations being approximated the maximum errors are less than 2 a more complete picture of the error can be shown by comparing the snapshots collected from both the full and reduced models the rmse for concentration in each model cell captured in the snapshots is presented in fig 9 the largest errors occur in a row of cells just below the source of the mass loading but these cells still have an rmse less than 2 g m3 for the nonlinear snapshots the result fig 10 is similar but due to the large magnitude of values in the snapshots it is presented in terms of nrmse the locations of the 286 interpolation points are also shown in fig 10 as black dots most of the points are clustered around the plume location and some are scattered along the trajectory of the plume one point is kept slightly above the mass loading boundary which represents the upgradient background concentration the pod deim reduced model was also tested on 50 simulations with randomly generated mass loading rates that span those included in the snapshot set i e 1000 1500 g m3 both the full model and the pod deim reduced model with r 10 and d 286 were run and compared for each sample the statistics of errors in the snapshot sets compiled over all 50 samples and compared to the single reduced model are shown in table 5 the mean nrmse and percent error are similar for both sets of snapshots the mean rmse over the entire model domain is also captured for each snapshot time and presented in fig 11 a nearly 100 of all snapshot times have an rmse less than 1 g m3 with a maximum rmse of 0 42 g m3 in fig 11b the maximum reduced error for each of the 50 samples is compared to the maximum simulated concentration which reflects the mass loading rate imposed the samples with the lowest error were near the middle of the concentration range incorporated in the snapshots additionally there is larger error associated with larger concentrations which could be due to the larger mass loading interval used between snapshots taken for 1300 and 1500 g day 5 discussion selection of the reduced dimensions r and d for the 1 d model show that the reduction potential for such a simple model is limited a dimension reduction from 100 to 42 implies 42 out of a possible 100 interpolation points are used to obtain a good reduced model fig 2 conversely for the 2 d model a dimension reduction from 13 248 to 286 implies 286 out of a possible 13 248 about 2 interpolation points are used for an accurate 2 d reduced model considering that the solute plume in the 1 d model covers a significant portion of the model domain the amount of the model domain that needs to be incorporated into the pod deim reduced model via the reduced dimension d may depend on the spatial extent of the changing concentrations though the dynamics between the specification of the two reduced dimensions is model specific it is clear for the 1 d test case that d 42 is necessary for accurate reduced model solutions given d 42 a range of values for r produce acceptable error and that error generally decreases monotonically with increasing r while the 1 d model does show the concept of pod deim model reduction can work with acceptable error for a nonlinear solute transport problem in practice there would never be a need for a reduced version of such a simple model thereby necessitating a more complex 2 d test case the results of the 2 d test case demonstrate the effectiveness of the pod deim reduced model on a regional scale solute transport simulation with nonlinear sorption the reduced dimensions were three orders of magnitude less than the full dimension for the initial pod on the snapshots of concentration and two orders of magnitude less than the full dimension for deim on the nonlinear snapshots though the selection of the reduced dimensions is problem dependent and requires some trial and error at least 99 9 energy is preserved when constructing both the pod and the deim bases p and d the location of the deim points are automatically chosen and demonstrate good coverage of the solute plume s spatial extent as expected points corresponding to locations with negligible changes in concentration are not used it was found that adding additional deim points beyond 286 did not significantly reduce the error fig 6 as they may be providing too much redundant linearly dependent information the pod deim reduced models developed with the methods of this research are robust to uncertainties in mass loading rates and the underlying flow field this means that if the exact leakage rate of a contaminant was unknown any number of mass loading rates within the range of those used to construct the snapshot set can be simulated and the reduced model would perform well the analysis of 50 random samples of mass loading rates shows that accuracy is best near the middle of the range used to construct the snapshot set fig 11b therefore the snapshot set should be designed to adequately bracket the range of uncertainty uncertainty in the steady flow field was examined by generating a stochastic hydraulic conductivity field the variation in magnitude and direction of the velocity vectors presents additional complexity to the solute transport model the sufficient accuracy of the reduced model under these conditions implies that the automatic selection of deim points works to capture both advection and dispersion in various directions additional sources of uncertainty could be captured in the snapshot sets by varying other model inputs such as transport parameters the results for both the 1 d and 2 d models exhibit high sensitivity to the snapshot set the numerical results for each reduced model substantially depend on what is captured in the snapshot set the snapshot set size is determined by a how many snapshots are taken for each simulation and b how many simulations are performed over the range of stresses mass loading rate in this case being captured the sensitivity is also related to the values chosen for the stresses in each simulation if the magnitude of these stresses span a large range there may be a need for more simulations in the snapshot set than if they span a small range these findings related to the snapshot set sensitivity highlight the potential benefit of an optimal snapshot selection method however good reduced model performance has been demonstrated even without optimal snapshots suggesting that an optimal snapshot selection could only further improve the performance rudimentary timing analysis shows that the pod deim reduced model is always faster than the full model however due to optimized solver options for the full model and a generic reduced model solver timing of the full and reduced models is not directly comparable even so the reduced model for the 2 d test case reduces run time to an average of about 3 5 min compared to about 10 min for the full model performed on an intel r core tm i7 2 8 ghz it is important to note that for these experiments it is the order of magnitude of the problem dimensions that signifies the substantial improvement of the reduced model with respect to the full model the speedup of the reduced model is also limited by the overhead of the software such as extensive file read and write routines to account for this cpu time was also compared for the cumulative time spent in the full model solver 419 s and the generic reduced model solver 22 s for a speedup of about 95 in contrast 0 14 s of cpu time were needed for the deim calculations in eq 12 that are precomputed once for each simulation if an optimal solver was designed for the reduced model as it was for the full model zheng and wang 1999 reduced model runtime could be substantially reduced while optimizing the code for speed was not the focus of this research the successful reduced model implementation within commonly used software provides an avenue for broader applications of pod deim primarily the reduction of the problem dimensions by two and three orders of magnitude presents a major step toward faster nonlinear solute transport simulations 6 conclusion in conclusion this research demonstrates the feasibility of using pod and deim to reduce a solute transport model with nonlinear sorption and largely dispersive behavior low peclet number while the application of pod deim to this type of solute transport is the primary contribution of this work a secondary contribution is the modification of the mt3d usgs software the implementation of this research within the mt3d framework provides flexibility for the application of pod deim since many solute transport models that have been published to date utilize that software the methods were tested on a simple 1 d model and a more complex heterogenous 2 d model an explicit trade off between the two reduced dimensions was presented for each case for the regional scale 2 d model the reduced dimensions were three and two orders of magnitude less than the full model dimensions for the pod and deim reduction routines respectively while the speedup of the reduced model is limited by the overhead of the software this dimension reduction for nonlinear solute transport models is demonstrated for the first time the application of the reduced modeling methodology also demonstrated a sensitivity to snapshot selection but accurate reduced models were produced even without an optimal snapshot selection overall this study represents a step toward being able to reduce very large complex regional groundwater flow and solute transport simulations future research in this field might involve reduced modeling strategies for the combination of nonlinear groundwater flow and nonlinear solute transport since this is the common case for many modern models used for planning and management purposes acknowledgments we wish to thank the four anonymous reviewers for their

613,the spontaneous imbibition of water into the matrix and gas filled fractures of unsaturated porous media is an important phenomenon in many geotechnical applications previous studies have focused on the imbibition behavior of water in the matrix but few works have considered spontaneous imbibition along fractures in this work a new fractal model considering the water losses from the fracture to the matrix was established to predict the sorptivity of rough walled fracture a fractal model considering the fractal dimension of tortuosity was modified to estimate the sorptivity of the matrix both of the models have a time exponent α and can be simplified to the classical lucas washburn l w equation with α 0 50 to verify the proposed models quantitative data on the imbibition of water in both the matrix and the fracture of unsaturated sandstone were acquired by neutron radiography the results show that the motion of the wetting front in both the matrix and the fracture does not obey the l w equation both theory and experimental observations indicate that fracture can significantly increase spontaneous imbibition in unsaturated sandstone by capillary action compared with the classical l w equation the models proposed in this study offers a better description of the dynamic imbibition behavior of water in unsaturated fractured sandstone and thus more reliable predictions of the sorptivity of the matrix and the fracture moreover a new method to estimate the time exponent of rough walled fracture in sandstone was also provided keywords sorptivity neutron radiography rough walled surface time exponent fractal model 1 introduction understanding the migration of liquid in the matrix and fractures of an unsaturated porous medium has great significance to many geotechnical applications aydin 2000 such as radioactive waste storage bodvarsson et al 1999 hunt and tompson 2005 tompson et al 2006 sequestration of carbon dioxide doster et al 2013 herring et al 2013 unconventional gas extraction oil and geothermal recoveries karpyn et al 2009b li and horne 2001 serhat and kovscek 1999 the protection of building foundations and other structures in the water environment cnudde et al 2008 daniel et al 2015 and the protection of groundwater resources faybishenko et al 2005 in recent years the application of rapid real time neutron radiography and high resolution x ray computed tomography ct imaging technology has greatly enhanced our experimental capability in studying liquid flow in porous media rapid real time neutron radiography shows unique advantages kang et al 2013 over other techniques owing to the strong attenuation of neutron rays by hydrogen and its relative insensitivity to the gas phase only valid for non hydrogen gases and mineral composition e g quartz and clay the microporous structure of porous media can be described accurately by high resolution x ray ct imaging technology zhao et al 2017 as a result researchers can characterize the flow of liquids in the matrix and fracture zone of porous media at high spatial and temporal resolutions and quantify the distribution of water in a wide range of natural and engineering materials neutron radiography has been used in many studies to analyses water migration and distribution in porous media such as rock dewanckele et al 2013 kang et al 2013a cheng et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 brick czachor et al 2002 el abd et al 2009 hassanein et al 2006 karoglou et al 2005 and concrete zhang et al 2011 2010a 2010b 2009 however most of the previous studies focused on the spontaneous imbibition of porous media matrices whereas few studies exist on the spontaneous imbibition of fracture structures water imbibition into fracture structures such as the compacted shear band of sandstone cores hall 2013 air filled fractures in sandstone cheng et al 2015 or steel reinforced concrete zhang et al 2010a is rapid in contrast to that occurring in matrices the results of the above studies show that the relationship between the imbibition height of the wetting front in the matrix or fracture of the porous media and time obeys the lucas washburn l w equation i e the height of the wetting front is proportional to the square root of the time accordingly the sorptivity of matrix and fractures can be obtained by linear regression or by direct calculation from the l w equation however the dynamic evolution of the wetting front does not always follow the l w equation for example the wetting behavior of lubricating oil in wool blankets and cotton fabrics usually does not obey the l w law the change of pore structure in porous media balankin and susarrey 2003 or the disorder of the capillary pressure caused by the anisotropy of the medium and the randomness of the pore size brú and pastor 2006 may be the main causes of this phenomenon thus a modified l w equation which assumes that the imbibition height of the wetting front is proportional to the power α of the time α is the time exponent has been proposed laughlin and davies 1961 the validity of the modified l w equation was later confirmed by a number of experimental results balankin and susarrey 2003 brú and pastor 2006 based on fractal theory an analytical expression of water imbibition in tortuous capillary tubes was derived in which the time exponent can be expressed as a function of the fractal dimension of tortuosity of the flow line in porous media cai and yu 2011 this analytical expression can be used to describe the dynamic imbibition of water in the porous media matrix and calculate the matrix sorptivity nevertheless for the imbibition behavior of water within fractures of porous media some of the above observations are qualitatively explained from the dynamics of capillary uptake cheng et al 2015 hall 2013 zhang et al 2010a however to our knowledge there seems to be no theoretical framework in the literature for the quantitative interpretation of water imbibition in fractures of porous media the study of this phenomenon is likely to be particularly important for engineering applications such as for the calculation of water losses in the exploitation of unconventional gas resources e g sandstone shale gas by using hydraulic fracturing and water damage to the foundations of buildings and other structures cheng et al 2015 the major objectives of this research are i to modify a model to predict the sorptivity of matrix which takes into account the fractal dimension of tortuosity ii to establish a fractal model to predict the sorptivity of a rough walled fracture in the unsaturated sandstone which considers the water losses from the fracture to the matrix iii to acquire quantitative data of the spontaneous imbibition of water in unsaturated fractured sandstone specimen using dynamic neutron radiography and use them to evaluate the proposed models 2 theoretical framework the phenomenon of water imbibition in porous media has been studied since the beginning of the 20th century the l w equation was derived to describe the water imbibition in a single capillary tube by using the hagen poiseuille equation which lays the foundation for the study of water imbibition in the pore structure of a porous media matrix lucas 1918 washburn 1921 cai et al 2010a modified the l w equation and then represent a porous medium as a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes to predict the dynamic imbibition of water in the matrix of the porous medium however in addition to the pore structure many other fracture structures exist in porous media such as rocks several classical theories have been established to describe the spontaneous imbibition of porous media but most of them just focus on the imbibition of pore structures benavente et al 2002 cai et al 2014 hammecker et al 2004 joekar niasar et al 2010 leventis et al 2000 li and zhao 2012 and few have concentrated on fracture structures cheng et al 2015 hardly any general models have been established to calculate the sorptivity of the fractures of a porous medium for this purpose a fractal model based on tortuous capillary bundle was further developed to describe the imbibition of water in sandstone matrix and a fractal model considering the water loss from the fracture into the matrix was established to describe the imbibition of water in fracture of sandstone 2 1 a fractal model to analyses water imbibition in the matrix in the process of imbibition water enters the pore structures of natural porous media under the capillary force cai and yu 2011 cheng et al 2015 cnudde et al 2008 the pore structure of natural porous media is complex and the pore size distribution psd has the essential features of a fractal system katz and thompson 1985 krohn 1988 this complex pore structure can be simplified as a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with fractal characteristics bear 1972 cai et al 2010a yu 2008 2005 yu et al 2008 the capillary tubes in the bundle have different diameters and the distribution of capillary diameters within the maximum and minimum capillary diameters satisfies the fractal power ratio relationship yu 2008 according to the hagen poiseuille equation and the assumption of infinite mobility of air phase in the matrix the flow rate of a single tortuous circular capillary can be expressed as 1 q π λ 4 δ p 128 μ l f where q is the flow rate λ µm is the capillary diameter of the matrix lf mm is the fractal distance travelled by the wetting front in the capillary as shown in fig 1 μ ns m2 is the viscosity of water and δp represents the pressure drop along the capillary water is imbibed into the capillary spontaneously under the action of the pressure drop the effect of gravity on the early stages of spontaneous capillary imbibition can be ignored since the assumptions of negligible effects are never validated cheng et al 2015 hay and dragila 2008 thus δp can be expressed as 2 δ p p c where pc is the capillary pressure according to the young laplace equation pc can be expressed as 3 p c 4 σ cos θ λ where σ n m is the air water surface tension θ is the water solid contact angle the fractal velocity vf mm s can be obtained as follows 4 v f 4 q π λ 2 λ 2 p c 32 μ l f combining eq 3 to 4 yields 5 v f λ σ cos θ 8 μ l f in most previous applications the relation between lf and ls the straight line vertical distance travelled by the wetting front in the capillary along the pressure drop as shown in fig 1 is expressed by a constant tortuosity however the tortuous capillaries always exhibit the fractal behavior in porous media wheatcraft and taylor 1988 developed a proportional relationship between lf and the length scale ε to describe the relationship between lf and ls yu and cheng 2002 believed that the diameter of the capillaries λ is analogous to the length scale ε cai and yu 2011 reported that the tortuosity depends on the scale of measurement and the fractal dimension for tortuosity of capillaries dt they also developed the fractal scaling relationship between ls and λ in porous media 6 l f λ 1 d t l s d t where dt lies in 1 dt 2 and 1 dt 3 in two and three dimensional spaces respectively by differentiating eq 6 with respect to time the relationship between the fractal velocity vf dlf dt and the straight line velocity vs dls dt as shown in fig 1 can be obtained cai et al 2010a 7 v f d t l s d t 1 λ 1 d t v s by substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 the water rising process in a single tortuous capillary can be expressed as follows cai et al 2014 2010a 8 d l s d t λ 2 d t 1 σ cos θ 8 μ d t l s 2 d t 1 integrating eq 8 assuming the initial condition ls 0 0 yields 9 l s σ cos θ 4 μ λ 1 2 d t 1 2 d t t 1 2 d t when dt 1 straight capillary as shown in fig 1 we obtain the l w equation which is expressed as 10 l s λ σ cos θ 4 μ 1 2 t 1 2 cai and yu 2011 obtained the relationship between time exponent α and the dt i e α 1 2dt thus the dt can be expressed as a function of time exponent α as follows 11 d t 1 2 α then eq 9 can be simplified as 12 l s σ cos θ 4 μ λ 1 1 α α t α for a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with different diameters the average distance travelled by the wetting front lsm mm can be calculated by the following expression cai and yu 2011 13 l s m t α λ m i n λ m a x f λ σ c o s θ 4 μ λ 1 1 α α d λ c m t α where f λ is the probability density function of the capillary diameter defined as f λ d λ m i n d λ d 1 d is the pore fractal dimension yu 2008 λmax µm and λmin µm are the maximum and minimum pore diameters respectively the value of λmax µm can be calculated by using the expression as follows cai et al 2010a 14 λ max 32 τ k 4 d 2 d 1 ϕ ϕ where τ is the tortuosity of pore structure k md is the permeability φ is the porosity cm is the sorptivity of the matrix which can be expressed as 15 c m σ c o s θ 4 μ α d λ m a x 1 α 1 d α β d β 1 α where β is defined as λmin λmax and generally it has a value of 10 4 β 10 2 in porous media cai et al 2010b feng et al 2004 yu and li 2001 based on this theoretical framework eq 15 is used to predict the sorptivity of the matrix in fractured sandstone in the applications time exponent α can be obtained by experimental data fitting 2 2 a fractal model to analyses water imbibition in a fracture zone in general water imbibition is rapidly in a rough fracture cheng et al 2015 believed that this phenomenon is caused by the combination of the capillary force and the surface spreading effect hay and dragila 2008 idealized the rough surface as comprised of a series of small cylindrical posts lined up on an otherwise smooth surface and then derived an invasion model to describe the spreading of water in a rough surface their assumption considered the effect of rough surface on water spreading however in natural rocks the fractures are not only rough but also tortuous in this section we assume that the fracture is a tortuous capillary with a rough surface and filled with air the top of the fracture is dry until the fracture filled with water thus the driving force is always the maximum capillary force during the imbibition process andersen et al 2018b since the fracture is filled with air the mobility ratio is strongly favorable andersen et al 2018b and the piston like displacement occurs during the imbibition of water into the fracture the rough surface is idealized as comprising a series of small cylinders arranged on a curved smooth surface and we assume that the height of the cylinder µ µm is equal to the average sand grain diameter of specimen w1 the distance between the cylinder edges ξ µm and the diameter of the cylinder d µm is 2 08δ and 0 83δ respectively hay et al 2008 the cross sectional flow model is shown in fig 2 b according to this assumption a fractal model is established to describe the rapid uptake of water within a single vertical fracture to obtain the flow rate of a single fracture eq 1 can be modified and expressed as 16 q 1 γ π λ f 4 δ p 128 μ l f f where λf µm is the median aperture of fracture lff mm is the fractal distance travelled by the wetting front in fracture γ is the water loss coefficient which means the percentage of water imbibed from the fracture into the matrix and can be expressed as 17 γ v m 1 v m 2 v f v m 1 v m 2 a s h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w a f l s f a s h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w λ f h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w where vf mm3 is the volume of water that imbibed into the fracture vm1 and vm2 mm3 are the volumes of water imbibed into the matrix from the left and right walls of the fracture respectively hsm1 and hsm2 mm are the horizontal distances travelled by the wetting front in the matrix on the left and right walls of the fracture respectively θ w mm3 mm3 is the average volumetric water content as mm2 and af mm2 is the fracture matrix vertical cross sectional area and the horizontal cross sectional area of the fracture respectively lsf mm is the straight line distance travelled by the wetting front in the fracture the above parameters related to caculate γ can be obtained by experiment such as neutron radiography test due to the rough surface of the fracture the pressure drop δp can be expressed as 18 δ p p c 2 δ p c 2 p μ where pc is the pressure difference across the water air interface caused by capillarity in rough surface which drives the spread of water in rough surface according to young laplace equation pc can be expressed as hay et al 2008 19 δ p c σ 1 r δ 1 r ξ where rδ and rξ are the radii of curvature in the vertical and the horizontal directions see fig 2 a here we assume that the roughness elements i e cylinders are normal to the surface thus the radii of curvature rδ and rξ are defined as 20 r δ δ cos θ sin θ r ξ ξ 2 cos θ pμ is the loss of pressure due to viscous dissipation which can be given as hay et al 2008 21 p μ 2 p 0 μ l s f v f d h 2 where lsf mm is the straight line distance of water imbibition in the fracture which can be expressed as lsf lff τf and τf is the tortuosity of the fracture the poiseuille number p0 cfre where cf is the fanning friction factor and re is the reynolds number associated with the diameter length scale p0 14 38 for a rectangle with an aspect ratio of δ λ 0 48 dh µm is the hydraulic diameter defined as 22 d h 4 a p w 4 δ ξ π 2 θ cos θ tan θ ξ 2 4 2 δ ξ where a µm2 is the cross sectional area of wetting fluid the rectangle s area minus the area of a circular segment and pw is the wetted perimeter hay et al 2008 the fractal velocity vf mm s of water imbibition in fracture can be expressed as 23 v f 4 q π λ f 2 1 γ λ f 2 32 μ l f f p c 2 δ p c 2 p μ where λf µm is the median fracture aperture which can be calculated based on the fracture volume extracted from neutron radiography by substituting eqs 3 19 20 21 into eq 23 the fractal velocity vf mm s can be expressed as 24 v f 1 γ λ f 2 32 μ l f f 4 σ cos θ λ f 2 σ 2 δ ξ cos θ ξ sin θ δ ξ 4 p 0 μ l f f v f τ f d h 2 by substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 24 yields 25 d l s f

δ ξ μ λ f 8 τ f d h 2 p 0 λ f 2 based on this theoretical framework eqs 27 and 28 can be used to predict the sorptivity of rough walled fracture in sandstone and the imbibition time exponent α of fracture in sandstone 3 materials and methods 3 1 sandstone specimen the tested sandstone was collected from rong county sichuan province china the tested sandstone was prepared as a plate specimen which was 41 mm 10 mm 35 mm in size and named as w1 as shown in fig 3 a an artificial rough walled fracture was then created on specimen w1 using the modified brazilian test karpyn et al 2009a as shown in fig 3 b before the experiment the sandstone specimen w1 was oven dried at 105 c until its weight was constant cheng et al 2015 the sides of the specimen were wrapped in metal foil tape to prevent water wetting and evaporation zhao et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 c the microstructure of the rough walled fracture surface was also obtained by using scanning electron microscopy sem as shown in fig 3 d the permeability k is 141 md measured by using the chemically equilibrated water fig 4 shows the psd of a specimen based on mercury intrusion porosimetry mip the porosity φ is 19 50 and the majority of pores are concentrated in the range of 5 13 µm moreover the mineral compositions of the sandstone were measured by using x ray diffraction xrd and listed in table 1 clay minerals account for 2 6 in the tested sandstone 3 2 high resolution x ray ct imaging a nanovoxel 4000 high resolution x ray ct scanner hrxct sanying precision instruments co ltd china was used to investigate the pore and fracture structures of the specimen w1 the fractured structure of the specimen w1 was reconstructed and analyzed by using image analysis software avizo fei co usa fig 5 a shows the two dimensional ct slice of the specimen fig 5 b shows the fracture volume of w1 extracted from hrxct scanning the count percent histogram distribution of fracture aperture in the sandstone specimen is shown in fig 5 c a cylindrical sandstone specimen drilled from the same sandstone block as specimen w1 with a diameter of 1 8 mm was prepared for hrxct scanning to better understand the pore structure the pore structure was also reconstructed and analyzed by using avizo a volume of interest voi of 600 600 600 voxels in the matrix of the sandstone was selected for further calculation of the pore structures as shown in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the two dimensional ct slice of the voi the pore volumes need to be segmented from the matrix to calculate the porosity φ tortuosity based on the otsu method the avizo auto thresholding module was used to calculate the recommended threshold of voi zhao et al 2017 in order to determine the optimum segmentation value of the sandstone specimen studied the variation of porosity φ under different threshold conditions were analysed as listed in table 2 the porosity φ was calculated by using the avizo quantification module zhao et al 2017 by comparing the calculated porosity φ with the measured porosity φ by mip 1695 was set as the thresholds to segment the pore volumes in the voi of the sandstone the three dimensional segmented pore volumes of voi were showed in fig 6 c 3 3 neutron radiography setup the imbibition experiments were performed at the cold neutron guide b located at the guide hall of china advanced research reactor in the china institute of atomic energy the neutron flux rate was 1 03 107 n cm2 s when the reactor operated at a power of 20 mw he et al 2013 the neutron imaging facility is located next to the end of the beam guide and the ratio of the collimator tube length to its aperture diameter is 85 zhao et al 2018 2017 the real time detector system is equipped with a new generation cmos sensor with 5 5 million pixels and speeds up to 100 fps at full frame he et al 2013 the experiment was performed in the following three steps i obtain 10 dark current images shutter closed no neutron illumination and 10 flat field images open shutter without specimen cheng et al 2011 ii hang the specimen holder in front of the scintillator screen and fix specimen w1 on it with the specimen 10 mm away from the scintillator screen then take 10 images of the dried specimen denoted as i dry and iii keep the shutter open and slowly lift an aluminium container filled with distilled water until the bottom of specimen w1 is in contact with the water surface this moment is defined as the baseline zero time cheng et al 2015 neutron images were obtained every 0 10 s to capture the rapid imbibition of water in fractured sandstone specimen and are denoted as wet reference image i wet the experiment lasted 120 s and a total of 9 images were selected to show the rapid uptake of water into the fracture and enable us to calculate the sorptivity of fractured sandstone 3 4 neutron image processing all the raw neutron radiographs were processed and analyzed using the imagej software packages abràmofff et al 2005 schneider et al 2012 for each acquired neutron image the two dimensional distribution of net water in the tested specimen can be obtained using the following steps zhao et al 2017 i one open beam reference image i ob one dark field reference image i df and one dry reference image i dry were acquired from the 10 dark current images 10 flat field images and 10 images of the dried specimen respectively ii in order to remove background noise and beam heterogeneities in the detector and obtain the normalized image of the dry and wet sandstone all raw neutron images of the dry and wet sandstone specimen were processed by using the following formula kang et al 2014 29 i n d r y f k i d r y i d f i o b i d f where indry is the normalized image of the dry sandstone specimen and fk is a rescaling factor used to correct for fluctuations in the neutron flux which was taken as unity in this work because all the images were collected at the same power of the neutron beam the normalized images of the wet sandstone specimen inwet can be obtained by replacing i dry with i wet in eq 29 iii to remove the effect of the dry sandstone specimen and the aluminium foil tape on the neutron intensity and obtain the net water transmission neutron images we divided the normalized wet specimen images inwet by the normalized images of the dry sandstone specimen indry as kang et al 2013 30 i w i n w e t i n d r y where iw denotes the net water transmission neutron images the selected net water transmission images of specimen w1 are shown in fig 7 the water thickness wt mm penetrated by neutron beam in the specimen was calculated using the following expression kang et al 2013 31 w t ζ 2 η ζ 2 η 2 1 η ln t w where tw is the value of transmitted intensity which changes only attribute to the variety of water content the value of tw is equal to the gray value extracted from the image iw by using imagej software ζ mm 1 is the attenuation coefficient for water η mm 2 is the correction coefficient that takes into account beam hardening the values of ζ and η were determined by calibration using water filled al cell machined to give a range of known water thicknesses which is 0 4419 mm 1and 0 0463 mm 2 respectively zhao et al 2018 then the volumetric water content θw can be calculated by 32 θ w w t l w where lw is the thickness of specimen penetrated by neutron beam 3 5 measurement of water wetting front in order to quantify the evolution of the wetting front several monitoring lines on the net water transmission neutron images were set up to extract the change of the wetting front positions as shown in fig 8 considering the complexity of the microstructures in the tested sandstone we superimposed 13 mm2 red grids on the image to define 11 monitoring lines including 9 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines to monitor the change of the water transmission with time for instance the blue lines show the no 2 and no 7 vertical monitoring lines in regions 1 and 2 the black lines show the no 10 and no 11 horizontal monitoring lines in regions 1 and 2 and the green line shows the no 9 vertical monitoring line in the fracture zone as shown in fig 8 a the distance travelled by the wetting front monitored by lines 2 lm2 7 lm7 9 lsf 10 hsm1 and 11 hsm2 are shown in fig 8 a the net water transmission profiles along the vertical and horizontal direction of the specimen were extracted from the image the distribution of the transmissions along the no 2 no 7 no 9 no 10 and no 11 monitoring lines are shown in fig 8 b the transmission increases in the direction of the water imbibition and where the value of the transmission is equal to or exceeds a threshold value indicating a drying phase the threshold value for specimen w1 is 0 95 based on the average transmission value of the dry image as illustrated in fig 8 b in this work the specimen w1 is assumed not to be wetted by water when the average transmission exceeded the threshold value 4 results and discussion 4 1 evolution of water wetting front fig 7 shows the evolution of water imbibition in both the fracture zone and the matrix of the specimen w1 monitored by neutron radiography the process of the evolution can be divided into three parts i water imbibed into the matrix when the bottom of the specimen is in contact with water ii then water uptake rapidly into the fracture iii last water imbibed into the matrix from the fracture the speed of water imbibition in the fracture is significantly larger than that in the matrix the distance travelled by the wetting front in other monitoring lines nos 1 3 4 5 6 8 were measured and the average distance lsm1 in region 1 and lsm2 in region 2 are obtained as shown in table 3 in order to describe the wetting fronts in different regions of the specimen comparatively the radiograph data obtained as t 0 80 s see fig 8 a is taken as an example it is found that the wetting front in the fracture reaches 34 77 mm which is approximately 16 times larger than that in the matrix of region 1 2 23 mm or region 2 2 05 mm this phenomenon may be induced by the larger effective diameter of the fracture compared with that in the matrix and the rougher surface of the fracture than that of the smooth capillary in the matrix cheng et al 2015 believed that capillary dynamics could explain the more rapid uptake of water in a fracture than in the surrounding matrix during spontaneous imbibition moreover water imbibed into the matrix from the fracture is more rapid than that from the bottom of the specimen hsm1 and hsm2 are 4 34 mm and 4 48 mm which are approximate 2 times larger than the average value of lsm1 and lsm2 as shown in table 3 this result may be caused by two reasons first the fracture was produced by using the modified brazilian method the regions near the fracture may have more microcracks or damages the width of the damaged zone varies between 2 and 10 times the width of the fracture aperture cheng et al 2015 second there is no gravity effect for the horizontal evolution of the wetting front finally the volumetric water content θw along the monitoring lines 10 and 11 are also calculated by using eq 32 the water loss coefficient γ can also be obtained by eq 17 table 3 lists the average value θ w and the water loss coefficient γ at different imbibition time the water loss coefficient γ rises with the increase of the imbibition time except at time of 0 10 s the boundary effect may cause this exception at 0 10 s the average value of water loss coefficient γ is selected as one representative value to estimate the loss of water from the fracture to the matrix and as one of the important parameters to calculate the sorptivity of the fracture during the spontaneous imbibition 4 2 determination of time exponent according to the literature review cheng et al 2015 kang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 the height of water imbibition in a matrix or fracture increases linearly with the square root of time i e time exponent α 0 50 however these researches did not consider the uncertainty of the time exponent i e α 0 5 caused by the heterogeneity of the medium or the capillary force disorder due to the randomness of pore sizes brú and pastor 2006 cai and yu 2011 fig 9 a shows that the wetting front positions are monitored in both space and time quantitative results of the wetting front position for each vertical and horizontal net water transmission profile are obtained from the neutron radiographs fig 9 presents that the double logarithmic plots of the wetting front positions versus time the time exponent α can be estimated by using linear regression and the values of goodness of fit r2 are larger than 0 93 as listed in table 4 the results clearly show a non classical i e time exponent α 0 5 behavior of the wetting front motion the time exponent α for the wetting front motion in regions 1 and 2 of the matrix are 0 46 and 0 45 in the vertical direction and 0 33 and 0 40 in the horizontal direction respectively possible causes of these variations are the randomness of the capillary force which is related to the anisotropy of the medium and the randomness of the psd brú and pastor 2006 cai and yu 2011 similar results have been reported for other porous medias e g chalk bentonite clay and berea with time exponent values of 0 40 for chalk li and horne 2004 0 41 for bentonite clay brú and pastor 2006 and 0 32 for berea sandstone li et al 2006 moreover it can be seen the first points of some of the data sets tends to slight deviation from the best fit line in fig 9 these deviations may be caused by the effect of boundary that affects the rate of spontaneous imbibition yildiz et al 2006 moreover the existence of the boundary will affect the equipotential line distribution of the imbibition field and the streamline distribution 4 3 sorptivity analysis 4 3 1 sorptivity from nonlinear regression of the experimental data fig 10 shows the relationships of the wetting front position in the matrix and the fracture with the time the sorptivity of the sandstone matrix cm regions 1 and 2 and the fracture cf can be estimated by the nonlinear regression of the plotted points it is found that the first point of the data set of fracture see fig 10 a tends to fall below the fitting line possible causes of this deviations are i the bottom of the specimen may not have been perfectly aligned with the water surface resulting in partial contact at very early times and ii the first image is integrated over a relatively long period of time 5 10 ms relative to the rate of wetting at very early times cheng et al 2015 table 5 presents the sorptivities of the matrix cm and the fracture zone cf obtained by experimental fit and all the values of the goodness of fit r2 are larger than 0 96 it is found that the sorptivity of the fracture is 39 61 mm s0 38 cheng et al 2015 reported that the fracture sorptivity of berea sandstone ranges from 17 87 to 27 12 mm s0 50 by linear regression of the experimental data however most of the previous studies on the sorptivity of rocks regard the time exponent α as 0 50 cheng et al 2015 hammecker and jeannette 1994 hassanein et al 2006 zhao et al 2017 in the current study the time exponent is 0 38 for the fracture sorpotivity the matrix sorptivities near the bottom of the specimen are 2 33 mm s0 46 region 1 and 2 18 mm s0 45 region 2 but the values of sorptivities near the fracture damage zone are 4 42 mm s0 33 line 10 and 4 93 mm s0 40 line 11 which are approximately 2 times larger than that near the bottom of the specimen this result quantifies the difference between the imbibition rate of water from the fracture or the bottom of the specimen into the matrix the matrix sorptivity near the bottom of the specimen obtained by nonlinear regression is basically consistent in regions 1 and 2 regardless of the values of the time exponent α the slight variations of the sorptivity in the matrix may be caused by the heterogeneity of the tested sandstone and the shrinkage closure and elimination of pore throats during the imbibition process benavente et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 moreover the sorptivity of the fracture obtained by nonlinear regression is much larger than that of the matrix this may be caused by not only the capillary uptake within the fracture aperture but also by the surface spreading of water on the side walls of the fracture cheng et al 2015 nevertheless the increased micro crack density associated with localized damage near the fracture may enhance the sorption of fracture hall 2013 sahmaran and li 2009 and zhang et al 2010a also observed the enhanced sorption phenomenon in fractured cementitious materials the above results not only prove that the fracture can significantly increase imbibition in fractured sandstone but also show the heterogeneity effects on the sorptivity 4 3 2 sorptivity from model prediction in this section we employ fractal models eqs 15 and 27 to predict the sorptivity for both the matrix and the fracture of tested sandstone the parameters used to calculate the sorptivity are listed in table 6 the value of δ is equal to the average sand grain diameter of specimen w1 which is obtained by measuring the sem image of the fracture surface see fig 3 d using imagej software the average sand grain diameter of specimen w1 is 193 52 μm which is consistent with the normal particle size range of sandstone i e 125 to 250 μm reported by folk 1980 fig 5 a was imported into autocad software and the fracture was depicted by using the polyline the tortuous and the straight line length of the fracture was measured and the τf can be calculated to be 1 05 the aperture of the rough walled fracture is calculated based on the three dimensional fracture volume obtained by hrxct see fig 5 b the calculated results showed the fracture aperture varied from 7 7 to 770 30 μm as shown in fig 5 c thus the median aperture λf is 389 μm the two dimensional fractal dimension of pores d equals to 1 84 which is measured by using fractal box counter in imagej software based on two dimensional ct slice of the specimen see fig 6 b the tortuosity of pore structure τ is calculated by avizo centroid path tortuosity module base on the pore structure data of voi after segmentation and equals to 2 06 see fig 6 c the value of λmax is calculated by using eq 14 and equals to 22 76 μm the average value of water loss coefficient γ in table 3 equals to 0 28 which is used in the sorptivity calculation feng et al 2004 reported that the value of β range from 10 4 to 10 2 in porous media take region 1 as an example we analyzed the effect of β with the values of 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 on the prediction of matrix sorptivity the predicted results of the matrix sorptivity region 1 are 0 20 mm s0 46 0 70 mm s0 46 and 2 41 mm s0 46 corresponding to the β of 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 based on the experimental nonlinear fitting values of the matrix sorptivity region 1 when β equals to 10 4 or 10 3 the predicted values of the developed model significantly underestimate the sorptivity of matrix when β 10 2 the value of the matrix sorptivity predicted by the developed model is close to the experimental nonlinear fitting value moreover cai et al 2010b suggested that the minimum pore diameter λmin is usually two orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum pore diameter λmax based on the experimental data regression β of 10 2 was chosen because it gave the best modeled results table 7 shows the sorptivities of various regions in the sandstone predicted by experimental nonlinear fitting and developed model comparatively the matrix sorptivities near the bottom of the specimen obtained by the model prediction are 1 03 region 1 and 1 07 region 2 times larger than the values obtained by nonlinear regression these results prove that the sorptivity of the matrix surrounding the fracture can be interpreted from the model some deviation of the model predicted sorptivity to the experimental fitting result may be caused by the following issues i some infilling materials such as clay minerals and quartz grains within the pores reduce the effective seepage radius of the pores ii the connectivity of the pores may be reduced due to the expansion of the clay mineral such as illite and kaolinite in contact with water zhao et al 2017 table 7 also indicates that the matrix sorptivities near the fracture damage zone obtained by the model prediction are seriously underestimated it is caused by the underestimated porosity value used in the model as mentioned in the previous sections the fracture of the tested sandstone was manufactured by the modified brazil test method which could induce damage of the regions near the fracture these damage and microcracks close to the fracture will increase the sorption ability of the matrix cheng et al 2015 hall 2013 the fracture sorptivity predicted by eq 27 is 1 04 times larger than the value obtained by nonlinear regression many previous studies related to the water flow in the fracture are based on the assumption of one dimensional flow which means no water will loss or imbibe from the fracture into the matrix andersen et al 2018a cheng et al 2015 if we do not consider the water loss coefficient in eq 30 the predicted fracture sorptivity is 45 67 mm s0 38 which is 1 15 times larger than the value obtained by nonlinear regression of experimental data thus the error of predicted fracture sorptivity is approximate 15 for the tested sandstone by using one dimensional assumption but the error of our developed model of fracture sorptivity is just 4 eq 27 considers the actual situation of water from the fracture to the matrix during the spontaneous imbibition of water in the fracture of sandstone which cause the predicted fracture sorptivity is closer to the actual value these results prove that the developed sorptivity model of fracture eq 27 is more effective moreover neutron radiography provides an effective tool to obtain the basic data to calculate the water loss coefficient it needs to point that the imbibition time exponent α of fracture in the tested sandstone equals to 0 38 by using eq 28 this value is consistent with that obtained by linear regression of experimental data it also indicates that eq 28 is effective and provides a new method to estimate the time exponent of water imbibed into rough walled fractures in sandstone all of the above results may provide a better understanding of the sorptivity in matrix and fracture of sandstone however further studies are also necessary to evaluate the validity of the models for other rocks the applicability of the models developed based on the laboratory scale test to the in situ test also needs to be verified 5 summary and conclusion in this study the dynamics of water imbibition in the unsaturated fractured sandstone is monitored successfully by neutron radiography the wetting front in the fracture moves faster than that in the matrix moreover the dynamic evolution of the wetting front in both the matrix and the fracture do not obey the l w equation with the time component α 0 5 experimental results show that the wetting front advanced linearly with the power α of the time the sorptivity of matrix and fracture were estimated by nonlinear regression of the experimental data a fractal model is further modified to predict the sorptivity of the matrix which takes into account the fractal dimension of tortuosity a new fractal model is established to predict the sorptivity of a rough walled fracture in the unsaturated sandstone which considers the water losses from the fracture to the matrix by comparing the experimental and model prediction results we found that i the maximum pore size pore fractal dimension and the fractal dimension of the tortuosity have a major influence on the determination of the sorptivity of matrix ii the fracture aperture the tortuosity of fracture the fractal dimension of tortuosity water losses coefficient and the diameter of sandstone particle play an important role in the prediction of fracture sorptivity moreover the established fractal model also provides a new method to estimate the imbibition time exponent of fracture this work provides important findings and guidance to further investigate this phenomenon in other natural and engineered porous media this phenomenon is likely to be particularly important in engineering applications such as the exploitation of unconventional gas resources e g sandstone shale gas by using hydraulic fracturing however some limitations are worth noting in this study we assumed the imbibition channel in the matrix as tortuous capillary tubes without considering the intersections of parallel capillaries moreover the current theoretical framework represents an only approximation of imbibition behavior within the unsaturated fractured sandstone used in this work

613,the spontaneous imbibition of water into the matrix and gas filled fractures of unsaturated porous media is an important phenomenon in many geotechnical applications previous studies have focused on the imbibition behavior of water in the matrix but few works have considered spontaneous imbibition along fractures in this work a new fractal model considering the water losses from the fracture to the matrix was established to predict the sorptivity of rough walled fracture a fractal model considering the fractal dimension of tortuosity was modified to estimate the sorptivity of the matrix both of the models have a time exponent α and can be simplified to the classical lucas washburn l w equation with α 0 50 to verify the proposed models quantitative data on the imbibition of water in both the matrix and the fracture of unsaturated sandstone were acquired by neutron radiography the results show that the motion of the wetting front in both the matrix and the fracture does not obey the l w equation both theory and experimental observations indicate that fracture can significantly increase spontaneous imbibition in unsaturated sandstone by capillary action compared with the classical l w equation the models proposed in this study offers a better description of the dynamic imbibition behavior of water in unsaturated fractured sandstone and thus more reliable predictions of the sorptivity of the matrix and the fracture moreover a new method to estimate the time exponent of rough walled fracture in sandstone was also provided keywords sorptivity neutron radiography rough walled surface time exponent fractal model 1 introduction understanding the migration of liquid in the matrix and fractures of an unsaturated porous medium has great significance to many geotechnical applications aydin 2000 such as radioactive waste storage bodvarsson et al 1999 hunt and tompson 2005 tompson et al 2006 sequestration of carbon dioxide doster et al 2013 herring et al 2013 unconventional gas extraction oil and geothermal recoveries karpyn et al 2009b li and horne 2001 serhat and kovscek 1999 the protection of building foundations and other structures in the water environment cnudde et al 2008 daniel et al 2015 and the protection of groundwater resources faybishenko et al 2005 in recent years the application of rapid real time neutron radiography and high resolution x ray computed tomography ct imaging technology has greatly enhanced our experimental capability in studying liquid flow in porous media rapid real time neutron radiography shows unique advantages kang et al 2013 over other techniques owing to the strong attenuation of neutron rays by hydrogen and its relative insensitivity to the gas phase only valid for non hydrogen gases and mineral composition e g quartz and clay the microporous structure of porous media can be described accurately by high resolution x ray ct imaging technology zhao et al 2017 as a result researchers can characterize the flow of liquids in the matrix and fracture zone of porous media at high spatial and temporal resolutions and quantify the distribution of water in a wide range of natural and engineering materials neutron radiography has been used in many studies to analyses water migration and distribution in porous media such as rock dewanckele et al 2013 kang et al 2013a cheng et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 brick czachor et al 2002 el abd et al 2009 hassanein et al 2006 karoglou et al 2005 and concrete zhang et al 2011 2010a 2010b 2009 however most of the previous studies focused on the spontaneous imbibition of porous media matrices whereas few studies exist on the spontaneous imbibition of fracture structures water imbibition into fracture structures such as the compacted shear band of sandstone cores hall 2013 air filled fractures in sandstone cheng et al 2015 or steel reinforced concrete zhang et al 2010a is rapid in contrast to that occurring in matrices the results of the above studies show that the relationship between the imbibition height of the wetting front in the matrix or fracture of the porous media and time obeys the lucas washburn l w equation i e the height of the wetting front is proportional to the square root of the time accordingly the sorptivity of matrix and fractures can be obtained by linear regression or by direct calculation from the l w equation however the dynamic evolution of the wetting front does not always follow the l w equation for example the wetting behavior of lubricating oil in wool blankets and cotton fabrics usually does not obey the l w law the change of pore structure in porous media balankin and susarrey 2003 or the disorder of the capillary pressure caused by the anisotropy of the medium and the randomness of the pore size brú and pastor 2006 may be the main causes of this phenomenon thus a modified l w equation which assumes that the imbibition height of the wetting front is proportional to the power α of the time α is the time exponent has been proposed laughlin and davies 1961 the validity of the modified l w equation was later confirmed by a number of experimental results balankin and susarrey 2003 brú and pastor 2006 based on fractal theory an analytical expression of water imbibition in tortuous capillary tubes was derived in which the time exponent can be expressed as a function of the fractal dimension of tortuosity of the flow line in porous media cai and yu 2011 this analytical expression can be used to describe the dynamic imbibition of water in the porous media matrix and calculate the matrix sorptivity nevertheless for the imbibition behavior of water within fractures of porous media some of the above observations are qualitatively explained from the dynamics of capillary uptake cheng et al 2015 hall 2013 zhang et al 2010a however to our knowledge there seems to be no theoretical framework in the literature for the quantitative interpretation of water imbibition in fractures of porous media the study of this phenomenon is likely to be particularly important for engineering applications such as for the calculation of water losses in the exploitation of unconventional gas resources e g sandstone shale gas by using hydraulic fracturing and water damage to the foundations of buildings and other structures cheng et al 2015 the major objectives of this research are i to modify a model to predict the sorptivity of matrix which takes into account the fractal dimension of tortuosity ii to establish a fractal model to predict the sorptivity of a rough walled fracture in the unsaturated sandstone which considers the water losses from the fracture to the matrix iii to acquire quantitative data of the spontaneous imbibition of water in unsaturated fractured sandstone specimen using dynamic neutron radiography and use them to evaluate the proposed models 2 theoretical framework the phenomenon of water imbibition in porous media has been studied since the beginning of the 20th century the l w equation was derived to describe the water imbibition in a single capillary tube by using the hagen poiseuille equation which lays the foundation for the study of water imbibition in the pore structure of a porous media matrix lucas 1918 washburn 1921 cai et al 2010a modified the l w equation and then represent a porous medium as a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes to predict the dynamic imbibition of water in the matrix of the porous medium however in addition to the pore structure many other fracture structures exist in porous media such as rocks several classical theories have been established to describe the spontaneous imbibition of porous media but most of them just focus on the imbibition of pore structures benavente et al 2002 cai et al 2014 hammecker et al 2004 joekar niasar et al 2010 leventis et al 2000 li and zhao 2012 and few have concentrated on fracture structures cheng et al 2015 hardly any general models have been established to calculate the sorptivity of the fractures of a porous medium for this purpose a fractal model based on tortuous capillary bundle was further developed to describe the imbibition of water in sandstone matrix and a fractal model considering the water loss from the fracture into the matrix was established to describe the imbibition of water in fracture of sandstone 2 1 a fractal model to analyses water imbibition in the matrix in the process of imbibition water enters the pore structures of natural porous media under the capillary force cai and yu 2011 cheng et al 2015 cnudde et al 2008 the pore structure of natural porous media is complex and the pore size distribution psd has the essential features of a fractal system katz and thompson 1985 krohn 1988 this complex pore structure can be simplified as a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with fractal characteristics bear 1972 cai et al 2010a yu 2008 2005 yu et al 2008 the capillary tubes in the bundle have different diameters and the distribution of capillary diameters within the maximum and minimum capillary diameters satisfies the fractal power ratio relationship yu 2008 according to the hagen poiseuille equation and the assumption of infinite mobility of air phase in the matrix the flow rate of a single tortuous circular capillary can be expressed as 1 q π λ 4 δ p 128 μ l f where q is the flow rate λ µm is the capillary diameter of the matrix lf mm is the fractal distance travelled by the wetting front in the capillary as shown in fig 1 μ ns m2 is the viscosity of water and δp represents the pressure drop along the capillary water is imbibed into the capillary spontaneously under the action of the pressure drop the effect of gravity on the early stages of spontaneous capillary imbibition can be ignored since the assumptions of negligible effects are never validated cheng et al 2015 hay and dragila 2008 thus δp can be expressed as 2 δ p p c where pc is the capillary pressure according to the young laplace equation pc can be expressed as 3 p c 4 σ cos θ λ where σ n m is the air water surface tension θ is the water solid contact angle the fractal velocity vf mm s can be obtained as follows 4 v f 4 q π λ 2 λ 2 p c 32 μ l f combining eq 3 to 4 yields 5 v f λ σ cos θ 8 μ l f in most previous applications the relation between lf and ls the straight line vertical distance travelled by the wetting front in the capillary along the pressure drop as shown in fig 1 is expressed by a constant tortuosity however the tortuous capillaries always exhibit the fractal behavior in porous media wheatcraft and taylor 1988 developed a proportional relationship between lf and the length scale ε to describe the relationship between lf and ls yu and cheng 2002 believed that the diameter of the capillaries λ is analogous to the length scale ε cai and yu 2011 reported that the tortuosity depends on the scale of measurement and the fractal dimension for tortuosity of capillaries dt they also developed the fractal scaling relationship between ls and λ in porous media 6 l f λ 1 d t l s d t where dt lies in 1 dt 2 and 1 dt 3 in two and three dimensional spaces respectively by differentiating eq 6 with respect to time the relationship between the fractal velocity vf dlf dt and the straight line velocity vs dls dt as shown in fig 1 can be obtained cai et al 2010a 7 v f d t l s d t 1 λ 1 d t v s by substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 the water rising process in a single tortuous capillary can be expressed as follows cai et al 2014 2010a 8 d l s d t λ 2 d t 1 σ cos θ 8 μ d t l s 2 d t 1 integrating eq 8 assuming the initial condition ls 0 0 yields 9 l s σ cos θ 4 μ λ 1 2 d t 1 2 d t t 1 2 d t when dt 1 straight capillary as shown in fig 1 we obtain the l w equation which is expressed as 10 l s λ σ cos θ 4 μ 1 2 t 1 2 cai and yu 2011 obtained the relationship between time exponent α and the dt i e α 1 2dt thus the dt can be expressed as a function of time exponent α as follows 11 d t 1 2 α then eq 9 can be simplified as 12 l s σ cos θ 4 μ λ 1 1 α α t α for a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with different diameters the average distance travelled by the wetting front lsm mm can be calculated by the following expression cai and yu 2011 13 l s m t α λ m i n λ m a x f λ σ c o s θ 4 μ λ 1 1 α α d λ c m t α where f λ is the probability density function of the capillary diameter defined as f λ d λ m i n d λ d 1 d is the pore fractal dimension yu 2008 λmax µm and λmin µm are the maximum and minimum pore diameters respectively the value of λmax µm can be calculated by using the expression as follows cai et al 2010a 14 λ max 32 τ k 4 d 2 d 1 ϕ ϕ where τ is the tortuosity of pore structure k md is the permeability φ is the porosity cm is the sorptivity of the matrix which can be expressed as 15 c m σ c o s θ 4 μ α d λ m a x 1 α 1 d α β d β 1 α where β is defined as λmin λmax and generally it has a value of 10 4 β 10 2 in porous media cai et al 2010b feng et al 2004 yu and li 2001 based on this theoretical framework eq 15 is used to predict the sorptivity of the matrix in fractured sandstone in the applications time exponent α can be obtained by experimental data fitting 2 2 a fractal model to analyses water imbibition in a fracture zone in general water imbibition is rapidly in a rough fracture cheng et al 2015 believed that this phenomenon is caused by the combination of the capillary force and the surface spreading effect hay and dragila 2008 idealized the rough surface as comprised of a series of small cylindrical posts lined up on an otherwise smooth surface and then derived an invasion model to describe the spreading of water in a rough surface their assumption considered the effect of rough surface on water spreading however in natural rocks the fractures are not only rough but also tortuous in this section we assume that the fracture is a tortuous capillary with a rough surface and filled with air the top of the fracture is dry until the fracture filled with water thus the driving force is always the maximum capillary force during the imbibition process andersen et al 2018b since the fracture is filled with air the mobility ratio is strongly favorable andersen et al 2018b and the piston like displacement occurs during the imbibition of water into the fracture the rough surface is idealized as comprising a series of small cylinders arranged on a curved smooth surface and we assume that the height of the cylinder µ µm is equal to the average sand grain diameter of specimen w1 the distance between the cylinder edges ξ µm and the diameter of the cylinder d µm is 2 08δ and 0 83δ respectively hay et al 2008 the cross sectional flow model is shown in fig 2 b according to this assumption a fractal model is established to describe the rapid uptake of water within a single vertical fracture to obtain the flow rate of a single fracture eq 1 can be modified and expressed as 16 q 1 γ π λ f 4 δ p 128 μ l f f where λf µm is the median aperture of fracture lff mm is the fractal distance travelled by the wetting front in fracture γ is the water loss coefficient which means the percentage of water imbibed from the fracture into the matrix and can be expressed as 17 γ v m 1 v m 2 v f v m 1 v m 2 a s h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w a f l s f a s h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w λ f h s m 1 h s m 2 ϕ θ w where vf mm3 is the volume of water that imbibed into the fracture vm1 and vm2 mm3 are the volumes of water imbibed into the matrix from the left and right walls of the fracture respectively hsm1 and hsm2 mm are the horizontal distances travelled by the wetting front in the matrix on the left and right walls of the fracture respectively θ w mm3 mm3 is the average volumetric water content as mm2 and af mm2 is the fracture matrix vertical cross sectional area and the horizontal cross sectional area of the fracture respectively lsf mm is the straight line distance travelled by the wetting front in the fracture the above parameters related to caculate γ can be obtained by experiment such as neutron radiography test due to the rough surface of the fracture the pressure drop δp can be expressed as 18 δ p p c 2 δ p c 2 p μ where pc is the pressure difference across the water air interface caused by capillarity in rough surface which drives the spread of water in rough surface according to young laplace equation pc can be expressed as hay et al 2008 19 δ p c σ 1 r δ 1 r ξ where rδ and rξ are the radii of curvature in the vertical and the horizontal directions see fig 2 a here we assume that the roughness elements i e cylinders are normal to the surface thus the radii of curvature rδ and rξ are defined as 20 r δ δ cos θ sin θ r ξ ξ 2 cos θ pμ is the loss of pressure due to viscous dissipation which can be given as hay et al 2008 21 p μ 2 p 0 μ l s f v f d h 2 where lsf mm is the straight line distance of water imbibition in the fracture which can be expressed as lsf lff τf and τf is the tortuosity of the fracture the poiseuille number p0 cfre where cf is the fanning friction factor and re is the reynolds number associated with the diameter length scale p0 14 38 for a rectangle with an aspect ratio of δ λ 0 48 dh µm is the hydraulic diameter defined as 22 d h 4 a p w 4 δ ξ π 2 θ cos θ tan θ ξ 2 4 2 δ ξ where a µm2 is the cross sectional area of wetting fluid the rectangle s area minus the area of a circular segment and pw is the wetted perimeter hay et al 2008 the fractal velocity vf mm s of water imbibition in fracture can be expressed as 23 v f 4 q π λ f 2 1 γ λ f 2 32 μ l f f p c 2 δ p c 2 p μ where λf µm is the median fracture aperture which can be calculated based on the fracture volume extracted from neutron radiography by substituting eqs 3 19 20 21 into eq 23 the fractal velocity vf mm s can be expressed as 24 v f 1 γ λ f 2 32 μ l f f 4 σ cos θ λ f 2 σ 2 δ ξ cos θ ξ sin θ δ ξ 4 p 0 μ l f f v f τ f d h 2 by substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 24 yields 25 d l s f

fracture in sandstone 3 materials and methods 3 1 sandstone specimen the tested sandstone was collected from rong county sichuan province china the tested sandstone was prepared as a plate specimen which was 41 mm 10 mm 35 mm in size and named as w1 as shown in fig 3 a an artificial rough walled fracture was then created on specimen w1 using the modified brazilian test karpyn et al 2009a as shown in fig 3 b before the experiment the sandstone specimen w1 was oven dried at 105 c until its weight was constant cheng et al 2015 the sides of the specimen were wrapped in metal foil tape to prevent water wetting and evaporation zhao et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 c the microstructure of the rough walled fracture surface was also obtained by using scanning electron microscopy sem as shown in fig 3 d the permeability k is 141 md measured by using the chemically equilibrated water fig 4 shows the psd of a specimen based on mercury intrusion porosimetry mip the porosity φ is 19 50 and the majority of pores are concentrated in the range of 5 13 µm moreover the mineral compositions of the sandstone were measured by using x ray diffraction xrd and listed in table 1 clay minerals account for 2 6 in the tested sandstone 3 2 high resolution x ray ct imaging a nanovoxel 4000 high resolution x ray ct scanner hrxct sanying precision instruments co ltd china was used to investigate the pore and fracture structures of the specimen w1 the fractured structure of the specimen w1 was reconstructed and analyzed by using image analysis software avizo fei co usa fig 5 a shows the two dimensional ct slice of the specimen fig 5 b shows the fracture volume of w1 extracted from hrxct scanning the count percent histogram distribution of fracture aperture in the sandstone specimen is shown in fig 5 c a cylindrical sandstone specimen drilled from the same sandstone block as specimen w1 with a diameter of 1 8 mm was prepared for hrxct scanning to better understand the pore structure the pore structure was also reconstructed and analyzed by using avizo a volume of interest voi of 600 600 600 voxels in the matrix of the sandstone was selected for further calculation of the pore structures as shown in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the two dimensional ct slice of the voi the pore volumes need to be segmented from the matrix to calculate the porosity φ tortuosity based on the otsu method the avizo auto thresholding module was used to calculate the recommended threshold of voi zhao et al 2017 in order to determine the optimum segmentation value of the sandstone specimen studied the variation of porosity φ under different threshold conditions were analysed as listed in table 2 the porosity φ was calculated by using the avizo quantification module zhao et al 2017 by comparing the calculated porosity φ with the measured porosity φ by mip 1695 was set as the thresholds to segment the pore volumes in the voi of the sandstone the three dimensional segmented pore volumes of voi were showed in fig 6 c 3 3 neutron radiography setup the imbibition experiments were performed at the cold neutron guide b located at the guide hall of china advanced research reactor in the china institute of atomic energy the neutron flux rate was 1 03 107 n cm2 s when the reactor operated at a power of 20 mw he et al 2013 the neutron imaging facility is located next to the end of the beam guide and the ratio of the collimator tube length to its aperture diameter is 85 zhao et al 2018 2017 the real time detector system is equipped with a new generation cmos sensor with 5 5 million pixels and speeds up to 100 fps at full frame he et al 2013 the experiment was performed in the following three steps i obtain 10 dark current images shutter closed no neutron illumination and 10 flat field images open shutter without specimen cheng et al 2011 ii hang the specimen holder in front of the scintillator screen and fix specimen w1 on it with the specimen 10 mm away from the scintillator screen then take 10 images of the dried specimen denoted as i dry and iii keep the shutter open and slowly lift an aluminium container filled with distilled water until the bottom of specimen w1 is in contact with the water surface this moment is defined as the baseline zero time cheng et al 2015 neutron images were obtained every 0 10 s to capture the rapid imbibition of water in fractured sandstone specimen and are denoted as wet reference image i wet the experiment lasted 120 s and a total of 9 images were selected to show the rapid uptake of water into the fracture and enable us to calculate the sorptivity of fractured sandstone 3 4 neutron image processing all the raw neutron radiographs were processed and analyzed using the imagej software packages abràmofff et al 2005 schneider et al 2012 for each acquired neutron image the two dimensional distribution of net water in the tested specimen can be obtained using the following steps zhao et al 2017 i one open beam reference image i ob one dark field reference image i df and one dry reference image i dry were acquired from the 10 dark current images 10 flat field images and 10 images of the dried specimen respectively ii in order to remove background noise and beam heterogeneities in the detector and obtain the normalized image of the dry and wet sandstone all raw neutron images of the dry and wet sandstone specimen were processed by using the following formula kang et al 2014 29 i n d r y f k i d r y i d f i o b i d f where indry is the normalized image of the dry sandstone specimen and fk is a rescaling factor used to correct for fluctuations in the neutron flux which was taken as unity in this work because all the images were collected at the same power of the neutron beam the normalized images of the wet sandstone specimen inwet can be obtained by replacing i dry with i wet in eq 29 iii to remove the effect of the dry sandstone specimen and the aluminium foil tape on the neutron intensity and obtain the net water transmission neutron images we divided the normalized wet specimen images inwet by the normalized images of the dry sandstone specimen indry as kang et al 2013 30 i w i n w e t i n d r y where iw denotes the net water transmission neutron images the selected net water transmission images of specimen w1 are shown in fig 7 the water thickness wt mm penetrated by neutron beam in the specimen was calculated using the following expression kang et al 2013 31 w t ζ 2 η ζ 2 η 2 1 η ln t w where tw is the value of transmitted intensity which changes only attribute to the variety of water content the value of tw is equal to the gray value extracted from the image iw by using imagej software ζ mm 1 is the attenuation coefficient for water η mm 2 is the correction coefficient that takes into account beam hardening the values of ζ and η were determined by calibration using water filled al cell machined to give a range of known water thicknesses which is 0 4419 mm 1and 0 0463 mm 2 respectively zhao et al 2018 then the volumetric water content θw can be calculated by 32 θ w w t l w where lw is the thickness of specimen penetrated by neutron beam 3 5 measurement of water wetting front in order to quantify the evolution of the wetting front several monitoring lines on the net water transmission neutron images were set up to extract the change of the wetting front positions as shown in fig 8 considering the complexity of the microstructures in the tested sandstone we superimposed 13 mm2 red grids on the image to define 11 monitoring lines including 9 vertical lines and 2 horizontal lines to monitor the change of the water transmission with time for instance the blue lines show the no 2 and no 7 vertical monitoring lines in regions 1 and 2 the black lines show the no 10 and no 11 horizontal monitoring lines in regions 1 and 2 and the green line shows the no 9 vertical monitoring line in the fracture zone as shown in fig 8 a the distance travelled by the wetting front monitored by lines 2 lm2 7 lm7 9 lsf 10 hsm1 and 11 hsm2 are shown in fig 8 a the net water transmission profiles along the vertical and horizontal direction of the specimen were extracted from the image the distribution of the transmissions along the no 2 no 7 no 9 no 10 and no 11 monitoring lines are shown in fig 8 b the transmission increases in the direction of the water imbibition and where the value of the transmission is equal to or exceeds a threshold value indicating a drying phase the threshold value for specimen w1 is 0 95 based on the average transmission value of the dry image as illustrated in fig 8 b in this work the specimen w1 is assumed not to be wetted by water when the average transmission exceeded the threshold value 4 results and discussion 4 1 evolution of water wetting front fig 7 shows the evolution of water imbibition in both the fracture zone and the matrix of the specimen w1 monitored by neutron radiography the process of the evolution can be divided into three parts i water imbibed into the matrix when the bottom of the specimen is in contact with water ii then water uptake rapidly into the fracture iii last water imbibed into the matrix from the fracture the speed of water imbibition in the fracture is significantly larger than that in the matrix the distance travelled by the wetting front in other monitoring lines nos 1 3 4 5 6 8 were measured and the average distance lsm1 in region 1 and lsm2 in region 2 are obtained as shown in table 3 in order to describe the wetting fronts in different regions of the specimen comparatively the radiograph data obtained as t 0 80 s see fig 8 a is taken as an example it is found that the wetting front in the fracture reaches 34 77 mm which is approximately 16 times larger than that in the matrix of region 1 2 23 mm or region 2 2 05 mm this phenomenon may be induced by the larger effective diameter of the fracture compared with that in the matrix and the rougher surface of the fracture than that of the smooth capillary in the matrix cheng et al 2015 believed that capillary dynamics could explain the more rapid uptake of water in a fracture than in the surrounding matrix during spontaneous imbibition moreover water imbibed into the matrix from the fracture is more rapid than that from the bottom of the specimen hsm1 and hsm2 are 4 34 mm and 4 48 mm which are approximate 2 times larger than the average value of lsm1 and lsm2 as shown in table 3 this result may be caused by two reasons first the fracture was produced by using the modified brazilian method the regions near the fracture may have more microcracks or damages the width of the damaged zone varies between 2 and 10 times the width of the fracture aperture cheng et al 2015 second there is no gravity effect for the horizontal evolution of the wetting front finally the volumetric water content θw along the monitoring lines 10 and 11 are also calculated by using eq 32 the water loss coefficient γ can also be obtained by eq 17 table 3 lists the average value θ w and the water loss coefficient γ at different imbibition time the water loss coefficient γ rises with the increase of the imbibition time except at time of 0 10 s the boundary effect may cause this exception at 0 10 s the average value of water loss coefficient γ is selected as one representative value to estimate the loss of water from the fracture to the matrix and as one of the important parameters to calculate the sorptivity of the fracture during the spontaneous imbibition 4 2 determination of time exponent according to the literature review cheng et al 2015 kang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 the height of water imbibition in a matrix or fracture increases linearly with the square root of time i e time exponent α 0 50 however these researches did not consider the uncertainty of the time exponent i e α 0 5 caused by the heterogeneity of the medium or the capillary force disorder due to the randomness of pore sizes brú and pastor 2006 cai and yu 2011 fig 9 a shows that the wetting front positions are monitored in both space and time quantitative results of the wetting front position for each vertical and horizontal net water transmission profile are obtained from the neutron radiographs fig 9 presents that the double logarithmic plots of the wetting front positions versus time the time exponent α can be estimated by using linear regression and the values of goodness of fit r2 are larger than 0 93 as listed in table 4 the results clearly show a non classical i e time exponent α 0 5 behavior of the wetting front motion the time exponent α for the wetting front motion in regions 1 and 2 of the matrix are 0 46 and 0 45 in the vertical direction and 0 33 and 0 40 in the horizontal direction respectively possible causes of these variations are the randomness of the capillary force which is related to the anisotropy of the medium and the randomness of the psd brú and pastor 2006 cai and yu 2011 similar results have been reported for other porous medias e g chalk bentonite clay and berea with time exponent values of 0 40 for chalk li and horne 2004 0 41 for bentonite clay brú and pastor 2006 and 0 32 for berea sandstone li et al 2006 moreover it can be seen the first points of some of the data sets tends to slight deviation from the best fit line in fig 9 these deviations may be caused by the effect of boundary that affects the rate of spontaneous imbibition yildiz et al 2006 moreover the existence of the boundary will affect the equipotential line distribution of the imbibition field and the streamline distribution 4 3 sorptivity analysis 4 3 1 sorptivity from nonlinear regression of the experimental data fig 10 shows the relationships of the wetting front position in the matrix and the fracture with the time the sorptivity of the sandstone matrix cm regions 1 and 2 and the fracture cf can be estimated by the nonlinear regression of the plotted points it is found that the first point of the data set of fracture see fig 10 a tends to fall below the fitting line possible causes of this deviations are i the bottom of the specimen may not have been perfectly aligned with the water surface resulting in partial contact at very early times and ii the first image is integrated over a relatively long period of time 5 10 ms relative to the rate of wetting at very early times cheng et al 2015 table 5 presents the sorptivities of the matrix cm and the fracture zone cf obtained by experimental fit and all the values of the goodness of fit r2 are larger than 0 96 it is found that the sorptivity of the fracture is 39 61 mm s0 38 cheng et al 2015 reported that the fracture sorptivity of berea sandstone ranges from 17 87 to 27 12 mm s0 50 by linear regression of the experimental data however most of the previous studies on the sorptivity of rocks regard the time exponent α as 0 50 cheng et al 2015 hammecker and jeannette 1994 hassanein et al 2006 zhao et al 2017 in the current study the time exponent is 0 38 for the fracture sorpotivity the matrix sorptivities near the bottom of the specimen are 2 33 mm s0 46 region 1 and 2 18 mm s0 45 region 2 but the values of sorptivities near the fracture damage zone are 4 42 mm s0 33 line 10 and 4 93 mm s0 40 line 11 which are approximately 2 times larger than that near the bottom of the specimen this result quantifies the difference between the imbibition rate of water from the fracture or the bottom of the specimen into the matrix the matrix sorptivity near the bottom of the specimen obtained by nonlinear regression is basically consistent in regions 1 and 2 regardless of the values of the time exponent α the slight variations of the sorptivity in the matrix may be caused by the heterogeneity of the tested sandstone and the shrinkage closure and elimination of pore throats during the imbibition process benavente et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 moreover the sorptivity of the fracture obtained by nonlinear regression is much larger than that of the matrix this may be caused by not only the capillary uptake within the fracture aperture but also by the surface spreading of water on the side walls of the fracture cheng et al 2015 nevertheless the increased micro crack density associated with localized damage near the fracture may enhance the sorption of fracture hall 2013 sahmaran and li 2009 and zhang et al 2010a also observed the enhanced sorption phenomenon in fractured cementitious materials the above results not only prove that the fracture can significantly increase imbibition in fractured sandstone but also show the heterogeneity effects on the sorptivity 4 3 2 sorptivity from model prediction in this section we employ fractal models eqs 15 and 27 to predict the sorptivity for both the matrix and the fracture of tested sandstone the parameters used to calculate the sorptivity are listed in table 6 the value of δ is equal to the average sand grain diameter of specimen w1 which is obtained by measuring the sem image of the fracture surface see fig 3 d using imagej software the average sand grain diameter of specimen w1 is 193 52 μm which is consistent with the normal particle size range of sandstone i e 125 to 250 μm reported by folk 1980 fig 5 a was imported into autocad software and the fracture was depicted by using the polyline the tortuous and the straight line length of the fracture was measured and the τf can be calculated to be 1 05 the aperture of the rough walled fracture is calculated based on the three dimensional fracture volume obtained by hrxct see fig 5 b the calculated results showed the fracture aperture varied from 7 7 to 770 30 μm as shown in fig 5 c thus the median aperture λf is 389 μm the two dimensional fractal dimension of pores d equals to 1 84 which is measured by using fractal box counter in imagej software based on two dimensional ct slice of the specimen see fig 6 b the tortuosity of pore structure τ is calculated by avizo centroid path tortuosity module base on the pore structure data of voi after segmentation and equals to 2 06 see fig 6 c the value of λmax is calculated by using eq 14 and equals to 22 76 μm the average value of water loss coefficient γ in table 3 equals to 0 28 which is used in the sorptivity calculation feng et al 2004 reported that the value of β range from 10 4 to 10 2 in porous media take region 1 as an example we analyzed the effect of β with the values of 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 on the prediction of matrix sorptivity the predicted results of the matrix sorptivity region 1 are 0 20 mm s0 46 0 70 mm s0 46 and 2 41 mm s0 46 corresponding to the β of 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 based on the experimental nonlinear fitting values of the matrix sorptivity region 1 when β equals to 10 4 or 10 3 the predicted values of the developed model significantly underestimate the sorptivity of matrix when β 10 2 the value of the matrix sorptivity predicted by the developed model is close to the experimental nonlinear fitting value moreover cai et al 2010b suggested that the minimum pore diameter λmin is usually two orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum pore diameter λmax based on the experimental data regression β of 10 2 was chosen because it gave the best modeled results table 7 shows the sorptivities of various regions in the sandstone predicted by experimental nonlinear fitting and developed model comparatively the matrix sorptivities near the bottom of the specimen obtained by the model prediction are 1 03 region 1 and 1 07 region 2 times larger than the values obtained by nonlinear regression these results prove that the sorptivity of the matrix surrounding the fracture can be interpreted from the model some deviation of the model predicted sorptivity to the experimental fitting result may be caused by the following issues i some infilling materials such as clay minerals and quartz grains within the pores reduce the effective seepage radius of the pores ii the connectivity of the pores may be reduced due to the expansion of the clay mineral such as illite and kaolinite in contact with water zhao et al 2017 table 7 also indicates that the matrix sorptivities near the fracture damage zone obtained by the model prediction are seriously underestimated it is caused by the underestimated porosity value used in the model as mentioned in the previous sections the fracture of the tested sandstone was manufactured by the modified brazil test method which could induce damage of the regions near the fracture these damage and microcracks close to the fracture will increase the sorption ability of the matrix cheng et al 2015 hall 2013 the fracture sorptivity predicted by eq 27 is 1 04 times larger than the value obtained by nonlinear regression many previous studies related to the water flow in the fracture are based on the assumption of one dimensional flow which means no water will loss or imbibe from the fracture into the matrix andersen et al 2018a cheng et al 2015 if we do not consider the water loss coefficient in eq 30 the predicted fracture sorptivity is 45 67 mm s0 38 which is 1 15 times larger than the value obtained by nonlinear regression of experimental data thus the error of predicted fracture sorptivity is approximate 15 for the tested sandstone by using one dimensional assumption but the error of our developed model of fracture sorptivity is just 4 eq 27 considers the actual situation of water from the fracture to the matrix during the spontaneous imbibition of water in the fracture of sandstone which cause the predicted fracture sorptivity is closer to the actual value these results prove that the developed sorptivity model of fracture eq 27 is more effective moreover neutron radiography provides an effective tool to obtain the basic data to calculate the water loss coefficient it needs to point that the imbibition time exponent α of fracture in the tested sandstone equals to 0 38 by using eq 28 this value is consistent with that obtained by linear regression of experimental data it also indicates that eq 28 is effective and provides a new method to estimate the time exponent of water imbibed into rough walled fractures in sandstone all of the above results may provide a better understanding of the sorptivity in matrix and fracture of sandstone however further studies are also necessary to evaluate the validity of the models for other rocks the applicability of the models developed based on the laboratory scale test to the in situ test also needs to be verified 5 summary and conclusion in this study the dynamics of water imbibition in the unsaturated fractured sandstone is monitored successfully by neutron radiography the wetting front in the fracture moves faster than that in the matrix moreover the dynamic evolution of the wetting front in both the matrix and the fracture do not obey the l w equation with the time component α 0 5 experimental results show that the wetting front advanced linearly with the power α of the time the sorptivity of matrix and fracture were estimated by nonlinear regression of the experimental data a fractal model is further modified to predict the sorptivity of the matrix which takes into account the fractal dimension of tortuosity a new fractal model is established to predict the sorptivity of a rough walled fracture in the unsaturated sandstone which considers the water losses from the fracture to the matrix by comparing the experimental and model prediction results we found that i the maximum pore size pore fractal dimension and the fractal dimension of the tortuosity have a major influence on the determination of the sorptivity of matrix ii the fracture aperture the tortuosity of fracture the fractal dimension of tortuosity water losses coefficient and the diameter of sandstone particle play an important role in the prediction of fracture sorptivity moreover the established fractal model also provides a new method to estimate the imbibition time exponent of fracture this work provides important findings and guidance to further investigate this phenomenon in other natural and engineered porous media this phenomenon is likely to be particularly important in engineering applications such as the exploitation of unconventional gas resources e g sandstone shale gas by using hydraulic fracturing however some limitations are worth noting in this study we assumed the imbibition channel in the matrix as tortuous capillary tubes without considering the intersections of parallel capillaries moreover the current theoretical framework represents an only approximation of imbibition behavior within the unsaturated fractured sandstone used in this work

614,recent recognition of the widespread occurrence of freshwater beneath the ocean has renewed interest in approaches to understand and predict its extent the most straightforward methodologies are based on the sharp interface approximation which neglects dispersive mechanisms the understanding of dispersion effects on freshwater extents in coastal aquifers is based almost entirely on onshore aquifer situations this study explores dispersion in offshore coastal aquifers in terms of the steady state freshwater extent seawater circulation and freshwater discharge through numerical experimentation results show that increasing dispersion causes a seaward shift in the interface toe location as expected whereas the interface tip shows a non monotonic relationship with dispersion that depends on the contrast between aquifer and aquitard hydraulic conductivities higher dispersion leads to enhanced seawater recirculation rates and freshwater discharge as opposed to non monotonic relationships obtained previously for onshore aquifers the mixing zone at the toe widens as dispersion increases similar to onshore cases whereas the mixing zone at the tip has a surprisingly non monotonic relationship with dispersion the dispersion relationships revealed in this study can be explained by counteractions between dispersion density and advective forces and refraction across the aquifer aquitard interface which in combination produce offshore aquifer behaviour that differs in some ways to the manner in which onshore aquifers respond to dispersive processes consequently previous empirical corrections to sharp interface methods to account for dispersive effects applied to onshore coastal aquifers are ineffective in their application to offshore settings keywords

zs depth of the sea at the bottom of the aquifer 1 introduction the discovery of widespread fresh groundwater in continental shelves e g post et al 2013 has promoted a renewed interest in methods to quantify the extent of these resources the development of simplified methodologies is particularly relevant to subsea freshwater estimation because offshore data are usually scarce and rapid approximations are critical first steps in recognising the potential for offshore freshwater reserves for example solórzano rivas and werner 2018 employed simplified conceptual models of offshore aquifers in their numerical modelling study of subsea freshwater extents and proposed an approximate method for simulating the offshore sea boundary condition using the general head boundary package of seawat langevin et al 2008 they recommended revision of analytical solutions to the extent of offshore fresh groundwater developed by bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 to allow for alternative salinity assumptions in the offshore aquitard werner and robinson 2018 subsequently developed this revision and knight et al 2018 applied it to the rapid assessment of numerous offshore aquifers from around the world the above analytical methods are based on assumptions that there is no mixing between freshwater and seawater i e a sharp interface and that seawater is stagnant rather than the circulating behaviour that is found in onshore coastal aquifer settings e g smith 2004 studies have shown that the seawater extent in coastal aquifers is overestimated by sharp interface methods e g cooper 1959 volker and rushton 1982 however sharp interface methods overestimate the extent of freshwater lenses for variable density situations in riverine riparian zones werner 2017a and therefore neglecting dispersion may lead to over or underestimation of fresh groundwater bodies in variable density systems the extent of seawater in coastal aquifers is commonly quantified by the interface toe location i e where the interface intercepts the bottom of the aquifer e g volker and rushton 1982 werner and simmons 2009 while the toe location typically indicates the most landward advancement of seawater at least in homogeneous aquifers the tip location i e where the interface intercepts the top of the aquifer usually reflects the maximum offshore extent of freshwater penetration this is an important additional consideration in studies concerned with the storage of freshwater beneath the seafloor the best known and studied cases of terrestrial discharge into the sea occur within the intertidal zone e g reilly and goodman 1985 bear et al 1999 thereby presuming that the tip is effectively connected to or near to the shoreline consequently the current understanding of the key factors in particular the role of dispersion influencing the tip position and by association the offshore extent of freshwater is somewhat deficient although extensive research has been carried out to assess the impact of neglecting dispersion in sharp interface models of onshore aquifers e g cooper 1959 pool and carrera 2011 llopis albert and pulido velazquez 2014 werner 2017b only hill 1988 has considered the effect of dispersion on the distribution of subsea freshwater hill 1988 compared sharp interface and dispersive interface solutions to the freshwater seawater distribution in a case study investigation of a layered offshore aquifer setting cape may county new jersey hill 1988 evaluated the freshwater extent in three aquifers with intervening aquitards an unconfined aquifer overlying two semi confined aquifers extending offshore some 22 km hill 1988 compared essaid s 1986 sharp interface numerical solution to dispersive numerical results for the stratified aquifer system the results showed that the tip and toe of the dispersive mixing zone were considerably more seaward than the sharp interface solution in the upper and lowermost aquifers whereas in the middle aquifer the sharp interface occurred within the numerical mixing zone albeit differing in slope relative to the dispersive mixing zone hill 1988 attributed the sharp dispersive interface mismatch within the upper and lowermost aquifers to differences in inter aquifer freshwater flow exchange between the sharp interface and dispersive methods that is while the dispersive solution treated inter aquifer exchange using standard flow and transport equations essaid s 1986 solution required special treatment of upward freshwater leakage where it flowed into saltwater in the overlying aquifer hill 1988 found that essaid s 1986 method caused overestimation of the seawater extent as mehdizadeh et al 2014 later confirmed hill 1988 also reported that dispersive results better matched sharp interface estimates with lower transverse dispersivity αt although supporting evidence for this outcome was not presented given that hill s 1988 analysis of offshore dispersive effects was confounded by essaid s 1986 assumption of inter aquifer freshwater exchange and the effect of dispersion was not systematically investigated a more thorough analysis of the role of dispersion on offshore salinity distributions including on both the toe and tip locations is warranted furthermore the influence of dispersion on estimates of freshwater discharge and on rates of seawater circulation in offshore aquifers should also be assessed in this regard this study is the first to investigate the effect of dispersion on freshwater discharge to and within offshore aquifers when inland boundary conditions are specified by fixed heads rather than fixed fluxes thus the main aim of this study is to explore the role of dispersion in influencing the key features of offshore freshwater seawater relationships including the characteristics of the freshwater seawater interface e g the tip and toe location and the mixing zone width rates of freshwater discharge and seawater circulation rates intentionally simplified offshore aquifer settings are considered in the form of cross sectional models of uniform geometry and homogeneous isotropic hydraulic properties this allows for comparison to the werner and robinson 2018 solution for the sharp interface position and assists in elucidating generalised behaviour that would otherwise be challenging to discern using more complicated situations we extend the research of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who studied steady state salinity distributions in subsea aquifer aquitard systems without accounting for dispersion i e based on the sharp interface assumption the dispersion independent form of the boundary rayleigh number considered by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 is revisited for dispersive situations additionally the study of largely onshore seawater recirculation by smith 2004 is re examined for offshore conditions 2 methods 2 1 analytical solution the werner and robinson 2018 solution is used here to provide exact distributions of the offshore freshwater seawater interface under steady state sharp interface conditions the conceptual model used by werner and robinson 2018 and others e g bakker 2006 bakker et al 2017 solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for the offshore continuation of continental fresh groundwater is illustrated in fig 1 this two dimensional cross sectional conceptual model is based on the assumption of one dimensional flow i e the dupuit approximation within an offshore aquifer that is homogeneous and isotropic freshwater and seawater are immiscible and separated by a sharp interface solórzano rivas and werner 2018 compared non dispersive numerical solutions against the bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 analytical solutions demonstrating that the analytical solution overestimated the extent of offshore fresh groundwater at the top of the aquifer due to the presumption by bakker 2006 that the offshore aquitard was filled entirely with seawater solórzano rivas and werner 2018 concluded that if the aquitard in areas overlying fresh groundwater is assumed to contain freshwater instead of seawater the analytical solution would give better results based on solórzano rivas and werner 2018 findings werner and robinson 2018 developed a solution that allows the aquitard salinity to be specified confirming that when freshwater is assumed in the aquitard the analytical solution and the non dispersive numerical solution are in better agreement for example werner and robinson 2018 report an improvement in the analytically derived tip location from an average discrepancy of 87 with the non dispersive numerical results when adopting seawater in the aquitard to only 2 when the salinity was changed to that of freshwater some of the input parameters to apply the werner and robinson 2018 solution are illustrated in fig 2 the symbols in fig 2 are as follows h is the thickness of the aquifer l h1 is the thickness of the aquitard l hs is the depth of the sea at the top of the aquitard l zs is the depth of the sea at the bottom of the aquifer l qf is the freshwater flow per unit length of coastline into the offshore aquifer l2 t ho is the onshore hydraulic head l lc is the length of the onshore confined aquifer l and ls is the length of the offshore semi confined aquifer l the werner and robinson 2018 solution has the flexibility of specifying qf or ho at the onshore boundary i e blue line in fig 2 here we adopted the option of specifying ho which is more practical given the tendency to measure and characterise groundwater heads rather than fluxes qf can be calculated by applying darcy s law in the onshore section in conjunction with knowledge of the head at the toe if the toe is onshore or obtaining the head at the shoreline through application of werner and robinson s 2018 solution if the toe is offshore werner and robinson 2018 introduced a dimensionless parameter β that defines the uniform groundwater salinity within the aquitard in the region where freshwater occurs in the aquifer it can be specified within the range of 0 to 1 whereby a value of 0 indicates that the aquitard contains seawater i e the assumption of bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 and 1 indicates that the aquitard contains freshwater which accords with the recommendation of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 werner and robinson 2018 define three key parameters to solve for the offshore interface distribution as 1 the dimensionless discharge in the confined section i e onshore aquifer μ qflf kh 2δ where lf is the leakage factor l defined by l f k h h l k z k is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity l t 1 kz is the aquitard vertical hydraulic conductivity l t 1 δ is the dimensionless density difference between freshwater ρf m l 3 and seawater ρs m l 3 given by ρ s ρ f ρ f 2 βhl h and 3 the dimensionless offshore aquitard length λ s ls lf other variables have been defined earlier in the paper the reader is referred to werner and robinson 2018 for a complete description of the mathematical solution bakker 2006 divided the original analytical solution into four interface cases which werner and robinson 2018 follow and which depend on the toe and tip position relative to the shoreline cases i and iii have an onshore toe and in cases ii and iv the toe is offshore the tip position is landward of the vertical sea boundary in cases i and ii and is attached to the offshore limit of the aquifer e g the edge of the continental shelf in cases iii and iv the remainder of the text designates these cases as analytical cases i to iv to distinguish them from the numerical model cases used in this study fig 3 shows contours of analytically derived dimensionless toe location xt i e toe location relative to the shoreline xtoe divided by lf where negative and positive values indicate onshore and offshore toe locations respectively as a function of µ and λs the range 2 0 xt 1 5 is shown red lines are the boundaries separating each analytical case wherein the line labelled xt 0 identifies the conditions under which the toe is coincident with the shoreline the x axis is truncated at λs 3 5 because higher values of λs do not affect the salinity distribution in the subsea aquifer for analytical cases i and ii that is offshore aquifers longer than λs 3 5 have the same toe location for the values of µ used in fig 3 the contours in fig 3 provide important information about the toe position in onshore offshore aquifer settings that is relevant to the current research objectives for example the contours of xt are nearly vertical in parts of analytical case iv tip connected to the offshore boundary and the toe is offshore indicating low sensitivity of xt to changes in freshwater discharge µ additionally analytical cases i and ii are represented by horizontal xt contours highlighting that those situations are independent of the dimensionless offshore length λs according to knight et al 2018 published situations of significant subsea fresh groundwater predominantly involve tips that are landward of the offshore aquifer limit at least under modern day conditions and therefore analytical cases i and ii are likely the most common for that reason and considering also that the tip can vary in its location in analytical cases i and ii thereby clearly differentiating our offshore aquifer analysis from onshore situations where the tip is relatively immobile attached to the coastline we focus on analytical cases i and ii in this investigation that is both the tip and toe potentially vary in response to parameter changes in our analysis 2 2 numerical methodology the finite difference numerical code seawat version 4 langevin et al 2008 was used to simulate dispersive cases of subsea freshwater groundwater seawat combines modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to solve the equations that describe variable density flow and solute transport in porous media the governing equations and methodology used by seawat are omitted here for brevity and the reader is referred to the user manual langevin et al 2008 for details of the code numerical experiments were based on the conceptual model illustrated in fig 2 and to some degree on cases developed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 except with the incorporation of dispersion parameters steady state salinity distributions were obtained for various offshore aquifer situations by running seawat in transient mode until the models converged on steady state conditions two different geometries are presented in this study a small domain to allow for simulation using a fine grid cross section a and a more realistic field scale domain cross section b that required coarser discretisation cross section a contains 111 layers and 1875 columns total dimension of 250 05 m long by 11 1 m deep uniform vertical discretisation δz of 0 1 m was used throughout the model domain while the horizontal discretisation δx varies from 0 1 m near the seaward boundary up to 10 m at the landward boundary cross section b 2508 m long by 55 5 m deep comprises 111 layers and 1137 columns with δx 2 m at the seaward boundary gradually increasing to 10 m at the landward boundary and a constant δz of 0 5 m the grid sizes of both cross sections were designed such that interfaces occurred in the regions of finest discretisation i e 0 1 m by 0 1 m in cross section a and 2 m by 0 5 m in cross section b we tested the effect of grid discretisation in cross section a for example a finer grid was tested in cross section a of 0 05 m by 0 05 m changes in salinity distributions attributable to the grid resolution were up to 2 i e freshwater zone was 2 larger using a finer grid estimated by averaging the differences in tip and toe locations indicating that model results are within reasonable bounds of grid dependency in any case the grid resolutions used in this study are at the limit of refinement in the context of model runtimes which were up to 178 3 h using an intel xeon cpu with specifications e5 1650 v4 3 60 ghz and 32 gb ram following the model layout of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 the topmost grid layer in the offshore portion simulates the effect of the ocean using a high value for k i e 10 000 m d and the subsequent ten layers simulate the desired aquitard thickness the onshore boundary blue line in fig 2 is a specified head with concentration conditions equal to freshwater i e zero concentration along the two sea boundaries red lines in fig 2 seawater hydrostatic heads were assigned the influence of the ocean on salinities at the aquifer ocean interface was simulated as follows a the vertical sea boundary represents the offshore limit of the aquifer and therefore the concentration condition depends on the flow direction such that discharge to the sea occurs at the ambient groundwater concentration whereas seawater concentration was assigned to any inflowing water b the horizontal sea boundary represents seawater immediately above the seafloor and therefore boundary cells were assigned constant seawater concentration presuming that freshwater discharge does not cause freshening of the sea smith 2004 recommends precaution in using type b boundary conditions because salt may accumulate at the boundary in an unrealistic manner a similar issue was recognised in the original henry problem as reported by segol et al 1975 and others following smith s 2004 recommendation we tested both approaches to the assignment of boundary conditions i e a and b described above to the horizontal seafloor results are reported for boundary condition b along the seafloor and only a selection of results obtained using boundary condition a are given for brevity as neither boundary condition accurately represents the physical mixing of freshwater and seawater within and immediately above the seafloor an argument can be made for one choice over the other the effect of seafloor boundary condition choice is reported in section 3 2 five offshore aquifer scenarios termed scenarios 1 to 5 were used to explore dispersion effects on the distribution of subsea fresh groundwater cross section a was used for scenarios 1 to 3 and cross section b for scenarios 4 and 5 each scenario adopted a range of dispersion parameters creating 40 simulations in total table 1 defines the parameter sets for each scenario parameters were selected to obtain interfaces that remained sufficiently distant from the seaward and landward model limits partly to avoid boundary effects the aquifer k aquitard kz contrast known to be a key controlling factor of subsea freshwater extent increased from 1 20 in scenario 1 to 1 1600 in scenario 5 adopted values of k 10 to 40 m d and kz 0 025 to 0 5 m d are generally within the range of typical field values for subsea aquifers e g 0 86 to 90 m d knight et al 2018 and aquitards 10 6 to 0 1 m d knight et al 2018 respectively with the exception being the relatively high kz value of 0 5 m d adopted for scenarios 1 and 2 we chose this relatively high value of kz so that small aquifer k aquitard kz contrasts i e 20 1 and 50 1 scenarios 1 and 2 respectively and near shore tip locations were included in the range of conditions otherwise parameters were derived from a review of other coastal aquifer modelling studies e g kooi and groen 2001 smith 2004 werner 2017a 2017b solórzano rivas and werner 2018 the dimensionless variables μ and lf used in this study allow for comparison with field conditions as reported by knight et al 2018 values of μ used in scenarios 1 to 5 are 0 19 1 06 0 52 0 89 and 0 69 respectively and the corresponding lf values are 14 m 22 m 45 m 500 m and 630 m a wide range of field conditions are observed in the data of knight et al 2018 for which μ values vary between 0 01 and 16 and lf values range from 140 m to 770 m the values of μ used in all five scenarios are therefore relatively low albeit they fall within the range for realistic situations lf values from scenarios 1 to 3 are below the lower limit of knight et al 2018 cases whereas lf values for scenarios 4 and 5 are within the range of real world cases it is well established that dispersion in models represents the largely unknown heterogeneity in the subsurface and that its magnitude is proportional to the scale of the analysed domain e g gelhar et al 1992 bear and cheng 2010 zech et al 2015 here to test different values of dispersion parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl and transverse dispersivity αt were varied systematically within the aquifer the following criteria were considered the minimum value of αl was constrained by the recommended grid peclet number pex given by δx αl 2 zheng and bennett 2002 to reduce artificial oscillations in seawat s solution the maximum value of αl was set to approximately 1 10 of the offshore aquifer length e g gelhar et al 1992 bear and cheng 2010 given that flow near the mixing zone has a significant vertical component e g abarca et al 2007 the maximum value of αl was further limited to the thickness of the aquifer i e maximum αl h a constant dispersivity anisotropy ratio αl αt of 10 was adopted this is consistent with previous studies e g kooi and groen 2001 smith 2004 badaruddin et al 2017 werner 2017a in order to evaluate if seawater circulation rates in offshore aquifers show the same non monotonic relationship with dispersion as found by smith 2004 for onshore aquifers our dimensionless dispersion values e g αl h αt h were designed to cover the entire range used by smith 2004 within the limits described above for the aquitard each scenario used a single value for the longitudinal dispersivity αl1 0 05 m for all models adopting cross section a i e scenarios 1 to 3 and 0 25 m for models adopting cross section b i e scenarios 4 and 5 given that flow within the aquitard is predominantly vertical e g solórzano rivas and werner 2018 α l1 was set according to the pez δz αl1 2 restriction of zheng and bennett 2002 frind 1982 suggested that a normal contrast of dispersivity values between aquifer and aquitard is around three orders of magnitude i e αl α l1 1000 in this study given that αl varies and α l1 is constant the dispersivity contrast between aquifer and aquitard varies between one and three orders of magnitude for cross section a and between one and two orders of magnitude for cross section b the lowest aquifer aquitard dispersivity contrast used in this study was also adopted by huyakorn et al 1987 2 3 output variables the effects of dispersion on subsea aquifers were quantified in terms of the output variables described below and illustrated in fig 4 similar output variables have been used by others e g smith 2004 abarca et al 2007 badaruddin et al 2017 the tip penetration xtip and toe penetration xtoe are defined by the steady state location of the 0 5 isochlor at the top and bottom of the aquifer respectively measured from the shoreline i e onshore and offshore values of xtoe are negative and positive respectively fig 4 the dimensionless widths of the mixing zone at the aquifer top w tip and bottom w toe are defined as wtip h and wtoe h respectively where wtip and wtoe are the horizontal distances between the 0 05 and 0 95 isochlors at the top and bottom of the aquifer respectively a similar definition was used by badaruddin et al 2017 the onshore boundary was defined by ho while qf see fig 2 to the subsea aquifer was calculated rather than specified we use qf and qfn for the analytically derived and numerically derived freshwater discharge rates respectively qfn is compared to qf using 1 δ q f q f n q f q f 100 we expect that dispersion will influence the rate of seawater circulation given the findings of smith 2004 for onshore aquifers seawater circulation is induced by the entrainment of seawater in the freshwater discharge to the sea and requirements for balanced salt mass in the subsea aquifer under steady state conditions e g cooper 1959 smith 2004 studied the phenomenon of seawater circulation within a two dimensional cross sectional model of onshore freshwater discharge towards the sea and included a short offshore section of aquifer his conceptual model differs from ours in that there is not an intervening aquitard separating the submarine aquifer from the sea in smith s 2004 models the absence of an offshore aquitard leads to very little offshore fresh groundwater and rather the interface tip remains near to the shoreline for the purposes of analysing seawater recirculation patterns smith 2004 defined a dimensionless seawater flux sc as 2 s c q s q f n 100 where qs is the rate of seawater flow l t 2 from to the sea qs is made of two components namely seawater inflow through the horizontal seafloor qsf and through the vertical face of the continental shelf qsv 2 4 mixed convection analysis unstable buoyancy conditions in fluid motion arise when a denser fluid overlies a lighter one under certain circumstances this can give rise to the onset of downward moving plumes typically in the shape of fingers when unstable problems are governed by both forced convection i e due to hydraulic forces and free convection i e buoyancy or fluid density driven forces it is said to be a mixed convective flow regime e g simmons et al 2010 solórzano rivas and werner 2018 undertook a mixed convection analysis in subsea aquitards subject to upward freshwater flow towards the seafloor they used the boundary layer theory of wooding et al 1997 whereby a critical boundary rayleigh number raδ exists at which the buoyancy and dispersive forces are in equilibrium forming a stable solute layer beneath the boundary solórzano rivas and werner 2018 adopted for convenience a dispersion independent form of wooding et al 1997 raδ see below which allowed them to avoid the need to quantify artificial numerical dispersion within their zero dispersion seawat simulations 3 r a δ ρ s ρ f k z ρ f q z here qz is the darcy flux of vertical freshwater flow through the aquitard at the position where the 0 5 isochlor intercepts the base of the aquitard l t 1 a raδ of around 2 was obtained by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for the conditions leading to half seawater concentrations i e the 0 5 isochlor at the top of the offshore aquifer this value of raδ was considered a predictor of the transition between freshwater and seawater within the aquitard assuming predominantly vertical aquitard flow and low dispersion conditions we extend the rayleigh analysis of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 which focused on sharp interface solutions by studying mixed convective processes under varying degrees of dispersiveness that is values of qz where the 0 5 isochlor meets the aquifer top were obtained from modelling results and used in eq 3 to explore whether the critical value of raδ obtained for low dispersion conditions by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 applies under more realistic levels of dispersiveness the raδ analysis described above is relevant to the development of boundary salt layers within aquitard sediments whereas smith and turner 2001 proposed a modified rayleigh number ra to assess the forces that cause water from a saline estuary to sink into an underlying freshwater aquifer without an intervening aquitard in their case the groundwater beneath the estuary flows laterally that aspect of their conceptual model is comparable to ours except smith and turner 2001 did not consider the intervening aquitard figs 1 and 2 from numerical experimentation smith and turner 2001 concluded that the critical ra for the occurrence of saltwater below the estuary is approximately five they proposed the following rayleigh number formulation 4 r a k h n e q z α l ρ s ρ f ρ f u u here ne is the effective porosity and u u is the regional discharge ratio between the flow crossing the left hand and right hand boundaries i e allowing for asymmetric flow to the estuary respectively other parameters have been previously defined in order to apply the smith and turner 2001 formulation to the conceptual model shown in fig 2 qz is taken at the location of the 0 5 isochlor at the top of the aquifer see eq 4 as a substitute for their uniform discharge across the riverbed i e ud in the notation of smith and turner 2001 we also assign u u a value of one so that the problem is treated as symmetric 3 results 3 1 sensitivity to dispersion 3 1 1 tip and toe penetration fig 5 presents the steady state locations of the 0 5 isochlor from five scenarios see table 1 showing the variability that arises with changes in dispersivity the left column of graphs depicts the tip and toe location while the right column shows interface shapes numerical results are compared with the werner and robinson 2018 analytical solution which are the grey coloured symbols and lines hereafter we refer to the werner and robinson 2018 solution as the sharp interface or analytical solution the results show that dispersion has a major influence on the position of the 0 5 isochlor the left column graphs of fig 5 illustrate that xtoe has a monotonic relationship with dispersion indicated by xtoe increases i e seaward advance with larger dispersivity this is consistent with studies of the effects of dispersion on xtoe in onshore coastal aquifers e g volker and rushton 1982 the same general trend is observed for all k kz contrasts i e scenarios 1 to 5 the tip also moves seaward with increasing dispersivity monotonically in scenarios 1 and 2 however changes in xtip with varying dispersivity show a non monotonic relationship in scenarios 3 to 5 that is increasing dispersivity leads to more seaward xtip values until a maximum is reached and then xtip retreats towards the shoreline with increasing dispersivity therefore the trend in xtip arising from changes to dispersivity depends on the k kz contrast fig 5 also shows that xtoe is more responsive to changes in dispersivity compared to corresponding changes in xtip the largest k kz contrast e g 1600 1 in scenario 5 fig 5e and highest dispersivity values e g αl 50 m lead to xtip values that approach the sharp interface xtip position this is in contrast to the notion devised from studies of onshore coastal aquifers that dispersion creates more extensive freshwater bodies and smaller seawater wedges relative to sharp interface solutions instead the contraction of the offshore freshwater extent with increased dispersion is similar behaviour to that of riparian freshwater lenses werner and laattoe 2016 werner 2017a thus freshwater seawater interfaces of offshore aquifers show dispersive behaviour that is a mixture of that observed in onshore coastal aquifers and within terrestrial freshwater lenses the responses in the tip and toe to changes in dispersion were quantified through sensitivity analysis as presented in table 2 we report the traditional sensitivity e g robinson and werner 2017 given by s t o e δ x t o e α l x t o e δ α l and s t i p δ x t i p α l x t i p δ α l for the toe and tip respectively table 2 demonstrates that for all scenarios the toe is more sensitive to dispersion than the tip by around one to two orders of magnitude consistent with the graphical representation of results in fig 5 specifically the ratio of toe shift to tip shift i e δxtoe δxtip caused by changes in dispersivity on average is about 9 1 in our simulations there is some evidence of patterns in stoe behaviour with rising dispersivity and with increasing k kz contrast recalling that k kz increases from scenarios 1 to 5 table 1 albeit the change in αl from 1 to 2 5 m in scenarios 1 and 2 are anomalous to otherwise generalizable trends that is stoe rises with increasing dispersivity in scenarios 1 and 2 rises then falls in scenarios 3 and 4 and falls in scenario 5 note that scenarios 1 to 3 adopted a set of αl values that differed to those used in scenarios 4 and 5 see table 1 and yet the rising then falling trend in stoe was nevertheless observed in both scenarios 3 and 4 despite the relationship between stip and dispersivity being rather complex whenever negative value of stip were obtained i e the tip shifted landward the value of stoe shows a downward trend with increasing αl albeit this behaviour is based on only three simulations and is difficult to conceptualise in terms of physical causes 3 1 2 width of the mixing zone the effect of dispersion on w tip and w toe for each scenario is illustrated in fig 6 it is evident that w tip and w toe respond differently to changes in dispersivity while an increase in dispersivity widens w toe w tip shows a surprising non monotonic relationship with dispersivity even though both w tip and w toe show asymptotic behaviour with increasing αl w tip reaches a maximum in scenarios 4 and 5 and subsequently a declining trend with increasing dispersivity is apparent also the maximum w tip value is reached at lower dispersivity values as the k kz contrast increases i e scenario 5 reaches the maximum w tip at a lower dispersivity value than that of scenario 4 for all but the lowest k kz contrast scenario 1 w tip and w toe differ the most under lower dispersivity and appear to converge on similar values at higher dispersivity values changes to the contrast in k and kz play a significant role in the patterns of interface widening for example stronger k kz contrasts i e increasing from scenarios 1 to 5 lead to wider interfaces despite otherwise the same dispersivity values being adopted as evident in higher values of both w tip and w toe compare fig 6a to 6c and 6d to 6e specifically w tip and w toe were 255 and 98 larger respectively in scenario 3 relative to scenario 1 and were 22 and 24 larger respectively in scenario 5 relative to scenario 4 averaged across the simulations of each scenario also w toe is much lower than w tip at low values of αl in the higher k kz scenarios i e scenarios 3 to 5 whereas in scenario 1 w tip and w toe are much closer for all values of αl additionally w tip exceeds w toe in all simulations except for higher values of αl in scenarios 1 and 2 these results highlight the strong dispersive effect that is imposed by the aquifer aquitard boundary which depending on the contrast between k and kz may cause more interface widening at the tip than the effect of varying the dispersivity values within reasonable limits 3 1 3 change in freshwater discharge to the sea the effect of dispersion on δqf positive values indicate that numerical fluxes exceed analytical fluxes is shown in fig 7 monotonic relationships between δqf and dispersion were obtained whereby an increase in δqf represents an increase in qfn because qf is dispersion independent fig 7 shows asymptotic behaviour for all cases except scenario 1 in that for higher dispersivity values i e αl h is greater than about 0 4 δqf varies little with changes to dispersivity the slope of the scenario 1 curve gradually reduce with αl h and therefore we expect that with higher values of αl h asymptotic behaviour is likely although testing this would require the use of unrealistic αl values the ratio k kz does not correlate to δqf demonstrated by the mixed order of scenarios with respect to δqf fig 7 the very small negative δqf value i e 0 13 at the start of the scenario 2 curve indicating that q f exceeds qfn is a numerical artefact we simulated scenario 2 with no dispersion i e αl 0 in seawat to explore the role of numerical aspects e g artificial numerical dispersion truncation error etc in this initial negative value of δqf the resulting non dispersive qfn value was 2 96 m3 d compared to qf 2 97 m3 day from the analytical solution this slight difference results in the small negative value for δqf in scenario 2 αl h 0 01 using the non dispersive qfn value as a substitute for qf i e to allow the calculation of δqf whereby small numerical nuances are consistent between simulations in eq 1 δqf for αl h 0 01 would be 0 42 instead of 0 13 thus we conclude that qfn increases consistently with dispersion across all scenarios 3 1 4 seawater circulation fig 8 depicts the relationship between sc and dispersion defined in terms of αt h for ease of comparison to the onshore aquifer results of smith 2004 for each scenario the labelled values of µ in fig 8 are from the analytical solution the results show that as dispersivity increases sc increases monotonically this does not accord with the non monotonic relationship observed for onshore aquifers by smith 2004 who adopted similar ranges of αl h and αt h to those of the current study fig 8 also indicates that sc depends on µ showing an inverse correlation between the two variables it is noteworthy that in scenario 1 seawater moved within several circulation cells while other scenarios involved only a single seawater circulation cell the result shown in fig 8 is based on the rate of seawater flux passing through the model domain and therefore the fluxes of any closed seawater recirculation bodies are not included in the values given for seawater circulation while only the analytically derived µ is labelled in fig 8 for simplicity the same relationship between µ and sc occurs when µ is estimated numerically i e qfn is used instead of qf to calculate µ values of numerically derived µ as dispersion increases are given in the discussion section 3 1 5 revisiting mixed convection theory for dispersive conditions both forms of the rayleigh number raδ and ra wooding et al 1997 smith and turner 2001 were determined from the numerical modelling results in accordance with the position at which the 0 5 isochlor crosses the top of the aquifer the relationships between raδ and αl h and ra and αl h are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively both rayleigh variants show inverse relationships with dispersion however the effect of the k kz contrast on relationships between raδ and ra and αl h differ that is while raδ decreases as the k kz contrast increases the opposite trend arises for ra whereas solórzano rivas and werner 2018 obtained a single value of raδ for multiple non dispersive situations figs 9 and 10 indicate that unique values of raδ and ra are not forthcoming from our dispersive simulations in fig 9 the different curves tend to converge with increasing values of the rayleigh number and as αl h decreases while at high values of αl h there is significant spread in raδ we also estimated raδ for scenarios 2 and 4 when αl 0 m obtaining values of 1 8 and 2 respectively this is in essence consistent with the finding of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who reported a value of raδ of around 2 for sharp interface problems the relationships depicted in fig 10 indicate that a single value of ra for characterising mixed convective processes in subsea aquifers is not easily recognisable from our results 3 2 effect of the seafloor boundary condition table 3 compares output variables from models adopting one of the two different options for the solute boundary conditions of the seafloor i e boundary conditions a and b see section 2 2 for brevity only the results from four simulations are presented in table 3 namely scenario 2 with αl values of 0 m and 1 m and scenario 4 with αl values of 0 m and 20 m simulations with αl 0 m are included to extend the analysis of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who adopted only boundary condition type a in their non dispersive numerical modelling the negative sign in the discrepancy values of table 3 shows that sc and δqf values decrease when boundary condition b is used whereas the tip and toe tend to increase when boundary condition b is used instead of a the decrease in sc by using boundary condition b is in agreement with the findings of smith 2004 in his evaluation of seawater circulation in onshore aquifer settings discrepancies in xtip xtoe w tip w toe and sc are not higher than 1 7 whereas δqf is modified significantly i e the discrepancy equals 14 in scenario 2 with αl 1 m 4 discussion 4 1 dispersion effects on offshore interfaces the different responses of the tip and toe to dispersion as illustrated in fig 5 are associated with changes in the freshwater seawater interface slope for example the interface tends to become steeper i e the horizontal separation between and toe and tip is reduced as dispersivity increases steepening of the interface with increased dispersivity has been observed previously in onshore aquifers e g shoemaker 2004 abarca et al 2007 kerrou and renard 2010 and therefore the same phenomenon in offshore aquifers is somewhat intuitive the steepening of the interface as dispersivity increases is linked to the loss in density gradient caused by enhanced mixing between freshwater and seawater as explained by kerrou and renard 2010 from their analysis of heterogeneity effects on seawater intrusion in onshore aquifers they report rotation steepening of the interface as dispersivity as a surrogate for heterogeneity increases leading to seaward movement of the toe in the situation of offshore aquifers rotation of the interface similarly causes seaward movement of the toe but there is an accompanying landward movement of the tip in our results unlike the monotonic behaviour of xtoe non monotonic relationships in xtip and w tip with dispersion are apparent the complex behaviour of xtip is attributable to the multi faceted influence of dispersion on the interface that is interface rotation occurs as the density effect weakens causing the tip to move landward as discussed above while the same weakening of density effects i e relative to dispersion tends to push the interface seaward the latter arises because the buoyancy force of the sea is effectively reduced at least relative to other forces the two effects interface rotation and seaward shift act on the tip in opposite directions and respond differently to dispersivity changes leading to the multi directional behaviour of xtip observed in fig 5c 5d and 5e the two factors interface rotation and seaward shift accompanying enhanced dispersivity both cause seaward movement of the toe leading to the disparate behaviour of xtoe and xtip the observed behaviour of w tip is dependent not only on dispersivity but also on the k kz contrast which also brings about enhanced mixing as observed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 and others e g frind 1982 lu et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016 both frind 1982 and solórzano rivas and werner 2018 found that the k kz contrast caused enhanced mixing even though they adopted non dispersive solute transport parameters in their numerical simulations dispersivity values and the effect of the k kz contrast are interrelated because as the interface becomes steeper the flow lines tend to also steepen thereby changing the incident angle of flow at the aquifer aquitard interface this in turn influences the dispersive effect of refraction across the aquifer aquitard interface sebben and werner 2016 creating complex relationships between w tip dispersivity and the k kz contrast the lower refractive effect under steeper angles at the aquifer aquitard interface is the most likely cause of the unintuitive reduction in w tip as the dispersivity increase in scenarios 4 and 5 the exact cause of this phenomenon remains an area of continuing research effort nevertheless the important role of the k kz contrast in interface widening adds to the known dispersive phenomena of offshore coastal aquifers the role of the k kz contrast in the widening of the toe w toe is difficult to ascertain and appears much smaller relative to the role of dispersion in controlling w toe michael et al 2016 also found complex relationships between mixing zone extent and the level of heterogeneity michael et al 2016 investigated the influence of geologic heterogeneity on offshore aquifers using three levels of horizontal geologic continuity levels of heterogeneity they compared heterogeneous and homogeneous representations of offshore aquifers however the same dispersivity was adopted in both cases hence the effect of dispersion on mixing and other interface properties is difficult to ascertain since dispersivity surrogates for heterogeneity in numerical models nevertheless they found in the heterogeneous numerical solutions that there is a non monotonic relationship between the level of heterogeneity i e low medium and high and the area of the mixing zone if we consider that by increasing dispersivity in our numerical models we simulate a higher level of local scale heterogeneity the interface behaviour observed in our study is generally consistent with that observed by michael et al 2016 given that empirical corrections to adjust sharp interface estimates of interface extent to account for dispersion effects have been found for onshore situations e g pool and carrera 2011 werner 2017a we sought similar types of correction factors for offshore aquifer situations however the more complex interrelationships among the different factors controlling offshore freshwater extent as described herein confounded our attempts namely we could not find a correlation that applied to all five scenarios therefore dispersive correction factors for modifying sharp interface estimates of offshore freshwater extent remain unavailable 4 2 dispersion effects on subsea fluxes 4 2 1 subsea fresh groundwater discharge while freshwater flux changes i e δqf increases with dispersion in all scenarios fig 7 the causal factors leading to differences in δqf between scenarios have proven difficult to characterise from the results obtained in our investigation for example δqf values are largest in scenario 5 and smallest in scenario 2 and the relative ranking of δqf curves e g fig 7 are not correlated to any of the parameter combinations e g µ lf βhl h k kz used to explain other phenomenon δqf values in scenario 2 are at least 5 times smaller than in any of the other scenarios the distinguishing features of scenario 2 relative to other scenarios is that cross section a i e the smaller of the two cross sections used is adopted and the analytical sharp interface solution for scenario 2 falls into the category of analytical case ii i e the toe is offshore fig 5 the analytical solutions for scenarios 1 3 and 5 produce analytical case i situations while scenario 4 as with scenario 2 is an analytical case ii situation as scenario 4 produces the second lowest values of δqf it appears that the type of analytical case may play an important role in the response of freshwater discharge to the level of dispersion additionally scenario 1 shows the steepest δqf gradient with respect to dispersion in fig 7 this scenario is the only one where all numerical simulation results but one are onshore i e consistent with the definition of analytical case i other scenarios in which the analytical solution produces analytical case i situations have numerical dispersive interface locations that are offshore i e consistent with the definition of analytical case ii thus in a way scenario 1 remains within the definition of analytical case i whereas scenarios 3 where half of the dispersive interfaces are offshore see fig 5 and 5 where all dispersive interfaces are offshore see fig 5 shift from analytical case i to ii within the simulations undertaken within these scenarios it would seem from this additional evidence that the analytical case type is related to the behaviour of δqf in response to changes to dispersivity whereby analytical case i creates a stronger δqf response to dispersivity changes the results given in fig 7 i e δqf increases with dispersion indicate that offshore fresh groundwater discharge will be larger in aquifers with greater heterogeneity if it is presumed that dispersivity typically represents the unknown heterogeneity of the porous medium at microscopic to local scales in solute transport modelling the same effect is unlikely to arise in density independent solute transport problems in which the dispersiveness of transport and the magnitude of flow are not coupled through water density variations in contrast to the solute concentration dependent velocity field of seawater intrusion problems e g volker and rushton 1982 4 2 2 seawater circulation rates the relationship between µ and sc shown in fig 8 helps to elucidate the influencing factors driving sc in offshore aquifers smith 2004 proposed the mixed convection ratio v khδ qf to describe the potential for seawater circulation given a known rate of freshwater discharge towards the sea according to smith 2004 v relates the characteristic free convection velocity k δ n e to the characteristic forced convection velocity q f h n e whereby large values of v indicate that buoyancy forces are more dominant relative to advective forces badaruddin et al 2017 used the inverse of v as the mixed convection ratio in their analysis of active seawater intrusion v is correlated to both µ and lf see section 2 1 i e μ l f h v table 4 shows the values of v sc and lf for the different dispersion values used in each scenario see table 1 for scenario definitions table 4 demonstrates that for a given scenario i e in which lf and h are maintained constant and only dispersivity varies µ is inversely proportional to v and directly related to sc however the same relationship does not exist among the different scenarios where lf and h vary where the relationship of sc with μ is inversely correlated and sc is non monotonic with v these results differ from those reported for onshore settings e g smith 2004 where a monotonic relationship between sc and v was found for example while scenario 3 has higher v values i e 8 039 than scenario 1 i e 6 847 scenario 1 has the highest sc value see table 4 despite the same dispersivity values e g αt h 0 1 adopted in both scenarios therefore while a higher sc would be expected for higher values of v in onshore aquifers the same behaviour may not arise in offshore aquifers this is because in offshore aquifers the k kz contrast affecting lf see section 2 1 is a significant factor in mixing zone and therefore sc trends fig 8 shows a monotonic relationship between sc and dispersion in all scenarios that is the threshold of dispersivity proposed by smith 2004 for onshore aquifers i e sc reduces when αt h 0 025 that arises as a consequence of the non monotonic sc dispersion relationship was not observed the sc dispersion relationship for offshore aquifers may become non monotonic at excessively high values of αt h but we found no reduction in sc for αt h up to values of 0 1 values of αt h 0 1 likely represent physically unrealistic dispersion values gelhar et al 1992 previous studies have identified that seawater circulation rates in onshore aquifers are mainly dependent on dispersion e g smith 2004 kerrou and renard 2010 and on qfn e g pool et al 2011 in this study we have identified that seawater circulation rates in offshore settings depend on the interrelation of qfn dispersion and the k kz contrast additionally michael et al 2016 found that multiple circulation cells arose in their heterogeneous models they concluded that these circulation cells led to seawater circulation rates that would otherwise be less in homogeneous models implying that homogeneous models are unlikely to create multiple circulation cells however we found multiple circulation cells in a selection of our simulations e g in all simulations of scenario 1 which adds to the findings of michael et al 2016 4 3 mixed convection analysis and boundary condition effects our mixed convection analysis of alternative rayleigh number formulations i e raδ and ra was unable to find a critical rayleigh number that would reliably predict the transition between freshwater and seawater at the top of the aquifer using non zero dispersion parameters this is in contradiction to the sharp interface analysis of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 that is the results depicted in fig 9 indicate that the value of raδ equal to 2 proposed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for sharp interface conditions does not apply in dispersive situations nonetheless raδ approximately equal to 2 was obtained consistently in our non dispersive simulations in agreement with solórzano rivas and werner 2018 the decrease in rayleigh numbers i e raδ and ra as dispersivity increases demonstrates that buoyancy forces are dissipated relative to advective forces by dispersive mechanisms this is consistent with the steepening of the interface slope and the generally seaward movement of the interface at least in terms of the toe as dispersivity increases as illustrated in fig 5 smith 2004 found that the type of concentration boundary condition had an important effect on onshore aquifers namely seawater circulation rates may be up to 1 6 times higher if the mass flux across the seafloor boundary depends on the ambient concentration instead of a constant concentration that produces accumulation of salt beneath the boundary in our study none of the simulated models using the constant concentration condition produced unphysical accumulation of salt in the aquitard in areas where freshwater discharges to the seafloor this is most likely a consequence of the reduced dispersivity applied to the aquitard whereas smith 2004 adopted uniform dispersion parameters in his cases the choice of concentration boundary condition representing the seafloor had little impact on the interface location the width of mixing zones and the seawater circulation rates whereas a significant boundary condition effect was observed in terms of freshwater fluxes to the sea see table 3 the finding that the type of seafloor boundary condition affects freshwater discharge to the sea adds to smith s 2004 conclusions about boundary condition effects of seawater circulation smith 2004 used specified flux conditions at the onshore boundary whereas in this study we used specified head conditions which allowed for the influence of boundary conditions and other factors on freshwater discharge to be evaluated for the case when non dispersive solute transport parameters were adopted the interface toe location was hardly influenced i e up to 2 1 see table 3 by the choice of offshore solute boundary condition therefore the results of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 results are not dependent on their choice of boundary condition i e flow direction dependent saltlux 5 conclusions the present study determined the effect of dispersion on the interface of subsea aquifers that contain fresh and saline groundwater dispersive numerical simulations of offshore groundwater flow have shown that the tip and toe respond differently to changes in dispersion increasing dispersivity resulted in more seaward toe positions in a similar manner to that observed in the more widely studied onshore case conversely the effect of dispersion on the tip location cannot be easily anticipated because of the non monotonic relationship between dispersivity and xtip surprisingly w tip follows a non monotonic relationship with dispersion in a similar fashion to xtip such that a maximum value is reached with increasing dispersivity after which w tip decreases as dispersivity increases this counterintuitive narrowing of the interface at the tip with dispersivity is caused by the dispersive effect of refraction across the aquifer aquitard interface specifically refractive dispersion strengthens when the incident angle is higher or less steep which occurs when the aquifer dispersion parameters are lower given our inland boundary condition i e specified head it has been possible to investigate the dispersion effect on fresh groundwater discharge towards the sea i e qfn finding that larger dispersivity values cause increased qfn considering that dispersivity surrogates for heterogeneity this indicates that heterogeneity plays an important role in fresh groundwater flow rates in density coupled systems the results also show that qfn is related to the type of analytical case i e the four tip toe situations defined by bakker 2006 whereby greater changes in qfn occur when dispersivity is increased if the interface is classified within the analytical case i i e the toe is onshore seawater circulation rates show a monotonic relationship with dispersion differing from the non monotonic relationship observed in onshore aquifers by smith 2004 this finding indicates that the critical dispersion value whereby the influence of buoyancy forces on seawater circulation rates diminishes differs from that proposed by smith 2004 for onshore settings this is mainly due to the influence of the aquifer aquitard interface on dispersion effects affecting sc this study adds to the current body of knowledge on seawater circulation in coastal aquifers by demonstrating that sc in offshore settings is correlated to the k kz contrast in addition to the sc parameter dependencies identified in onshore coastal aquifer studies other factors investigated in this study including the evaluation of mixed convective processes demonstrate that the raδ proposed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for the sharp interface simplification in offshore aquifers does not apply in dispersive conditions this is because dispersion effects reduce the influence of buoyancy forces driven by density gradients thereby lowering raδ as dispersivity increases additionally it has been shown that the type of concentration boundary in subsea aquifers for model set ups similar to ours likely have negligible effect on salinity distributions and seawater circulation rates but may impact significantly the estimations of freshwater flow towards the sea our attempts to find a dispersive correction factor to sharp interface estimates that can be applied to all five scenarios were not successful further efforts may need to consider seeking dispersive correction factors for individual analytical case more generally the results presented in this analysis show that the response to dispersion of onshore aquifers do not necessarily apply to offshore aquifers primarily due to the influence of the aquifer aquitard boundary which contributes significantly to the interplay between dispersive buoyancy and advective forces that is refraction at the aquifer aquitard boundary play a major role in controlling the extent of freshwater and freshwater seawater mixing in the offshore aquifer acknowledgments s

614,recent recognition of the widespread occurrence of freshwater beneath the ocean has renewed interest in approaches to understand and predict its extent the most straightforward methodologies are based on the sharp interface approximation which neglects dispersive mechanisms the understanding of dispersion effects on freshwater extents in coastal aquifers is based almost entirely on onshore aquifer situations this study explores dispersion in offshore coastal aquifers in terms of the steady state freshwater extent seawater circulation and freshwater discharge through numerical experimentation results show that increasing dispersion causes a seaward shift in the interface toe location as expected whereas the interface tip shows a non monotonic relationship with dispersion that depends on the contrast between aquifer and aquitard hydraulic conductivities higher dispersion leads to enhanced seawater recirculation rates and freshwater discharge as opposed to non monotonic relationships obtained previously for onshore aquifers the mixing zone at the toe widens as dispersion increases similar to onshore cases whereas the mixing zone at the tip has a surprisingly non monotonic relationship with dispersion the dispersion relationships revealed in this study can be explained by counteractions between dispersion density and advective forces and refraction across the aquifer aquitard interface which in combination produce offshore aquifer behaviour that differs in some ways to the manner in which onshore aquifers respond to dispersive processes consequently previous empirical corrections to sharp interface methods to account for dispersive effects applied to onshore coastal aquifers are ineffective in their application to offshore settings keywords

zs depth of the sea at the bottom of the aquifer 1 introduction the discovery of widespread fresh groundwater in continental shelves e g post et al 2013 has promoted a renewed interest in methods to quantify the extent of these resources the development of simplified methodologies is particularly relevant to subsea freshwater estimation because offshore data are usually scarce and rapid approximations are critical first steps in recognising the potential for offshore freshwater reserves for example solórzano rivas and werner 2018 employed simplified conceptual models of offshore aquifers in their numerical modelling study of subsea freshwater extents and proposed an approximate method for simulating the offshore sea boundary condition using the general head boundary package of seawat langevin et al 2008 they recommended revision of analytical solutions to the extent of offshore fresh groundwater developed by bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 to allow for alternative salinity assumptions in the offshore aquitard werner and robinson 2018 subsequently developed this revision and knight et al 2018 applied it to the rapid assessment of numerous offshore aquifers from around the world the above analytical methods are based on assumptions that there is no mixing between freshwater and seawater i e a sharp interface and that seawater is stagnant rather than the circulating behaviour that is found in onshore coastal aquifer settings e g smith 2004 studies have shown that the seawater extent in coastal aquifers is overestimated by sharp interface methods e g cooper 1959 volker and rushton 1982 however sharp interface methods overestimate the extent of freshwater lenses for variable density situations in riverine riparian zones werner 2017a and therefore neglecting dispersion may lead to over or underestimation of fresh groundwater bodies in variable density systems the extent of seawater in coastal aquifers is commonly quantified by the interface toe location i e where the interface intercepts the bottom of the aquifer e g volker and rushton 1982 werner and simmons 2009 while the toe location typically indicates the most landward advancement of seawater at least in homogeneous aquifers the tip location i e where the interface intercepts the top of the aquifer usually reflects the maximum offshore extent of freshwater penetration this is an important additional consideration in studies concerned with the storage of freshwater beneath the seafloor the best known and studied cases of terrestrial discharge into the sea occur within the intertidal zone e g reilly and goodman 1985 bear et al 1999 thereby presuming that the tip is effectively connected to or near to the shoreline consequently the current understanding of the key factors in particular the role of dispersion influencing the tip position and by association the offshore extent of freshwater is somewhat deficient although extensive research has been carried out to assess the impact of neglecting dispersion in sharp interface models of onshore aquifers e g cooper 1959 pool and carrera 2011 llopis albert and pulido velazquez 2014 werner 2017b only hill 1988 has considered the effect of dispersion on the distribution of subsea freshwater hill 1988 compared sharp interface and dispersive interface solutions to the freshwater seawater distribution in a case study investigation of a layered offshore aquifer setting cape may county new jersey hill 1988 evaluated the freshwater extent in three aquifers with intervening aquitards an unconfined aquifer overlying two semi confined aquifers extending offshore some 22 km hill 1988 compared essaid s 1986 sharp interface numerical solution to dispersive numerical results for the stratified aquifer system the results showed that the tip and toe of the dispersive mixing zone were considerably more seaward than the sharp interface solution in the upper and lowermost aquifers whereas in the middle aquifer the sharp interface occurred within the numerical mixing zone albeit differing in slope relative to the dispersive mixing zone hill 1988 attributed the sharp dispersive interface mismatch within the upper and lowermost aquifers to differences in inter aquifer freshwater flow exchange between the sharp interface and dispersive methods that is while the dispersive solution treated inter aquifer exchange using standard flow and transport equations essaid s 1986 solution required special treatment of upward freshwater leakage where it flowed into saltwater in the overlying aquifer hill 1988 found that essaid s 1986 method caused overestimation of the seawater extent as mehdizadeh et al 2014 later confirmed hill 1988 also reported that dispersive results better matched sharp interface estimates with lower transverse dispersivity αt although supporting evidence for this outcome was not presented given that hill s 1988 analysis of offshore dispersive effects was confounded by essaid s 1986 assumption of inter aquifer freshwater exchange and the effect of dispersion was not systematically investigated a more thorough analysis of the role of dispersion on offshore salinity distributions including on both the toe and tip locations is warranted furthermore the influence of dispersion on estimates of freshwater discharge and on rates of seawater circulation in offshore aquifers should also be assessed in this regard this study is the first to investigate the effect of dispersion on freshwater discharge to and within offshore aquifers when inland boundary conditions are specified by fixed heads rather than fixed fluxes thus the main aim of this study is to explore the role of dispersion in influencing the key features of offshore freshwater seawater relationships including the characteristics of the freshwater seawater interface e g the tip and toe location and the mixing zone width rates of freshwater discharge and seawater circulation rates intentionally simplified offshore aquifer settings are considered in the form of cross sectional models of uniform geometry and homogeneous isotropic hydraulic properties this allows for comparison to the werner and robinson 2018 solution for the sharp interface position and assists in elucidating generalised behaviour that would otherwise be challenging to discern using more complicated situations we extend the research of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who studied steady state salinity distributions in subsea aquifer aquitard systems without accounting for dispersion i e based on the sharp interface assumption the dispersion independent form of the boundary rayleigh number considered by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 is revisited for dispersive situations additionally the study of largely onshore seawater recirculation by smith 2004 is re examined for offshore conditions 2 methods 2 1 analytical solution the werner and robinson 2018 solution is used here to provide exact distributions of the offshore freshwater seawater interface under steady state sharp interface conditions the conceptual model used by werner and robinson 2018 and others e g bakker 2006 bakker et al 2017 solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for the offshore continuation of continental fresh groundwater is illustrated in fig 1 this two dimensional cross sectional conceptual model is based on the assumption of one dimensional flow i e the dupuit approximation within an offshore aquifer that is homogeneous and isotropic freshwater and seawater are immiscible and separated by a sharp interface solórzano rivas and werner 2018 compared non dispersive numerical solutions against the bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 analytical solutions demonstrating that the analytical solution overestimated the extent of offshore fresh groundwater at the top of the aquifer due to the presumption by bakker 2006 that the offshore aquitard was filled entirely with seawater solórzano rivas and werner 2018 concluded that if the aquitard in areas overlying fresh groundwater is assumed to contain freshwater instead of seawater the analytical solution would give better results based on solórzano rivas and werner 2018 findings werner and robinson 2018 developed a solution that allows the aquitard salinity to be specified confirming that when freshwater is assumed in the aquitard the analytical solution and the non dispersive numerical solution are in better agreement for example werner and robinson 2018 report an improvement in the analytically derived tip location from an average discrepancy of 87 with the non dispersive numerical results when adopting seawater in the aquitard to only 2 when the salinity was changed to that of freshwater some of the input parameters to apply the werner and robinson 2018 solution are illustrated in fig 2 the symbols in fig 2 are as follows h is the thickness of the aquifer l h1 is the thickness of the aquitard l hs is the depth of the sea at the top of the aquitard l zs is the depth of the sea at the bottom of the aquifer l qf is the freshwater flow per unit length of coastline into the offshore aquifer l2 t ho is the onshore hydraulic head l lc is the length of the onshore confined aquifer l and ls is the length of the offshore semi confined aquifer l the werner and robinson 2018 solution has the flexibility of specifying qf or ho at the onshore boundary i e blue line in fig 2 here we adopted the option of specifying ho which is more practical given the tendency to measure and characterise groundwater heads rather than fluxes qf can be calculated by applying darcy s law in the onshore section in conjunction with knowledge of the head at the toe if the toe is onshore or obtaining the head at the shoreline through application of werner and robinson s 2018 solution if the toe is offshore werner and robinson 2018 introduced a dimensionless parameter β that defines the uniform groundwater salinity within the aquitard in the region where freshwater occurs in the aquifer it can be specified within the range of 0 to 1 whereby a value of 0 indicates that the aquitard contains seawater i e the assumption of bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 and 1 indicates that the aquitard contains freshwater which accords with the recommendation of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 werner and robinson 2018 define three key parameters to solve for the offshore interface distribution as 1 the dimensionless discharge in the confined section i e onshore aquifer μ qflf kh 2δ where lf is the leakage factor l defined by l f k h h l k z k is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity l t 1 kz is the aquitard vertical hydraulic conductivity l t 1 δ is the dimensionless density difference between freshwater ρf m l 3 and seawater ρs m l 3 given by ρ s ρ f ρ f 2 βhl h and 3 the dimensionless offshore aquitard length λ s ls lf other variables have been defined earlier in the paper the reader is referred to werner and robinson 2018 for a complete description of the mathematical solution bakker 2006 divided the original analytical solution into four interface cases which werner and robinson 2018 follow and which depend on the toe and tip position relative to the shoreline cases i and iii have an onshore toe and in cases ii and iv the toe is offshore the tip position is landward of the vertical sea boundary in cases i and ii and is attached to the offshore limit of the aquifer e g the edge of the continental shelf in cases iii and iv the remainder of the text designates these cases as analytical cases i to iv to distinguish them from the numerical model cases used in this study fig 3 shows contours of analytically derived dimensionless toe location xt i e toe location relative to the shoreline xtoe divided by lf where negative and positive values indicate onshore and offshore toe locations respectively as a function of µ and λs the range 2 0 xt 1 5 is shown red lines are the boundaries separating each analytical case wherein the line labelled xt 0 identifies the conditions under which the toe is coincident with the shoreline the x axis is truncated at λs 3 5 because higher values of λs do not affect the salinity distribution in the subsea aquifer for analytical cases i and ii that is offshore aquifers longer than λs 3 5 have the same toe location for the values of µ used in fig 3 the contours in fig 3 provide important information about the toe position in onshore offshore aquifer settings that is relevant to the current research objectives for example the contours of xt are nearly vertical in parts of analytical case iv tip connected to the offshore boundary and the toe is offshore indicating low sensitivity of xt to changes in freshwater discharge µ additionally analytical cases i and ii are represented by horizontal xt contours highlighting that those situations are independent of the dimensionless offshore length λs according to knight et al 2018 published situations of significant subsea fresh groundwater predominantly involve tips that are landward of the offshore aquifer limit at least under modern day conditions and therefore analytical cases i and ii are likely the most common for that reason and considering also that the tip can vary in its location in analytical cases i and ii thereby clearly differentiating our offshore aquifer analysis from onshore situations where the tip is relatively immobile attached to the coastline we focus on analytical cases i and ii in this investigation that is both the tip and toe potentially vary in response to parameter changes in our analysis 2 2 numerical methodology the finite difference numerical code seawat version 4 langevin et al 2008 was used to simulate dispersive cases of subsea freshwater groundwater seawat combines modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to solve the equations that describe variable density flow and solute transport in porous media the governing equations and methodology used by seawat are omitted here for brevity and the reader is referred to the user manual langevin et al 2008 for details of the code numerical experiments were based on the conceptual model illustrated in fig 2 and to some degree on cases developed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 except with the incorporation of dispersion parameters steady state salinity distributions were obtained for various offshore aquifer situations by running seawat in transient mode until the models converged on steady state conditions two different geometries are presented in this study a small domain to allow for simulation using a fine grid cross section a and a more realistic field scale domain cross section b that required coarser discretisation cross section a contains 111 layers and 1875 columns total dimension of 250 05 m long by 11 1 m deep uniform vertical discretisation δz of 0 1 m was used throughout the model domain while the horizontal discretisation δx varies from 0 1 m near the seaward boundary up to 10 m at the landward boundary cross section b 2508 m long by 55 5 m deep comprises 111 layers and 1137 columns with δx 2 m at the seaward boundary gradually increasing to 10 m at the landward boundary and a constant δz of 0 5 m the grid sizes of both cross sections were designed such that interfaces occurred in the regions of finest discretisation i e 0 1 m by 0 1 m in cross section a and 2 m by 0 5 m in cross section b we tested the effect of grid discretisation in cross section a for example a finer grid was tested in cross section a of 0 05 m by 0 05 m changes in salinity distributions attributable to the grid resolution were up to 2 i e freshwater zone was 2 larger using a finer grid estimated by averaging the differences in tip and toe locations indicating that model results are within reasonable bounds of grid dependency in any case the grid resolutions used in this study are at the limit of refinement in the context of model runtimes which were up to 178 3 h using an intel xeon cpu with specifications e5 1650 v4 3 60 ghz and 32 gb ram following the model layout of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 the topmost grid layer in the offshore portion simulates the effect of the ocean using a high value for k i e 10 000 m d and the subsequent ten layers simulate the desired aquitard thickness the onshore boundary blue line in fig 2 is a specified head with concentration conditions equal to freshwater i e zero concentration along the two sea boundaries red lines in fig 2 seawater hydrostatic heads were assigned the influence of the ocean on salinities at the aquifer ocean interface was simulated as follows a the vertical sea boundary represents the offshore limit of the aquifer and therefore the concentration condition depends on the flow direction such that discharge to the sea occurs at the ambient groundwater concentration whereas seawater concentration was assigned to any inflowing water b the horizontal sea boundary represents seawater immediately above the seafloor and therefore boundary cells were assigned constant seawater concentration presuming that freshwater discharge does not cause freshening of the sea smith 2004 recommends precaution in using type b boundary conditions because salt may accumulate at the boundary in an unrealistic manner a similar issue was recognised in the original henry problem as reported by segol et al 1975 and others following smith s 2004 recommendation we tested both approaches to the assignment of boundary conditions i e a and b described above to the horizontal seafloor results are reported for boundary condition b along the seafloor and only a selection of results obtained using boundary condition a are given for brevity as neither boundary condition accurately represents the physical mixing of freshwater and seawater within and immediately above the seafloor an argument can be made for one choice over the other the effect of seafloor boundary condition choice is reported in section 3 2 five offshore aquifer scenarios termed scenarios 1 to 5 were used to explore dispersion effects on the distribution of subsea fresh groundwater cross section a was used for scenarios 1 to 3 and cross section b for scenarios 4 and 5 each scenario adopted a range of dispersion parameters creating 40 simulations in total table 1 defines the parameter sets for each scenario parameters were selected to obtain interfaces that remained sufficiently distant from the seaward and landward model limits partly to avoid boundary effects the aquifer k aquitard kz contrast known to be a key controlling factor of subsea freshwater extent increased from 1 20 in scenario 1 to 1 1600 in scenario 5 adopted values of k 10 to 40 m d and kz 0 025 to 0 5 m d are generally within the range of typical field values for subsea aquifers e g 0 86 to 90 m d knight et al 2018 and aquitards 10 6 to 0 1 m d knight et al 2018 respectively with the exception being the relatively high kz value of 0 5 m d adopted for scenarios 1 and 2 we chose this relatively high value of kz so that small aquifer k aquitard kz contrasts i e 20 1 and 50 1 scenarios 1 and 2 respectively and near shore tip locations were included in the range of conditions otherwise parameters were derived from a review of other coastal aquifer modelling studies e g kooi and groen 2001 smith 2004 werner 2017a 2017b solórzano rivas and werner 2018 the dimensionless variables μ and lf used in this study allow for comparison with field conditions as reported by knight et al 2018 values of μ used in scenarios 1 to 5 are 0 19 1 06 0 52 0 89 and 0 69 respectively and the corresponding lf values are 14 m 22 m 45 m 500 m and 630 m a wide range of field conditions are observed in the data of knight et al 2018 for which μ values vary between 0 01 and 16 and lf values range from 140 m to 770 m the values of μ used in all five scenarios are therefore relatively low albeit they fall within the range for realistic situations lf values from scenarios 1 to 3 are below the lower limit of knight et al 2018 cases whereas lf values for scenarios 4 and 5 are within the range of real world cases it is well established that dispersion in models represents the largely unknown heterogeneity in the subsurface and that its magnitude is proportional to the scale of the analysed domain e g gelhar et al 1992 bear and cheng 2010 zech et al 2015 here to test different values of dispersion parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl and transverse dispersivity αt were varied systematically within the aquifer the following criteria were considered the minimum value of αl was constrained by the recommended grid peclet number pex given by δx αl 2 zheng and bennett 2002 to reduce artificial oscillations in seawat s solution the maximum value of αl was set to approximately 1 10 of the offshore aquifer length e g gelhar et al 1992 bear and cheng 2010 given that flow near the mixing zone has a significant vertical component e g abarca et al 2007 the maximum value of αl was further limited to the thickness of the aquifer i e maximum αl h a constant dispersivity anisotropy ratio αl αt of 10 was adopted this is consistent with previous studies e g kooi and groen 2001 smith 2004 badaruddin et al 2017 werner 2017a in order to evaluate if seawater circulation rates in offshore aquifers show the same non monotonic relationship with dispersion as found by smith 2004 for onshore aquifers our dimensionless dispersion values e g αl h αt h were designed to cover the entire range used by smith 2004 within the limits described above for the aquitard each scenario used a single value for the longitudinal dispersivity αl1 0 05 m for all models adopting cross section a i e scenarios 1 to 3 and 0 25 m for models adopting cross section b i e scenarios 4 and 5 given that flow within the aquitard is predominantly vertical e g solórzano rivas and werner 2018 α l1 was set according to the pez δz αl1 2 restriction of zheng and bennett 2002 frind 1982 suggested that a normal contrast of dispersivity values between aquifer and aquitard is around three orders of magnitude i e αl α l1 1000 in this study given that αl varies and α l1 is constant the dispersivity contrast between aquifer and aquitard varies between one and three orders of magnitude for cross section a and between one and two orders of magnitude for cross section b the lowest aquifer aquitard dispersivity contrast used in this study was also adopted by huyakorn et al 1987 2 3 output variables the effects of dispersion on subsea aquifers were quantified in terms of the output variables described below and illustrated in fig 4 similar output variables have been used by others e g smith 2004 abarca et al 2007 badaruddin et al 2017 the tip penetration xtip and toe penetration xtoe are defined by the steady state location of the 0 5 isochlor at the top and bottom of the aquifer respectively measured from the shoreline i e onshore and offshore values of xtoe are negative and positive respectively fig 4 the dimensionless widths of the mixing zone at the aquifer top w tip and bottom w toe are defined as wtip h and wtoe h respectively where wtip and wtoe are the horizontal distances between the 0 05 and 0 95 isochlors at the top and bottom of the aquifer respectively a similar definition was used by badaruddin et al 2017 the onshore boundary was defined by ho while qf see fig 2 to the subsea aquifer was calculated rather than specified we use qf and qfn for the analytically derived and numerically derived freshwater discharge rates respectively qfn is compared to qf using 1 δ q f q f n q f q f 100 we expect that dispersion will influence the rate of seawater circulation given the findings of smith 2004 for onshore aquifers seawater circulation is induced by the entrainment of seawater in the freshwater discharge to the sea and requirements for balanced salt mass in the subsea aquifer under steady state conditions e g cooper 1959 smith 2004 studied the phenomenon of seawater circulation within a two dimensional cross sectional model of onshore freshwater discharge towards the sea and included a short offshore section of aquifer his conceptual model differs from ours in that there is not an intervening aquitard separating the submarine aquifer from the sea in smith s 2004 models the absence of an offshore aquitard leads to very little offshore fresh groundwater and rather the interface tip remains near to the shoreline for the purposes of analysing seawater recirculation patterns smith 2004 defined a dimensionless seawater flux sc as 2 s c q s q f n 100 where qs is the rate of seawater flow l t 2 from to the sea qs is made of two components namely seawater inflow through the horizontal seafloor qsf and through the vertical face of the continental shelf qsv 2 4 mixed convection analysis unstable buoyancy conditions in fluid motion arise when a denser fluid overlies a lighter one under certain circumstances this can give rise to the onset of downward moving plumes typically in the shape of fingers when unstable problems are governed by both forced convection i e due to hydraulic forces and free convection i e buoyancy or fluid density driven forces it is said to be a mixed convective flow regime e g simmons et al 2010 solórzano rivas and werner 2018 undertook a mixed convection analysis in subsea aquitards subject to upward freshwater flow towards the seafloor they used the boundary layer theory of wooding et al 1997 whereby a critical boundary rayleigh number raδ exists at which the buoyancy and dispersive forces are in equilibrium forming a stable solute layer beneath the boundary solórzano rivas and werner 2018 adopted for convenience a dispersion independent form of wooding et al 1997 raδ see below which allowed them to avoid the need to quantify artificial numerical dispersion within their zero dispersion seawat simulations 3 r a δ ρ s ρ f k z ρ f q z here qz is the darcy flux of vertical freshwater flow through the aquitard at the position where the 0 5 isochlor intercepts the base of the aquitard l t 1 a raδ of around 2 was obtained by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for the conditions leading to half seawater concentrations i e the 0 5 isochlor at the top of the offshore aquifer this value of raδ was considered a predictor of the transition between freshwater and seawater within the aquitard assuming predominantly vertical aquitard flow and low dispersion conditions we extend the rayleigh analysis of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 which focused on sharp interface solutions by studying mixed convective processes under varying degrees of dispersiveness that is values of qz where the 0 5 isochlor meets the aquifer top were obtained from modelling results and used in eq 3 to explore whether the critical value of raδ obtained for low dispersion conditions by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 applies under more realistic levels of dispersiveness the raδ analysis described above is relevant to the development of boundary salt layers within aquitard sediments whereas smith and turner 2001 proposed a modified rayleigh number ra to assess the forces that cause water from a saline estuary to sink into an underlying freshwater aquifer without an intervening aquitard in their case the groundwater beneath the estuary flows laterally that aspect of their conceptual model is comparable to ours except smith and turner 2001 did not consider the intervening aquitard figs 1 and 2 from numerical experimentation smith and turner 2001 concluded that the critical ra for the occurrence of saltwater below the estuary is approximately five they proposed the following rayleigh number formulation 4 r a k h n e q z α l ρ s ρ f ρ f u u here ne is the effective porosity and u u is the regional discharge ratio between the flow crossing the left hand and right hand boundaries i e allowing for asymmetric flow to the estuary respectively other parameters have been previously defined in order to apply the smith and turner 2001 formulation to the conceptual model shown in fig 2 qz is taken at the location of the 0 5 isochlor at the top of the aquifer see eq 4 as a substitute for their uniform discharge across the riverbed i e ud in the notation of smith and turner 2001 we also assign u u a value of one so that the problem is treated as symmetric 3 results 3 1 sensitivity to dispersion 3 1 1 tip and toe penetration fig 5 presents the steady state locations of the 0 5 isochlor from five scenarios see table 1 showing the variability that arises with changes in dispersivity the left column of graphs depicts the tip and toe location while the right column shows interface shapes numerical results are compared with the werner and robinson 2018 analytical solution which are the grey coloured symbols and lines hereafter we refer to the werner and robinson 2018 solution as the sharp interface or analytical solution the results show that dispersion has a major influence on the position of the 0 5 isochlor the left column graphs of fig 5 illustrate that xtoe has a monotonic relationship with dispersion indicated by xtoe increases i e seaward advance with larger dispersivity this is consistent with studies of the effects of dispersion on xtoe in onshore coastal aquifers e g volker and rushton 1982 the same general trend is observed for all k kz contrasts i e scenarios 1 to 5 the tip also moves seaward with increasing dispersivity monotonically in scenarios 1 and 2 however changes in xtip with varying dispersivity show a non monotonic relationship in scenarios 3 to 5 that is increasing dispersivity leads to more seaward xtip values until a maximum is reached and then xtip retreats towards the shoreline with increasing dispersivity therefore the trend in xtip arising from changes to dispersivity depends on the k kz contrast fig 5 also shows that xtoe is more responsive to changes in dispersivity compared to corresponding changes in xtip the largest k kz contrast e g 1600 1 in scenario 5 fig 5e and highest dispersivity values e g αl 50 m lead to xtip values that approach the sharp interface xtip position this is in contrast to the notion devised from studies of onshore coastal aquifers that dispersion creates more extensive freshwater bodies and smaller seawater wedges relative to sharp interface solutions instead the contraction of the offshore freshwater extent with increased dispersion is similar behaviour to that of riparian freshwater lenses werner and laattoe 2016 werner 2017a thus freshwater seawater interfaces of offshore aquifers show dispersive behaviour that is a mixture of that observed in onshore coastal aquifers and within terrestrial freshwater lenses the responses in the tip and toe to changes in dispersion were quantified through sensitivity analysis as presented in table 2 we report the traditional sensitivity e g robinson and werner 2017 given by s t o e δ x t o e α l x t o e δ α l and s t i p δ x t i p α l x t i p δ α l for the toe and tip respectively table 2 demonstrates that for all scenarios the toe is more sensitive to dispersion than the tip by around one to two orders of magnitude consistent with the graphical representation of results in fig 5 specifically the ratio of toe shift to tip shift i e δxtoe δxtip caused by changes in dispersivity on average is about 9 1 in our simulations there is some evidence of patterns in stoe behaviour with rising dispersivity and with increasing k kz contrast recalling that k kz increases from scenarios 1 to 5 table 1 albeit the change in αl from 1 to 2 5 m in scenarios 1 and 2 are anomalous to otherwise generalizable trends that is stoe rises with increasing dispersivity in scenarios 1 and 2 rises then falls in scenarios 3 and 4 and falls in scenario 5 note that scenarios 1 to 3 adopted a set of αl values that differed to those used in scenarios 4 and 5 see table 1 and yet the rising then falling trend in stoe was nevertheless observed in both scenarios 3 and 4 despite the relationship between stip and dispersivity being rather complex whenever negative value of stip were obtained i e the tip shifted landward the value of stoe shows a downward trend with increasing αl albeit this behaviour is based on only three simulations and is difficult to conceptualise in terms of physical causes 3 1 2 width of the mixing zone the effect of dispersion on w tip and w toe for each scenario is illustrated in fig 6 it is evident that w tip and w toe respond differently to changes in dispersivity while an increase in dispersivity widens w toe w tip shows a surprising non monotonic relationship with dispersivity even though both w tip and w toe show asymptotic behaviour with increasing αl w tip reaches a maximum in scenarios 4 and 5 and subsequently a declining trend with increasing dispersivity is apparent also the maximum w tip value is reached at lower dispersivity values as the k kz contrast increases i e scenario 5 reaches the maximum w tip at a lower dispersivity value than that of scenario 4 for all but the lowest k kz contrast scenario 1 w tip and w toe differ the most under lower dispersivity and appear to converge on similar values at higher dispersivity values changes to the contrast in k and kz play a significant role in the patterns of interface widening for example stronger k kz contrasts i e increasing from scenarios 1 to 5 lead to wider interfaces despite otherwise the same dispersivity values being adopted as evident in higher values of both w tip and w toe compare fig 6a to 6c and 6d to 6e specifically w tip and w toe were 255 and 98 larger respectively in scenario 3 relative to scenario 1 and were 22 and 24 larger respectively in scenario 5 relative to scenario 4 averaged across the simulations of each scenario also w toe is much lower than w tip at low values of αl in the higher k kz scenarios i e scenarios 3 to 5 whereas in scenario 1 w tip and w toe are much closer for all values of αl additionally w tip exceeds w toe in all simulations except for higher values of αl in scenarios 1 and 2 these results highlight the strong dispersive effect that is imposed by the aquifer aquitard boundary which depending on the contrast between k and kz may cause more interface widening at the tip than the effect of varying the dispersivity values within reasonable limits 3 1 3 change in freshwater discharge to the sea the effect of dispersion on δqf positive values indicate that numerical fluxes exceed analytical fluxes is shown in fig 7 monotonic relationships between δqf and dispersion were obtained whereby an increase in δqf represents an increase in qfn because qf is dispersion independent fig 7 shows asymptotic behaviour for all cases except scenario 1 in that for higher dispersivity values i e αl h is greater than about 0 4 δqf varies little with changes to dispersivity the slope of the scenario 1 curve gradually reduce with αl h and therefore we expect that with higher values of αl h asymptotic behaviour is likely although testing this would require the use of unrealistic αl values the ratio k kz does not correlate to δqf demonstrated by the mixed order of scenarios with respect to δqf fig 7 the very small negative δqf value i e 0 13 at the start of the scenario 2 curve indicating that q f exceeds qfn is a numerical artefact we simulated scenario 2 with no dispersion i e αl 0 in seawat to explore the role of numerical aspects e g artificial numerical dispersion truncation error etc in this initial negative value of δqf the resulting non dispersive qfn value was 2 96 m3 d compared to qf 2 97 m3 day from the analytical solution this slight difference results in the small negative value for δqf in scenario 2 αl h 0 01 using the non dispersive qfn value as a substitute for qf i e to allow the calculation of δqf whereby small numerical nuances are consistent between simulations in eq 1 δqf for αl h 0 01 would be 0 42 instead of 0 13 thus we conclude that qfn increases consistently with dispersion across all scenarios 3 1 4 seawater circulation fig 8 depicts the relationship between sc and dispersion defined in terms of αt h for ease of comparison to the onshore aquifer results of smith 2004 for each scenario the labelled values of µ in fig 8 are from the analytical solution the results show that as dispersivity increases sc increases monotonically this does not accord with the non monotonic relationship observed for onshore aquifers by smith 2004 who adopted similar ranges of αl h and αt h to those of the current study fig 8 also indicates that sc depends on µ showing an inverse correlation between the two variables it is noteworthy that in scenario 1 seawater moved within several circulation cells while other scenarios involved only a single seawater circulation cell the result shown in fig 8 is based on the rate of seawater flux passing through the model domain and therefore the fluxes of any closed seawater recirculation bodies are not included in the values given for seawater circulation while only the analytically derived µ is labelled in fig 8 for simplicity the same relationship between µ and sc occurs when µ is estimated numerically i e qfn is used instead of qf to calculate µ values of numerically derived µ as dispersion increases are given in the discussion section 3 1 5 revisiting mixed convection theory for dispersive conditions both forms of the rayleigh number raδ and ra wooding et al 1997 smith and turner 2001 were determined from the numerical modelling results in accordance with the position at which the 0 5 isochlor crosses the top of the aquifer the relationships between raδ and αl h and ra and αl h are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively both rayleigh variants show inverse relationships with dispersion however the effect of the k kz contrast on relationships between raδ and ra and αl h differ that is while raδ decreases as the k kz contrast increases the opposite trend arises for ra whereas solórzano rivas and werner 2018 obtained a single value of raδ for multiple non dispersive situations figs 9 and 10 indicate that unique values of raδ and ra are not forthcoming from our dispersive simulations in fig 9 the different curves tend to converge with increasing values of the rayleigh number and as αl h decreases while at high values of αl h there is significant spread in raδ we also estimated raδ for scenarios 2 and 4 when αl 0 m obtaining values of 1 8 and 2 respectively this is in essence consistent with the finding of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who reported a value of raδ of around 2 for sharp interface problems the relationships depicted in fig 10 indicate that a single value of ra for characterising mixed convective processes in subsea aquifers is not easily recognisable from our results 3 2 effect of the seafloor boundary condition table 3 compares output variables from models adopting one of the two different options for the solute boundary conditions of the seafloor i e boundary conditions a and b see section 2 2 for brevity only the results from four simulations are presented in table 3 namely scenario 2 with αl values of 0 m and 1 m and scenario 4 with αl values of 0 m and 20 m simulations with αl 0 m are included to extend the analysis of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who adopted only boundary condition type a in their non dispersive numerical modelling the negative sign in the discrepancy values of table 3 shows that sc and δqf values decrease when boundary condition b is used whereas the tip and toe tend to increase when boundary condition b is used instead of a the decrease in sc by using boundary condition b is in agreement with the findings of smith 2004 in his evaluation of seawater circulation in onshore aquifer settings discrepancies in xtip xtoe w tip w toe and sc are not higher than 1 7 whereas δqf is modified significantly i e the discrepancy equals 14 in scenario 2 with αl 1 m 4 discussion 4 1 dispersion effects on offshore interfaces the different responses of the tip and toe to dispersion as illustrated in fig 5 are associated with changes in the freshwater seawater interface slope for example the interface tends to become steeper i e the horizontal separation between and toe and tip is reduced as dispersivity increases steepening of the interface with increased dispersivity has been observed previously in onshore aquifers e g shoemaker 2004 abarca et al 2007 kerrou and renard 2010 and therefore the same phenomenon in offshore aquifers is somewhat intuitive the steepening of the interface as dispersivity increases is linked to the loss in density gradient caused by enhanced mixing between freshwater and seawater as explained by kerrou and renard 2010 from their analysis of heterogeneity effects on seawater intrusion in onshore aquifers they report rotation steepening of the interface as dispersivity as a surrogate for heterogeneity increases leading to seaward movement of the toe in the situation of offshore aquifers rotation of the interface similarly causes seaward movement of the toe but there is an accompanying landward movement of the tip in our results unlike the monotonic behaviour of xtoe non monotonic relationships in xtip and w tip with dispersion are apparent the complex behaviour of xtip is attributable to the multi faceted influence of dispersion on the interface that is interface rotation occurs as the density effect weakens causing the tip to move landward as discussed above while the same weakening of density effects i e relative to dispersion tends to push the interface seaward the latter arises because the buoyancy force of the sea is effectively reduced at least relative to other forces the two effects interface rotation and seaward shift act on the tip in opposite directions and respond differently to dispersivity changes leading to the multi directional behaviour of xtip observed in fig 5c 5d and 5e the two factors interface rotation and seaward shift accompanying enhanced dispersivity both cause seaward movement of the toe leading to the disparate behaviour of xtoe and xtip the observed behaviour of w tip is dependent not only on dispersivity but also on the k kz contrast which also brings about enhanced mixing as observed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 and others e g frind 1982 lu et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016 both frind 1982 and solórzano rivas and werner 2018 found that the k kz contrast caused enhanced mixing even though they adopted non dispersive solute transport parameters in their numerical simulations dispersivity values and the effect of the k kz contrast are interrelated because as the interface becomes steeper the flow lines tend to also steepen thereby changing the incident angle of flow at the aquifer aquitard interface this in turn influences the dispersive effect of refraction across the aquifer aquitard interface sebben and werner 2016 creating complex relationships between w tip dispersivity and the k kz contrast the lower refractive effect under steeper angles at the aquifer aquitard interface is the most likely cause of the unintuitive reduction in w tip as the dispersivity increase in scenarios 4 and 5 the exact cause of this phenomenon remains an area of continuing research effort nevertheless the important role of the k kz contrast in interface widening adds to the known dispersive phenomena of offshore coastal aquifers the role of the k kz contrast in the widening of the toe w toe is difficult to ascertain and appears much smaller relative to the role of dispersion in controlling w toe michael et al 2016 also found complex relationships between mixing zone extent and the level of heterogeneity michael et al 2016 investigated the influence of geologic heterogeneity on offshore aquifers using three levels of horizontal geologic continuity levels of heterogeneity they compared heterogeneous and homogeneous representations of offshore aquifers however the same dispersivity was adopted in both cases hence the effect of dispersion on mixing and other interface properties is difficult to ascertain since dispersivity surrogates for heterogeneity in numerical models nevertheless they found in the heterogeneous numerical solutions that there is a non monotonic relationship between the level of heterogeneity i e low medium and high and the area of the mixing zone if we consider that by increasing dispersivity in our numerical models we simulate a higher level of local scale heterogeneity the interface behaviour observed in our study is generally consistent with that observed by michael et al 2016 given that empirical corrections to adjust sharp interface estimates of interface extent to account for dispersion effects have been found for onshore situations e g pool and carrera 2011 werner 2017a we sought similar types of correction factors for offshore aquifer situations however the more complex interrelationships among the different factors controlling offshore freshwater extent as described herein confounded our attempts namely we could not find a correlation that applied to all five scenarios therefore dispersive correction factors for modifying sharp interface estimates of offshore freshwater extent remain unavailable 4 2 dispersion effects on subsea fluxes 4 2 1 subsea fresh groundwater discharge while freshwater flux changes i e δqf increases with dispersion in all scenarios fig 7 the causal factors leading to differences in δqf between scenarios have proven difficult to characterise from the results obtained in our investigation for example δqf values are largest in scenario 5 and smallest in scenario 2 and the relative ranking of δqf curves e g fig 7 are not correlated to any of the parameter combinations e g µ lf βhl h k kz used to explain other phenomenon δqf values in scenario 2 are at least 5 times smaller than in any of the other scenarios the distinguishing features of scenario 2 relative to other scenarios is that cross section a i e the smaller of the two cross sections used is adopted and the analytical sharp interface solution for scenario 2 falls into the category of analytical case ii i e the toe is offshore fig 5 the analytical solutions for scenarios 1 3 and 5 produce analytical case i situations while scenario 4 as with scenario 2 is an analytical case ii situation as scenario 4 produces the second lowest values of δqf it appears that the type of analytical case may play an important role in the response of freshwater discharge to the level of dispersion additionally scenario 1 shows the steepest δqf gradient with respect to dispersion in fig 7 this scenario is the only one where all numerical simulation results but one are onshore i e consistent with the definition of analytical case i other scenarios in which the analytical solution produces analytical case i situations have numerical dispersive interface locations that are offshore i e consistent with the definition of analytical case ii thus in a way scenario 1 remains within the definition of analytical case i whereas scenarios 3 where half of the dispersive interfaces are offshore see fig 5 and 5 where all dispersive interfaces are offshore see fig 5 shift from analytical case i to ii within the simulations undertaken within these scenarios it would seem from this additional evidence that the analytical case type is related to the behaviour of δqf in response to changes to dispersivity whereby analytical case i creates a stronger δqf response to dispersivity changes the results given in fig 7 i e δqf increases with dispersion indicate that offshore fresh groundwater discharge will be larger in aquifers with greater heterogeneity if it is presumed that dispersivity typically represents the unknown heterogeneity of the porous medium at microscopic to local scales in solute transport modelling the same effect is unlikely to arise in density independent solute transport problems in which the dispersiveness of transport and the magnitude of flow are not coupled through water density variations in contrast to the solute concentration dependent velocity field of seawater intrusion problems e g volker and rushton 1982 4 2 2 seawater circulation rates the relationship between µ and sc shown in fig 8 helps to elucidate the influencing factors driving sc in offshore aquifers smith 2004 proposed the mixed convection ratio v khδ qf to describe the potential for seawater circulation given a known rate of freshwater discharge towards the sea according to smith 2004 v relates the characteristic free convection velocity k δ n e to the characteristic forced convection velocity q f h n e whereby large values of v indicate that buoyancy forces are more dominant relative to advective forces badaruddin et al 2017 used the inverse of v as the mixed convection ratio in their analysis of active seawater intrusion v is correlated to both µ and lf see section 2 1 i e μ l f h v table 4 shows the values of v sc and lf for the different dispersion values used in each scenario see table 1 for scenario definitions table 4 demonstrates that for a given scenario i e in which lf and h are maintained constant and only dispersivity varies µ is inversely proportional to v and directly related to sc however the same relationship does not exist among the different scenarios where lf and h vary where the relationship of sc with μ is inversely correlated and sc is non monotonic with v these results differ from those reported for onshore settings e g smith 2004 where a monotonic relationship between sc and v was found for example while scenario 3 has higher v values i e 8 039 than scenario 1 i e 6 847 scenario 1 has the highest sc value see table 4 despite the same dispersivity values e g αt h 0 1 adopted in both scenarios therefore while a higher sc would be expected for higher values of v in onshore aquifers the same behaviour may not arise in offshore aquifers this is because in offshore aquifers the k kz contrast affecting lf see section 2 1 is a significant factor in mixing zone and therefore sc trends fig 8 shows a monotonic relationship between sc and dispersion in all scenarios that is the threshold of dispersivity proposed by smith 2004 for onshore aquifers i e sc reduces when αt h 0 025 that arises as a consequence of the non monotonic sc dispersion relationship was not observed the sc dispersion relationship for offshore aquifers may become non monotonic at excessively high values of αt h but we found no reduction in sc for αt h up to values of 0 1 values of αt h 0 1 likely represent physically unrealistic dispersion values gelhar et al 1992 previous studies have identified that seawater circulation rates in onshore aquifers are mainly dependent on dispersion e g smith 2004 kerrou and renard 2010 and on qfn e g pool et al 2011 in this study we have identified that seawater circulation rates in offshore settings depend on the interrelation of qfn dispersion and the k kz contrast additionally michael et al 2016 found that multiple circulation cells arose in their heterogeneous models they concluded that these circulation cells led to seawater circulation rates that would otherwise be less in homogeneous models implying that homogeneous models are unlikely to create multiple circulation cells however we found multiple circulation cells in a selection of our simulations e g in all simulations of scenario 1 which adds to the findings of michael et al 2016 4 3 mixed convection analysis and boundary condition effects our mixed convection analysis of alternative rayleigh number formulations i e raδ and ra was unable to find a critical rayleigh number that would reliably predict the transition between freshwater and seawater at the top of the aquifer using non zero dispersion parameters this is in contradiction to the sharp interface analysis of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 that is the results depicted in fig 9 indicate that the value of raδ equal to 2 proposed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for sharp interface conditions does not apply in dispersive situations nonetheless raδ approximately equal to 2 was obtained consistently in our non dispersive simulations in agreement with solórzano rivas and werner 2018 the decrease in rayleigh numbers i e raδ and ra as dispersivity increases demonstrates that buoyancy forces are dissipated relative to advective forces by dispersive mechanisms this is consistent with the steepening of the interface slope and the generally seaward movement of the interface at least in terms of the toe as dispersivity increases as illustrated in fig 5 smith 2004 found that the type of concentration boundary condition had an important effect on onshore aquifers namely seawater circulation rates may be up to 1 6 times higher if the mass flux across the seafloor boundary depends on the ambient concentration instead of a constant concentration that produces accumulation of salt beneath the boundary in our study none of the simulated models using the constant concentration condition produced unphysical accumulation of salt in the aquitard in areas where freshwater discharges to the seafloor this is most likely a consequence of the reduced dispersivity applied to the aquitard whereas smith 2004 adopted uniform dispersion parameters in his cases the choice of concentration boundary condition representing the seafloor had little impact on the interface location the width of mixing zones and the seawater circulation rates whereas a significant boundary condition effect was observed in terms of freshwater fluxes to the sea see table 3 the finding that the type of seafloor boundary condition affects freshwater discharge to the sea adds to smith s 2004 conclusions about boundary condition effects of seawater circulation smith 2004 used specified flux conditions at the onshore boundary whereas in this study we used specified head conditions which allowed for the influence of boundary conditions and other factors on freshwater discharge to be evaluated for the case when non dispersive solute transport parameters were adopted the interface toe location was hardly influenced i e up to 2 1 see table 3 by the choice of offshore solute boundary condition therefore the results of solórzano rivas and werner 2018 results are not dependent on their choice of boundary condition i e flow direction dependent saltlux 5 conclusions the present study determined the effect of dispersion on the interface of subsea aquifers that contain fresh and saline groundwater dispersive numerical simulations of offshore groundwater flow have shown that the tip and toe respond differently to changes in dispersion increasing dispersivity resulted in more seaward toe positions in a similar manner to that observed in the more widely studied onshore case conversely the effect of dispersion on the tip location cannot be easily anticipated because of the non monotonic relationship between dispersivity and xtip surprisingly w tip follows a non monotonic relationship with dispersion in a similar fashion to xtip such that a maximum value is reached with increasing dispersivity after which w tip decreases as dispersivity increases this counterintuitive narrowing of the interface at the tip with dispersivity is caused by the dispersive effect of refraction across the aquifer aquitard interface specifically refractive dispersion strengthens when the incident angle is higher or less steep which occurs when the aquifer dispersion parameters are lower given our inland boundary condition i e specified head it has been possible to investigate the dispersion effect on fresh groundwater discharge towards the sea i e qfn finding that larger dispersivity values cause increased qfn considering that dispersivity surrogates for heterogeneity this indicates that heterogeneity plays an important role in fresh groundwater flow rates in density coupled systems the results also show that qfn is related to the type of analytical case i e the four tip toe situations defined by bakker 2006 whereby greater changes in qfn occur when dispersivity is increased if the interface is classified within the analytical case i i e the toe is onshore seawater circulation rates show a monotonic relationship with dispersion differing from the non monotonic relationship observed in onshore aquifers by smith 2004 this finding indicates that the critical dispersion value whereby the influence of buoyancy forces on seawater circulation rates diminishes differs from that proposed by smith 2004 for onshore settings this is mainly due to the influence of the aquifer aquitard interface on dispersion effects affecting sc this study adds to the current body of knowledge on seawater circulation in coastal aquifers by demonstrating that sc in offshore settings is correlated to the k kz contrast in addition to the sc parameter dependencies identified in onshore coastal aquifer studies other factors investigated in this study including the evaluation of mixed convective processes demonstrate that the raδ proposed by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 for the sharp interface simplification in offshore aquifers does not apply in dispersive conditions this is because dispersion effects reduce the influence of buoyancy forces driven by density gradients thereby lowering raδ as dispersivity increases additionally it has been shown that the type of concentration boundary in subsea aquifers for model set ups similar to ours likely have negligible effect on salinity distributions and seawater circulation rates but may impact significantly the estimations of freshwater flow towards the sea our attempts to find a dispersive correction factor to sharp interface estimates that can be applied to all five scenarios were not successful further efforts may need to consider seeking dispersive correction factors for individual analytical case more generally the results presented in this analysis show that the response to dispersion of onshore aquifers do not necessarily apply to offshore aquifers primarily due to the influence of the aquifer aquitard boundary which contributes significantly to the interplay between dispersive buoyancy and advective forces that is refraction at the aquifer aquitard boundary play a major role in controlling the extent of freshwater and freshwater seawater mixing in the offshore aquifer acknowledgments s
