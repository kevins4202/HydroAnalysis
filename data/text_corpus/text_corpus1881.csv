irrigation scheduling yield water scarcity 1 introduction avocado industry has a high relevance in chile both in surface and production since chile ranks fourth in the world regarding avocado exports muñoz et al 2020 however in the last decade chile has been affected by a severe decrease in water availability between 25 and 45 less especially in semi arid to arid regions center north of the country garreaud et al 2017 2020 additionally over exploitation of water resources combined with a poor agricultural irrigation management have led to a water crisis reducing agricultural productivity increasing water access problems for the population and causing potential ecological damage under this scenario the avocado is one of the most affected and controversial species muñoz et al 2020 due to its high water requirements fereres 2012 given the competition for water resources that chile faces it is necessary to develop agronomic management strategies that increase irrigation water productivity wp kg of fruit m3 of water applied beyá marshall et al 2018 in recent years irrigation scheduling and monitoring technologies scholander pressure chamber and capacitance probes linked to online platforms mainly have been gradually introduced to the sector although there is still a significant technology gap among farmers callejas et al 2019 2014 one of the methods to define irrigation scheduling has been the establishment of plant water status thresholds among these midday stem water potential ψₓ thresholds have been reported for fruit trees ferreyra et al 2007 mccutchan and shackel 1992 naor 2006 naor et al 2008 shackel et al 1997 williams et al 2012 although ψₓ can be used to monitor plant water status it varies widely based on the environmental conditions when the measurement is taken in this sense its normalization with environmental variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd has proven to account for this variation mccutchan and shackel 1992 naor 2006 ferreyra et al 2007 gálvez et al 2014 corell et al 2016 shackel et al 2021 the response curve of the ψₓ as function of vpd at non limiting soil water content level is called the fully irrigated baseline shackel et al 1997 and it has been implemented as an effective criterion to determine the optimal irrigation frequency corell et al 2016 gálvez et al 2014 shackel 2007 shackel et al 2021 however it is a discontinuous method and requires a high labor to fulfill the frequency of measurements required as a counterpart monitoring soil water content through sensors mainly fdr and tdr frequency and time domain reflectometry respectively capacitance probes and most recently linked to telemetry and icts information and communication technology have garnered great interest among farmers callejas et al 2019 vera et al 2019 2013 their use is based on the determination of limits or management lines ml which are defined visually following the dynamics of the soil water content ɵw full point field capacity and breaking point or irrigation threshold are worthy of note the full point is defined as the maximum desirable water storage without deep percolation field capacity is established with the traditional definition which is the amount of water stored in the soil after an abundant irrigation and a free drainage between 24 and 72 h depending on the soil texture finding a balance between water and oxygen in the soil veihmeyer and hendrickson 1950 the breaking point threshold refill the lowest limit is slightly above the level where a crop begins to experience water stress thus maintaining the crop within these levels field capacity and breaking point ensures a suitable water status and at the same time avoids loss due to deep percolation campbell and campbell 1982 the most relevant ml is the breaking point which is determined when apparent water uptake rate change at least 20 respect the day before at a similar referential evapotranspiration apparent water uptake is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum ɵw values recorded during the daylight of a given day after one or two days irrigation or rainfall abrisqueta et al 2012 starr and paltineanu 1998a thompson et al 2007a 2007b although this criterion is practical for irrigation management its implementation must be validated with objective measurements of the plant water status especially if there are water restrictions in phenological periods sensitive to water scarcity however few studies and to the best of our knowledge none on avocado have related the progressive decline of soil water content to plant water status measurements abrisqueta et al 2012 thompson et al 2007a 2007b and its impact on yield either in a complete crop cycle or in periods sensitive to water scarcity furthermore there are several tree species that produce more and better quality fruit when they experience moderate stress as more carbon is partitioned to fruits and only vegetative sinks may slow down so a decline of water uptake may not correspond to detrimental water stress in addition establishing management lines for a crop and given irrigation cycle differs remarkably according to the soil depth and its properties and the method used to set ml thompson et al 2007b therefore the adequate use of this technology requires to be checked with evaluations of plant water status of the monitored tree and others from the same management area because this technology is expensive and most of the farmers use one sensor per uniform area of management it is worth having another tool to support irrigation management decisions the most critical phenological period of avocado is at the end of spring and beginning of summer when shoots and the roots grow vigorously and the fruit set and final fruit size is defined mainly by the amount of carbohydrates available ferreyra and selles 2012 silber et al 2019 in fact the greatest rate of cell division of the fruit occurs during the first 100 days after flowering cowan et al 1997 this period end of spring and beginning of summer is consistent with the projected declines in irrigation water availability at basin scale irrigation channels garreaud et al 2017 2020 during the season which is why it is relevant to assess the impact of a water restriction during this period for this the aims of this study were i to evaluate the management lines effectiveness determined with a fdr probe on productivity and fruit size in hass avocado based on greater profitability and water productivity ii generate a non stressed base line to check the management lines and iii to evaluate the impact of a reduction in water input in periods critical to avocado phenology 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and orchard characteristics the trial was carried out between september 2017 and october 2019 two seasons in a commercial avocado orchard persea americana mill cv hass grafted on mexícola 12 years old 4 meter height planted at 6 2 m in 2005 nw se orientation located in peumo region of o higgins chile 34 24 21 69 s 71 10 31 43 w the climate of the study area is mediterranean with rainy winters temperatures that vary on average between a maximum of 29 5 ºc january and a minimum of 4 6ºc july with an average of six frosts per year a mean annual precipitation of 636 mm and a dry period of 7 months with an annual reference evapotranspiration of 1375 mm santibáñez et al 2017 the soil correspond to the peumo soil series a mollisol of alluvial origin flat moderately deep with a predominantly silty loam texture and moderate drainage ciren 2002 the crop was established on a trapezoidal ridge 2 m at the base and 60 cm high the soil profile of the ridge was characterized every 10 15 cm the texture varied from loam 0 20 cm to sandy loam at depth 20 70 cm with an bulk density from 1 27 to 1 57 mg m 3 a volumetric water content at field capacity from 25 8 to 29 4 0 03 mpa and 14 9 16 8 of permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa the greatest proportion of fine roots appeared in the first 30 cm moderate from 30 to 50 cm and nil to scarce below 50 cm a distribution characteristic of this species schaffer et al 2013 prior to setting up the trial the temporal and spatial vigor variability of the orchard was analyzed through spectral vegetation indices such as the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index using satellite images 10 10 m from the sentinel 2 a msi sensors then the crop vigor zones were clustering through k means a multivariate spatio temporal technique used in performing data groupings widely used for cluster analyses kassambara 2017 and in the unsupervised classification of satellite images borra et al 2019 data on vigor variability were used to identify the most homogenous areas of the block to establish the best location for the enviroscan continuous soil water content monitoring sensor sentek sensor technologies stepney australia selecting the place that allows to make representative irrigation decisions fig 1 carrying out this diagnosis is an important complement to the use of fdr probes given that as it is a single point of monitoring the soil water content its representativeness must be as high as possible and its location must not only contemplate practical experience homogeneity of the trees in situ as the plant size but must also contemplate an objective diagnosis like a spectral vegetation index of the spatial and temporal orchard variability in addition close to the fdr probe and within the high vigor area trees were selected to establish the treatments and their replicates seeking homogeneity in terms of crown size and trunk cross sectional area tcsa 25 variation coefficient without apparent symptoms of diseases or pests 2 2 irrigation treatments irrigation was performed through microsprinklers one per plant located between plants 2 m wetting diameter the treatments consisted of different rates of irrigation water replacement taking a reference treatment as a control the time and frequency of irrigation was the same for all the treatments while the differentiation between treatments was done using microsprinklers at different flows rate accordingly the treatments were t1 control irrigation throughout the season 28 l h 1 microsprinklers t2 29 less throughout the season 20 l h 1 microsprinklers t3 25 more throughout the season 35 l h 1 microsprinklers t4 control irrigation until the end of the first fruitlet abscission 712 bbch scale alcaraz et al 2013 mid december 28 l h 1 microsprinklers and then 29 less 20 l h 1 microsprinklers until harvest t5 control irrigation up to 100 days after full bloom beginning the second fruit drop march drop 715 bbch scale alcaraz et al 2013 mid february 28 l h 1 microsprinklers and then 29 less 20 l h 1 microsprinklers until harvest in t4 and t5 the microsprinklers were changed when the time of reducing irrigation amounts arrived the control treatment consisted of keeping the soil water content above the breaking point throughout the season therefore irrigation was performed weekly or biweekly whereas the other treatments were expected to generate water content levels above or below this ml the breaking point was established according the criteria indicated by thompson et al 2007b with an enviroscan probe where onset of plant water stress take place when apparent water uptake rate change at least 20 respect the day before at a similar reference evapotranspiration apparent daily crop water uptake δ is established as the difference between the maximum value of the soil water content ɵw of the day and the lowest ɵw value for a particular day fig 2 the first reduction δ 3 9 fig 2 was considered as a signal of the onset of water stress and the second as a confirmation of water stress δ 2 7 fig 2 2 3 experimental design and measurements 2 3 1 experimental design homogeneous trees were selected in august before bloom in terms of vegetative development and tcsa vigor and height and with no visual nutrition deficiency symptoms or pathological problems the experiment was a complete randomized block design with four replications per treatment the experimental plots were 3 rows 5 trees where the central tree of the central row was used for collecting data of soil water content physiological measurements yield and fruit quality parameters this design two trees as buffers located at both sides of the measurement unit aimed to reduce border effects due to irrigation treatments of adjacent plot 2 3 2 meteorological data during the study period daily maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed were recorded by a weather station campbell sci utah usa located one kilometer away from the study area reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated with the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 2 3 3 plant water status stem water potential ψₓ was measured at midday 1200 h solar time with a scholander pressure chamber pms model 600 usa as an indicator of plant water status two leaves per tree two leaves per replicate were selected from the shady central part of the north face of the canopy near the trunk afterwards a mean value per tree was calculated to measure ψₓ leaves were covered with bags of aluminum sheets wrapped in plastic at least one hour before taking the measurements to allow the water potential of the leaves to balance with the water potential of the stem ψₓ were measured every 15 20 days during the irrigation period just before an irrigation event and during the winter the measurement frequency was reduced to once a month leaves were placed in the chamber within seconds of excision and following the precautions recommended by hsiao 1990 2 3 4 soil water content measurements the volumetric soil water content was monitored using a calibrated multisensor capacitance probe enviroscan sentek sensor technologies stepney australia in one of the control treatment replicates the enviroscan probe was placed in the middle of the ridge of the tree inside a pvc access tube installed within the wetted area between the plant trunk and the sprinklers emitter 0 5 m from tree trunk the probe presented sensors at 10 30 50 and 70 cm depth where the first three sensors covered practically 90 of the active root system estimated during the installation of the probes in the other treatments and replicates pvc access tubes one per replicate were installed in these tubes the soil water content was monitored before irrigation through a calibrated fdr probe diviner 2000 sentek sensor technologies stepney australia at the same time that ψₓ all the pvc tubes were installed in august 2017 one month before the treatments began the enviroscan data were stored in a data logger and transmitted via gprs every 15 min to a central server which was permanently connected the stored raw data were graphically displayed as volumetric water content the total water content was expressed as the sum of reading of the three sensors located in the active root system as per the hardware manufacturer s instructions a flowmeter was installed to determinate the total amount of water applied in a replicate of the control treatment 2 3 5 yield and its components trees were harvested in october of both years for each harvest all fruits were counted and weighed and their average weight was calculated crop load and yield were normalized by tree size in terms of the trunk cross sectional area tcsa tcsa was measured 30 cm up from the soil at harvest fruit size distribution was evaluated in 100 fruits per replicate and classified according to commercial categories a 20 fruits sample were used for fruit maturity determination the oil concentration in the pulp is strongly related to dry matter hernández et al 2016 so pulp dry matter was determined to evaluate fruit maturity in fact dry matter content is the current harvest index for avocados at least 23 dry matter or 9 oil the pulp was dried in an atmospheric pressure oven at 103 c until achieving a constant weight water productivity wp was calculated as yield divided by irrigation applied plus effective rainfall fereres and soriano 2007 from september to may because during winter irrigation to frost control was performed the economic return was calculated each season using the total estimated yield fruit size distribution and farm gate prices the 3 season average 2017 2019 farm gate prices were obtained from sofruco export company finally profitability of water management economic return electricity cost was estimated as the percentage of return or loss of each treatment compared to the reference treatment 2 4 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed under the mixed model framework fixed factor treatments and crop load covariance random factors blocks in case of significant differences between treatments fisher s lsd test for multiple comparisons was used α 0 05 crop load was used as covariance to take into account the effect on yield efficiency and fruit size relationships between ψₓ yield and wp with total water content sum of the three representative deep sensors of the enviroscan where active roots where found each deep sensor vpd crop load and water replacement were fitted testing linear nonlinear and multiple regression models a t test was used for individual coefficients on the regression parameters estimated with a 5 level of significance for the selection of the models the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic were assessed yang 2005 in multiple regression models mallows cp statistic was used as an indicator of the contribution of the explanatory variables in the fit regression models balzarini et al 2008 in order to visualize the association and the type of relationship between each explanatory variable and dependent variable a partial residual analysis was done with scatter plots draper and smith 1998 the statistics program used was infostat v 2017 di rienzo et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal conditions the reference evapotranspiration eto during the period of greatest demand for irrigation september may varied between 1020 and 971 mm for 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 fig 3 the maximum eto occurred in december with a maximum average of 5 6 mm day the maximum vapor pressure deficit max vpd varied from 1 3 to 1 4 kpa in september to 3 0 3 6 kpa between december and february there was no precipitation during the summer in terms of the minimum temperature although frosts appeared during the winter with an absolute minimum of 3 1 c in july 2018 these did not generally cause any crop damage due to their short duration and to the frost protection with microsprinklers 3 2 soil and plant water status the breaking point was determined in december 2017 when the climate conditions were similar between days similar eto fig 2 a clear reduction in the apparent daily water uptake was observed between december 24 and 25 2017 which confirms a limitation in water uptake by the crop abrisqueta et al 2012 starr and paltineanu 1998a thompson et al 2007b the control treatment maintained soil water content above the breaking point throughout the trial period fig 4 on the other hand in the first season the treatments with the lowest water input reached soil water content levels below the breaking point whereas in the second season all the treatments stayed over it although the 29 control treatment t2 frequently reached levels near the breaking point during the summer fig 4 generally the 25 control treatment t3 presented soil water content levels constantly higher than the reference with ψₓ over the control treatment moreover the stem water potential reached levels of moderate stress ferreyra and selles 2012 between 0 6 and 0 9 mpa in the restrictive treatments during the first season whereas in the second although the treatment with more water presented lower stress levels between 0 3 and 0 5 mpa the rest of the treatments stayed in the normal range between 0 4 and 0 6 mpa ferreyra and selles 2012 in this respect wallberg et al 2014 reported that stomatal conductance begins to decline progressively with stem water potential levels of 0 4 mpa and continues until the stomata close completely with levels of 1 0 to 1 2 mpa and consequently decreasing photosynthesis due to the high variability of soil water content among treatments and climate conditions during the season multiple linear regressions were fitted to explain stem water potential as a function of vpd and soil water content at different depths either individually or combined sum of depths fig 5 the best fit r2 0 77 rmse 0 01 was that which considered the sum of water content at 10 30 50 cm which also agreed with the breaking point management line established by the methodology described before the multiple linear regression analysis showed that the influence of vpd was greater than soil water content to explain stem water potential higher mallows cp this was likely due to most measurements in all treatments were in the easily available water range however if we observed the partial residues the plant water status begins to fall when soil water content was almost the same that was defined as the breaking point management line 77 vs 74 water content expressed as the sum of soil water content at depths 10 30 and 50 cm fig 5 this shows that determining the management line according to the rate of apparent water uptake is a practical and effective tool to define irrigation scheduling as it has been reported for other species abrisqueta et al 2012 starr and paltineanu 1998a 1998b thompson et al 2007a 3 3 response of yield components to differential irrigation with respect to the yield components it was observed that no treatment affected crop load which is why the differences in yield in both seasons were due to effects in fruit size table 1 in this sense the water status levels reached in the restrictive treatments were not sufficient to increase fruit abscission even in the second fruit drop march drop which is highly dependent on the availability of photoassimilates despite the high production levels presented in this study tables 1 and 2 51 and 44 kg tree equivalent to 45 7 and 40 9 t ha on average for the first and second seasons of this trial considering 888 plants ha these results suggest that the availability of water nutrients and absorption efficiency were not affected silber et al 2012 in both seasons an increased water input 13 000 14 500 m3 ha 1 in 25 control treatment did not have positive effect on the yield components compared to the control treatment 10 300 11 600 m3 ha 1 table 2 by contrast a delay in maturation dry matter in the first season was observed table 1 similar results have been reported previously by holzapfel et al 2017 and osorio et al 2012 who reached the maximum performance with irrigations of 8887 to 10 000 m3 ha 1 in the same study area and the limarí valley region of coquimbo chile respectively on the other hand no detrimental effect was observed in the treatment with a greater water input which could have occurred in this species which is highly sensitive to root asphyxia schaffer et al 2013 this is probably due to the textural class loam to sandy loam which facilitates deep percolation and to the ridge which prevents the accumulation of excess water in both seasons the 29 control treatment t2 had a slight detrimental effect on fruit weight 6 7 smaller and therefore on productivity and profitability 4 5 reduction table 2 although the more delayed water reduction treatments t4 and t5 did not reach a critical stem water potential level fig 4 they presented a decrease yield which was equal to or greater than the treatment with less water input throughout the season 29 control treatment table 2 this suggests that in case of a projection of less water availability at the end of the season it is advisable to adapt the plant gradually during spring summer delivering less water as a way of promoting root growth dichio et al 2002 sofo et al 2007 similar results have recently been reported in avocados by silber et al 2019 who reported that the effect of constant stress throughout the season in hass avocados was less detrimental to the yield than short periods of stress applied in summer in any case although in the present work lower production levels were observed these were only 6 less than the control irrigation maintaining exportable fruit over 90 table 2 this means that although the avocado in the study area reduces its productivity with water inputs between 7300 to 8200 m3 ha 1 the impact on the yield and therefore the profitability is low table 2 allowing a water saving of 29 in fact under the limitations of this study in terms of levels of water applied it was observed that the water productivity increased linearly with lower water inputs fig 6 3 4 water relations the avocado is highly sensitive to vpd variations and it adjusts the daily gas exchange and the stem water potential according to how the vpd varies during the day ferreyra et al 2007 whiley et al 1988 in this sense vpd has a direct influence on stem water potential and in avocado a logarithmic fit has been seen ferreyra et al 2007 and in this study was found as well fig 7a in fact the treatment with the greatest water input was adjusted to the same fully irrigated baseline reported by ferreyra et al 2007 as originally proposed mccutchan and shackel 1992 the baseline was intended to serve as a plant based reference ψₓ value indicating non soil water limited wet soil conditions rather than a plant based reference value indicating non physiologically limiting non stressed conditions shackel et al 2021 in this sense the non stressed baseline obtained here was validated with production data which makes it more robust enabling maximization of the water resource close to 30 compared to that reported by ferreyra et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge this is the first non stressed baseline reported on avocado based on the best profitability fig 7a max profitability treatments correspond to the control treatment data first season and t1 and t4 second season table 2 this baseline can be used to schedule irrigation or validate the use of breaking point management lines in other orchards with similar climate conditions it should be noted that the measurements must be taken on completely sunny days since it was observed that on partially cloudy days foggy or cloudy conditions until midday with clearing after that the stem water potential was more negative than expected despite having water available indicating stress values without suffering from water stress data not shown similar to what was described by jones 2004 and williams et al 2012 in this sense coastal areas or areas with marine influence usually have numerous days with this condition during the summer hence it is important to consider this aspect before processing the data and using the proposed reference baselines another aspect to consider is the presence of fruit on the trees schaffer et al 2013 indicate that the crop load plays a role in stomatal control since a carbohydrate accumulation in the leaf affects stomatal opening and therefore water uptake by the plant silber et al 2013a in this sense it was observed that in fruitless period postharvest and until fruit set the stem water potential was not associated with the curves presented fig 7b so the baseline reported here is valid from fruit set to harvest when the trees did not have fruit or there is less demand for photoassimilates the stem water potential values at the same vpd increased fig 7b due to a greater stomatal control and increase in resources towards the roots gucci et al 1991 lopez et al 2016 marsal et al 2008 similar to what was reported by mccutchan and schackel 1992 sadras and trentacoste 2011 and naor et al 2008 however when the demand for photoassimilates is greater or at certain levels of crop load medium to high there are no differences in the stem potential at the same vpd berman and dejong 1997 ortuño et al 2010 intrigliolo and castel 2010 naor 2014 thus trees with a zero or low crop load require lower irrigation rates than trees with a higher crop load ben gal et al 2016 silber et al 2013b because the crop load determines the tree s demand for photoassimilates sink capacity while irrigation affects the assimilation rate source capacity the combined effect of both defines the availability of assimilates which is reflected in some cases by the reserve carbohydrates naor 2014 silber et al 2013b the crop load alters the relation between the stem water potential and the stomatal conductance which is anisohydric at a higher load i e the potential falls as the crop load rises but the stomatal opening is maintained transpiration continues and as a result so is the photosynthetic rate however in spite of the adjustment of the water relations of the trees in terms of the crop load greater stem potentials less negative must be maintained to maximize the commercial yield of the trees with a high crop load 4 concluding remarks the information collected in this study associated with physiological indicators of the plants yield components and fruit quality made it possible to evaluate irrigation strategies based on management lines established with the capacitance probes in mature avocado trees in general the results allow to conclude that the criterion of the breaking point based on following the soil water content dynamics on the transition of a rapid rate of depletion to a slower under similar reference evapotranspiration is a practical criterion to determine the optimal time for irrigation without negatively affecting the yield and or the maturation and saving water greater water inputs or soil water content over the breaking point do not improve any production and or quality parameters furthermore they decrease the efficiency of water use the validate reference non stressed baseline of water stem potential would allow to obtain a water saving between 25 and 30 compared to fully irrigated baseline this non stressed baseline allows to set the optimal moment for irrigation without affecting yield considering the climatic influence additionally complements the establishment of the breaking point line with fdr probes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

full point field capacity and breaking point or irrigation threshold are worthy of note the full point is defined as the maximum desirable water storage without deep percolation field capacity is established with the traditional definition which is the amount of water stored in the soil after an abundant irrigation and a free drainage between 24 and 72 h depending on the soil texture finding a balance between water and oxygen in the soil veihmeyer and hendrickson 1950 the breaking point threshold refill the lowest limit is slightly above the level where a crop begins to experience water stress thus maintaining the crop within these levels field capacity and breaking point ensures a suitable water status and at the same time avoids loss due to deep percolation campbell and campbell 1982 the most relevant ml is the breaking point which is determined when apparent water uptake rate change at least 20 respect the day before at a similar referential evapotranspiration apparent water uptake is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum ɵw values recorded during the daylight of a given day after one or two days irrigation or rainfall abrisqueta et al 2012 starr and paltineanu 1998a thompson et al 2007a 2007b although this criterion is practical for irrigation management its implementation must be validated with objective measurements of the plant water status especially if there are water restrictions in phenological periods sensitive to water scarcity however few studies and to the best of our knowledge none on avocado have related the progressive decline of soil water content to plant water status measurements abrisqueta et al 2012 thompson et al 2007a 2007b and its impact on yield either in a complete crop cycle or in periods sensitive to water scarcity furthermore there are several tree species that produce more and better quality fruit when they experience moderate stress as more carbon is partitioned to fruits and only vegetative sinks may slow down so a decline of water uptake may not correspond to detrimental water stress in addition establishing management lines for a crop and given irrigation cycle differs remarkably according to the soil depth and its properties and the method used to set ml thompson et al 2007b therefore the adequate use of this technology requires to be checked with evaluations of plant water status of the monitored tree and others from the same management area because this technology is expensive and most of the farmers use one sensor per uniform area of management it is worth having another tool to support irrigation management decisions the most critical phenological period of avocado is at the end of spring and beginning of summer when shoots and the roots grow vigorously and the fruit set and final fruit size is defined mainly by the amount of carbohydrates available ferreyra and selles 2012 silber et al 2019 in fact the greatest rate of cell division of the fruit occurs during the first 100 days after flowering cowan et al 1997 this period end of spring and beginning of summer is consistent with the projected declines in irrigation water availability at basin scale irrigation channels garreaud et al 2017 2020 during the season which is why it is relevant to assess the impact of a water restriction during this period for this the aims of this study were i to evaluate the management lines effectiveness determined with a fdr probe on productivity and fruit size in hass avocado based on greater profitability and water productivity ii generate a non stressed base line to check the management lines and iii to evaluate the impact of a reduction in water input in periods critical to avocado phenology 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and orchard characteristics the trial was carried out between september 2017 and october 2019 two seasons in a commercial avocado orchard persea americana mill cv hass grafted on mexícola 12 years old 4 meter height planted at 6 2 m in 2005 nw se orientation located in peumo region of o higgins chile 34 24 21 69 s 71 10 31 43 w the climate of the study area is mediterranean with rainy winters temperatures that vary on average between a maximum of 29 5 ºc january and a minimum of 4 6ºc july with an average of six frosts per year a mean annual precipitation of 636 mm and a dry period of 7 months with an annual reference evapotranspiration of 1375 mm santibáñez et al 2017 the soil correspond to the peumo soil series a mollisol of alluvial origin flat moderately deep with a predominantly silty loam texture and moderate drainage ciren 2002 the crop was established on a trapezoidal ridge 2 m at the base and 60 cm high the soil profile of the ridge was characterized every 10 15 cm the texture varied from loam 0 20 cm to sandy loam at depth 20 70 cm with an bulk density from 1 27 to 1 57 mg m 3 a volumetric water content at field capacity from 25 8 to 29 4 0 03 mpa and 14 9 16 8 of permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa the greatest proportion of fine roots appeared in the first 30 cm moderate from 30 to 50 cm and nil to scarce below 50 cm a distribution characteristic of this species schaffer et al 2013 prior to setting up the trial the temporal and spatial vigor variability of the orchard was analyzed through spectral vegetation indices such as the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index using satellite images 10 10 m from the sentinel 2 a msi sensors then the crop vigor zones were clustering through k means a multivariate spatio temporal technique used in performing data groupings widely used for cluster analyses kassambara 2017 and in the unsupervised classification of satellite images borra et al 2019 data on vigor variability were used to identify the most homogenous areas of the block to establish the best location for the enviroscan continuous soil water content monitoring sensor sentek sensor technologies stepney australia selecting the place that allows to make representative irrigation decisions fig 1 carrying out this diagnosis is an important complement to the use of fdr probes given that as it is a single point of monitoring the soil water content its representativeness must be as high as possible and its location must not only contemplate practical experience homogeneity of the trees in situ as the plant size but must also contemplate an objective diagnosis like a spectral vegetation index of the spatial and temporal orchard variability in addition close to the fdr probe and within the high vigor area trees were selected to establish the treatments and their replicates seeking homogeneity in terms of crown size and trunk cross sectional area tcsa 25 variation coefficient without apparent symptoms of diseases or pests 2 2 irrigation treatments irrigation was performed through microsprinklers one per plant located between plants 2 m wetting diameter the treatments consisted of different rates of irrigation water replacement taking a reference treatment as a control the time and frequency of irrigation was the same for all the treatments while the differentiation between treatments was done using microsprinklers at different flows rate accordingly the treatments were t1 control irrigation throughout the season 28 l h 1 microsprinklers t2 29 less throughout the season 20 l h 1 microsprinklers t3 25 more throughout the season 35 l h 1 microsprinklers t4 control irrigation until the end of the first fruitlet abscission 712 bbch scale alcaraz et al 2013 mid december 28 l h 1 microsprinklers and then 29 less 20 l h 1 microsprinklers until harvest t5 control irrigation up to 100 days after full bloom beginning the second fruit drop march drop 715 bbch scale alcaraz et al 2013 mid february 28 l h 1 microsprinklers and then 29 less 20 l h 1 microsprinklers until harvest in t4 and t5 the microsprinklers were changed when the time of reducing irrigation amounts arrived the control treatment consisted of keeping the soil water content above the breaking point throughout the season therefore irrigation was performed weekly or biweekly whereas the other treatments were expected to generate water content levels above or below this ml the breaking point was established according the criteria indicated by thompson et al 2007b with an enviroscan probe where onset of plant water stress take place when apparent water uptake rate change at least 20 respect the day before at a similar reference evapotranspiration apparent daily crop water uptake δ is established as the difference between the maximum value of the soil water content ɵw of the day and the lowest ɵw value for a particular day fig 2 the first reduction δ 3 9 fig 2 was considered as a signal of the onset of water stress and the second as a confirmation of water stress δ 2 7 fig 2 2 3 experimental design and measurements 2 3 1 experimental design homogeneous trees were selected in august before bloom in terms of vegetative development and tcsa vigor and height and with no visual nutrition deficiency symptoms or pathological problems the experiment was a complete randomized block design with four replications per treatment the experimental plots were 3 rows 5 trees where the central tree of the central row was used for collecting data of soil water content physiological measurements yield and fruit quality parameters this design two trees as buffers located at both sides of the measurement unit aimed to reduce border effects due to irrigation treatments of adjacent plot 2 3 2 meteorological data during the study period daily maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed were recorded by a weather station campbell sci utah usa located one kilometer away from the study area reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated with the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 2 3 3 plant water status stem water potential ψₓ was measured at midday 1200 h solar time with a scholander pressure chamber pms model 600 usa as an indicator of plant water status two leaves per tree two leaves per replicate were selected from the shady central part of the north face of the canopy near the trunk afterwards a mean value per tree was calculated to measure ψₓ leaves were covered with bags of aluminum sheets wrapped in plastic at least one hour before taking the measurements to allow the water potential of the leaves to balance with the water potential of the stem ψₓ were measured every 15 20 days during the irrigation period just before an irrigation event and during the winter the measurement frequency was reduced to once a month leaves were placed in the chamber within seconds of excision and following the precautions recommended by hsiao 1990 2 3 4 soil water content measurements the volumetric soil water content was monitored using a calibrated multisensor capacitance probe enviroscan sentek sensor technologies stepney australia in one of the control treatment replicates the enviroscan probe was placed in the middle of the ridge of the tree inside a pvc access tube installed within the wetted area between the plant trunk and the sprinklers emitter 0 5 m from tree trunk the probe presented sensors at 10 30 50 and 70 cm depth where the first three sensors covered practically 90 of the active root system estimated during the installation of the probes in the other treatments and replicates pvc access tubes one per replicate were installed in these tubes the soil water content was monitored before irrigation through a calibrated fdr probe diviner 2000 sentek sensor technologies stepney australia at the same time that ψₓ all the pvc tubes were installed in august 2017 one month before the treatments began the enviroscan data were stored in a data logger and transmitted via gprs every 15 min to a central server which was permanently connected the stored raw data were graphically displayed as volumetric water content the total water content was expressed as the sum of reading of the three sensors located in the active root system as per the hardware manufacturer s instructions a flowmeter was installed to determinate the total amount of water applied in a replicate of the control treatment 2 3 5 yield and its components trees were harvested in october of both years for each harvest all fruits were counted and weighed and their average weight was calculated crop load and yield were normalized by tree size in terms of the trunk cross sectional area tcsa tcsa was measured 30 cm up from the soil at harvest fruit size distribution was evaluated in 100 fruits per replicate and classified according to commercial categories a 20 fruits sample were used for fruit maturity determination the oil concentration in the pulp is strongly related to dry matter hernández et al 2016 so pulp dry matter was determined to evaluate fruit maturity in fact dry matter content is the current harvest index for avocados at least 23 dry matter or 9 oil the pulp was dried in an atmospheric pressure oven at 103 c until achieving a constant weight water productivity wp was calculated as yield divided by irrigation applied plus effective rainfall fereres and soriano 2007 from september to may because during winter irrigation to frost control was performed the economic return was calculated each season using the total estimated yield fruit size distribution and farm gate prices the 3 season average 2017 2019 farm gate prices were obtained from sofruco export company finally profitability of water management economic return electricity cost was estimated as the percentage of return or loss of each treatment compared to the reference treatment 2 4 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed under the mixed model framework fixed factor treatments and crop load covariance random factors blocks in case of significant differences between treatments fisher s lsd test for multiple comparisons was used α 0 05 crop load was used as covariance to take into account the effect on yield efficiency and fruit size relationships between ψₓ yield and wp with total water content sum of the three representative deep sensors of the enviroscan where active roots where found each deep sensor vpd crop load and water replacement were fitted testing linear nonlinear and multiple regression models a t test was used for individual coefficients on the regression parameters estimated with a 5 level of significance for the selection of the models the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic were assessed yang 2005 in multiple regression models mallows cp statistic was used as an indicator of the contribution of the explanatory variables in the fit regression models balzarini et al 2008 in order to visualize the association and the type of relationship between each explanatory variable and dependent variable a partial residual analysis was done with scatter plots draper and smith 1998 the statistics program used was infostat v 2017 di rienzo et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal conditions the reference evapotranspiration eto during the period of greatest demand for irrigation september may varied between 1020 and 971 mm for 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 fig 3 the maximum eto occurred in december with a maximum average of 5 6 mm day the maximum vapor pressure deficit max vpd varied from 1 3 to 1 4 kpa in september to 3 0 3 6 kpa between december and february there was no precipitation during the summer in terms of the minimum temperature although frosts appeared during the winter with an absolute minimum of 3 1 c in july 2018 these did not generally cause any crop damage due to their short duration and to the frost protection with microsprinklers 3 2 soil and plant water status the breaking point was determined in december 2017 when the climate conditions were similar between days similar eto fig 2 a clear reduction in the apparent daily water uptake was observed between december 24 and 25 2017 which confirms a limitation in water uptake by the crop abrisqueta et al 2012 starr and paltineanu 1998a thompson et al 2007b the control treatment maintained soil water content above the breaking point throughout the trial period fig 4 on the other hand in the first season the treatments with the lowest water input reached soil water content levels below the breaking point whereas in the second season all the treatments stayed over it although the 29 control treatment t2 frequently reached levels near the breaking point during the summer fig 4 generally the 25 control treatment t3 presented soil water content levels constantly higher than the reference with ψₓ over the control treatment moreover the stem water potential reached levels of moderate stress ferreyra and selles 2012 between 0 6 and 0 9 mpa in the restrictive treatments during the first season whereas in the second although the treatment with more water presented lower stress levels between 0 3 and 0 5 mpa the rest of the treatments stayed in the normal range between 0 4 and 0 6 mpa ferreyra and selles 2012 in this respect wallberg et al 2014 reported that stomatal conductance begins to decline progressively with stem water potential levels of 0 4 mpa and continues until the stomata close completely with levels of 1 0 to 1 2 mpa and consequently decreasing photosynthesis due to the high variability of soil water content among treatments and climate conditions during the season multiple linear regressions were fitted to explain stem water potential as a function of vpd and soil water content at different depths either individually or combined sum of depths fig 5 the best fit r2 0 77 rmse 0 01 was that which considered the sum of water content at 10 30 50 cm which also agreed with the breaking point management line established by the methodology described before the multiple linear regression analysis showed that the influence of vpd was greater than soil water content to explain stem water potential higher mallows cp this was likely due to most measurements in all treatments were in the easily available water range however if we observed the partial residues the plant water status begins to fall when soil water content was almost the same that was defined as the breaking point management line 77 vs 74 water content expressed as the sum of soil water content at depths 10 30 and 50 cm fig 5 this shows that determining the management line according to the rate of apparent water uptake is a practical and effective tool to define irrigation scheduling as it has been reported for other species abrisqueta et al 2012 starr and paltineanu 1998a 1998b thompson et al 2007a 3 3 response of yield components to differential irrigation with respect to the yield components it was observed that no treatment affected crop load which is why the differences in yield in both seasons were due to effects in fruit size table 1 in this sense the water status levels reached in the restrictive treatments were not sufficient to increase fruit abscission even in the second fruit drop march drop which is highly dependent on the availability of photoassimilates despite the high production levels presented in this study tables 1 and 2 51 and 44 kg tree equivalent to 45 7 and 40 9 t ha on average for the first and second seasons of this trial considering 888 plants ha these results suggest that the availability of water nutrients and absorption efficiency were not affected silber et al 2012 in both seasons an increased water input 13 000 14 500 m3 ha 1 in 25 control treatment did not have positive effect on the yield components compared to the control treatment 10 300 11 600 m3 ha 1 table 2 by contrast a delay in maturation dry matter in the first season was observed table 1 similar results have been reported previously by holzapfel et al 2017 and osorio et al 2012 who reached the maximum performance with irrigations of 8887 to 10 000 m3 ha 1 in the same study area and the limarí valley region of coquimbo chile respectively on the other hand no detrimental effect was observed in the treatment with a greater water input which could have occurred in this species which is highly sensitive to root asphyxia schaffer et al 2013 this is probably due to the textural class loam to sandy loam which facilitates deep percolation and to the ridge which prevents the accumulation of excess water in both seasons the 29 control treatment t2 had a slight detrimental effect on fruit weight 6 7 smaller and therefore on productivity and profitability 4 5 reduction table 2 although the more delayed water reduction treatments t4 and t5 did not reach a critical stem water potential level fig 4 they presented a decrease yield which was equal to or greater than the treatment with less water input throughout the season 29 control treatment table 2 this suggests that in case of a projection of less water availability at the end of the season it is advisable to adapt the plant gradually during spring summer delivering less water as a way of promoting root growth dichio et al 2002 sofo et al 2007 similar results have recently been reported in avocados by silber et al 2019 who reported that the effect of constant stress throughout the season in hass avocados was less detrimental to the yield than short periods of stress applied in summer in any case although in the present work lower production levels were observed these were only 6 less than the control irrigation maintaining exportable fruit over 90 table 2 this means that although the avocado in the study area reduces its productivity with water inputs between 7300 to 8200 m3 ha 1 the impact on the yield and therefore the profitability is low table 2 allowing a water saving of 29 in fact under the limitations of this study in terms of levels of water applied it was observed that the water productivity increased linearly with lower water inputs fig 6 3 4 water relations the avocado is highly sensitive to vpd variations and it adjusts the daily gas exchange and the stem water potential according to how the vpd varies during the day ferreyra et al 2007 whiley et al 1988 in this sense vpd has a direct influence on stem water potential and in avocado a logarithmic fit has been seen ferreyra et al 2007 and in this study was found as well fig 7a in fact the treatment with the greatest water input was adjusted to the same fully irrigated baseline reported by ferreyra et al 2007 as originally proposed mccutchan and shackel 1992 the baseline was intended to serve as a plant based reference ψₓ value indicating non soil water limited wet soil conditions rather than a plant based reference value indicating non physiologically limiting non stressed conditions shackel et al 2021 in this sense the non stressed baseline obtained here was validated with production data which makes it more robust enabling maximization of the water resource close to 30 compared to that reported by ferreyra et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge this is the first non stressed baseline reported on avocado based on the best profitability fig 7a max profitability treatments correspond to the control treatment data first season and t1 and t4 second season table 2 this baseline can be used to schedule irrigation or validate the use of breaking point management lines in other orchards with similar climate conditions it should be noted that the measurements must be taken on completely sunny days since it was observed that on partially cloudy days foggy or cloudy conditions until midday with clearing after that the stem water potential was more negative than expected despite having water available indicating stress values without suffering from water stress data not shown similar to what was described by jones 2004 and williams et al 2012 in this sense coastal areas or areas with marine influence usually have numerous days with this condition during the summer hence it is important to consider this aspect before processing the data and using the proposed reference baselines another aspect to consider is the presence of fruit on the trees schaffer et al 2013 indicate that the crop load plays a role in stomatal control since a carbohydrate accumulation in the leaf affects stomatal opening and therefore water uptake by the plant silber et al 2013a in this sense it was observed that in fruitless period postharvest and until fruit set the stem water potential was not associated with the curves presented fig 7b so the baseline reported here is valid from fruit set to harvest when the trees did not have fruit or there is less demand for photoassimilates the stem water potential values at the same vpd increased fig 7b due to a greater stomatal control and increase in resources towards the roots gucci et al 1991 lopez et al 2016 marsal et al 2008 similar to what was reported by mccutchan and schackel 1992 sadras and trentacoste 2011 and naor et al 2008 however when the demand for photoassimilates is greater or at certain levels of crop load medium to high there are no differences in the stem potential at the same vpd berman and dejong 1997 ortuño et al 2010 intrigliolo and castel 2010 naor 2014 thus trees with a zero or low crop load require lower irrigation rates than trees with a higher crop load ben gal et al 2016 silber et al 2013b because the crop load determines the tree s demand for photoassimilates sink capacity while irrigation affects the assimilation rate source capacity the combined effect of both defines the availability of assimilates which is reflected in some cases by the reserve carbohydrates naor 2014 silber et al 2013b the crop load alters the relation between the stem water potential and the stomatal conductance which is anisohydric at a higher load i e the potential falls as the crop load rises but the stomatal opening is maintained transpiration continues and as a result so is the photosynthetic rate however in spite of the adjustment of the water relations of the trees in terms of the crop load greater stem potentials less negative must be maintained to maximize the commercial yield of the trees with a high crop load 4 concluding remarks the information collected in this study associated with physiological indicators of the plants yield components and fruit quality made it possible to evaluate irrigation strategies based on management lines established with the capacitance probes in mature avocado trees in general the results allow to conclude that the criterion of the breaking point based on following the soil water content dynamics on the transition of a rapid rate of depletion to a slower under similar reference evapotranspiration is a practical criterion to determine the optimal time for irrigation without negatively affecting the yield and or the maturation and saving water greater water inputs or soil water content over the breaking point do not improve any production and or quality parameters furthermore they decrease the efficiency of water use the validate reference non stressed baseline of water stem potential would allow to obtain a water saving between 25 and 30 compared to fully irrigated baseline this non stressed baseline allows to set the optimal moment for irrigation without affecting yield considering the climatic influence additionally complements the establishment of

indicated that different crops had significant differences in water and energy consumption the blue water requirements of wheat maize rice and cotton were 3174 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 4271 8 m3 ha 1 yr 1 7283 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and 8769 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively of these crops wheat had the lowest blue water requirements and cotton had the highest in addition the planting area of the trb increased by 105 104 ha during the study period with cotton accounting for 45 of the total planting area the expansion of the planting area led to a continuous improvement in cotton production income leading to the highest energy economic productivity in cotton 0 065 mj however the increase in total water and energy consumption water and energy mass productivity in cotton were lower than in the other three crops 0 15 kg m3 and 0 04 kg mj the average wefni of rice wheat maize and cotton was 0 40 0 45 0 43 and 0 35 respectively this demonstrated that wheat had the highest resources utilization productivity in agricultural inputs while cotton had the lowest these results can provide an important scientific basis for current and future agricultural management optimization keywords wef nexus index cropping patterns agricultural sustainable development agricultural inputs productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water energy and food are the basic factors of human survival and development and their internal coupling contributes to the realization of regional sustainable development goals chai et al 2020 chen et al 2020 rasul 2016 zhang et al 2018 at present the internal coupling is affected by external factors such as climate change and covid 19 leading to a significant increase in human demand for water energy and food abbott et al 2019 duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 piao et al 2010 it is expected that by 2050 the global demand for these three factors will increase by 55 80 and 60 respectively zuo et al 2021 such massive increases will undoubtedly pose a correspondingly massive threat to the water energy and food security of all countries especially in developing nations where resources are either insufficient or badly managed amnuaylojaroen et al 2021 miralles wilhelm 2016 shi et al 2020 water energy food wef nexus is used to describe the complex and close relationship between the three factors hua et al 2021 shi et al 2021 for example food and energy production and consumption require a large amount of water for irrigation and cooling while water extraction transportation and distribution need energy support at the same time food generates energy in the form of biomass energy el gafy et al 2017 li et al 2021c wen et al 2022 zuo et al 2021 therefore it is important to clarify the complex relationship between water energy and food in order to make rational use of the wef nexus thereby alleviating the crisis of resources shortage and helping to realize the coordinated development of resources el gafy et al 2017 ma et al 2021 agriculture is the main driving force of wef nexus development but it is also the main consumer of water resources and energy in the world guan et al 2020 miralles wilhelm 2016 as well agriculture plays an important role in social and economic development research shows that irrigation and food processing consume 70 of global freshwater resources and 30 of total energy fan et al 2020 garcia et al 2019 this high level of consumption is particularly evident in the tarim river basin trb in china s sparsely populated northwest which has a unique geographical location characterized by extreme aridity and oasis agriculture long et al 2021 at the same time water resources are an important factor restricting social and economic development fang et al 2018 shen et al 2013 unlike humid areas the trb generally has irrigated agriculture and irrigation water in the trb accounts for about 95 of the region s total water consumption fang et al 2018 the main water resources in the trb are glacier snow meltwater but it is difficult to use these resources directly as they are stored in high mountain locales huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021a with the expansion of planting area over the past several decades surface water resources have been unable to meet the needs of agricultural irrigation so groundwater is being used for irrigation this has caused the gradual depletion of groundwater especially in recent years fang et al 2018 wang et al 2021b in addition according to the xinjiang statistical yearbook the input of chemical fertilizers in the trb has increased by 91 104 tonnes since 1990 while it is true that a high proportion of inputs of water resources and chemical fertilizers leads to an increase in agricultural output it also leads to a drop in groundwater tables and a deterioration in water quality wang et al 2021b it is worth mentioning that agriculture is a major source of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases ghg emissions accounting for about 20 of the ghg emissions and growing at a rate of 1 per year fabiani et al 2020 frank et al 2018 lamb et al 2016 wang et al 2019 excessive consumption of irrigation and chemical fertilizer produces a large amount of carbon emissions which greatly affects the sustainable development of agriculture and exacerbates the contradiction between water energy and food in the agricultural cropping systems hasanzadeh saray et al 2022 several studies apply the water energy food nexus index wefni as a new perspective of agricultural management to comprehensively evaluate the wef nexus in the cropping systems el gafy et al 2017 fabiani et al 2020 gathala et al 2020 karamian et al 2021 li et al 2021c sadeghi et al 2020 the approach not only focuses on the connection of a single factor but also considers the balance between water and energy consumption productivity and benefits to the cropping systems sadeghi et al 2020 applied the wefni approach to quantitatively study 14 crops in the shazand basin of markazi province iran he found that sugar cane and cucumber had the lowest wefni karamian et al 2021 explored the applicability of the wefni approach on a farm scale for the first time demonstrating that wheat has a higher agricultural inputs efficiency hasanzadeh saray et al 2022 applied the wefni approach to study 7 crops in northwest iran showing silage corn as having the highest index therefore the wefni approach would be helpful for studying the wef nexus relationship in agricultural management to improve the efficiency of resources utilization jamali et al 2021 previous studies on the wef nexus in trb s agricultural management have experienced the single factor of water resources water food and water food climate change shen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 over the past half century the trb has felt the impact of climate change and the rate of the temperature rise is significantly higher than the global average level of 0 22 10a chen et al 2016 2014 li et al 2021b xiang et al 2020 in addition the start time of accumulated temperature 10 in the basin is 7 days earlier and the end time 12 days later which to some extent facilitates the expansion of grain sown area and the increase in yield liu et al 2021 studies have also indicated that crop water demand has increased at a high rate of 9 47 mm yr 1 fang et al 2018 these studies however ignore agricultural energy consumption huang et al 2018 long et al 2021 although agricultural energy consumption plays a dominant role in the wef nexus it is unclear how the wef nexus has coordinated development in the agricultural management of the trb based on the above analyses the present study took the trb as the study area and incorporated the three factors of water energy and food into the investigation of agricultural cropping systems the objectives of this research work were 1 to calculate the water and energy consumption of the main crops in the trb from 1990 to 2019 and determine how water and energy productivity have changed and 2 to quantitatively evaluate the trends of the wefni for the main crops by the wefni approach and explore the influencing factors 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the trb is located in northwest china with a drainage area of 1 02 106 km2 fig 1 it is bordered by the tienshan mountains to the north the kunlun mountains to the south and the pamir plateau to the west the basin has a typical temperate arid continental climate with scarce precipitation and high rates of evaporation the annual average precipitation from 1989 to 2015 was 17 4 42 0 mm while the annual evaporation was 2500 3000 mm the trb is a dissipative inland river with dominant glacier snow meltwater contributing to the flow the annual average runoff is 398 108 m3 at present only the aksu river yarkand river hotan river kaidu kongque river and tarim river are connected by surface water forming a drainage system pattern of four sources and one trunk chen et al 2011 fang et al 2018 huang et al 2021 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the administrative regions include the bayingol mongolian autonomous prefecture aksu region kizilsu kirghiz autonomous prefecture kashgar region hotan region and 56 farms under xinjiang construction corps in terms of the region s economic conditions the trb is dominated by intensive irrigated agriculture rice maize cotton and wheat are the main crops covering about 80 of the planting area they are planted in oases on the edge of deserts and rely on surface water and groundwater for irrigation fang et al 2018 ling et al 2019 long et al 2021 wang et al 2021a xue et al 2019 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data for this study were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn en a total of 26 meteorological observation stations with complete observation series were selected from the trb the data of the observation sites were selected for the years 1990 2019 for a total of 30 years the main meteorological factors include daily precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature average wind speed sunshine hours and relative humidity 2 2 2 socio economic data the socio economic data for this research were collected from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 1991 2020 xinjiang water resources bulletin 2001 2016 china price yearbook 1991 2019 national agricultural cost benefit data assembly 1991 2020 and china water bulletin 2017 2020 the data mainly include crop acreage crop yield labor input agricultural film pesticides machinery irrigation efficiency diesel seeding rate and fertilizer application amounts for five prefectures in the trb crop coefficients are derived from the literature with region specific data shen et al 2013 zhai et al 2021 while crop sales price data were sourced from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao https www fao org home zh 2 2 3 survey data a survey was conducted among farmers in bayingol xinjiang province bayingol is an important oasis agricultural production area in the trb taking bayingol as an example this study collected data on the crop growth cycle of different crops in the research area table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water energy food nexus index wefni model framework building in this study wefni is introduced to evaluate agricultural inputs productivity cropping systems development by establishing an agricultural wefni model fig 2 illustrates the wefni model framework for the trb including three relationships of water and energy water and food and energy and food there are six evaluation indicators in total which are applied to four crops namely rice wheat maize and cotton water consumption water mass productivity and water economic productivity are used to measure the relationship between water and food while energy consumption energy mass productivity and energy economic productivity are used to measure the relationship between energy and food in addition as the population of the basin continues to increase and the irrigated area to expand the relationship between water and energy is expressed through energy consumption which also increases energy demand to some extent taking into account crop production cost and income water and energy consumption and water and energy productivity this study adopts the wefni as the evaluation standard for crop agricultural inputs productivity el gafy et al 2017 fabiani et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 2 3 2 water and energy consumption indicators we assume that water consumption is equal to crop water requirement cwr fan et al 2020 karamian et al 2021 the latter which includes two factors green water and blue water green water is provided by rain and stored in unsaturated soil as water mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 blue water is the amount of water provided through irrigation mao et al 2021 the green water requirement of crops is equal to the effective precipitation during the growing season the thiessen method fig s1 is used to determine the cwr of each crop based on the observation data of meteorological stations wang et al 2021a the green water requirements cwrgreen m3 ha 1 yr 1 and blue water requirements cwrblue m3 ha 1 yr 1 are calculated in eqs 1 and 2 respectively as follows 1 cwr green 10 n d 1 et green 2 cwr blue 10 n d 1 et blue where etgreen mm d 1 and etblue mm d 1 are the crop evapotranspiration from precipitation and irrigation water respectively n is the length of the growing period for a crop within one year and the constant value 10 is used to convert the water depth mm to the volume of water m3 ha 1 this is calculated in eqs 3 and 4 as follows 3 et green min et c p e 4 et blue max 0 et c p e where etc mm d 1 is the crop evapotranspiration for the month and pe mm d 1 is the effective precipitation available to each crop type this relationship is formulated in eq 5 5 et c k c et o where kc is the crop coefficient and eto mm d 1 is the reference evapotranspiration of the reference crop table s1 which is calculated using cropwat 8 0 software mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 additionally kc is a coefficient expressing the difference in evapotranspiration between the cropped area and a reference grass surface table 1 pe is calculated using the empirical formula derived by the u s department of agriculture soil conservation service fan et al 2020 the parameter is calculated as expressed in eq 6 p e p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 for p 8 3 mm d 1 6 p e 4 17 0 1 p for p 8 3 mm d 1 where p is daily precipitation mm d 1 the energy consumption indicator denotes direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption in this case direct energy consumption refers to diesel fuel labor and irrigation water karamian et al 2021 the cwr is used to calculate the irrigation water requirement which also needs to consider irrigation efficiency and loss of farmland by rivers in general the irrigation water requirement is higher than cwr the main calculation method multiplies cwr by crop planting area divided by irrigation efficiency table s2 indirect energy consumption refers to the input of chemical fertilizers pesticides seeds agricultural film and farm machinery in crop production according to field visits fertilizer energy consumption accounts for the main indirect energy use and is determined by the planting area of crops therefore we assign the fertilizer energy consumption to the four crops by using the crop sown area as a weighting coefficient ghaderpour and rafiee 2017 sadeghi et al 2020 the energy equivalent is used to represent the primary energy inputs associated with the manufacture of production tools hülsbergen et al 2001 rajpoot et al 2021 there are obvious changes in the energy equivalent between different studies which is mainly due to different calculation methods and regional boundaries fabiani et al 2020 jat et al 2020 venkatalaxmi et al 2004 zahedi et al 2015 the energy equivalent is not invariable and must be modified according to local conditions and regional agricultural production characteristics according to the actual situation of input and output in agricultural production in china yi and gao 1998 and hu et al 2011 determined the energy equivalent standard of main agricultural production materials in the nation s cropping system therefore the energy equivalent value of the present study adopts this standard taking the trb as an example the energy input in the investigated area is multiplied by the energy equivalent table 2 to calculate the total energy consumption of crop production in the study area fan et al 2020 yadav et al 2017 the total amount of energy consumed in the production process of agricultural machinery ei is calculated as shown in eq 7 7 e i n am ni ee n mr where ei is the total amount of energy consumed by agricultural machinery in the production process of i crops amni is the number of the n agricultural machinery used for i crop een is the energy equivalent of type n agricultural machinery and mr is the depreciation rate of agricultural machinery in this paper mr takes a fixed value of 10 zhen et al 2017 2 3 3 water and energy productivity indicators the water and energy productivity of the agricultural cropping system has been evaluated by crop yield crop income and costs zahedi et al 2015 the indicators for water and energy productivity are calculated using the formulas shown in table 3 the higher the water and energy mass productivity indicators the higher the efficiency of water and energy use the higher the water and energy economic productivity the better the economic benefits of water and energy consumption karamian et al 2021 yield grain production per hectare water water consumption per hectare energy the amount of input energy consumed per hectare tr total income of main crops per hectare tc total cost of main crops per hectare 2 3 4 water energy food nexus index wefni wefni is calculated using eq 8 as proposed by el gafy et al 2017 8 wefni i 1 n w i s ij i 1 n w i where sij is the standardized indicator value in the j year wi is the weight of each indicator and n is the number of indicators in this study the entropy method text s1 is used to assign weights objectively to each indicator which avoids the subjectivity of artificial weight assignment to a certain extent the entropy method calculates the information entropy of indicators by analyzing the dispersion degree between indicators and the amount of information carried by each indicator the larger the entropy value the greater the difference between indicators in other words the larger the differential coefficient the greater the weight of indicators in the evaluation system li et al 2021a due to the different sizes of each unit wefni cannot be directly calculated therefore all indicators need to be normalized to obtain dimensionless values for which eqs 9 and 10 as proposed by malakar and lu 2021 can be used 9 positive s ij x ij x min x max x min 10 negative s i j x max x i j x max x min where xij is the actual value of each indicator xmax is the maximum value of the evaluation indicator and xmin is the minimum value of the evaluation indicator 3 results 3 1 water and energy consumption changes for the main crops 3 1 1 water consumption as can be seen in fig 3 the water consumption of each crop was mainly blue water irrigation with less green water resources being used the main reason for the heavy reliance on blue water irrigation is that the regional climate is arid evaporation is strong and precipitation is scant so green water resources cannot be obtained as reliably fang et al 2018 tao et al 2011 xia et al 2022 there were some key differences in blue water consumption among the crops in terms of crop types the cwrblue for cotton was the highest 8769 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 followed by rice 7283 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 maize 4271 8 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and wheat 3174 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 except for bayingol and aksu the other three regions kizilsu kirghiz kashgar and hotan had the lowest proportion of cwrblue for cotton and rice in 2010 dipping below 0 90 however kizilsu kirghiz kashgar and hotan had the highest proportion of cwrblue for wheat in 2007 measuring 0 95 0 95 and 0 96 meanwhile from 2004 to 2009 the cwrblue for maize in hotan was higher than the average level of the trb all of which were greater than 5000 m3 ha 1 yr 1 in terms of spatial distribution the cwrblue of the main crops rice wheat maize and cotton in kizilsu kirghiz was lower than the other four regions recorded as 7100 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 2808 6 m3 ha 1 yr 1 3864 5 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and 8298 4 m3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively these amounts were all lower than the average level of cwrblue for the main crops this also reflected that compared with the other four regions the cwrgreen in kizilsu kirghiz was relatively abundant at 979 5 m3 ha 1 yr 1 the research results were consistent with those of fang et al 2018 3 1 2 energy consumption fig 4 showed that cotton and rice had the highest average energy consumption in the trb from 1990 to 2019 at 3 83 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 and 3 81 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 respectively compared to the other three staple crops the higher energy consumption per hectare of cotton was mainly due to the higher irrigation water requirement and agricultural film wang et al 2019 the total energy consumption of cotton in kashgar and aksu was the highest over the study periods at 85 108 mj yr 1 and 84 108 mj yr 1 furthermore in the important irrigation regions of kashgar and aksu in the trb cotton planting area increased by 436 6 104 ha and 297 7 104 ha resulting in increased inputs of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the total energy input of aksu rice was 5 108 mj yr 1 which was higher than the other four regions in addition the irrigation water requirement of rice in the trb during the same timeframe was much higher than that of wheat and maize and directly led to increases in rice energy input at 2 4 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 and 2 5 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 maize and wheat had the lowest average energy consumption per hectare the average energy consumption of wheat was higher than that of maize because the seeding rate of wheat was higher according to the statistical results the average seeding rate of wheat during the study period was 322 kg ha and the average seed seeding amount of maize was 61 kg ha the energy consumption per hectare of wheat and maize in kizilsu kirghiz was the lowest 2 4 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 and 2 3 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 thus compared with aksu and kashgar the planting area directly affected the use of fertilizer fuel which was consistent with the findings of fabiani et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 irrigation water and nitrogenous fertilizer account for a high proportion of the total energy consumption of the main crops in the trb it was worth noting that the energy input of wheat seeds was higher than that of other crops according to the national agricultural cost benefit data assembly the sowing amount of seeds per hectare was 332 kg ha which was higher than that of rice 150 kg ha the higher proportion of fertilizer in wheat and maize was consistent with the findings of karamian et al 2021 despite the large amount of fertilizer input leading to an increase in grain yield and making the wef coupling degree of wheat and maize higher and more closely related the chemical fertilizer had a certain negative impact on farmland water quality and agricultural sustainability wang et al 2021b moreover the trb is located in arid northwest china where nearly all agriculture is irrigated in 1990 the trb had an irrigation efficiency of only 0 38 which was quite low and necessitated high amounts of surface water irrigation and more energy consumption after 2000 with the improvements in irrigation water saving technology and the proposal of the three red lines irrigation efficiency increased to 0 56 by 2019 wang et al 2019 from this we can see that improvements in water saving technology can reduce the corresponding energy use 3 2 spatial temporal variations in water and energy productivity 3 2 1 water and energy mass productivity table 4 showed the yield of the main crops in the trb during 1990 2019 according to the data wheat had the highest annual average crop yield 228 0 104 tonnes followed by maize 204 8 104 tonnes cotton 99 4 104 tonnes and rice 23 1 104 tonnes the average annual yield of wheat and maize in kashgar were 97 0 104 tonnes and 91 2 104 tonnes respectively accounting for 43 and 45 of the total wheat and maize yield in the trb respectively the average annual yield of cotton and rice in aksu were 39 3 104 tonnes and 12 4 104 tonnes respectively accounting for 39 and 54 of the total output of cotton and rice in the study area respectively fig 6a b c and d illustrated the water mass productivity of the main crops in the trb during the study period the higher the water mass productivity the less irrigated water will be used to produce the same grain and the better the ecological environment sadeghi et al 2020 in terms of crop types wheat maize and rice had the highest water mass productivity while cotton had the lowest 1 5 kg m3 1 3 kg m3 0 96 kg m3 and 0 15 kg m3 respectively moreover wheat had the highest water mass productivity mainly because its yield was higher than that of other crops table 4 and the irrigation water amount was lower which was consistent with the research results of molden et al 2010 from 2010 2019 the average water mass productivity of wheat was 1 6 kg m3 which was higher than that of the previous 20 years this indicated that the development of water saving irrigation technologies such as the drip irrigation system and optimized water distribution played an important role in improving water mass productivity long et al 2021 according to the xinjiang statistical yearbook the effective water saving area in the trb increased from 0 48 to 0 56 water mass productivity of wheat in the aksu was the highest 1 6 kg m3 followed by bayingol kashgar kizilsu kirghiz and hotan fig 6e f j and h showed the energy mass productivity of the main crops in the trb during 1990 2019 cotton had the lowest energy mass productivity followed by rice and wheat while maize had the highest 0 04 kg mj 0 20 kg mj 0 21 kg mj and 0 26 kg mj respectively the energy mass productivity indicator was mainly influenced by two factors energy input amount and crop yield compared to rice cotton had a higher energy input amount per hectare and much lower energy mass productivity mainly because the planting area of cotton was much larger than that of rice fig 9 from 1990 2010 the planting area of cotton increased from 21 5 104 to 114 2 104 ha the rice planting area accounted for only 0 05 of the cotton planting area and the irrigation water consumption accounted for only 0 9 5 of the total irrigation water wang et al 2019 the average energy mass productivity of cotton from 2010 to 2019 was 0 07 kg mj which was higher than that of the previous two periods with the improvements in irrigation efficiency and the development of agricultural automation crop yield increased at the same time the amount of water and labor required for irrigation declined resulting in higher energy mass productivity for cotton in 2010 2019 than in 1990 2010 fang et al 2018 3 2 2 water and energy economic productivity fig 7 clearly showed that the annual average water economic productivity of maize was the highest in the trb during the study period followed by wheat cotton and rice 0 30 m3 0 28 m3 0 26 m3 and 0 24 m3 respectively as a cash crop the transaction price of cotton increased 1766 5 tonne 1 yr 1 which was higher than the transaction price for other three grain crops however the water consumption of cotton was also significantly higher than that of grain crops therefore the water economic productivity of cotton during the study period was low meanwhile the transaction price of maize was 251 8 tonne 1 yr 1 which was higher than that of wheat and the water consumption of maize was lower than that of cotton making the water economic productivity of maize higher however cotton 0 065 mj required more energy economic productivity than maize 0 060 mj followed by rice 0 050 mj and wheat 0 039 mj compared to 2000 2009 the water economic productivity of maize grew fastest in 2010 2019 at a rate of 60 from 2010 2019 aksu maize had the highest water economic productivity 0 57 m3 followed by bayingol 0 51 m3 kashgar 0 47 m3 hotan 0 38 m3 and kizilsu kirghiz 0 32 m3 the average water economic productivity of rice in 1990 1999 0 16 m3 was lower than that in either 2000 2009 or 2010 2019 from 1990 1999 water economic productivity for bayingol rice was the lowest and aksu rice was the highest furthermore again compared to 2010 2019 the water economic productivity of wheat and cotton was higher than that of rice it surged even higher in 2010 2019 with an average growth rate of 40 and 55 respectively the results of energy economic productivity were shown in fig 7 the average energy economic productivity of cotton from 2010 to 2019 was 0 09 which was higher than that of the previous 20 years in addition the average growth rate in 2010 2019 was 37 higher than the rate in 2000 2009 from 2010 2019 the energy economic productivity of cotton in aksu was higher 0 11 mj than in the other study regions finally during 1990 1999 the energy economic productivity of wheat was the lowest 0 03 mj with the average energy economic productivity of wheat in hotan being the lowest overall 0 02 mj fig 8 3 3 evolution trend of the wefni for the main crops 3 3 1 weight value for evaluation indicators the standardized values of water and energy consumption water and energy mass productivity and water and energy economic productivity indicators were formulated in eqs 9 and 10 further the average weights of rice wheat maize and cotton in the trb were determined by an entropy weight method the results indicated that among the four crops water and energy economic productivity had the highest weight while water and energy consumption had the lowest this also reflected that in the process of agricultural production economic benefits have become an important factor for promoting regional agricultural development in addition to considering the relationship between crops and regional climate conditions 3 3 2 wefni for the main crops fig 9 illustrated the variation trends in the wefni for rice wheat maize and cotton in the trb from 1990 to 2019 on the whole the wefni of crops experienced massive fluctuations and showed extremely unstable development furthermore the minimum value was close to zero indicating that the development of the agricultural planting system in the study area is not sustainable in terms of the main crops wheat had the highest wefni with an average of 0 45 followed by maize 0 43 rice 0 40 and cotton 0 35 cotton had both higher production costs and irrigation water requirements than the other three crops while wheat and maize had lower water and energy consumption this was consistent with the research results of sadeghi et al 2020 and karamian et al 2021 who calculated the wefni value of iran agriculture and found that the wefni value of wheat was higher than that of other crops both iran and the trb rely on irrigation for their agriculture which indicated that wheat may be more sustainable in an irrigated agricultural cropping system in arid areas and can coordinate various resources better due to the increased levels of machinery and irrigation efficiency leading to a reduction in rice labor input and energy consumption from irrigation rice total energy consumption in bayingol reached the highest level 42498 4 mj ha 1 in 2018 and the lowest level in 2019 energy consumption directly affected energy mass and economic productivity resulting in the highest indicators of energy mass and economic productivity occurring in 2019 as well as the highest level of rice wefni in 2019 and the lowest in 2018 the wefni of wheat in bayingol reached the highest value 0 85 in 2012 but dropped to 0 25 in 2019 from 2015 2019 the wefni of wheat in aksu kashgar and kizilsu kirghiz showed a linear decline mainly due to the increase in wheat water consumption year by year at the same time water consumption served as a negative indicator leading to a decrease in the wefni the maximum wefni of maize was 0 74 in bayingol in 2015 while the lowest wefni was 0 07 in kizilsu kirghiz in 1992 this demonstrated that even with the same crop there can be huge gaps between different regions overall the wefni of cotton experienced poor development in 2011 the nitrogenous fertilizer rate decreased significantly in the trb which affected the overall energy consumption the energy consumption was a negative indicator resulting in the highest cotton wefni in 2011 after 2011 the use of chemical fertilizers and agricultural film increased year by year resulting in an increase in energy consumption and a gradual decrease in wefni for instance the value of cotton in the hotan district in 2019 was the lowest 0 05 while its value in aksu in 1995 was the highest 0 82 similarly sustainable development was also unstable and showed large gaps 4 discussion 4 1 impact of cropping patterns on agricultural wef nexus changes in cropping patterns and planting area proved to be important factors that affected the development of agricultural wef nexus in the cropping patterns cotton maize and wheat occupied a large proportion of the planting area from the 1990 s onward the cotton planting area has shown a rising trend and the expansion has been particularly rapid since 2000 among the four studied crops cotton required an immense amount of blue water resources to meet its growth needs due to its long growth cycle and high crop coefficient a report by the international crisis group icg asia report suggests that a hectare of cotton needs 8000 10 000 m3 of irrigation water more than twice as much as that of wheat and maize zhupankhan et al 2017 therefore cotton being a highly water consuming cash crop is lower than the other three crops in the water consumption indicator the increase in acreage is directly associated with this increase in water and energy inputs according to the energy consumption of labor irrigation water chemical fertilizer and seeds during crop production irrigation water accounts for 50 of total energy consumption karamian et al 2021 the planting area of cotton was significantly larger than that of rice and other food crops resulting in higher total energy consumption and lower energy mass productivity in the present study high inputs of water resources and energy resulted in the low wefni of crops fig 9 in recent years cotton has required more water and fertilizers which has led to poor agricultural input productivity and significant fluctuations in agricultural cropping systems whereas food crops such as wheat and maize are more efficient this also reflects that the optimization of agricultural cropping patterns to reduce water and energy consumption has had an important impact on the sustainable development of agriculture sadeghi et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 for example central asia has adopted a safe food policy reducing the planting area of cotton and increasing the planting area of wheat which has greatly saved water resources and ensured the security of agricultural water wegerich et al 2015 there were difficulties in achieving a rapid transformation of the existing planting patterns in the trb xinjiang is a high quality cotton production base in china but it is also the only long staple cotton production area long et al 2021 in addition the one black and one white strategy was implemented in the 1990 s and the one white was cotton which is the main reason why cotton cultivation has been widely promoted since the 1990 s however a warming climate leads to changes in cumulative temperature and crop phenology will also change amnuaylojaroen et al 2021 for example rising temperatures may shorten the growing cycle of cotton thus reducing its water requirements and providing a better environment for cotton growth wang et al 2008 in addition planting cotton has proven beneficial to increasing farmers income according to the crop transaction prices published by the world bank the average transaction price of cotton in 1990 2019 was 1766 54 ha which was eight times the price of wheat and seven times the price of maize this has increased the income of local farmers alleviating poverty and giving cotton higher energy economic productivity than the other three main crops finding ways to save water optimize high energy efficiency and improve agricultural productivity are urgently needed if existing cropping and consumption patterns are not changed fan et al 2020 fang et al 2018 pointed out that surface water and groundwater are the main sources of agricultural water in the trb which used 95 of its blue water resources and produced 40 of the region s gdp long et al 2021 therefore the amount of water used for crop irrigation far exceeded the regional water resources productivity making the pressure on regional water resources increasingly serious over 88 of irrigation water in the trb comes from surface water and 12 from groundwater zhong et al 2009 due to the use of surface irrigation systems crops are irrigated less efficiently leading to increased water use and directly resulting in higher irrigation energy inputs prior 2010 the highest irrigation efficiency in the trb was 0 42 which meant that irrigation water use was almost twice what was required although any water that leaked during irrigation remained in the basin it meant that more energy was consumed to reduce the negative impact of this practice the government has invested 10 7 billion renminbi rmb in the trb since 2001 to strengthen watershed management renovate the plains reservoirs and develop drip irrigation water saving technology fang et al 2018 in 2015 the three red lines of the trb were implemented to strictly control agricultural water use efficiency xu 2014 with irrigation efficiency increasing to 0 56 in 2019 at the same time the mechanization of cotton production has been greatly improved and mechanical cotton picking was being promoted to reduce the input of labor and other energy therefore the crop water and energy mass productivity in the trb from 2010 to 2019 was significantly higher than that of the previous 20 years the government has recognized the importance of shifting from water consuming crops to water saving crops however it has not vigorously advocated the one black and one white strategy resulting in only a small decrease in the sown area of cotton in recent years fig 10 therefore according to the national energy and food security while pursuing economic benefits reasonable adjustment of cropping structure is critically important for the sustainable development of the agricultural planting system chen et al 2017 4 2 major adaption potential and uncertainties there are few studies that focus specifically on the wef nexus of the agricultural cropping systems in the trb compared with previous work the wefni approach proposed by el gafy et al 2017 has been used here to quantitatively evaluate the sustainability of the agricultural planting system in the study area this strategy provides provided detailed results for the optimization of agricultural cropping patterns that could be applied to the trb the resulted show that in terms of crop types wheat and maize were more sustainable in irrigated agricultural cropping systems while cotton was less sustainable fang et al 2018 karamian et al 2021 long et al 2021 wang et al 2019 spatially the wefni of crops in aksu were the highest while those in kashgar were the lowest this should not be surprising as kashgar hotan and kizilsu kirghiz are state level poor areas that lack both modernized water resources management and economic development aksu however as one of the main irrigated areas of the trb has a higher cotton yield than the other areas as well as a more robust economic income and large index weight there were two major uncertainties in this study the first of which was the uncertainty of irrigation water requirements although statistical data record irrigation water requirements at the regional scale the actual irrigation water requirements of crops could not be collected therefore theoretical irrigation water requirements of crops have been used in lieu of actual irrigation water requirements a second uncertainty was that this study did not consider agricultural ghg emissions to optimize cropping patterns therefore future research should consider quantifying agricultural ghg emissions and optimizing crop wefni to help decision makers optimize cropping patterns 5 conclusions the present study characterized changes in water and energy consumption for the four main crops rice wheat maize and cotton and investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of water and energy productivity in the trb from 1990 to 2019 in addition trends in the wefni for main crops were calculated using the wefni approach and the driving factors were discussed the findings from this research were expected to provide new insights into the management of agricultural cropping patterns in the trb 1 the blue water requirements for rice wheat maize and cotton in the trb from 1990 2019 were 7283 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 3174 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 4271 8 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and 8769 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively while the minimum energy consumption of maize was 2 4 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 overall wheat and maize had the lowest water and energy consumption respectively 2 the water and energy mass productivity of the main crops in the trb was higher in 2010 2019 than in 1990 2010 wheat had the highest water mass productivity 1 5 kg m3 while maize had the highest energy mass productivity 0 26 kg mj however the energy economic productivity of cotton was higher than that of the other three crops 0 065 mj 3 wheat showed the highest wefni in the trb during the entire study period with an average of 0 45 followed by maize 0 43

basin trb is an important index that reflects agricultural inputs productivity this study used the crop water requirement energy equivalent and agricultural water energy food nexus index wefni model to comprehensively evaluate the water and energy consumption water and energy productivity and the wefni of the main crops rice wheat maize and cotton in the trb from 1990 to 2019 the results indicated that different crops had significant differences in water and energy consumption the blue water requirements of wheat maize rice and cotton were 3174 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 4271 8 m3 ha 1 yr 1 7283 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and 8769 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively of these crops wheat had the lowest blue water requirements and cotton had the highest in addition the planting area of the trb increased by 105 104 ha during the study period with cotton accounting for 45 of the total planting area the expansion of the planting area led to a continuous improvement in cotton production income leading to the highest energy economic productivity in cotton 0 065 mj however the increase in total water and energy consumption water and energy mass productivity in cotton were lower than in the other three crops 0 15 kg m3 and 0 04 kg mj the average wefni of rice wheat maize and cotton was 0 40 0 45 0 43 and 0 35 respectively this demonstrated that wheat had the highest resources utilization productivity in agricultural inputs while cotton had the lowest these results can provide an important scientific basis for current and future agricultural management optimization keywords wef nexus index cropping

human survival and development and their internal coupling contributes to the realization of regional sustainable development goals chai et al 2020 chen et al 2020 rasul 2016 zhang et al 2018 at present the internal coupling is affected by external factors such as climate change and covid 19 leading to a significant increase in human demand for water energy and food abbott et al 2019 duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 piao et al 2010 it is expected that by 2050 the global demand for these three factors will increase by 55 80 and 60 respectively zuo et al 2021 such massive increases will undoubtedly pose a correspondingly massive threat to the water energy and food security of all countries especially in developing nations where resources are either insufficient or badly managed amnuaylojaroen et al 2021 miralles wilhelm 2016 shi et al 2020 water energy food wef nexus is used to describe the complex and close relationship between the three factors hua et al 2021 shi et al 2021 for example food and energy production and consumption require a large amount of water for irrigation and cooling while water extraction transportation and distribution need energy support at the same time food generates energy in the form of biomass energy el gafy et al 2017 li et al 2021c wen et al 2022 zuo et al 2021 therefore it is important to clarify the complex relationship between water energy and food in order to make rational use of the wef nexus thereby alleviating the crisis of resources shortage and helping to realize the coordinated development of resources el gafy et al 2017 ma et al 2021 agriculture is the main driving force of wef nexus development but it is also the main consumer of water resources and energy in the world guan et al 2020 miralles wilhelm 2016 as well agriculture plays an important role in social and economic development research shows that irrigation and food processing consume 70 of global freshwater resources and 30 of total energy fan et al 2020 garcia et al 2019 this high level of consumption is particularly evident in the tarim river basin trb in china s sparsely populated northwest which has a unique geographical location characterized by extreme aridity and oasis agriculture long et al 2021 at the same time water resources are an important factor restricting social and economic development fang et al 2018 shen et al 2013 unlike humid areas the trb generally has irrigated agriculture and irrigation water in the trb accounts for about 95 of the region s total water consumption fang et al 2018 the main water resources in the trb are glacier snow meltwater but it is difficult to use these resources directly as they are stored in high mountain locales huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021a with the expansion of planting area over the past several decades surface water resources have been unable to meet the needs of agricultural irrigation so groundwater is being used for irrigation this has caused the gradual depletion of groundwater especially in recent years fang et al 2018 wang et al 2021b in addition according to the xinjiang statistical yearbook the input of chemical fertilizers in the trb has increased by 91 104 tonnes since 1990 while it is true that a high proportion of inputs of water resources and chemical fertilizers leads to an increase in agricultural output it also leads to a drop in groundwater tables and a deterioration in water quality wang et al 2021b it is worth mentioning that agriculture is a major source of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases ghg emissions accounting for about 20 of the ghg emissions and growing at a rate of 1 per year fabiani et al 2020 frank et al 2018 lamb et al 2016 wang et al 2019 excessive consumption of irrigation and chemical fertilizer produces a large amount of carbon emissions which greatly affects the sustainable development of agriculture and exacerbates the contradiction between water energy and food in the agricultural cropping systems hasanzadeh saray et al 2022 several studies apply the water energy food nexus index wefni as a new perspective of agricultural management to comprehensively evaluate the wef nexus in the cropping systems el gafy et al 2017 fabiani et al 2020 gathala et al 2020 karamian et al 2021 li et al 2021c sadeghi et al 2020 the approach not only focuses on the connection of a single factor but also considers the balance between water and energy consumption productivity and benefits to the cropping systems sadeghi et al 2020 applied the wefni approach to quantitatively study 14 crops in the shazand basin of markazi province iran he found that sugar cane and cucumber had the lowest wefni karamian et al 2021 explored the applicability of the wefni approach on a farm scale for the first time demonstrating that wheat has a higher agricultural inputs efficiency hasanzadeh saray et al 2022 applied the wefni approach to study 7 crops in northwest iran showing silage corn as having the highest index therefore the wefni approach would be helpful for studying the wef nexus relationship in agricultural management to improve the efficiency of resources utilization jamali et al 2021 previous studies on the wef nexus in trb s agricultural management have experienced the single factor of water resources water food and water food climate change shen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 over the past half century the trb has felt the impact of climate change and the rate of the temperature rise is significantly higher than the global average level of 0 22 10a chen et al 2016 2014 li et al 2021b xiang et al 2020 in addition the start time of accumulated temperature 10 in the basin is 7 days earlier and the end time 12 days later which to some extent facilitates the expansion of grain sown area and the increase in yield liu et al 2021 studies have also indicated that crop water demand has increased at a high rate of 9 47 mm yr 1 fang et al 2018 these studies however ignore agricultural energy consumption huang et al 2018 long et al 2021 although agricultural energy consumption plays a dominant role in the wef nexus it is unclear how the wef nexus has coordinated development in the agricultural management of the trb based on the above analyses the present study took the trb as the study area and incorporated the three factors of water energy and food into the investigation of agricultural cropping systems the objectives of this research work were 1 to calculate the water and energy consumption of the main crops in the trb from 1990 to 2019 and determine how water and energy productivity have changed and 2 to quantitatively evaluate the trends of the wefni for the main crops by the wefni approach and explore the influencing factors 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the trb is located in northwest china with a drainage area of 1 02 106 km2 fig 1 it is bordered by the tienshan mountains to the north the kunlun mountains to the south and the pamir plateau to the west the basin has a typical temperate arid continental climate with scarce precipitation and high rates of evaporation the annual average precipitation from 1989 to 2015 was 17 4 42 0 mm while the annual evaporation was 2500 3000 mm the trb is a dissipative inland river with dominant glacier snow meltwater contributing to the flow the annual average runoff is 398 108 m3 at present only the aksu river yarkand river hotan river kaidu kongque river and tarim river are connected by surface water forming a drainage system pattern of four sources and one trunk chen et al 2011 fang et al 2018 huang et al 2021 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the administrative regions include the bayingol mongolian autonomous prefecture aksu region kizilsu kirghiz autonomous prefecture kashgar region hotan region and 56 farms under xinjiang construction corps in terms of the region s economic conditions the trb is dominated by intensive irrigated agriculture rice maize cotton and wheat are the main crops covering about 80 of the planting area they are planted in oases on the edge of deserts and rely on surface water and groundwater for irrigation fang et al 2018 ling et al 2019 long et al 2021 wang et al 2021a xue et al 2019 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data for this study were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn en a total of 26 meteorological observation stations with complete observation series were selected from the trb the data of the observation sites were selected for the years 1990 2019 for a total of 30 years the main meteorological factors include daily precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature average wind speed sunshine hours and relative humidity 2 2 2 socio economic data the socio economic data for this research were collected from the xinjiang statistical yearbook 1991 2020 xinjiang water resources bulletin 2001 2016 china price yearbook 1991 2019 national agricultural cost benefit data assembly 1991 2020 and china water bulletin 2017 2020 the data mainly include crop acreage crop yield labor input agricultural film pesticides machinery irrigation efficiency diesel seeding rate and fertilizer application amounts for five prefectures in the trb crop coefficients are derived from the literature with region specific data shen et al 2013 zhai et al 2021 while crop sales price data were sourced from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao https www fao org home zh 2 2 3 survey data a survey was conducted among farmers in bayingol xinjiang province bayingol is an important oasis agricultural production area in the trb taking bayingol as an example this study collected data on the crop growth cycle of different crops in the research area table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water energy food nexus index wefni model framework building in this study wefni is introduced to evaluate agricultural inputs productivity cropping systems development by establishing an agricultural wefni model fig 2 illustrates the wefni model framework for the trb including three relationships of water and energy water and food and energy and food there are six evaluation indicators in total which are applied to four crops namely rice wheat maize and cotton water consumption water mass productivity and water economic productivity are used to measure the relationship between water and food while energy consumption energy mass productivity and energy economic productivity are used to measure the relationship between energy and food in addition as the population of the basin continues to increase and the irrigated area to expand the relationship between water and energy is expressed through energy consumption which also increases energy demand to some extent taking into account crop production cost and income water and energy consumption and water and energy productivity this study adopts the wefni as the evaluation standard for crop agricultural inputs productivity el gafy et al 2017 fabiani et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 2 3 2 water and energy consumption indicators we assume that water consumption is equal to crop water requirement cwr fan et al 2020 karamian et al 2021 the latter which includes two factors green water and blue water green water is provided by rain and stored in unsaturated soil as water mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 blue water is the amount of water provided through irrigation mao et al 2021 the green water requirement of crops is equal to the effective precipitation during the growing season the thiessen method fig s1 is used to determine the cwr of each crop based on the observation data of meteorological stations wang et al 2021a the green water requirements cwrgreen m3 ha 1 yr 1 and blue water requirements cwrblue m3 ha 1 yr 1 are calculated in eqs 1 and 2 respectively as follows 1 cwr green 10 n d 1 et green 2 cwr blue 10 n d 1 et blue where etgreen mm d 1 and etblue mm d 1 are the crop evapotranspiration from precipitation and irrigation water respectively n is the length of the growing period for a crop within one year and the constant value 10 is used to convert the water depth mm to the volume of water m3 ha 1 this is calculated in eqs 3 and 4 as follows 3 et green min et c p e 4 et blue max 0 et c p e where etc mm d 1 is the crop evapotranspiration for the month and pe mm d 1 is the effective precipitation available to each crop type this relationship is formulated in eq 5 5 et c k c et o where kc is the crop coefficient and eto mm d 1 is the reference evapotranspiration of the reference crop table s1 which is calculated using cropwat 8 0 software mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 additionally kc is a coefficient expressing the difference in evapotranspiration between the cropped area and a reference grass surface table 1 pe is calculated using the empirical formula derived by the u s department of agriculture soil conservation service fan et al 2020 the parameter is calculated as expressed in eq 6 p e p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 for p 8 3 mm d 1 6 p e 4 17 0 1 p for p 8 3 mm d 1 where p is daily precipitation mm d 1 the energy consumption indicator denotes direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption in this case direct energy consumption refers to diesel fuel labor and irrigation water karamian et al 2021 the cwr is used to calculate the irrigation water requirement which also needs to consider irrigation efficiency and loss of farmland by rivers in general the irrigation water requirement is higher than cwr the main calculation method multiplies cwr by crop planting area divided by irrigation efficiency table s2 indirect energy consumption refers to the input of chemical fertilizers pesticides seeds agricultural film and farm machinery in crop production according to field visits fertilizer energy consumption accounts for the main indirect energy use and is determined by the planting area of crops therefore we assign the fertilizer energy consumption to the four crops by using the crop sown area as a weighting coefficient ghaderpour and rafiee 2017 sadeghi et al 2020 the energy equivalent is used to represent the primary energy inputs associated with the manufacture of production tools hülsbergen et al 2001 rajpoot et al 2021 there are obvious changes in the energy equivalent between different studies which is mainly due to different calculation methods and regional boundaries fabiani et al 2020 jat et al 2020 venkatalaxmi et al 2004 zahedi et al 2015 the energy equivalent is not invariable and must be modified according to local conditions and regional agricultural production characteristics according to the actual situation of input and output in agricultural production in china yi and gao 1998 and hu et al 2011 determined the energy equivalent standard of main agricultural production materials in the nation s cropping system therefore the energy equivalent value of the present study adopts this standard taking the trb as an example the energy input in the investigated area is multiplied by the energy equivalent table 2 to calculate the total energy consumption of crop production in the study area fan et al 2020 yadav et al 2017 the total amount of energy consumed in the production process of agricultural machinery ei is calculated as shown in eq 7 7 e i n am ni ee n mr where ei is the total amount of energy consumed by agricultural machinery in the production process of i crops amni is the number of the n agricultural machinery used for i crop een is the energy equivalent of type n agricultural machinery and mr is the depreciation rate of agricultural machinery in this paper mr takes a fixed value of 10 zhen et al 2017 2 3 3 water and energy productivity indicators the water and energy productivity of the agricultural cropping system has been evaluated by crop yield crop income and costs zahedi et al 2015 the indicators for water and energy productivity are calculated using the formulas shown in table 3 the higher the water and energy mass productivity indicators the higher the efficiency of water and energy use the higher the water and energy economic productivity the better the economic benefits of water and energy consumption karamian et al 2021 yield grain production per hectare water water consumption per hectare energy the amount of input energy consumed per hectare tr total income of main crops per hectare tc total cost of main crops per hectare 2 3 4 water energy food nexus index wefni wefni is calculated using eq 8 as proposed by el gafy et al 2017 8 wefni i 1 n w i s ij i 1 n w i where sij is the standardized indicator value in the j year wi is the weight of each indicator and n is the number of indicators in this study the entropy method text s1 is used to assign weights objectively to each indicator which avoids the subjectivity of artificial weight assignment to a certain extent the entropy method calculates the information entropy of indicators by analyzing the dispersion degree between indicators and the amount of information carried by each indicator the larger the entropy value the greater the difference between indicators in other words the larger the differential coefficient the greater the weight of indicators in the evaluation system li et al 2021a due to the different sizes of each unit wefni cannot be directly calculated therefore all indicators need to be normalized to obtain dimensionless values for which eqs 9 and 10 as proposed by malakar and lu 2021 can be used 9 positive s ij x ij x min x max x min 10 negative s i j x max x i j x max x min where xij is the actual value of each indicator xmax is the maximum value of the evaluation indicator and xmin is the minimum value of the evaluation indicator 3 results 3 1 water and energy consumption changes for the main crops 3 1 1 water consumption as can be seen in fig 3 the water consumption of each crop was mainly blue water irrigation with less green water resources being used the main reason for the heavy reliance on blue water irrigation is that the regional climate is arid evaporation is strong and precipitation is scant so green water resources cannot be obtained as reliably fang et al 2018 tao et al 2011 xia et al 2022 there were some key differences in blue water consumption among the crops in terms of crop types the cwrblue for cotton was the highest 8769 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 followed by rice 7283 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 maize 4271 8 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and wheat 3174 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 except for bayingol and aksu the other three regions kizilsu kirghiz kashgar and hotan had the lowest proportion of cwrblue for cotton and rice in 2010 dipping below 0 90 however kizilsu kirghiz kashgar and hotan had the highest proportion of cwrblue for wheat in 2007 measuring 0 95 0 95 and 0 96 meanwhile from 2004 to 2009 the cwrblue for maize in hotan was higher than the average level of the trb all of which were greater than 5000 m3 ha 1 yr 1 in terms of spatial distribution the cwrblue of the main crops rice wheat maize and cotton in kizilsu kirghiz was lower than the other four regions recorded as 7100 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 2808 6 m3 ha 1 yr 1 3864 5 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and 8298 4 m3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively these amounts were all lower than the average level of cwrblue for the main crops this also reflected that compared with the other four regions the cwrgreen in kizilsu kirghiz was relatively abundant at 979 5 m3 ha 1 yr 1 the research results were consistent with those of fang et al 2018 3 1 2 energy consumption fig 4 showed that cotton and rice had the highest average energy consumption in the trb from 1990 to 2019 at 3 83 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 and 3 81 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 respectively compared to the other three staple crops the higher energy consumption per hectare of cotton was mainly due to the higher irrigation water requirement and agricultural film wang et al 2019 the total energy consumption of cotton in kashgar and aksu was the highest over the study periods at 85 108 mj yr 1 and 84 108 mj yr 1 furthermore in the important irrigation regions of kashgar and aksu in the trb cotton planting area increased by 436 6 104 ha and 297 7 104 ha resulting in increased inputs of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the total energy input of aksu rice was 5 108 mj yr 1 which was higher than the other four regions in addition the irrigation water requirement of rice in the trb during the same timeframe was much higher than that of wheat and maize and directly led to increases in rice energy input at 2 4 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 and 2 5 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 maize and wheat had the lowest average energy consumption per hectare the average energy consumption of wheat was higher than that of maize because the seeding rate of wheat was higher according to the statistical results the average seeding rate of wheat during the study period was 322 kg ha and the average seed seeding amount of maize was 61 kg ha the energy consumption per hectare of wheat and maize in kizilsu kirghiz was the lowest 2 4 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 and 2 3 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 thus compared with aksu and kashgar the planting area directly affected the use of fertilizer fuel which was consistent with the findings of fabiani et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 irrigation water and nitrogenous fertilizer account for a high proportion of the total energy consumption of the main crops in the trb it was worth noting that the energy input of wheat seeds was higher than that of other crops according to the national agricultural cost benefit data assembly the sowing amount of seeds per hectare was 332 kg ha which was higher than that of rice 150 kg ha the higher proportion of fertilizer in wheat and maize was consistent with the findings of karamian et al 2021 despite the large amount of fertilizer input leading to an increase in grain yield and making the wef coupling degree of wheat and maize higher and more closely related the chemical fertilizer had a certain negative impact on farmland water quality and agricultural sustainability wang et al 2021b moreover the trb is located in arid northwest china where nearly all agriculture is irrigated in 1990 the trb had an irrigation efficiency of only 0 38 which was quite low and necessitated high amounts of surface water irrigation and more energy consumption after 2000 with the improvements in irrigation water saving technology and the proposal of the three red lines irrigation efficiency increased to 0 56 by 2019 wang et al 2019 from this we can see that improvements in water saving technology can reduce the corresponding energy use 3 2 spatial temporal variations in water and energy productivity 3 2 1 water and energy mass productivity table 4 showed the yield of the main crops in the trb during 1990 2019 according to the data wheat had the highest annual average crop yield 228 0 104 tonnes followed by maize 204 8 104 tonnes cotton 99 4 104 tonnes and rice 23 1 104 tonnes the average annual yield of wheat and maize in kashgar were 97 0 104 tonnes and 91 2 104 tonnes respectively accounting for 43 and 45 of the total wheat and maize yield in the trb respectively the average annual yield of cotton and rice in aksu were 39 3 104 tonnes and 12 4 104 tonnes respectively accounting for 39 and 54 of the total output of cotton and rice in the study area respectively fig 6a b c and d illustrated the water mass productivity of the main crops in the trb during the study period the higher the water mass productivity the less irrigated water will be used to produce the same grain and the better the ecological environment sadeghi et al 2020 in terms of crop types wheat maize and rice had the highest water mass productivity while cotton had the lowest 1 5 kg m3 1 3 kg m3 0 96 kg m3 and 0 15 kg m3 respectively moreover wheat had the highest water mass productivity mainly because its yield was higher than that of other crops table 4 and the irrigation water amount was lower which was consistent with the research results of molden et al 2010 from 2010 2019 the average water mass productivity of wheat was 1 6 kg m3 which was higher than that of the previous 20 years this indicated that the development of water saving irrigation technologies such as the drip irrigation system and optimized water distribution played an important role in improving water mass productivity long et al 2021 according to the xinjiang statistical yearbook the effective water saving area in the trb increased from 0 48 to 0 56 water mass productivity of wheat in the aksu was the highest 1 6 kg m3 followed by bayingol kashgar kizilsu kirghiz and hotan fig 6e f j and h showed the energy mass productivity of the main crops in the trb during 1990 2019 cotton had the lowest energy mass productivity followed by rice and wheat while maize had the highest 0 04 kg mj 0 20 kg mj 0 21 kg mj and 0 26 kg mj respectively the energy mass productivity indicator was mainly influenced by two factors energy input amount and crop yield compared to rice cotton had a higher energy input amount per hectare and much lower energy mass productivity mainly because the planting area of cotton was much larger than that of rice fig 9 from 1990 2010 the planting area of cotton increased from 21 5 104 to 114 2 104 ha the rice planting area accounted for only 0 05 of the cotton planting area and the irrigation water consumption accounted for only 0 9 5 of the total irrigation water wang et al 2019 the average energy mass productivity of cotton from 2010 to 2019 was 0 07 kg mj which was higher than that of the previous two periods with the improvements in irrigation efficiency and the development of agricultural automation crop yield increased at the same time the amount of water and labor required for irrigation declined resulting in higher energy mass productivity for cotton in 2010 2019 than in 1990 2010 fang et al 2018 3 2 2 water and energy economic productivity fig 7 clearly showed that the annual average water economic productivity of maize was the highest in the trb during the study period followed by wheat cotton and rice 0 30 m3 0 28 m3 0 26 m3 and 0 24 m3 respectively as a cash crop the transaction price of cotton increased 1766 5 tonne 1 yr 1 which was higher than the transaction price for other three grain crops however the water consumption of cotton was also significantly higher than that of grain crops therefore the water economic productivity of cotton during the study period was low meanwhile the transaction price of maize was 251 8 tonne 1 yr 1 which was higher than that of wheat and the water consumption of maize was lower than that of cotton making the water economic productivity of maize higher however cotton 0 065 mj required more energy economic productivity than maize 0 060 mj followed by rice 0 050 mj and wheat 0 039 mj compared to 2000 2009 the water economic productivity of maize grew fastest in 2010 2019 at a rate of 60 from 2010 2019 aksu maize had the highest water economic productivity 0 57 m3 followed by bayingol 0 51 m3 kashgar 0 47 m3 hotan 0 38 m3 and kizilsu kirghiz 0 32 m3 the average water economic productivity of rice in 1990 1999 0 16 m3 was lower than that in either 2000 2009 or 2010 2019 from 1990 1999 water economic productivity for bayingol rice was the lowest and aksu rice was the highest furthermore again compared to 2010 2019 the water economic productivity of wheat and cotton was higher than that of rice it surged even higher in 2010 2019 with an average growth rate of 40 and 55 respectively the results of energy economic productivity were shown in fig 7 the average energy economic productivity of cotton from 2010 to 2019 was 0 09 which was higher than that of the previous 20 years in addition the average growth rate in 2010 2019 was 37 higher than the rate in 2000 2009 from 2010 2019 the energy economic productivity of cotton in aksu was higher 0 11 mj than in the other study regions finally during 1990 1999 the energy economic productivity of wheat was the lowest 0 03 mj with the average energy economic productivity of wheat in hotan being the lowest overall 0 02 mj fig 8 3 3 evolution trend of the wefni for the main crops 3 3 1 weight value for evaluation indicators the standardized values of water and energy consumption water and energy mass productivity and water and energy economic productivity indicators were formulated in eqs 9 and 10 further the average weights of rice wheat maize and cotton in the trb were determined by an entropy weight method the results indicated that among the four crops water and energy economic productivity had the highest weight while water and energy consumption had the lowest this also reflected that in the process of agricultural production economic benefits have become an important factor for promoting regional agricultural development in addition to considering the relationship between crops and regional climate conditions 3 3 2 wefni for the main crops fig 9 illustrated the variation trends in the wefni for rice wheat maize and cotton in the trb from 1990 to 2019 on the whole the wefni of crops experienced massive fluctuations and showed extremely unstable development furthermore the minimum value was close to zero indicating that the development of the agricultural planting system in the study area is not sustainable in terms of the main crops wheat had the highest wefni with an average of 0 45 followed by maize 0 43 rice 0 40 and cotton 0 35 cotton had both higher production costs and irrigation water requirements than the other three crops while wheat and maize had lower water and energy consumption this was consistent with the research results of sadeghi et al 2020 and karamian et al 2021 who calculated the wefni value of iran agriculture and found that the wefni value of wheat was higher than that of other crops both iran and the trb rely on irrigation for their agriculture which indicated that wheat may be more sustainable in an irrigated agricultural cropping system in arid areas and can coordinate various resources better due to the increased levels of machinery and irrigation efficiency leading to a reduction in rice labor input and energy consumption from irrigation rice total energy consumption in bayingol reached the highest level 42498 4 mj ha 1 in 2018 and the lowest level in 2019 energy consumption directly affected energy mass and economic productivity resulting in the highest indicators of energy mass and economic productivity occurring in 2019 as well as the highest level of rice wefni in 2019 and the lowest in 2018 the wefni of wheat in bayingol reached the highest value 0 85 in 2012 but dropped to 0 25 in 2019 from 2015 2019 the wefni of wheat in aksu kashgar and kizilsu kirghiz showed a linear decline mainly due to the increase in wheat water consumption year by year at the same time water consumption served as a negative indicator leading to a decrease in the wefni the maximum wefni of maize was 0 74 in bayingol in 2015 while the lowest wefni was 0 07 in kizilsu kirghiz in 1992 this demonstrated that even with the same crop there can be huge gaps between different regions overall the wefni of cotton experienced poor development in 2011 the nitrogenous fertilizer rate decreased significantly in the trb which affected the overall energy consumption the energy consumption was a negative indicator resulting in the highest cotton wefni in 2011 after 2011 the use of chemical fertilizers and agricultural film increased year by year resulting in an increase in energy consumption and a gradual decrease in wefni for instance the value of cotton in the hotan district in 2019 was the lowest 0 05 while its value in aksu in 1995 was the highest 0 82 similarly sustainable development was also unstable and showed large gaps 4 discussion 4 1 impact of cropping patterns on agricultural wef nexus changes in cropping patterns and planting area proved to be important factors that affected the development of agricultural wef nexus in the cropping patterns cotton maize and wheat occupied a large proportion of the planting area from the 1990 s onward the cotton planting area has shown a rising trend and the expansion has been particularly rapid since 2000 among the four studied crops cotton required an immense amount of blue water resources to meet its growth needs due to its long growth cycle and high crop coefficient a report by the international crisis group icg asia report suggests that a hectare of cotton needs 8000 10 000 m3 of irrigation water more than twice as much as that of wheat and maize zhupankhan et al 2017 therefore cotton being a highly water consuming cash crop is lower than the other three crops in the water consumption indicator the increase in acreage is directly associated with this increase in water and energy inputs according to the energy consumption of labor irrigation water chemical fertilizer and seeds during crop production irrigation water accounts for 50 of total energy consumption karamian et al 2021 the planting area of cotton was significantly larger than that of rice and other food crops resulting in higher total energy consumption and lower energy mass productivity in the present study high inputs of water resources and energy resulted in the low wefni of crops fig 9 in recent years cotton has required more water and fertilizers which has led to poor agricultural input productivity and significant fluctuations in agricultural cropping systems whereas food crops such as wheat and maize are more efficient this also reflects that the optimization of agricultural cropping patterns to reduce water and energy consumption has had an important impact on the sustainable development of agriculture sadeghi et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 for example central asia has adopted a safe food policy reducing the planting area of cotton and increasing the planting area of wheat which has greatly saved water resources and ensured the security of agricultural water wegerich et al 2015 there were difficulties in achieving a rapid transformation of the existing planting patterns in the trb xinjiang is a high quality cotton production base in china but it is also the only long staple cotton production area long et al 2021 in addition the one black and one white strategy was implemented in the 1990 s and the one white was cotton which is the main reason why cotton cultivation has been widely promoted since the 1990 s however a warming climate leads to changes in cumulative temperature and crop phenology will also change amnuaylojaroen et al 2021 for example rising temperatures may shorten the growing cycle of cotton thus reducing its water requirements and providing a better environment for cotton growth wang et al 2008 in addition planting cotton has proven beneficial to increasing farmers income according to the crop transaction prices published by the world bank the average transaction price of cotton in 1990 2019 was 1766 54 ha which was eight times the price of wheat and seven times the price of maize this has increased the income of local farmers alleviating poverty and giving cotton higher energy economic productivity than the other three main crops finding ways to save water optimize high energy efficiency and improve agricultural productivity are urgently needed if existing cropping and consumption patterns are not changed fan et al 2020 fang et al 2018 pointed out that surface water and groundwater are the main sources of agricultural water in the trb which used 95 of its blue water resources and produced 40 of the region s gdp long et al 2021 therefore the amount of water used for crop irrigation far exceeded the regional water resources productivity making the pressure on regional water resources increasingly serious over 88 of irrigation water in the trb comes from surface water and 12 from groundwater zhong et al 2009 due to the use of surface irrigation systems crops are irrigated less efficiently leading to increased water use and directly resulting in higher irrigation energy inputs prior 2010 the highest irrigation efficiency in the trb was 0 42 which meant that irrigation water use was almost twice what was required although any water that leaked during irrigation remained in the basin it meant that more energy was consumed to reduce the negative impact of this practice the government has invested 10 7 billion renminbi rmb in the trb since 2001 to strengthen watershed management renovate the plains reservoirs and develop drip irrigation water saving technology fang et al 2018 in 2015 the three red lines of the trb were implemented to strictly control agricultural water use efficiency xu 2014 with irrigation efficiency increasing to 0 56 in 2019 at the same time the mechanization of cotton production has been greatly improved and mechanical cotton picking was being promoted to reduce the input of labor and other energy therefore the crop water and energy mass productivity in the trb from 2010 to 2019 was significantly higher than that of the previous 20 years the government has recognized the importance of shifting from water consuming crops to water saving crops however it has not vigorously advocated the one black and one white strategy resulting in only a small decrease in the sown area of cotton in recent years fig 10 therefore according to the national energy and food security while pursuing economic benefits reasonable adjustment of cropping structure is critically important for the sustainable development of the agricultural planting system chen et al 2017 4 2 major adaption potential and uncertainties there are few studies that focus specifically on the wef nexus of the agricultural cropping systems in the trb compared with previous work the wefni approach proposed by el gafy et al 2017 has been used here to quantitatively evaluate the sustainability of the agricultural planting system in the study area this strategy provides provided detailed results for the optimization of agricultural cropping patterns that could be applied to the trb the resulted show that in terms of crop types wheat and maize were more sustainable in irrigated agricultural cropping systems while cotton was less sustainable fang et al 2018 karamian et al 2021 long et al 2021 wang et al 2019 spatially the wefni of crops in aksu were the highest while those in kashgar were the lowest this should not be surprising as kashgar hotan and kizilsu kirghiz are state level poor areas that lack both modernized water resources management and economic development aksu however as one of the main irrigated areas of the trb has a higher cotton yield than the other areas as well as a more robust economic income and large index weight there were two major uncertainties in this study the first of which was the uncertainty of irrigation water requirements although statistical data record irrigation water requirements at the regional scale the actual irrigation water requirements of crops could not be collected therefore theoretical irrigation water requirements of crops have been used in lieu of actual irrigation water requirements a second uncertainty was that this study did not consider agricultural ghg emissions to optimize cropping patterns therefore future research should consider quantifying agricultural ghg emissions and optimizing crop wefni to help decision makers optimize cropping patterns 5 conclusions the present study characterized changes in water and energy consumption for the four main crops rice wheat maize and cotton and investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of water and energy productivity in the trb from 1990 to 2019 in addition trends in the wefni for main crops were calculated using the wefni approach and the driving factors were discussed the findings from this research were expected to provide new insights into the management of agricultural cropping patterns in the trb 1 the blue water requirements for rice wheat maize and cotton in the trb from 1990 2019 were 7283 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 3174 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 4271 8 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and 8769 3 m3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively while the minimum energy consumption of maize was 2 4 104 mj ha 1 yr 1 overall wheat and maize had the lowest water and energy consumption respectively 2 the water and energy mass productivity of the main crops in the trb was higher in 2010 2019 than in 1990 2010 wheat had the highest water mass productivity 1 5 kg m3 while maize had the highest energy mass productivity 0 26 kg mj however the energy economic productivity of cotton was higher than that of the other three crops 0 065 mj 3 wheat showed the highest wefni in the trb during the entire study period with an average of 0 45 followed by maize 0 43

9407,tillage practices have a profound influence on the propensity for overland flow formation the hydrological behavior of nine experimental plots was investigated by means of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and water retention analysis provided by single ring infiltrometer inf and rainfall simulator rs infiltration measurements the applied management practices encompassed no tillage reduced tillage and several forms of conventional tillage methods specifically the influence of wide and narrow sowing rows and the use of cover crops were examined finally the applicability of inf and rs for overland flow formation evaluation on cropped plots was compared the reduced tillage practices resulted in the ks and water retention increase implying a lower propensity for overland flow formation the ks in the reduced tillage plots were higher by 30 50 compared to conventionally tilled and by 20 compared to no tilled plots respectively the differences in water retention were less straightforward as the reduced tilled plots exhibited higher retention than conventionally tilled plots by 20 but lower values compared to no tilled plots in june by 15 the utilization of narrow sowing rows generally resulted in higher ks and enhanced water retention compared to wide rows the use of cover crops in the conventionally tilled plots led to a 40 increase in ks and a 90 increase in water retention hence the use of reduced tillage narrow sowing rows or cover crops in the conventionally tilled plots were found desirable for the mitigation of soil erosion flash flood occurrence and sufficient groundwater recharge eight times higher variance of ks using a single ring infiltrometer compared to rs indicated the incomparability of these two methods therefore the rs should be considered as a benchmark for evaluating the propensity to overland flow formation on cropped plots keywords rainfall simulator single ring infiltrometer infiltration saturated hydraulic conductivity overland flow maize data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction maize is the fifth most cultivated crop in the czech republic and represents approximately 13 of arable land czech statistical office et al 2021 with increasing subsidies for the construction of biogas plants the rise of maize cultivation as biomass fuel could be expected martinát et al 2016 however maize as a wide row crop poses a risk of overland flow and rill erosion due to overland flow occurrence especially on sloping lands alternative cultivation practices can reduce the above mentioned negative effects by applying residue crop cover or reduced tillage there has been extensive research regarding the impact of different tillage practices on soil hydraulic properties under various conditions and crop cultivations including maize reviews by strudley et al 2008 or skaalsveen et al 2019 showed however how complex it is to identify the most suitable agricultural procedure as it is determined by a unique combination of natural conditions and crop type moreover soil hydraulic properties do vary in space and time alletto et al 2015 šípek et al 2019 villarreal et al 2017 a complex response to tillage is well reflected supplemented or dominated by the temporal and spatial variability of plant growth climate and soil type for example logsdon et al 1993 documented changes between contrasting tillage practices significantly on temporal scale inconsistent conclusions can be presented also from results by hangen et al 2002 and miller et al 2000 where the first research presented more intensive vertical flow in macropores in low tilled soils pointing to increased vertical connectivity whereas the later observed such findings in conventional practices in spite of the ks being one of the most evaluated parameters it represents spatially and temporally highly variable processes seasonal variability of ks was also presented by khakural et al 1992 results showed a seasonally variable response of ks to contrasting tillage methods in a span of three years on one site and no difference on others with different soil types but similar climate and geological conditions water retention storage represents our second inspected soil hydraulic parameter often expressed as soil water holding capacity so far no consensus has been accepted in the literature on how altered soil properties under various tillage treatments affect soil water retention ability skaalsveen et al 2019 next to the variability of natural conditions inconsistent results can be assigned to applied methods and results interpretation over the implemented research studies examples of contradictory results between no tillage nt and conventional tillage ct on soil water content swc can be presented in results by josa and hereter 2005 who reports higher swc on nt on depth span of 20 cm whereas results by abdollahi et al 2014 inform about higher swc on ct in the depth of 12 25 cm relating higher swc to higher pore volume at this depth however opposite swc attributes were found near the ct surface plot potentially caused by smaller pore volume ugarte nano et al 2015 compared swc on repacked and undisturbed samples on nt and ct plots repacked samples used to separate the impact of soil properties showed significantly higher swc on nt plot at all matric potentials whereas undisturbed samples taken to represent the impact of tillage treatments resulted in a significant effect of nt on higher swc at high matric potentials only pointing to the importance of soil texture and structural properties as to the effect of sampling methods on results interpretation therefore recommendations for implementing cross comparison principles in the evaluation of tillage methods for future research are proposed strudley et al 2008 above mentioned studies however do not consider soil conditions from the surface characteristics point of view which may play a substantial role in water retention ability therefore armand et al 2009 leys et al 2010 and hösl and strauss 2016 focused on the effect of soil surface properties on soil erosion and overland flow revealing its reduction when conservation tillage methods were applied the main effect is attributed to the increased surface roughness supported by mulching or cover crop implementation causing the rise in infiltrability armand et al 2009 and increased transmission losses leys et al 2010 hösl and strauss 2016 presented contradictory results probably caused by inappropriate execution of conservation practice in real life even though the observed results outline only a moderate effect of conservational tillage on overland flow reduction compared to ct langhans et al 2019 results by leys et al 2010 report on the increasing effect of conservational tillage with an increasing plot scale however the stronger scale effect was noted rather for soil loss reduction than overland flow langhans et al 2019 also found that the overall level of runoff coefficient was most clearly affected by crop type wheat vs maize rather than tillage methods despite the studies mentioned above only very little research considers the potential of management practices for enhanced water retention and overland flow reduction with the presence of vegetation cover maize can hold up to 80 of rainfall if fully grown olesen and jensen 2017 which has the potential to affect the generation of overland flow therefore there is a need to consider the interception value caused by vegetation cover in the quantification of retention ability soil hydraulic properties can be determined by several methods either by assessing the amount of water contained in the soil itself by gravimetric calculations from ring soil samples or by non direct methods such as tensiometers measurements or it can be obtained by measurements of infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity infiltration rate and its steady state of saturated hydraulic conductivity can be measured directly in the field using a single inf or double ring infiltrometer guelf permeameter or in laboratory conditions using the soil permeameter these methods however cover only small areas 1 m² and it is necessary to repeat them at several positions in the experimental area jačka et al 2014 on the other hand in the case of the rainfall simulator rs method the area coverage is much larger with the potential to account for the interception effect of crops and reduction of variability compared to point measurements yet studies comparing rs with other point measurement methods are scarce gupta 1993 compared three point measurement methods with rs showing two times higher variability for guelph permeameter and infiltrometer to rs however the role of vegetation cover during the growing season was not considered the scope of this study is therefore 1 to compare the applicability of inf and rs for overland flow formation evaluation on cropped plots and 2 to investigate the impact of nine maize tillage practices ranging from conventional to various types of conservational tillage methods on the propensity to form overland flow by means of ks and water retention analysis provided by inf and rs infiltration measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment was layout place near the town of jevíčko czech republic 49 40 n 16 43 e on site situated at 386 m above sea level with an average slope of 6 fig 1 the surface flow pathways head directly to the face of the slope the average annual temperature at the site equals 8

climate with approximately uniform precipitation distribution and warm summers tolasz et al 2007 according to köppen 1936 the climate of the period of interest was characterized by below average precipitation in the 2016 2017 winter period followed by a medium wet vegetation season fig 2 air temperatures were close to their average values in all months except january 2017 which attained a monthly average air temperature of 7 6 c 5 4 c below its average value soil cover is formed by haplic luvisol iuss 2015 with loamy texture and low rock content the ratio of sand silt clay fractions is

influenced by the presence of water the volumetric soil moisture content was measured in the laboratory using nine undisturbed samples taken from each plot before measurement with rs or inf both values 15 3 1 3 in july 18 3 1 8 in august reflected warm and dry weather during the summer in the year 2017 the soil surface was without any post farming residuals which could affect the infiltration process see fig 3 2 2 tillage treatments nine different experimental maize plots 4 m x 40 m on the experimental field 60 60 m were established to analyze their propensity to overland flow formation in general they encompassed no tillage nt conventional tillage ct and reduced tillage strip till st treatments presented in more detail in fig 1 and table 1 briefly procedures began with autumn incorporation of crop residues by disk cultivator on all experimental plots in conventionally tilled plots that was followed by deep ploughing to the depth of 25 30 cm in mid november in spring a soil compactor was used before sowing into wide ct w ct cc narrow ct n and double row ct dr plots except for the case of fallow land ct fl which was kept without a crop for the whole experimental period in late may cover crop was sowed on the ct cc plot composed of spring wheat and field pea conservational treatments replaced deep ploughing for autumn soil loosening to the depth of 20 cm and compactor application before august and september rye sowing on nt and st plots respectively additionally strip till to the depth of 25 cm was applied in november on st a treatment in spring desiccation of the stand with total herbicide was followed by strip till to the depth of 20 cm and april maize sowing on both st plots on nt plots maize sowing in may was preceded by rye harvest june crop height reached 0 9 1 55 m with 50 coverage in august height was 2 4 2 8 m with 95 coverage kincl 2017 2 3 field measurements two types of measurement methods were used to analyse the impact of applied tillage treatments on the ability of soil to infiltrate water first a standard single ring inf infiltrometer and second a rainfall simulator rs single ring infiltrometer is more usable than its double ring version but sufficient for the purpose of this study moreover it describes soil surface conditions rather than guelph permeameter two measurement periods were conducted during the 2017 vegetation season at the end of june and in the middle of august june and august 2017 were dry and warm months which is indicated by low soil moisture at the side during both periods each measurement took three days from ca 8 30 18 00 with all installations of rs at each plot the weather was sunny and with low wind speed during all days 2 3 1 single ring infiltration rate measurement the infiltration rate was measured 2 3 times at each plot by automatic inf with a mariotte s bottle for a stable pressure head flow group cze a metal cylinder 10 5 cm in inner diameter 10 cm in height was stuck into the soil totally on which the main apparatus with water tank and water level sensor was installed the stable pressure head was set on only 4 0 5 cm from the soil surface the lowest which the inf allows to approach the ponding effect of heavy rainfall each measurement took from 30 min to 2 h until a steady state of infiltration rate when saturated hydraulic conductivity ks could be estimated the measured infiltration rates were then evaluated by phillips s approximation 1957 1 it a 0 5 s t 0 5 where i is infiltration rate m s 1 a means parameter s sorptivity m s 1 2 and t time min 2 3 2 rainfall simulator infiltration rate measurement and determination of water retention for the rainfall simulation the device developed at the research institute for soil and water conservation was applied to each experimental plot in both time periods water was sprinkled from cone nozzles operating at a pressure of 0 5 bar which was located at the height of 2 0 m above the terrain at the area of 25 m2 rainfall intensity was kept constant at 1 2 mm min 1 the rainfall simulation was set at 30 min at each plot the overland flow was measured by tipping buckets at the end of each sprinkling plot thus the infiltration rate of soil at every experimental plot was calculated as a difference between simulated rainfall and overland flow from the plot a more detailed view of the overland flow infiltration process determination from the beginning of the rainfall simulation till the steady state overland flow is shown in fig 4 at the beginning of the simulation rainfall is first wholly captured by the surface of the canopy interception capacity is filling fig 4 part a when the interception capacity of vegetation is filled water begins to fall to the surface of the soil here either overland flow occurs immediately or water infiltrates into the ground in both cases due to high rainfall intensity an overland flow will happen sooner or later at the beginning of the infiltration when water is redistributed to deeper soil horizons soil pores are filled with water gradually their volume depends mainly on porosity and soil moisture and can be determined as an effective porosity bear 1971 as the rainfall simulation continues effective porosity and the interception capacity are filled entirely with water and therefore can be negligible as the soil pores and interception capacity get saturated values of measured actual infiltration rate begin to equal the difference between the intensity of the simulated rainfall and the intensity of the overland flow fig 4 part b the point at which the infiltration rate measured at the time in fig 4 border between part b c starts to coincide with the measured calculated infiltration rate is difficult to predict however it is possible to precisely determine the steady state of overland flow that is the steady state of the infiltration velocity as the soil profile is saturated the resulting steady state value can be taken as the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the measured surface soil horizon retention capacity is affected not only by the soil layer but also by the interception capacity of vegetation cover crops during the growing season the idea of the soil plant system water retention capacity is represented in fig 4 as the a and b periods in the context of this sprinkling experiment the time from the beginning of rainfall simulation till the time of the steady state of overland flow or steady state of infiltration can be evaluated as the retention ability of the experimental plot fig 4 yellow area there are several ways in which the steady state of the overland flow can be evaluated for a quick and simplified solution a constant k method published by blume et al 2007 used to determine the end of the drain wave of the rainfall runoff event was used the method is theoretically based on the theory of linear storage by determining the recession coefficient k of the exponential function in eq 2 for all points on the hydrograph it is possible to identify the point in time after which k is approximately constant therefore k is calculated for each point by differentiating the equation 2 k dq dt 1 q t where k is recession coefficient q is outflow or discharge mm min 1 this method is based on the search for a minimum difference k 0 1 two times in a row in this case between the two following measurement values divided by 2 in a row of calculations for at least three subsequent calculations the water retention of experimental plots was assessed as a yellow area in fig 4 representing the amount of rainfall connecting points of beginning of the rainfall overland flow formation and attaining the stable outflow rate the water retention served as an indicator of the plot s susceptibility to soil erosion and the formation of flash floods after heavy rainfall the area was converted to mm of rain based on the constant rainfall intensity 1 2 mm min 1 3 results and discussion the rs and the inf were used to measure the ks and the time delay before the start of the overland flow formation characterizing the water retention capacity of each plot all the measurements were conducted twice during the 2017 growing season with the exception of the st s plot in august when both measurements are missing 3 1 insight into the applicability of single ring infiltrometer and rainfall simulator on maize cropped plots in june ks mean values of inf measurements reached up to four times higher than those obtained by rs fig 5 a comparison of ks coefficients of variance cv demonstrates higher variability for inf in all measuring periods fig 5 reaching up to eight times higher cv values in june and more than five times higher values in august than rs this fact was given by the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties such as macropores distribution soil cracks or initial soil moisture affecting inf measurements more than rs ones the reason behind was attributed to the difference in the spatial coverage of both measurements each single ring infiltrometer measurement characterizes the ks in an 87 cm2 plot compared to 250 000 cm2 in the case of a rainfall simulator this inevitably leads to a better representation of the plot infiltration rate which is obviously biased in the case of smaller single ring infiltrometer additionally the pearson correlation coefficient between ks values from rs and mean values from inf ranged from zero to 0 28 in june and august respectively suggesting the incomparability of results between these two methods therefore for further analysis of the propensity of maize tillage practices to form overland flow values from rs measurements were used although there are not many rs and inf comparison studies most of those performed report similar findings sidiras and roth 1987 and boers et al 1992 undertook measurements on clayey soil in brazil and sandy loam in nigeria respectively on plots with bare soil and cropped land in both studies double ring infiltrometers were used and the lower rs infiltration values were attributed to raindrop impact producing soil surface sealing and therefore faster formation of overland flow it reflected a more realistic process than the infiltrometer measurements in the case of verbist et al 2013 the main reason for higher infiltration rates obtained from infiltrometer was dependent on soil structure and method application like that in stony and dry soil in chile the inf insertion opened up preferential pathways and connected them to larger pores that were not active when the rs technique was used however the effect of method application can also lead to opposite results gupta 1993 explained their outcomes of lower infiltrometer values by manifestation of clay layer properties excavated for ring installation purposes preserved under topsoil in the case of rainfall simulation gómez et al 2001 attributed their lower ks infiltrometer measurement results compared to rs by intentionally omitting soil cracks that were included in rainfall simulations leading to higher values especially in line with our observations are resulted by gómez et al 2001 and verbist et al 2013 who refer to previous arguments of rs smoothing effect due to larger area coverage in our case inf measurements irregularities were caused by hardly visible macropores created by land cracking during a drought even though infiltrometers were installed to avoid any soil cracks or visible macropores some measurements were affected anyway a limited amount of inf measurements is not enough for the correct determination of ks the spatial ks variability extending over three orders of magnitude was reported e g by šípek et al 2019 in the uncultivated fluvisol at the plot of 100 m2 such variability was also documented by iqbal et al 2005 rosemary et al 2017 or usowicz and lipiec 2017 on several alluvial soils loamy sand alfisol and sandy podzol to avoid highly variable values obtained by inf measurements the standard dual ring infiltration could solve this problem with its larger infiltrating area however time or human resources necessary for dual ring infiltration operation would prolong measuring time moreover all plots would not be measured at the same time resulting in varied weather and soil conditions on the other hand rs has the potential to cover a larger area hence this method tends to smooth out measurement variability fig 5 and account for the crop interception effect compared to point measurements these facts place rs into a position of a more objective method in the sense of describing mean ks value water retention and overland flow formation on cropped plots verbist et al 2013 mentioned that the estimated final infiltration rate values will always depend on the measurement method as on the calculation technique used which invalidates the idea of a well defined and unique soil characteristic ks based on field measurements from our results as those discussed the variability of final ks values is therefore strongly recommended to be considered when interpreting the obtained measurements however to support the interpretation gupta 1993 offers other factors to consider relating to accuracy and precision when choosing the proper method for estimating hydraulic conductivity those are the ease of operation location of the measuring site availability of time and other resources and the ultimate usage of obtained values 3 2 propensity of maize tillage practices to form overland flow 3 2 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity from rs measurements affected by tillage practices the highest ks values were observed on ct cc 1 03 mm min 1 st s 1 03 mm min 1 and st a 0 95 mm min 1 plots in june and on st a 1 23 mm min 1 and ct cc 1 21 mm min 1 plots in august see fig 6 the positive effect of strip tillage st plots was also demonstrated by jabro et al 2011 where ks values on st plot exceeded those on conventionally tilled plot ct plots by 56 68 compared to the 23 30 on st a x ct w plots in our study in june and in august respectively lower difference between results can be assigned to differences in soil texture which was identified as sandy loam by jabro et al 2011 compared to loamy soil in the presented study according to their research higher ks value on the st plot is attributed to reduced soil compaction higher total porosity and lower bulk density even though st a treatment included one more strip till application in november lower ks values were measured at the st a compared to the st s plot compared to st and ct cc plots lower ks values in june were recorded on no tillage plots nt w 0 80 mm min 1 nt n 0 83 mm min 1 that were followed by even smaller values on conventionally tilled ct n 0 74 mm min 1 and ct w 0 73 mm min 1 plots similar findings between nt and ct were also reported by other researchers e g benjamin 1993 azooz and arshad 1996 attributing higher ks values under nt treatment to undisturbed continuity of soil pore structure also caused by endogenic earthworm activity tebrügge and düring 1999 nevertheless opposite results were also observed such as by heard et al 1988 khakural et al 1992 and haruna et al 2018 this ambiguity can be caused by soil climate and time scale of performed experiment inconsistencies across research studies just as by measurement procedures so it is not possible to generalize results without detailed information on all controlling factors strudley et al 2008 therefore it is possible to state that nt practices have slightly higher more favourable in terms of overland flow formation ks values than ct plots in the jeví čko research site s environment this assumption can be related to soil cracks creating macropores in nt plots moreover the difference between nt plots and ct w ct n plots increased in august simulations fig 6 the lowest values of ks were in both measurements reached on the ct fl plot namely 0 59 mm min 1 in june and 0 50 mm min 1 in august comparing wide row and narrow row sowing treatments nt n nt w and ct n nt w plots higher ks values were always observed on the nt n plot 0 83 and 1 04 mm min 1 in june and august respectively than on nt w plot 0 80 and 1 02 mm min 1 a similar trend is also reflected in plots with conventional treatment on ct n 0 74 mm min 1 and ct w 0 73 mm min 1 in june however this trend reversed in ct plots in august when ct n attained lower ks 0 80 mm min 1 than ct w 0 86 mm min 1 as changes in ks values were also observed between nt n and nt w treatments difference decreased it is possible to assume that the reversed situation on ct n and ct w plots results from maize growth development another interpretation of this slight change can be attributed to the higher susceptibility of wide row on ct w to soil drying and cracking leading to increased soil infiltrability a profound difference was observed between ct w and ct cc plots although the ct cc plot was treated just the same as the ct w plot except for cover crop cc sowing in may ks values are almost 30 higher than on the ct w plot similar findings were observed by haruna et al 2018 where higher ks values were reached on plots with the application of winter cover crop compared to plots with no cover crop although differences were not significant they were consistent with the slightly higher proportion of macropores observed within this treatment indicating the ability of cover crops to improve macropores effect and infiltration due to the activity of the roots improving pore connectivity and soil structure villamil et al 2006 as found by çerçioğlu et al 2019 the impact of cover crop application maybe even enhanced over the years sowing the maize into double rows ct dr resulted in intermediate values of ks of 0 83 mm min 1 in june and 0 94 mm min 1 in august the shape of the infiltration curve during the rs experiment fig 6 represents an indicator of the impact of applied treatments on overland flow occurrence during various precipitation lengths i e if two plots would have similar ks but one had a higher drop of infiltration rate following its initial value then this plot would be less prone to overland flow formation in short intense rainfall periods the highest infiltration rate drop was observed on the ct fl plot at 0 88 mm min 1 in june and 0 67 mm min 1 in august the most stable reactions were on the ct cc plot fig 6 in june the infiltration rate dropped only by 0 09 mm min 1 and no drop was recorded in the august simulation in the case of the remaining plots the recorded drops ranged from 0 2 mm min 1 to 0 6 mm min 1 higher ks values were generally observed in august measurement in all plots fig 6 except ct fl when august values 0 51 mm min 1 were lower than those in june 0 59 mm min 1 this seasonal variation of ks will be probably given by the observed indirect relationship between ks and soil wetness reported e g by zhou et al 2008 or šípek et al 2019 zeinalzadeh et al 2011 additionally also associated the increase in soil and water temperature with ks increases in the growing season 3 2 2 water retention affected by tillage practices the highest amount of simulated rainfall needed to form steady state overland flow was reached in august on the st a plot 26 0 mm fig 7 however water retention in june was one of the lowest 10 0 mm on this plot this significant difference can be attributed to the mechanical nature of soil cracking during dry summer increasing soil infiltration rather than to the hydraulic properties of non cracked soils the st s plot attained water retention of 23 4 mm in june documenting the efficiency of reduced tillage on the formation of overland flow the low propensity for the overland flow formation was also registered on ct cc 20 0 18 0 mm in june august experiment and nt n plots 17 2 21 8 mm the lowest water retention was attained in the ct w plot 10 7 9 2 mm followed by ct fl 15 5 12 2 mm nt w ct n and ct dr plots represented fluctuating water retention always attaining a lower value in august see fig 7 this overall decrease in water retention was observed at all plots on average by 27 8 the nt n and st a plots were the exceptions with rises of 26 7 and 160 8 respectively the overall decrease can be explained by higher volumetric water content before the measurements in august than in june on average 0 02 cm3 cm 3 which is the case of all sites except nt n attaining the same soil water content in june the same or higher water retention was observed on no tilled nt plots compared to conventionally tilled ct ones in june the water retention was 10 9 mm on nt w than on the ct w plot there was no difference when narrow sowing rows were contrasted in august the water retention was 11 9 mm on nt n than on the ct n plot in this case no difference was found between wide rows plots in the case of wide and narrow sowing row treatments on conventionally ct n ct w tilled plots higher water retention values and longer time lag to overland flow formation mainly were observed on narrow sowing row treatments at the beginning of the season the difference between ct w and ct n plots attained 6 6 mm conversely the difference in the water retention was in favour of wider rows in no tillage plots nt w and nt n by 4 4 mm on the other hand this trend reversed in august and a higher difference in overland flow initiation was observed between no tillage plots 12 4 mm whereas on conventionally tilled plots the difference dropped to zero the use of cover crop ct cc proved to have a positive effect on water retention increasing the precipitation threshold necessary for overland flow formation by 9 3 mm in june and 8 8 mm in august compared to conventionally tilled plot without cover crop ct w comparing the conventional corn seeding scheme in wide narrow and double sowing row with fallow land the water retention was consistently lowest in the wide row plot compared to the remaining fig 7 4 conclusion applying nine different maize tillage practices variously affected saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and water retention the most beneficial treatments in terms of sustainable water management were the plots where reduced tillage was applied in these plots the increased ks and water retention imply a reduced propensity for overland flow formation which is desirable for mitigating soil erosion alleviation of agricultural drought flash flood occurrence and sufficient groundwater recharge the conventionally and no tilled plots proved to have a lower ability to retain water and also lead to reduced infiltration among them the one where the cover crop was utilized is the only option to alleviate the above mentioned risks the comparison of single ring infiltrometer inf and rainfall simulator rs measurement methods applicability on maize grown plots resulted in much lower rs variability which was given its large scale coverage together with its ability to account for the crop interception effect this method can be considered a benchmark for evaluating mean ks value water retention and overland flow formation on cropped plots in summary maize can be grown in a hydrologically more responsible way than the one represented by standard conventional tillage this is a challenging opportunity for the effort to re establish the natural water

9407,tillage practices have a profound influence on the propensity for overland flow formation the hydrological behavior of nine experimental plots was investigated by means of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and water retention analysis provided by single ring infiltrometer inf and rainfall simulator rs infiltration measurements the applied management practices encompassed no tillage reduced tillage and several forms of conventional tillage methods specifically the influence of wide and narrow sowing rows and the use of cover crops were examined finally the applicability of inf and rs for overland flow formation evaluation on cropped plots was compared the reduced tillage practices resulted in the ks and water retention increase implying a lower propensity for overland flow formation the ks in the reduced tillage plots were higher by 30 50 compared to conventionally tilled and by 20 compared to no tilled plots respectively the differences in water retention were less straightforward as the reduced tilled plots exhibited higher retention than conventionally tilled plots by 20 but lower values compared to no tilled plots in june by 15 the utilization of narrow sowing rows generally resulted in higher ks and enhanced water retention compared to wide rows the use of cover crops in the conventionally tilled plots led to a 40 increase in ks and a 90 increase in water retention hence the use of reduced tillage narrow sowing rows or cover crops in the conventionally tilled plots were found desirable for the mitigation of soil erosion flash flood occurrence and sufficient groundwater recharge eight times higher variance of ks using a single ring infiltrometer compared to rs indicated the incomparability of these two methods therefore the rs should be considered as a benchmark for evaluating the propensity to overland flow formation on cropped plots keywords rainfall simulator single ring infiltrometer infiltration saturated hydraulic conductivity overland flow maize data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction maize is the fifth most cultivated crop in the czech republic and represents approximately 13 of arable land czech statistical office et al 2021 with increasing subsidies for the construction of biogas plants the rise of maize cultivation as biomass fuel could be expected martinát et al 2016 however maize as a wide row crop poses a risk of overland flow and rill erosion due to overland flow occurrence especially on sloping lands alternative cultivation practices can reduce the above mentioned negative effects by applying residue crop cover or reduced tillage there has been extensive research regarding the impact of different tillage practices on soil hydraulic properties under various conditions and crop cultivations including maize reviews by strudley et al 2008 or skaalsveen et al 2019 showed however how complex it is to identify the most suitable agricultural procedure as it is determined by a unique combination of natural conditions and crop type moreover soil hydraulic properties do vary in space and time alletto et al 2015 šípek et al 2019 villarreal et al 2017 a complex response to tillage is well reflected supplemented or dominated by the temporal and spatial variability of plant growth climate and soil type for example logsdon et al 1993 documented changes between contrasting tillage practices significantly on temporal scale inconsistent conclusions can be presented also from results by hangen et al 2002 and miller et al 2000 where the first research presented more intensive vertical flow in macropores in low tilled soils pointing to increased vertical connectivity whereas the later observed such findings in conventional practices in spite of the ks being one of the most evaluated parameters it represents spatially and temporally highly variable processes seasonal variability of ks was also presented by khakural et al 1992 results showed a seasonally variable response of ks to contrasting tillage methods in a span of three years on one site and no difference on others with different soil types but similar climate and geological conditions water retention storage represents our second inspected soil hydraulic parameter often expressed as soil water holding capacity so far no consensus has been accepted in the literature on how altered soil properties under various tillage treatments affect soil water retention ability skaalsveen et al 2019 next to the variability of natural conditions inconsistent results can be assigned to applied methods and results interpretation over the implemented research studies examples of contradictory results between no tillage nt and conventional tillage ct on soil water content swc can be presented in results by josa and hereter 2005 who reports higher swc on nt on depth span of 20 cm whereas results by abdollahi et al 2014 inform about higher swc on ct in the depth of 12 25 cm relating higher swc to higher pore volume at this depth however opposite swc attributes were found near the ct surface plot potentially caused by smaller pore volume ugarte nano et al 2015 compared swc on repacked and undisturbed samples on nt and ct plots repacked samples used to separate the impact of soil properties showed significantly higher swc on nt plot at all matric potentials whereas undisturbed samples taken to represent the impact of tillage treatments resulted in a significant effect of nt on higher swc at high matric potentials only pointing to the importance of soil texture and structural properties as to the effect of sampling methods on results interpretation therefore recommendations for implementing cross comparison principles in the evaluation of tillage methods for future research are proposed strudley et al 2008 above mentioned studies however do not consider soil conditions from the surface characteristics point of view which may play a substantial role in water retention ability therefore armand et al 2009 leys et al 2010 and hösl and strauss 2016 focused on the effect of soil surface properties on soil erosion and overland flow revealing its reduction when conservation tillage methods were applied the main effect is attributed to the increased surface roughness supported by mulching or cover crop implementation causing the rise in infiltrability armand et al 2009 and increased transmission losses leys et al 2010 hösl and strauss 2016 presented contradictory results probably caused by inappropriate execution of conservation practice in real life even though the observed results outline only a moderate effect of conservational tillage on overland flow reduction compared to ct langhans et al 2019 results by leys et al 2010 report on the increasing effect of conservational tillage with an increasing plot scale however the stronger scale effect was noted rather for soil loss reduction than overland flow langhans et al 2019 also found that the overall level of runoff coefficient was most clearly affected by crop type wheat vs maize rather than tillage methods despite the studies mentioned above only very little research considers the potential of management practices for enhanced water retention and overland flow reduction with the presence of vegetation cover maize can hold up to 80 of rainfall if fully grown olesen and jensen 2017 which has the potential to affect the generation of overland flow therefore there is a need to consider the interception value caused by vegetation cover in the quantification of retention ability soil hydraulic properties can be determined by several methods either by assessing the amount of water contained in the soil itself by gravimetric calculations from ring soil samples or by non direct methods such as tensiometers measurements or it can be obtained by measurements of infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity infiltration rate and its steady state of saturated hydraulic conductivity can be measured directly in the field using a single inf or double ring infiltrometer guelf permeameter or in laboratory conditions using the soil permeameter these methods however cover only small areas 1 m² and it is necessary to repeat them at several positions in the experimental area jačka et al 2014 on the other hand in the case of the rainfall simulator rs method the area coverage is much larger with the potential to account for the interception effect of crops and reduction of variability compared to point measurements yet studies comparing rs with other point measurement methods are scarce gupta 1993 compared three point measurement methods with rs showing two times higher variability for guelph permeameter and infiltrometer to rs however the role of vegetation cover during the growing season was not considered the scope of this study is therefore 1 to compare the applicability of inf and rs for overland flow formation evaluation on cropped plots and 2 to investigate the impact of nine maize tillage practices ranging from conventional to various types of conservational tillage methods on the propensity to form overland flow by means of ks and water retention analysis provided by inf and rs infiltration measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment was layout place near the town of jevíčko czech republic 49 40 n

influenced by the presence of water the volumetric soil moisture content was measured in the laboratory using nine undisturbed samples taken from each plot before measurement with rs or inf both values 15 3 1 3 in july 18 3 1 8 in august reflected warm and dry weather during the summer in the year 2017 the soil surface was without any post farming residuals which could affect the infiltration process see fig 3 2 2 tillage treatments nine different experimental maize plots 4 m x 40 m on the experimental field 60 60 m were established to analyze their propensity to overland flow formation in general they encompassed no tillage nt conventional tillage ct and reduced tillage strip till st treatments presented in more detail in fig 1 and table 1 briefly procedures began with autumn incorporation of crop residues by disk cultivator on all experimental plots in conventionally tilled plots that was followed by deep ploughing to the depth of 25 30 cm in mid november in spring a soil compactor was used before sowing into wide ct w ct cc narrow ct n and double row ct dr plots except for the case of fallow land ct fl which was kept without a crop for the whole experimental period in late may cover crop was sowed on the ct cc plot composed of spring wheat and field pea conservational treatments replaced deep ploughing for autumn soil loosening to the depth of 20 cm and compactor application before august and september rye sowing on nt and st plots respectively additionally strip till to the depth of 25 cm was applied in november on st a treatment in spring desiccation of the stand with total herbicide was followed by strip till to the depth of 20 cm and april maize sowing on both st plots on nt plots maize sowing in may was preceded by rye harvest june crop height reached 0 9 1 55 m with 50 coverage in august height was 2 4 2 8 m with 95 coverage kincl 2017 2 3 field measurements two types of measurement methods were used to analyse the impact of applied tillage treatments on the ability of soil to infiltrate water first a standard single ring inf infiltrometer and second a rainfall simulator rs single ring infiltrometer is more usable than its double ring version but sufficient for the purpose of this study moreover it describes soil surface conditions rather than guelph permeameter two measurement periods were conducted during the 2017 vegetation season at the end of june and in the middle of august june and august 2017 were dry and warm months which is indicated by low soil moisture at the side during both periods each measurement took three days from ca 8 30 18 00 with all installations of rs at each plot the weather was sunny and with low wind speed during all days 2 3 1 single ring infiltration rate measurement the infiltration rate was measured 2 3 times at each plot by automatic inf with a mariotte s bottle for a stable pressure head flow group cze a metal cylinder 10 5 cm in inner diameter 10 cm in height was stuck into the soil totally on which the main apparatus with water tank and water level sensor was installed the stable pressure head was set on only 4 0 5 cm from the soil surface the lowest which the inf allows to approach the ponding effect of heavy rainfall each measurement took from 30 min to 2 h until a steady state of infiltration rate when saturated hydraulic conductivity ks could be estimated the measured infiltration rates were then evaluated by phillips s approximation 1957 1 it a 0 5 s t 0 5 where i is infiltration rate m s 1 a means parameter s sorptivity m s 1 2 and t time min 2 3 2 rainfall simulator infiltration rate measurement and determination of water retention for the rainfall simulation the device developed at the research institute for soil and water conservation was applied to each experimental plot in both time periods water was sprinkled from cone nozzles operating at a pressure of 0 5 bar which was located at the height of 2 0 m above the terrain at the area of 25 m2 rainfall intensity was kept constant at 1 2 mm min 1 the rainfall simulation was set at 30 min at each plot the overland flow was measured by tipping buckets at the end of each sprinkling plot thus the infiltration rate of soil at every experimental plot was calculated as a difference between simulated rainfall and overland flow from the plot a more detailed view of the overland flow infiltration process determination from the beginning of the rainfall simulation till the steady state overland flow is shown in fig 4 at the beginning of the simulation rainfall is first wholly captured by the surface of the canopy interception capacity is filling fig 4 part a when the interception capacity of vegetation is filled water begins to fall to the surface of the soil here either overland flow occurs immediately or water infiltrates into the ground in both cases due to high rainfall intensity an overland flow will happen sooner or later at the beginning of the infiltration when water is redistributed to deeper soil horizons soil pores are filled with water gradually their volume depends mainly on porosity and soil moisture and can be determined as an effective porosity bear 1971 as the rainfall simulation continues effective porosity and the interception capacity are filled entirely with water and therefore can be negligible as the soil pores and interception capacity get saturated values of measured actual infiltration rate begin to equal the difference between the intensity of the simulated rainfall and the intensity of the overland flow fig 4 part b the point at which the infiltration rate measured at the time in fig 4 border between part b c starts to coincide with the measured calculated infiltration rate is difficult to predict however it is possible to precisely determine the steady state of overland flow that is the steady state of the infiltration velocity as the soil profile is saturated the resulting steady state value can be taken as the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the measured surface soil horizon retention capacity is affected not only by the soil layer but also by the interception capacity of vegetation cover crops during the growing season the idea of the soil plant system water retention capacity is represented in fig 4 as the a and b periods in the context of this sprinkling experiment the time from the beginning of rainfall simulation till the time of the steady state of overland flow or steady state of infiltration can be evaluated as the retention ability of the experimental plot fig 4 yellow area there are several ways in which the steady state of the overland flow can be evaluated for a quick and simplified solution a constant k method published by blume et al 2007 used to determine the end of the drain wave of the rainfall runoff event was used the method is theoretically based on the theory of linear storage by determining the recession coefficient k of the exponential function in eq 2 for all points on the hydrograph it is possible to identify the point in time after which k is approximately constant therefore k is calculated for each point by differentiating the equation 2 k dq dt 1 q t where k is recession coefficient q is outflow or discharge mm min 1 this method is based on the search for a minimum difference k 0 1 two times in a row in this case between the two following measurement values divided by 2 in a row of calculations for at least three subsequent calculations the water retention of experimental plots was assessed as a yellow area in fig 4 representing the amount of rainfall connecting points of beginning of the rainfall overland flow formation and attaining the stable outflow rate the water retention served as an indicator of the plot s susceptibility to soil erosion and the formation of flash floods after heavy rainfall the area was converted to mm of rain based on the constant rainfall intensity 1 2 mm min 1 3 results and discussion the rs and the inf were used to measure the ks and the time delay before the start of the overland flow formation characterizing the water retention capacity of each plot all the measurements were conducted twice during the 2017 growing season with the exception of the st s plot in august when both measurements are missing 3 1 insight into the applicability of single ring infiltrometer and rainfall simulator on maize cropped plots in june ks mean values of inf measurements reached up to four times higher than those obtained by rs fig 5 a comparison of ks coefficients of variance cv demonstrates higher variability for inf in all measuring periods fig 5 reaching up to eight times higher cv values in june and more than five times higher values in august than rs this fact was given by the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties such as macropores distribution soil cracks or initial soil moisture affecting inf measurements more than rs ones the reason behind was attributed to the difference in the spatial coverage of both measurements each single ring infiltrometer measurement characterizes the ks in an 87 cm2 plot compared to 250 000 cm2 in the case of a rainfall simulator this inevitably leads to a better representation of the plot infiltration rate which is obviously biased in the case of smaller single ring infiltrometer additionally the pearson correlation coefficient between ks values from rs and mean values from inf ranged from zero to 0 28 in june and august respectively suggesting the incomparability of results between these two methods therefore for further analysis of the propensity of maize tillage practices to form overland flow values from rs measurements were used although there are not many rs and inf comparison studies most of those performed report similar findings sidiras and roth 1987 and boers et al 1992 undertook measurements on clayey soil in brazil and sandy loam in nigeria respectively on plots with bare soil and cropped land in both studies double ring infiltrometers were used and the lower rs infiltration values were attributed to raindrop impact producing soil surface sealing and therefore faster formation of overland flow it reflected a more realistic process than the infiltrometer measurements in the case of verbist et al 2013 the main reason for higher infiltration rates obtained from infiltrometer was dependent on soil structure and method application like that in stony and dry soil in chile the inf insertion opened up preferential pathways and connected them to larger pores that were not active when the rs technique was used however the effect of method application can also lead to opposite results gupta 1993 explained their outcomes of lower infiltrometer values by manifestation of clay layer properties excavated for ring installation purposes preserved under topsoil in the case of rainfall simulation gómez et al 2001 attributed their lower ks infiltrometer measurement results compared to rs by intentionally omitting soil cracks that were included in rainfall simulations leading to higher values especially in line with our observations are resulted by gómez et al 2001 and verbist et al 2013 who refer to previous arguments of rs smoothing effect due to larger area coverage in our case inf measurements irregularities were caused by hardly visible macropores created by land cracking during a drought even though infiltrometers were installed to avoid any soil cracks or visible macropores some measurements were affected anyway a limited amount of inf measurements is not enough for the correct determination of ks the spatial ks variability extending over three orders of magnitude was reported e g by šípek et al 2019 in the uncultivated fluvisol at the plot of 100 m2 such variability was also documented by iqbal et al 2005 rosemary et al 2017 or usowicz and lipiec 2017 on several alluvial soils loamy sand alfisol and sandy podzol to avoid highly variable values obtained by inf measurements the standard dual ring infiltration could solve this problem with its larger infiltrating area however time or human resources necessary for dual ring infiltration operation would prolong measuring time moreover all plots would not be measured at the same time resulting in varied weather and soil conditions on the other hand rs has the potential to cover a larger area hence this method tends to smooth out measurement variability fig 5 and account for the crop interception effect compared to point measurements these facts place rs into a position of a more objective method in the sense of describing mean ks value water retention and overland flow formation on cropped plots verbist et al 2013 mentioned that the estimated final infiltration rate values will always depend on the measurement method as on the calculation technique used which invalidates the idea of a well defined and unique soil characteristic ks based on field measurements from our results as those discussed the variability of final ks values is therefore strongly recommended to be considered when interpreting the obtained measurements however to support the interpretation gupta 1993 offers other factors to consider relating to accuracy and precision when choosing the proper method for estimating hydraulic conductivity those are the ease of operation location of the measuring site availability of time and other resources and the ultimate usage of obtained values 3 2 propensity of maize tillage practices to form overland flow 3 2 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity from rs measurements affected by tillage practices the highest ks values were observed on ct cc 1 03 mm min 1 st s 1 03 mm min 1 and st a 0 95 mm min 1 plots in june and on st a 1 23 mm min 1 and ct cc 1 21 mm min 1 plots in august see fig 6 the positive effect of strip tillage st plots was also demonstrated by jabro et al 2011 where ks values on st plot exceeded those on conventionally tilled plot ct plots by 56 68 compared to the 23 30 on st a x ct w plots in our study in june and in august respectively lower difference between results can be assigned to differences in soil texture which was identified as sandy loam by jabro et al 2011 compared to loamy soil in the presented study according to their research higher ks value on the st plot is attributed to reduced soil compaction higher total porosity and lower bulk density even though st a treatment included one more strip till application in november lower ks values were measured at the st a compared to the st s plot compared to st and ct cc plots lower ks values in june were recorded on no tillage plots nt w 0 80 mm min 1 nt n 0 83 mm min 1 that were followed by even smaller values on conventionally tilled ct n 0 74 mm min 1 and ct w 0 73 mm min 1 plots similar findings between nt and ct were also reported by other researchers e g benjamin 1993 azooz and arshad 1996 attributing higher ks values under nt treatment to undisturbed continuity of soil pore structure also caused by endogenic earthworm activity tebrügge and düring 1999 nevertheless opposite results were also observed such as by heard et al 1988 khakural et al 1992 and haruna et al 2018 this ambiguity can be caused by soil climate and time scale of performed experiment inconsistencies across research studies just as by measurement procedures so it is not possible to generalize results without detailed information on all controlling factors strudley et al 2008 therefore it is possible to state that nt practices have slightly higher more favourable in terms of overland flow formation ks values than ct plots in the jeví čko research site s environment this assumption can be related to soil cracks creating macropores in nt plots moreover the difference between nt plots and ct w ct n plots increased in august simulations fig 6 the lowest values of ks were in both measurements reached on the ct fl plot namely 0 59 mm min 1 in june and 0 50 mm min 1 in august comparing wide row and narrow row sowing treatments nt n nt w and ct n nt w plots higher ks values were always observed on the nt n plot 0 83 and 1 04 mm min 1 in june and august respectively than on nt w plot 0 80 and 1 02 mm min 1 a similar trend is also reflected in plots with conventional treatment on ct n 0 74 mm min 1 and ct w 0 73 mm min 1 in june however this trend reversed in ct plots in august when ct n attained lower ks 0 80 mm min 1 than ct w 0 86 mm min 1 as changes in ks values were also observed between nt n and nt w treatments difference decreased it is possible to assume that the reversed situation on ct n and ct w plots results from maize growth development another interpretation of this slight change can be attributed to the higher susceptibility of wide row on ct w to soil drying and cracking leading to increased soil infiltrability a profound difference was observed between ct w and ct cc plots although the ct cc plot was treated just the same as the ct w plot except for cover crop cc sowing in may ks values are almost 30 higher than on the ct w plot similar findings were observed by haruna et al 2018 where higher ks values were reached on plots with the application of winter cover crop compared to plots with no cover crop although differences were not significant they were consistent with the slightly higher proportion of macropores observed within this treatment indicating the ability of cover crops to improve macropores effect and infiltration due to the activity of the roots improving pore connectivity and soil structure villamil et al 2006 as found by çerçioğlu et al 2019 the impact of cover crop application maybe even enhanced over the years sowing the maize into double rows ct dr resulted in intermediate values of ks of 0 83 mm min 1 in june and 0 94 mm min 1 in august the shape of the infiltration curve during the rs experiment fig 6 represents an indicator of the impact of applied treatments on overland flow occurrence during various precipitation lengths i e if two plots would have similar ks but one had a higher drop of infiltration rate following its initial value then this plot would be less prone to overland flow formation in short intense rainfall periods the highest infiltration rate drop was observed on the ct fl plot at 0 88 mm min 1 in june and 0 67 mm min 1 in august the most stable reactions were on the ct cc plot fig 6 in june the infiltration rate dropped only by 0 09 mm min 1 and no drop was recorded in the august simulation in the case of the remaining plots the recorded drops ranged from 0 2 mm min 1 to 0 6 mm min 1 higher ks values were generally observed in august measurement in all plots fig 6 except ct fl when august values 0 51 mm min 1 were lower than those in june 0 59 mm min 1 this seasonal variation of ks will be probably given by the observed indirect relationship between ks and soil wetness reported e g by zhou et al 2008 or šípek et al 2019 zeinalzadeh et al 2011 additionally also associated the increase in soil and water temperature with ks increases in the growing season 3 2 2 water retention affected by tillage practices the highest amount of simulated rainfall needed to form steady state overland flow was reached in august on the st a plot 26 0 mm fig 7 however water retention in june was one of the lowest 10 0 mm on this plot this significant difference can be attributed to the mechanical nature of soil cracking during dry summer increasing soil infiltration rather than to the hydraulic properties of non cracked soils the st s plot attained water retention of 23 4 mm in june documenting the efficiency of reduced tillage on the formation of overland flow the low propensity for the overland flow formation was also registered on ct cc 20 0 18 0 mm in june august experiment and nt n plots 17 2 21 8 mm the lowest water retention was attained in the ct w plot 10 7 9 2 mm followed by ct fl 15 5 12 2 mm nt w ct n and ct dr plots represented fluctuating water retention always attaining a lower value in august see fig 7 this overall decrease in water retention was observed at all plots on average by 27 8 the nt n and st a plots were the exceptions with rises of 26 7 and 160 8 respectively the overall decrease can be explained by higher volumetric water content before the measurements in august than in june on average 0 02 cm3 cm 3 which is the case of all sites except nt n attaining the same soil water content in june the same or higher water retention was observed on no tilled nt plots compared to conventionally tilled ct ones in june the water retention was 10 9 mm on nt w than on the ct w plot there was no difference when narrow sowing rows were contrasted in august the water retention was 11 9 mm on nt n than on the ct n plot in this case no difference was found between wide rows plots in the case of wide and narrow sowing row treatments on conventionally ct n ct w tilled plots higher water retention values and longer time lag to overland flow formation mainly were observed on narrow sowing row treatments at the beginning of the season the difference between ct w and ct n plots attained 6 6 mm conversely the difference in the water retention was in favour of wider rows in no tillage plots nt w and nt n by 4 4 mm on the other hand this trend reversed in august and a higher difference in overland flow initiation was observed between no tillage plots 12 4 mm whereas on conventionally tilled plots the difference dropped to zero the use of cover crop ct cc proved to have a positive effect on water retention increasing the precipitation threshold necessary for overland flow formation by 9 3 mm in june and 8 8 mm in august compared to conventionally tilled plot without cover crop ct w comparing the conventional corn seeding scheme in wide narrow and double sowing row with fallow land the water retention was consistently lowest in the wide row plot compared to the remaining fig 7 4 conclusion applying nine different maize tillage practices variously affected saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and water retention the most beneficial treatments in terms of sustainable water management were the plots where reduced tillage was applied in these plots the increased ks and water retention imply a reduced propensity for overland flow formation which is desirable for mitigating soil erosion alleviation of agricultural drought flash flood occurrence and sufficient groundwater recharge the conventionally and no tilled plots proved to have a lower ability to retain water and also lead to reduced infiltration among them the one where the cover crop was utilized is the only option to alleviate the above mentioned risks the comparison of single ring infiltrometer inf and rainfall simulator rs measurement methods applicability on maize grown plots resulted in much lower rs variability which was given its large scale coverage together with its ability to account for the crop interception effect this method can be considered a benchmark for evaluating mean ks value water retention and overland flow formation on cropped plots in summary maize can be grown in a hydrologically more responsible way than the one represented by standard conventional tillage this is a challenging opportunity for the effort to re establish the natural water

9408,understanding the water use strategy of crops is important for maintaining the stability of agricultural production and improving water use efficiency wue affected by a variety of water sources and hyper arid climate the characteristics of root water uptake rwu in seed maize are extremely complicated but underestimated in oasis farmlands with shallow groundwater we hypothesized that isotope δ2h and δ18o measurements over three years coupled with a mixsiar model would reveal the characteristics of rwu in maize stable water isotopes in oasis farmlands were continuously observed from 2019

soil water in 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers to rwu in maize were 29 7 12 2 14 8 and 43 3 respectively from the jointing stage to the dough stage the depth of rwu in maize was from shallow to deep but after the dough stage the depth of rwu in maize was from deep to shallow crops might prefer to absorb more groundwater and irrigation water in oasis farmlands with shallow

introduction about 70 of groundwater and surface water is used for agricultural irrigation worldwide penna et al 2020 unsustainable water resource management and low water use efficiency wue in fields accelerate the shortages of water which are more prominent in arid and semi arid areas gomez alday et al 2022 artificial oasis farmland is a typical landscape in arid areas whereas natural and environmental conditions e g extreme drought barren soil and water shortage impact the stability of agricultural production zhang et al 2018 water demand constantly increases with the continuous expansion of artificial oasis farmlands which further increases water scarcity in hyper arid regions zhang et al 2016 2019 importantly the mismatch between water supply schemes and the characteristics of root water uptake rwu leads to lower wue of crops in these regions yang et al 2015 physiological characteristics of rwu for crops in artificial oasis farmlands remain largely unknown especially the variation over crop growth stages water use strategies of crops are an issue of wide concern in agroecosystems which could mitigate the contradictions arising from water scarcity the rwu in plants the main process of water transfer in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac is not only crucial to understanding the water cycle in ecosystems but also for improving the production of crops bois et al 2021 exploring the mechanisms of rwu can regulate water use strategies of crops growth manzoni et al 2013 however rwu in crops are affected by the water supply understanding water use for crops from various water sources or different soil layers has become key to alleviating water stress of plant growth and ensuring high wue in irrigated fields the rwu patterns in crops are crucial to improving wue for the stability of agricultural production and to making optimal irrigation schemes for better agricultural water management eriksson 2017 isotope technology a high accuracy quick and non destructive method can be used to explore water use in crops flanagan et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 through evaporation transpiration and infiltration stable isotope fractionation occurs which makes the isotopic composition of different water sources unique arellano et al 2020 when using isotopes to study water use the assumption is that isotopic fractionation does not occur during the process of water as it is absorbed by plant roots from the soil and transported to xylem ellsworth and williams 2007 liu et al 2020 the contribution of different water sources to plant growth can be determined by comparing isotopic composition between xylem and multiple sources moreover some models including binary or ternary hybrid models isosource models and mixsiar models allow for the quantitative study rwu in plants yang et al 2018 importantly mixsiar models consider spatiotemporal variability and uncertainty of each source whereby the results of rwu in plants are more representative and persuasive dudley et al 2018 thus isotope measurements δ2h and δ18o combined with mixsiar models can characterize crop water use from different soil depths or water sources schwendenmann et al 2015 ma and song

et al 2018 however these previous studies are limited to a single season and do not consider differences in seasonal variation in water supply precipitation irrigation and groundwater ma and song 2016 also the studies on rwu in plants were conducted over short time scales and the conclusions were drawn from a single year s data within high uncertainty caused by the external environmental and logistical errors in our study area maize was affected by various water sources precipitation irrigation water soil water and groundwater and the patterns of rwu are extremely complex but undefined moreover there are few observational studies on the characteristics of rwu in seed maize across consecutive years we hypothesized that isotope measurements δ2h and δ18o across three years coupled with a mixsiar model would reveal rwu strategies in seed maize soil matrix potential and stable isotopes were continuously observed under the oasis farmlands from 2019 to 2021 the aims of this study were

study sites as in yi 2015 2 3 isotope sampling and measurement methods the sampled plants and soil samples were sealed with parafilm pm 996 and immediately put into the refrigerator and then sent to the laboratory for cold storage below 4 until δ2h and δ18o were measured the same established sampling and measurement methods were used across the three consecutive years as described below 2 3 1 stem water samples two maize plants with three replicates were randomly sampled in each growth stage the stem each plant was cut about 5 cm from the ground and the bract was removed to prevent isotope fractionation caused by transpiration the 2 3 cm stem base samples were put quickly into brown glass bottles 2 3 2 soil water and groundwater samples in order to investigate the contributions of soil water from different layers to rwu in maize the soil profile was divided into five layers based on soil layer classification and soil water sources 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm on the same day when sampling plants in each growth stage soil samples at the five soil layers were taken near the sampled maize using a soil auger each month soil samples with three replicates were put quickly into 50 ml centrifuge tubes groundwater samples were collected in an observation well with 20 ml centrifuge tubes with three replicates 2 3 3 irrigation and precipitation samples rainwater

event with 20 ml centrifugal tubes from irrigation outlets with three replicates after each collecting samples irrigation and precipitation samples were measured every time 2 3 4 measurement methods the samples were analyzed in the isotope hydrology laboratory of the key laboratory of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences the collected samples was independently measured each time stem water and soil water were extracted by low temperature vacuum distillation extraction apparatus the δ2h and δ18o was measured by lgr liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 912 0008 1001 los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa in order to reduce the error caused by instrumentation each sample was measured 6 times and the average value of the last 4 measurements was taken to better reflect the difference in isotopic composition for different samples the following equation was used 1 δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δ denotes the isotopic composition of samples r sample and r standard represent the hydrogen or oxygen stable isotope ratio 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the samples and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively the measurement accuracies of δ2h and δ18o are 0

depths of 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm at each sampling plot sensors were installed in the center of each plot with one monitoring profile of soil matrix potential at each plot due to logistical difficulties soil matrix potential was monitored every 30 min 2 5 data analysis the mixsiar model a new bayesian hybrid model was developed based on the following equations stock et al 2018 2 y i k 1 n f k w ik where y i represents the mixed source data n is the number of sources w ik is each source data f k is the contribution of each source to mixed source the r package mixsiar https github com brianstock mixsiar was used to calculate the contribution of different soil layers to rwu in maize the mixed source data was input as the isotope ratio of stem water and the source data was input as the isotope ratio of different soil layers since it was assumed that isotope fractionation did not occur the discrimination data was set to zero the error structure consisted of resid and process errors and the parameter running step was set to very long all data were represented as means standard deviation sd statistical analyses were implemented using spss ver 20 0 spss inc chicago il the spatial kriging interpolation tool in arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca usa was used to estimate variation in soil matrix potential in the soil profile univariate linear regression analysis was performed using spss version 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 variation in soil matrix potential and underground water depth soil matrix potential increased from shallow to deep soil layers fig 2 and soil matrix potential near groundwater was higher than in the topsoil layer indicating that the lower soil layers might often replenish soil water in the upper layer furthermore the variation of soil matrix potential was responded markedly to drought events soil matrix potential in the topsoil layer was lower in may 2020 than those in other two years resulting from low winter irrigation amount in 2019 surface soil matrix potential gradually decreased before irrigation and rose sharply after irrigation soil matrix potential at 0 30 cm varied considerably during maize growth whereas the variation in soil matrix potential below 70 cm was more stable fig 2 in our study sites underground water depths over crop growth stages were 0 75 1 12 m in 2019 0 78 1 09 m in 2020 and 0 67 1 01 in 2021 respectively moreover there were no differences in underground water depth among the observation periods in 2019 2020 and 2021 3 2 isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen for different water samples the linear fitting equation of the local meteoric water line lmwl in all three years was δ2h 7 51δ18o 7 14 r 2 0 97 p 0 01 the slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl was smaller than the

different water samples whereby stem water was a mixture of multiple water sources according to the isotopic distribution of different water sources stem water had high similarity to groundwater irrigation water and soil water while differing from precipitation fig 3 the variation in δ18o was roughly the same as that of δ2h in each water sample fig 4 the range of δ18o in precipitation was the highest ranging from 11 21 to 1 14 with a mean value of 5 58 the average values for δ18o of irrigation water 8 70 and groundwater 8 26 were similar to that of stem water 8 25 but precipitation and stem water differed the δ18o in soil water ranged from 11 23 to 5 11 with a mean value of 8 57 the δ18o of 0 40 cm soil layer fluctuated each year but remained below 40 cm fig 4d f the δ18o of 20 40 cm soil layer was the lowest throughout the soil profile and overall the δ18o first decreased and then increased with soil depth fig 4d f 3 3 contribution of different soil layers to the root water uptake of maize we compared the δ18o of stem water to soil water the depth of rwu for maize was concentrated at 0 20 cm during the jointing stage fig 5 during the growth stage the depth of rwu was from the shallow to deep layers from the tasseling to dough stage the depth of rwu was concentrated in the 50 90 cm layer fig 5 during the mature stage the depth of rwu reduced to 0 20 cm in 2019 and 2020 fig 5 in 2021 the depth of rwu was concentrated at 60 80 cm resulting from high soil water content in deeper soil layers and lower underground water depth during the observation period the contribution from soil water at 0 20 cm to rwu was 45 8 32 7 22 8 13 2 and 33 7 at the jointing tasseling filling dough and mature stages respectively fig 6 over the growing season the annual average contributions of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layers to rwu were 29 7 12 1 14 9 20 6 and 22 7 respectively maize preferred to use 0 20 cm and below 60 cm during the growing season whereas the contribution of the 20 60 cm layers to rwu was lower fig 6 4 discussion the isotopic composition of various water sources differ due to isotopic fractionation dudley et al 2018 the evaporation in our study area was higher than the global average resulting in the slope of the lmwl to be lower than the gmwl and there were pronounced differences in isotopic composition between precipitation and other water sources the slope of in soil water isotopes fitting equation was lower than the lmwl suggesting that evaporation occurs when precipitation infiltrates soils our results coincide with previous findings in arid regions liu et al 2020 wu et al 2016 indicating groundwater recharge might rarely come from local low precipitation events the composition of isotopes varied among different soil layers stable isotopes at 40 100 cm depth were more stable than 0 40 cm depth the seasonal variation of soil matrix potential at 0 40 cm was high and likely caused by irrigation precipitation and strong evaporation thus stable isotopes were either depleted or enriched in topsoil layers leroux et al 1995 moreover the stable isotopes in topsoil fluctuated seasonally as in corneo et al 2018 however the stable isotopes for soil water in our study area first decreased and then slightly increased with depth wherein the inflection point of the soil profile was at about 30 cm fig 5 where evaporation weakened schwendenmann et al 2015 stable isotopes at 20 40 cm soil layer were the lowest which explains isotope enrichment being weakest stable isotopes for soil water then slightly increased with depth which was similar to groundwater fig 4 likely because below 40 cm is affected by groundwater replenishment thus the isotope composition among different soil layers differed in the oasis farmlands which are comprehensively affected by irrigation groundwater and soil evaporation the depth of rwu in plants varied with growth stage crop root distribution is thought to trace the depth of rwu in plants but it may not reflect actual water uptake temporally and spatially ehleringer and dawson 1992 which mainly depends on root activity and soil moisture wu et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 generally root length is considered when determining sampling depth for most crops scarcely any roots are found below 120 cm zhao et al 2018 thus the sampling soil depth in our study was 100 cm with shallow groundwater the contribution of the 0 20 cm layer to rwu in maize was 45 8 in the jointing stage indicating that the topsoil layer was the dominant depth of rwu at this growth stage similarly liu et al 2018 showed that the 0 20 cm layer provided 59 7 of water for maize growth at early stages aboveground aerial roots in maize support crop growth and account for a large percentage of the shallow root weight ma and song 2016 in our plots maize roots were short and distributed in the upper soil layer at the vegetative stages yi 2015 from the jointing to dough stage the water requirements of maize and its evapotranspiration increased the depth of rwu became deeper because roots were long and swc at the top layers could not meet the water requirements wu et al 2016 maize roots extend to deeper soils and these roots may be more efficient at absorbing water in deep layers also soil matrix potential at deeper layers was higher than the topsoil layer and swc at deeper soil layers met the water demand of maize however from the dough to mature stage the depth of rwu became shallower as the crops enter the mature stage the water demand of maize decreases due to shrinking roots zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 found that 52 4 of water was from 0 to 20 cm at the harvest stage the depth of rwu in our study area was complex and mainly depended on root activity and swc but it was roughly consistent with the findings that the depth of rwu was characterized by shallow deep shallow according to growth stage wang et al 2010 the contributions of soil water at 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm to rwu in maize were 29 7 and 43 3 respectively during the three years the contribution of soil water at 20 60 cm to rwu for maize was less fig 7 suggesting maize absorbed soil water from the upper soil layer which is affected by irrigation events and from the deeper soil layer which is regulated by groundwater as zhang et al 1999 reported plants preferred to absorb fresh water such as irrigation water or precipitation rather than soil water vegetation depends on groundwater in arid areas without irrigation cui et al 2015 the shallow groundwater may replenish the deeper soil layers in our study area maize was inclined to absorb soil water at higher swc layers drake and franks 2003 the contribution of soil water to rwu was positively correlated with swc rose et al 2003 swc consequently should be taken into consideration when determining crop water uptake wang et al 2010 yang et al 2015 thus crops prefer to absorb soil water at 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm which may be a survival strategy for maize with shallow groundwater in hyper arid regions due to affecting by various water sources rwu patterns in maize became complicated in our study area in our study area annual pan evaporation averaged twenty times greater than annual precipitation zhang et al 2022 generally swc in the oasis regions was replenished by irrigation and groundwater during the growing season ding et al 2010 the isotopic values of soil water at 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm might represent the isotopic values of irrigation water and groundwater fig 4 thus crops more prefer to absorb irrigation water and groundwater in oasis farmlands with shallow groundwater our results are different than those from humid areas and semi arid regions wu et al 2021 aguzzoni et al 2022 but

9408,understanding the water use strategy of crops is important for maintaining the stability of agricultural production and improving water use efficiency wue affected by a variety of water sources and hyper arid climate the characteristics of root water uptake rwu in seed maize are extremely complicated but underestimated in oasis farmlands with shallow groundwater we hypothesized that isotope δ2h and δ18o measurements over three years coupled with a mixsiar model would reveal the characteristics of rwu in maize stable water isotopes in oasis farmlands were continuously observed from 2019 to 2021 over the growing season the soil matrix potential increased with soil depth the isotopes in stem water had high similarity to groundwater irrigation water and soil water the contributions of soil water in 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers to rwu in maize were 29 7 12 2 14 8 and 43 3 respectively from the jointing stage to the dough stage the depth of rwu in maize was from shallow to deep but after the dough stage the depth of rwu in maize was from deep to shallow crops might prefer to absorb more groundwater and irrigation water in oasis farmlands with shallow groundwater this study provides insights into crop water uptake and agricultural water management in hyper arid regions keywords desert oasis regions mixsiar model seed maize stable water isotope water use efficiency data availability the authors declare that the majority of the data supporting the findings of this study are available from y y zhang zhangyongyong lzb ac cn upon request 1 introduction about 70 of groundwater and surface water is used for agricultural irrigation worldwide penna et al 2020 unsustainable water resource management and low water use efficiency wue in fields accelerate the shortages of water which are more prominent in arid and semi arid areas gomez alday et al 2022 artificial oasis farmland is a typical landscape in arid areas whereas natural and environmental conditions e g extreme drought barren soil and water shortage impact the stability of agricultural production zhang et al 2018 water demand constantly increases with the continuous expansion of artificial oasis farmlands which further increases water scarcity in hyper arid regions zhang et al 2016 2019 importantly the mismatch between water supply schemes and the characteristics of root water uptake rwu leads to lower wue of crops in these regions yang et al 2015 physiological characteristics of rwu for crops in artificial oasis farmlands remain largely unknown especially the variation over crop growth stages water use strategies of crops are an issue of wide concern in agroecosystems which could mitigate the contradictions arising from water scarcity the rwu in plants the main process of water transfer in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac is not only crucial to understanding the water cycle in ecosystems but also for improving the production of crops bois et al 2021 exploring the mechanisms of rwu can regulate water use strategies of crops growth manzoni et al 2013 however rwu in crops are affected by the water supply understanding water use for crops from various water sources or different soil layers has become key to alleviating water stress of plant growth and ensuring high wue in irrigated fields the rwu patterns in crops are crucial to improving wue for the stability of agricultural production and to making optimal irrigation schemes for better agricultural water management eriksson 2017 isotope technology a high accuracy quick and non destructive method can be used to explore water use in crops flanagan et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 through evaporation transpiration and infiltration stable isotope fractionation occurs which makes the isotopic composition of different water sources unique arellano et al 2020 when using isotopes to study water use the assumption is that isotopic fractionation does not occur during the process of water as it is absorbed by plant roots from the soil and transported to xylem ellsworth and williams 2007 liu et al 2020 the contribution of different water sources to plant growth can be determined by comparing isotopic composition between xylem and multiple sources moreover some models including binary or ternary hybrid models isosource models and mixsiar models allow for the quantitative study rwu in plants yang et al 2018 importantly mixsiar models consider spatiotemporal variability and uncertainty of each source whereby the results of rwu in plants are more representative and persuasive dudley et al 2018 thus isotope measurements δ2h and δ18o combined with mixsiar models can characterize crop water use from different soil depths or water sources schwendenmann et al 2015 ma and song 2016 li et al 2020 for example in croplands winter wheat throughout all growth stages obtained 65 of its water derived from 0 to 60 cm depth irrigation depth should be less than 60 cm liu et al 2021 the main water uptake in maize was 50 80 cm depth zhao et al 2018 isotope has been employed to evaluate rwu in maize cotton rice and wheat karakis et al 2018 yang et al 2018 isotope technology coupled with quantitative models is a powerful way to provide insight into optimal agricultural water management ehleringer and dawson 1992 the artificial oasis in the middle reach of the heihe river is the largest seed maize cultivation center in china yang et al 2015 the production of maize in this area accounts for 40 of the seed maize produced throughout china zhang et al 2016 maize yield effectively determines agricultural productivity of this area due to heterogeneous conditions the depth of rwu in maize varies during the growing season wu et al 2016 ma and song 2016 liu et al 2018 the roots of maize mainly consume shallow soil water during the early growth stage penna et al 2020 the water use strategy of some plants was revealed using the isotope technology coupled with related models yang et al 2018 however these previous studies are limited to a single season and do not consider differences in seasonal variation in water supply precipitation irrigation and groundwater ma and song 2016 also the studies on rwu in plants were conducted over short time scales and the conclusions were drawn from a single year s data within high uncertainty caused by the external environmental and logistical errors in our study area maize was affected by various water sources precipitation irrigation water soil water and groundwater and the patterns of rwu are extremely complex but undefined moreover there are few observational studies on the characteristics of rwu in seed maize across consecutive years we hypothesized that isotope measurements δ2h and δ18o across three years coupled with a mixsiar model would reveal rwu strategies in seed maize soil matrix potential and stable isotopes were continuously observed under the oasis farmlands from 2019 to 2021 the aims of this study were to 1 investigate isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen for different water samples 2 quantitatively assess the patterns of rwu in maize from different soil layers 2 materials and methods 2 1

concentrated from july to september the study was performed from 2019 to 2021 the underground water depth in our study site is shallow within 1 m yi 2015 soil physicochemical properties of the experimental site are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design monoculture of seed maize is the primary crop in the study area and has been planted there for more than 20 years we established 48 m2 6 m 8 m sampling plot with three replicates maize seed maize 1256 was grown using ridge furrow cultivation ridges were constructed by elevating the soil on both sides of the plot and then mulching with black plastic film the planting density was 72 000 seeds hm 2 maize was sown along the midline of each ridge on april 10 and harvested on september 15 to ensure growth fertilizer consisting of 360 kg n hm2 in the form of urea n 46 and triamine n 18 180 kg p hm2 in the form of triamine p2o5 18 and 180 kg k hm2 in the form of triamine k2o 18 was applied to each plot every year fertilizer was applied evenly in the seedling jointing and filling stages we used furrow irrigation three times in 2019 june 9 july 20 and august 24 three times in 2020 june 7 july 15 and august 15 and three times in 2021 june 6 july 16 and august 14 during maize growth the amount of water used was 80 90 mm on each time the growth season of maize is generally divided into six growth stages the seedling jointing tasseling filling dough and mature stages ding et al 2010 we sampled from april 2019 to september 2021 the proportion of dry root weight density at different growth stages were referred from the same study sites as in yi 2015 2 3 isotope sampling and measurement methods the sampled plants and soil samples were sealed with parafilm pm 996 and immediately put into the refrigerator and then sent to the laboratory for cold storage below 4 until δ2h and δ18o were measured the same established sampling and measurement methods were used across the three consecutive years as described below 2 3 1 stem water samples two maize plants with three replicates were randomly sampled in each growth stage the stem each plant was cut about 5 cm from the ground and the bract was removed to prevent isotope fractionation caused by transpiration the 2 3 cm stem base samples were put quickly into brown glass bottles 2 3 2 soil water and groundwater samples in order to investigate the contributions of soil water from different layers to rwu in maize the soil profile was divided into five layers based on soil layer classification and soil water sources 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm on the same day when sampling plants in each growth stage soil samples at the five soil layers were taken near the sampled maize using a soil auger each month soil samples with three replicates were put quickly into 50 ml centrifuge tubes groundwater samples were collected in an observation well with 20 ml centrifuge tubes with three replicates 2 3 3 irrigation and precipitation samples rainwater samples were collected during each precipitation event via rainwater collector and stored in 20 ml centrifuge tube with three replicates irrigation water samples were collected from each irrigation event with 20 ml centrifugal tubes from irrigation outlets with three replicates after each collecting samples irrigation and precipitation samples were measured every time 2 3 4 measurement methods the samples were analyzed in the isotope hydrology laboratory of the key laboratory of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences the collected samples was independently measured each time stem water and soil water were extracted by low temperature vacuum distillation extraction apparatus the δ2h and δ18o was measured by lgr liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 912 0008 1001 los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa in order to reduce the error caused by instrumentation each sample was measured 6 times and the average value of the last 4 measurements was taken to better reflect the difference in isotopic composition for different samples the following equation was used 1 δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δ denotes the isotopic composition of samples r sample and r standard represent the hydrogen or oxygen stable isotope ratio 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the samples and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow respectively the measurement accuracies of δ2h and δ18o are 0

in linze underground water depth in our study sites was obtained from the linze station which was manually observed soil matrix potential was monitored with the teros 21 sensor meter company usa at depths of 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm at each sampling plot sensors were installed in the center of each plot with one monitoring profile of soil matrix potential at each plot due to logistical difficulties soil matrix potential was monitored every 30 min 2 5 data analysis the mixsiar model a new bayesian hybrid model was developed based on the following equations stock et al 2018 2 y i k 1 n f k w ik where y i represents the mixed source data n is the number of sources w ik is each source data f k is the contribution of each source to mixed source the r package mixsiar https github com brianstock mixsiar was used to calculate the contribution of different soil layers to rwu in maize the mixed source data was input as the isotope ratio of stem water and the source data was input as the isotope ratio of different soil layers since it was assumed that isotope fractionation did not occur the discrimination data was set to zero the error structure consisted of resid and process errors and the parameter running step was set to very long all data were represented as means standard deviation sd statistical analyses were implemented using spss ver 20 0 spss inc chicago il the spatial kriging interpolation tool in arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca usa was used to estimate variation in soil matrix potential in the soil profile univariate linear regression analysis was performed using spss version 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 variation in soil matrix potential and underground water depth soil matrix potential increased from shallow to deep soil layers fig 2 and soil matrix potential near groundwater was higher than in the topsoil layer indicating that the lower soil layers might often replenish soil water in the upper layer furthermore the variation of soil matrix potential was responded markedly to drought events soil matrix potential in the topsoil layer was lower in may 2020 than those in other two years resulting from low winter irrigation amount in 2019 surface soil matrix potential gradually decreased before irrigation and rose sharply after irrigation soil matrix potential at 0 30 cm varied considerably during maize growth whereas the variation in soil matrix potential below 70 cm was more stable fig 2 in our study sites underground water depths over crop growth stages were 0 75 1 12 m in 2019 0 78 1 09 m in 2020 and 0 67 1 01 in 2021

this paper a hybrid multi criteria decision making mcdm method is presented for the evaluation and selection of irrigation methods this process involves various potentially conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria therefore a hybrid mcdm method such as hf ahp promethee ii is needed to make decisions in hf ahp promethee ii hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process hf ahp is first implemented to determine importance weights of criteria and then hesitant fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enriching evaluations ii hf promethee ii is utilized to assess and rank the irrigation method alternatives for comparison analysis hf ahp topsis hf ahp technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method is also implemented to the same problem a case study is presented where five irrigation method alternatives in söke plain are assessed by five expert decision makers dms based on fifteen evaluation criteria sprinkler is found to be the first ranked irrigation method among five alternatives with both hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis resulting in the same ranking the selection of this irrigation technique by the expert dms is compliant with prevailing regional features related to hydrologic climatic environmental conditions and with regard to cotton one of the highest water consuming crops keywords cotton irrigation methods mcdm ahp promethee ii topsis söke plain data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction developing countries in the southern and eastern rim of the mediterranean basin are expected to suffer from severe drought impacts in the near future burak and margat 2016 tramblay et al 2020 hydrological droughts are less predictable than meteorological droughts due to human induced activities like water withdrawal from surface as well as groundwater which ultimately jeopardise water resources and water dependent sectors like agriculture cotton gossypium l is one of the highest water consuming crops grown in warm climatic regions prone to water scarcity decline in water resources and increased droughts in the face of climate change necessitate more efficient irrigation systems for cotton production as a solution to these hazards hydrological drought has been solved by irrigating the full harvesting area and crop yields increased from average to very high chapagain et al 2006 this achievement shows that irrigation is evidently one of the most important factors influencing the yield of cotton production surface irrigation e g flood and furrow is the most commonly used method for cotton irrigation worldwide although modern systems which are mainly sprinkler and drip irrigation are increasingly adopted in water scarce regions their implementation in developing countries is still at a very low rate skhiri and dechmi 2012 since the 1970 s many scientists have conducted studies into water use efficiency and cotton productivity comparing the furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation methods in particular cetin and bilgel 2002 the study carried out by ibragimov et al 2007 shows that the drip irrigation method increases water use efficiency by more than 35 and improves seed lint cotton yield by about 10 19 compared to the furrow irrigation method janat 2008 observed that 25 50 of irrigation water is saved by drip irrigation compared to furrow irrigation and increase in water use efficiency with drip irrigation was twice as high as with furrow irrigation in turkey agriculture is the highest water consuming activity responsible for 77 of total water use corresponding to 45 05 billion m3 whilst the efficiency ratio is approximately 40 50 on the national average dsi 2021 this is due to high evapotranspiration losses and most importantly due to physical losses caused by inefficient surface irrigation methods which means that 50 of the diverted stored water is wasted on the average the distribution of the irrigated areas equipped with different irrigation methods is 1020 441 ha surface irrigation 356 484 ha sprinkler and 280 709 ha drip irrigation corresponding to 61 22 and 17 respectively as of 2019 dsi 2020 the overall irrigation management is under the responsibility of the sate hydraulic works dsi a central agency which delegates the operation and maintenance o m duties to the irrigation associations ias according to the international cotton advisory committee icac that issues the yearly cotton production statistics approximately 65 of the cotton crop production in the world is generated by india china and usa respectively icac 2019 turkey is the 7th country in the world for cotton production and the leading country in the mediterranean basin at present icac 2019 republic of turkey ministry of agriculture and forestry 2017 the south aegean and south eastern regions are the most appropriate for cotton production in turkey since these areas offer the most fertile alluvial soil type with high water holding capacity and also appropriate meteorological conditions with an average temperature above 200 c in summer and above 00 c in winter providing optimum conditions for crop yield mutluer 1997 this research paper has the objective of attaining a consensus by the dms about the best irrigation method among the alternatives considered in söke plain in this respect it supplements the inocottongrow project carried out between 2018 and 2019 aiming at reducing the water footprint of the global cotton textile industry in line with un sustainable development goals in söke plain the study area is located in the southwest part of turkey at the downstream end of büyük menderes river meander river in the aegean region as shown in fig 1 it is one of the ten sub basins of the büyük

agricultural land out of which 36 000 ha is irrigated within the main basin söke plain ia 2021 söke falls within the mediterranean climate belt with rainfall in winter higher than the potential evapotranspiration pet and occurring between november and march followed by a dry summer burak et al 2021a 2021b rainfall during the cotton growing season between mid april and october is rather short with mean rainfall of 25 mm month and lower than 10 mm month in july and august turkish state meteorological service 2021 the cropping pattern in söke is almost uniform at 97 cotton weber et al 2021 this ratio increased from 88 in 2007 to 97 in 2020 koç 2007 söke plain ia 2021 irrigation is practiced 3 4 times per season the net irrigation demand for the cotton crop varies between 400 and 450 mm for total seasonal applications the pet is fairly stable enabling the reliable forecasting of water demand weber et al 2021 water risk atlas wra tool shows that the büyük menderes river and söke plain are located in an area where the drought risk index is medium high 0 6 0 8 water stress index is extremely high 0 8 and the overall water risk is high 3 4 which represents all water related risks with respect to the physical quantity quality and regulatory reputational risk categories beta aqueduct 2020 hofste et al 2019 these values demonstrate the vulnerability of the region with regard to climate change field surveys indicated that the estimated irrigation efficiency is in the range of 60 in söke plain which means that approximately 40 of diverted water is lost on farm where irrigation is practiced with conventional methods weber et al 2021 one of the main outcomes of the field study demonstrated that agricultural water efficiency in the region should be improved by sustainable management solutions the application of modern irrigation methods helps reduce the water footprint of cotton irrigation relieve the water stress index of the region increase agricultural efficiency and consequently reduce the financial risks of farmers regarding the planning of efficient irrigation techniques it has been proposed to decision makers that they take part in a multi criteria decision making mcdm process to select the most appropriate system for söke plain based on their expertise multi criteria analysis mca and multi criteria decision making mcdm methods are considered to be well suited decision support tools in water resources management since there are many potentially conflicting criteria to consider while making decisions in a given area hajkowicz and collins 2007

there are so few studies that combined hf ahp and hf promethee methods liang et al 2020 implemented ahp to determine criteria weights and then hf promethee to select suitable hazardous waste disposal enterprises in china previously integrated hf ahp and hf promethee ii to evaluate transformers in a power distribution project however to the best of the authors knowledge a hybrid hf ahp promethee method was applied for the first time in the field of agricultural water management in this study here as the mcdm method hf ahp promethee ii is preferred to have both hf ahp and hf promethee ii methods advantages in the evaluation of irrigation methods promethee methods are easily applicable with stable results moradpour et al 2011 f samanlioglu and ayağ 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2021 2017 2016 velasquez and hester 2013 however methods such as hf promethee hf topsis vikor and electre do not suggest defined guidelines to determine criteria weights assuming these are pre determined by dms appropriately macharis et al 2004 f samanlioglu and ayağ 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2021 2016 velasquez and hester 2013 ahp is stronger in evaluation of qualitative criteria then promethee methods and if there are eight or more criteria with promethee methods the dms may find it tough to assess criteria and alternatives clearly macharis et al 2004 moradpour et al 2011 samanlioglu and ayağ 2020b 2016 with hf ahp quantitative and qualitative criteria can be assessed using pairwise comparisons and dependable criteria weights are determined with the help of consistency checks however implementing solely hf ahp for both evaluation of criteria and alternatives might be burdensome and time consuming due to enormous number of pairwise comparisons particularly when there are many criteria and alternatives in the problem samanlioglu and ayağ 2020a 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2019 2017 therefore in this research in order to obtain reliable results without large number of pairwise comparisons integration of both methods namely hf ahp promethee ii is applied in order to check the stability of results for comparison analysis also hf ahp topsis ahmad et al 2022 alfakeeh et al 2022

implemented to the same problem and the results are presented in the case study section here in both methods hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets hflts and hesitant fuzzy set concepts are utilized along with fuzzy envelope approach to reflect the uncertainty ambiguity and hesitations dms might have in their assessments samanlioglu and kaya 2020 of criteria and irrigation method alternatives utilization of these concepts increases the flexibility of dms in the decision making process and makes the whole process close to real samanlioglu and ayağ 2020a 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2021 samanlioglu and kaya 2020 to the best of the authors knowledge there is no research in the literature that has utilized a mcdm method such as hf ahp promethee ii or hf ahp topsis for the evaluation of irrigation methods to this date therefore as the objective motivation of the study it is expected that application of these two relatively recent mcdm methods both hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis in the decision making process of the irrigation method will bring new insight to the literature more specifically implementation of hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis hybrid mcdm methods in irrigation method selection broadens the assessment perspective to include all significant aspects for the irrigation method decision process focuses on attaining a consensus decision that is agreeable to all dms in a structured way provides a framework that can accommodate imprecise data quantitative and qualitative potentially conflicting criteria and group decision making with various dms and even incorporates hesitations of dms in their preferences to the process moreover application of these methods in the selection of the irrigation method reduces the biases from dms depending on their gut instincts and groupthink failures that affect solely intuitive methods in the next section these methods are explained in detail 2 methodology hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis for comparison analysis 2 1 hesitant fuzzy sets hfs and application of fuzzy envelope approach in hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis fuzzy envelope approach liu and rodríguez 2014 is used for hesitant

the details are given in this section since hflts are used in this paper these methods are called hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis in hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis triangular hesitant fuzzy sets thfs are applied to define the uncertain data and hesitation and vagueness of preferences of dms and linguistic variables fuzzy set theory contains classes with soft boundaries klir and

2030 around 20 by 2050 and around 45 by 2100 ozkul 2009 increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation will result in reduced river discharge decreased water levels and dried streambeds followed by severe adverse impacts on water availability and quality as agriculture is excessively water dependent it will be one of the most impacted sectors by drought durdu 2010 irrigated fields in the basin continue to expand with a large number of water works and irrigation schemes in söke plain in particular where water is the main input of economic activities extensive irrigation with conventional methods has already aggravated the pressure on water resources with regard to quantity and quality söke plain is one of the regions facing water salinity and alkalinity in turkey koç 2008 due to salinity washing out the soil to remove the salt followed by leaching applications are traditional excessive leaching not only increases water table problems with clogging and losses in the yield but also increases water consumption in the plain and decreases water quality due to leaching soil problems lead to inefficiencies in the downstream irrigation farms although sprinkler systems are adaptable to most of the soil types they are best suited to sandy alluvial soils with high infiltration rates with appropriate design measures of irrigation rate surface ponding and runoff can be avoided couto et al 2013 koç 2008 in line with hydrologic environmental agricultural and socio economic features prevailing in söke plain and further planning in agricultural expansion of cotton production measures to increase water use efficiency in irrigation is a must moreover existing heavy irrigation activities also have adverse impacts on the water bodies of the büyük menderes river basin causing changes on their hydromorphology e g bafa lake a natural park under severe threat of water level lowering ülker et al 2021 modern irrigation techniques are increasingly advised at regional and national level to replace conventional systems as they are more efficient environmentally correct and sustainable in this research 15 criteria have been evaluated to make a comprehensive assessment of the irrigation methods aiming at more sustainable agricultural management practices in söke plain the results of the evaluation tables with two hybrid mcdm methods hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis have shown that dms have opted primarily for sprinkler irrigation with mini sprink ranking second the overall result is found to be compliant with the enumerated arguments with regard to the soil and water quality meteorological conditions and the crop pattern of the irrigated land kanber et al 2005 koç 2011 drip irrigation which is likely to generate deficiencies in o m because of high suspended solid parameters in irrigation water ranks third in the case of söke plain field surveys and exchanges with practitioners e g agricultural engineers technicians in söke plain support this result in turkey the 3rd agricultural council meetings were held in 2019 and one of the important outcomes relates to the completion of new irrigation investments and rehabilitation projects in the next 25 years ensuring effective and efficient use of water in agriculture the ministry of agriculture and forestry 2019 also the 1st water council was held in 2021 and its final declaration involves the targets for preparation of the water efficiency strategy document and basin based water efficiency action plans targeting the expansion of modern irrigation methods in economically irrigable lands which apply to söke plain the ministry of agriculture and forestry 2021 in the light of the above targets related to agriculture and water management this study puts forward the selection criteria of irrigation means and dms overall ranking of alternative irrigation methods in söke plain utilizing two comprehensive hybrid mcdm methods which can be replicated in the other river basins of turkey as well as in other basins worldwide for similar purposes hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis methods are flexible and easy to use in terms of dms in fact dms only present their preferences during the pairwise comparison of criteria table 4 and the evaluation of alternatives with respect to each criterion table 5 all the calculations presented in the case study and results section related to these methods are done in microsoft excel program these calculations can easily be adapted to other river basins of turkey the world and other mcdm problems in agriculture and water management once the numbers of criteria alternatives and dms are updated and new preferences of dms are incorporated based on the problem 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid hf ahp promethee ii method is presented for the assessment of irrigation methods in söke plain turkey hf promethee ii is practically applied in many real life problems in the literature with steady results however this method does not include a specific step for calculation of criteria weights therefore a hybrid mcdm method such as hf ahp promethee ii is necessary in hf ahp promethee ii first criteria weights are determined with hf ahp and then these weights are utilized in hf promethee ii and irrigation method alternatives for söke plain are ranked from best to worst for comparison analysis another hybrid mcdm method hf ahp topsis is applied to the same problem and it has been observed that both methods resulted in the same ranking of alternative irrigation methods that is sprinkler best alternative mini sprink drip irrigation surface irrigation and furrow irrigation in hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis the hesitations and vagueness dms might have in their judgements are imitated with the usage of hesitant linguistic terms usage of these terms provide more flexibility to dms in their judgements with this presented hybrid method stable results are obtained without dense calculations the result of ranking by the dms puts forward the sprinkler method as the best alternative for cotton irrigation improving irrigation practices is necessary in the region when the current irrigation data and outputs of the applied hybrid mcdm methods are assessed for future research water supply alternatives for cotton irrigation e g treated domestic and or industrial wastewater recycled drainage water and mixing up conventional water with unconventional water can be evaluated for hedging agricultural water supply in söke plain the result of such research is expected to give an optimal engineering solution trade off between hydrologic agricultural and socio economic aspects and help release the pressure on the water resources of söke plain which is prone to drought under the pressure of both climate change and extensive irrigation needs moreover for future research in terms of mcdm methods inner outer dependence and feedback relationships between criteria can be investigated and therefore hf anp hf analytical network process method can be integrated with mcdm methods such as hf promethee ii hf topsis hf vikor and hf multimoora in order to evaluate and rank various alternatives in mcdm problems of agriculture and water management also different extensions of fuzzy sets such as interval type 2 pythagorean spherical

9409,söke plain turkey is one of the two plains where cotton production is the highest in turkey the leading country for cotton production in the mediterranean basin the cropping pattern in söke plain is dominated by cotton with a ratio of 97 the overall irrigation scheme is equipped with conventional systems i e surface furrow whose efficiency is approximately 50 due to high evaporation and physical losses water efficiency improvement in cotton irrigation necessitates a thorough evaluation of the agricultural water management for söke plain a water scarce region under drought threat in this paper a hybrid multi criteria decision making mcdm method is presented for the evaluation and selection of irrigation methods this process involves various potentially conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria therefore a hybrid mcdm method such as hf ahp promethee ii is needed to make decisions in hf ahp promethee ii hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process hf ahp is first implemented to determine importance weights of criteria and then hesitant fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enriching evaluations ii hf promethee ii is utilized to assess and rank the irrigation method alternatives for comparison analysis hf ahp topsis hf ahp technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method is also implemented to the same problem a case study is presented where five irrigation method alternatives in söke plain are assessed by five expert decision makers dms based on fifteen evaluation criteria sprinkler is found to be the first ranked irrigation method among five alternatives with both hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis resulting in the same ranking the selection of this irrigation technique by the expert dms is compliant with prevailing regional features related to hydrologic climatic environmental conditions and with regard to cotton one of the highest water consuming crops keywords cotton irrigation methods mcdm ahp promethee ii topsis söke plain data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction developing countries in the southern and eastern rim of the mediterranean basin are expected to suffer from severe drought impacts in the near future burak and margat 2016 tramblay et al 2020 hydrological droughts are less predictable than meteorological droughts due to human induced activities like water withdrawal from surface as well as groundwater which ultimately jeopardise water resources and water dependent sectors like agriculture cotton gossypium l is one of the highest water consuming crops grown in warm climatic regions prone to water scarcity decline in water resources and increased droughts in the face of climate change necessitate more efficient irrigation systems for cotton production as a solution to these hazards hydrological drought has been solved by irrigating the full harvesting area and crop yields increased from average to very high chapagain et al 2006 this achievement shows that irrigation is evidently one of the most important factors influencing the yield of cotton production surface irrigation e g flood and furrow is the most commonly used method for cotton irrigation worldwide although modern systems which are mainly sprinkler and drip irrigation are increasingly adopted in water scarce regions their implementation in developing countries is still at a very low rate skhiri and dechmi 2012 since the 1970 s many scientists have conducted studies into water use efficiency and cotton productivity comparing the furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation methods in particular cetin and bilgel 2002 the study carried out by ibragimov et al 2007 shows that the drip irrigation method increases water use efficiency by more than 35 and improves seed lint cotton yield by about 10 19 compared to the furrow irrigation method janat 2008 observed that 25 50 of irrigation water is saved by drip irrigation compared to furrow irrigation and increase in water use efficiency with drip irrigation was twice as high as with furrow irrigation in turkey agriculture is the highest water consuming activity responsible for 77 of total water use corresponding to 45 05 billion m3 whilst the efficiency ratio is approximately 40 50 on the national average dsi 2021 this is due to high evapotranspiration losses and most importantly due to physical losses caused by inefficient surface irrigation methods which means that 50 of the diverted stored water is wasted on the average the distribution of the irrigated areas equipped with different irrigation methods is 1020 441 ha surface irrigation 356 484 ha sprinkler and 280 709 ha drip irrigation corresponding to 61 22 and 17 respectively as of 2019 dsi 2020 the overall irrigation management is under the responsibility of the sate hydraulic works dsi a central agency which delegates the operation and maintenance o m duties to the irrigation associations ias according to the international cotton advisory committee icac that issues the yearly cotton production statistics approximately 65 of the cotton crop production in the world is generated by india china and usa respectively icac 2019 turkey is the 7th country in the world for cotton production and the leading country in the mediterranean basin at present icac 2019 republic of turkey ministry of agriculture and forestry 2017 the south aegean and south eastern regions are the most appropriate for cotton production in turkey since these areas offer the most fertile alluvial soil type with high water holding capacity and also appropriate meteorological conditions with an average temperature above 200 c in summer and above 00 c in winter providing optimum conditions for crop yield mutluer 1997 this research paper has the objective of attaining a consensus by the dms about the best irrigation method among the alternatives considered in söke plain in this respect it supplements the inocottongrow project carried out between 2018 and 2019 aiming at reducing the water footprint of the global cotton textile industry in line with un sustainable development goals in söke plain the study area is located in the southwest part of turkey at the downstream end of büyük menderes river meander river in the aegean region as shown in fig 1 it is one of the ten sub basins of the büyük menderes river which has a total agricultural area of 1149 872 ha out of which 87 is irrigable land republic of turkey ministry of agriculture and forestry 2018 söke plain extends on a 45 000 ha agricultural land out of which 36 000 ha is irrigated within the main basin söke plain ia 2021 söke falls within the mediterranean climate belt with rainfall in winter higher than the potential evapotranspiration pet and occurring between november and march followed by a dry summer burak et al 2021a 2021b rainfall during the cotton growing season between mid april and october is rather short with mean rainfall of 25 mm month and lower than 10 mm month in july and august turkish state meteorological service 2021 the cropping pattern in söke is almost uniform at 97 cotton weber et al 2021 this ratio increased from 88 in 2007 to 97 in 2020 koç 2007 söke plain ia 2021 irrigation is practiced 3 4 times per season the net irrigation demand for the cotton crop varies between 400 and 450 mm for total seasonal applications the pet is fairly stable enabling the reliable forecasting of water demand weber et al 2021 water risk atlas wra tool shows that the büyük menderes river and söke plain are located in an area where the drought risk index is medium high 0 6 0 8 water stress index is extremely high 0 8 and the overall water risk is high 3 4 which represents all water related risks with respect to the physical quantity quality and regulatory reputational risk categories beta aqueduct 2020 hofste et al 2019 these values demonstrate the vulnerability of the region with regard to climate change field surveys indicated that the estimated irrigation efficiency is in the range of 60 in söke plain which means that approximately 40 of diverted water is lost on farm where irrigation is practiced with conventional methods weber et al 2021 one of the main outcomes of the field study demonstrated that agricultural water efficiency in the region should be improved by sustainable management solutions the application of modern irrigation methods helps reduce the water footprint of cotton irrigation relieve the water stress index of the region increase agricultural efficiency and consequently reduce the financial risks of farmers regarding the planning of efficient irrigation techniques it has been proposed to decision makers that they take part in a multi criteria decision making mcdm process to select the most appropriate system for söke plain based on their expertise multi criteria analysis mca and multi criteria decision making mcdm methods are considered to be well suited decision support tools in water resources management since there are many potentially conflicting criteria to consider while making decisions in a given area hajkowicz and collins 2007 an extensive review of applications of mca methods in water resource planning and management is given in hajkowicz and collins s hajkowicz and collins 2007 study with the main focus of water policy

there are so few studies that combined hf ahp and hf promethee methods liang et al 2020 implemented ahp to determine criteria weights and then hf promethee to select suitable hazardous waste disposal enterprises in china previously integrated hf ahp and hf promethee ii to evaluate transformers in a power distribution project however to the best of the authors knowledge a hybrid hf ahp promethee method was applied for the first time in the field of agricultural water management in this study here as the mcdm method hf ahp promethee ii is preferred to have both hf ahp and hf promethee ii methods advantages in the evaluation of irrigation methods promethee methods are easily applicable with stable results moradpour et al 2011 f samanlioglu and ayağ 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2021 2017 2016 velasquez and hester 2013 however methods such as hf promethee hf topsis vikor and electre do not suggest defined guidelines to determine criteria weights assuming these are pre determined by dms appropriately macharis et al 2004 f samanlioglu and ayağ 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2021 2016 velasquez and hester 2013 ahp is stronger in evaluation of qualitative criteria then promethee methods and if there are eight or more criteria with promethee methods the dms may find it tough to assess criteria and alternatives clearly macharis et al 2004 moradpour et al 2011 samanlioglu and ayağ 2020b 2016 with hf ahp quantitative and qualitative criteria can be assessed using pairwise comparisons and dependable criteria weights are determined with the help of consistency checks however implementing solely hf ahp for both evaluation of criteria and alternatives might be burdensome and time consuming due to enormous number of pairwise comparisons particularly when there are many criteria and alternatives in the problem samanlioglu and ayağ 2020a 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2019 2017 therefore in this research in order to obtain reliable results without large number of pairwise comparisons integration of both methods namely hf ahp promethee ii is applied in order to check the stability of results for comparison analysis also hf ahp topsis ahmad et al 2022 alfakeeh et al 2022 alghassab 2022 attaallah and khan 2022 ayağ and samanlioglu 2021 chen et al 2019a 2019b çolak and kaya 2020 nadeem et al 2022 samanlioglu and ayağ 2020a seh et al 2022 suwanasri et al 2014 is implemented to the same problem and the results are presented in the case study section here in both methods hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets hflts and hesitant fuzzy set concepts are utilized along with fuzzy envelope approach to reflect the uncertainty ambiguity and hesitations dms might have in their assessments samanlioglu and kaya 2020 of criteria and irrigation method alternatives utilization of these concepts increases the flexibility of dms in the decision making process and makes the whole process close to real samanlioglu and ayağ 2020a 2020b samanlioglu and ayağ 2021 samanlioglu and kaya 2020 to the best of the authors knowledge there is no research in the literature that has utilized a mcdm method such as hf ahp promethee ii or hf ahp topsis for the evaluation of irrigation methods to this date therefore as the objective motivation of the study it is expected that application of these two relatively recent mcdm methods both hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis in the decision making process of the irrigation method will bring new insight to the literature more specifically implementation of hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis hybrid mcdm methods in irrigation method selection broadens the assessment perspective to include all significant aspects for the irrigation method decision process focuses on attaining a consensus decision that is agreeable to all dms in a structured way provides a framework that can accommodate imprecise data quantitative and qualitative potentially conflicting criteria and group decision making with various dms and even incorporates hesitations of dms in their preferences to the process moreover application of these methods in the selection of the irrigation method reduces the biases from dms depending on their gut instincts and groupthink failures that affect solely intuitive methods in the next section these methods are explained in detail 2 methodology hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis for comparison analysis 2 1 hesitant fuzzy sets hfs and application of fuzzy envelope approach in hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis fuzzy envelope approach liu and rodríguez 2014 is used for hesitant assessments and corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers tfns are determined in this approach based on the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets hflts linguistic expressions can be embodied by a tfn and the details are given in this section since hflts are used in this paper these methods are called hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis in hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis triangular hesitant fuzzy sets thfs are applied to define the uncertain data and hesitation and vagueness of preferences of dms and linguistic variables fuzzy set theory contains classes with soft boundaries klir and yuan 1995 lootsma 1997 and using fuzzy set theories crisp ones can be fuzzified zadeh 1994 a fuzzy number is a fuzzy set f x μ f x x r where x is r x and μ f x is from r to 0 1 tfns are easy to apply

2030 around 20 by 2050 and around 45 by 2100 ozkul 2009 increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation will result in reduced river discharge decreased water levels and dried streambeds followed by severe adverse impacts on water availability and quality as agriculture is excessively water dependent it will be one of the most impacted sectors by drought durdu 2010 irrigated fields in the basin continue to expand with a large number of water works and irrigation schemes in söke plain in particular where water is the main input of economic activities extensive irrigation with conventional methods has already aggravated the pressure on water resources with regard to quantity and quality söke plain is one of the regions facing water salinity and alkalinity in turkey koç 2008 due to salinity washing out the soil to remove the salt followed by leaching applications are traditional excessive leaching not only increases water table problems with clogging and losses in the yield but also increases water consumption in the plain and decreases water quality due to leaching soil problems lead to inefficiencies in the downstream irrigation farms although sprinkler systems are adaptable to most of the soil types they are best suited to sandy alluvial soils with high infiltration rates with appropriate design measures of irrigation rate surface ponding and runoff can be avoided couto et al 2013 koç 2008 in line with hydrologic environmental agricultural and socio economic features prevailing in söke plain and further planning in agricultural expansion of cotton production measures to increase water use efficiency in irrigation is a must moreover existing heavy irrigation activities also have adverse impacts on the water bodies of the büyük menderes river basin causing changes on their hydromorphology e g bafa lake a natural park under severe threat of water level lowering ülker et al 2021 modern irrigation techniques are increasingly advised at regional and national level to replace conventional systems as they are more efficient environmentally correct and sustainable in this research 15 criteria have been evaluated to make a comprehensive assessment of the irrigation methods aiming at more sustainable agricultural management practices in söke plain the results of the evaluation tables with two hybrid mcdm methods hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis have shown that dms have opted primarily for sprinkler irrigation with mini sprink ranking second the overall result is found to be compliant with the enumerated arguments with regard to the soil and water quality meteorological conditions and the crop pattern of the irrigated land kanber et al 2005 koç 2011 drip irrigation which is likely to generate deficiencies in o m because of high suspended solid parameters in irrigation water ranks third in the case of söke plain field surveys and exchanges with practitioners e g agricultural engineers technicians in söke plain support this result in turkey the 3rd agricultural council meetings were held in 2019 and one of the important outcomes relates to the completion of new irrigation investments and rehabilitation projects in the next 25 years ensuring effective and efficient use of water in agriculture the ministry of agriculture and forestry 2019 also the 1st water council was held in 2021 and its final declaration involves the targets for preparation of the water efficiency strategy document and basin based water efficiency action plans targeting the expansion of modern irrigation methods in economically irrigable lands which apply to söke plain the ministry of agriculture and forestry 2021 in the light of the above targets related to agriculture and water management this study puts forward the selection criteria of irrigation means and dms overall ranking of alternative irrigation methods in söke plain utilizing two comprehensive hybrid mcdm methods which can be replicated in the other river basins of turkey as well as in other basins worldwide for similar purposes hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis methods are flexible and easy to use in terms of dms in fact dms only present their preferences during the pairwise comparison of criteria table 4 and the evaluation of alternatives with respect to each criterion table 5 all the calculations presented in the case study and results section related to these methods are done in microsoft excel program these calculations can easily be adapted to other river basins of turkey the world and other mcdm problems in agriculture and water management once the numbers of criteria alternatives and dms are updated and new preferences of dms are incorporated based on the problem 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid hf ahp promethee ii method is presented for the assessment of irrigation methods in söke plain turkey hf promethee ii is practically applied in many real life problems in the literature with steady results however this method does not include a specific step for calculation of criteria weights therefore a hybrid mcdm method such as hf ahp promethee ii is necessary in hf ahp promethee ii first criteria weights are determined with hf ahp and then these weights are utilized in hf promethee ii and irrigation method alternatives for söke plain are ranked from best to worst for comparison analysis another hybrid mcdm method hf ahp topsis is applied to the same problem and it has been observed that both methods resulted in the same ranking of alternative irrigation methods that is sprinkler best alternative mini sprink drip irrigation surface irrigation and furrow irrigation in hf ahp promethee ii and hf ahp topsis the hesitations and vagueness dms might have in their judgements are imitated with the usage of hesitant linguistic terms usage of these terms provide more flexibility to dms in their judgements with this presented hybrid method stable results are obtained without dense calculations the result of ranking by the dms puts forward the sprinkler method as the best alternative for cotton irrigation improving irrigation practices is necessary in the region when the current irrigation data and outputs of the applied hybrid mcdm methods are assessed for future research water supply alternatives for cotton irrigation e g treated domestic and or industrial wastewater recycled drainage water and mixing up conventional water with unconventional water can be evaluated for hedging agricultural water supply in söke plain the result of such research is expected to give an optimal engineering solution trade off between hydrologic agricultural and socio economic aspects and help release the pressure on the water resources of söke plain which is prone to drought under the pressure of both climate change and extensive irrigation needs moreover for future research in terms of mcdm methods inner outer dependence and feedback relationships between criteria can be investigated and therefore hf anp hf analytical network process method can be integrated with mcdm methods such as hf promethee ii hf topsis hf vikor and hf multimoora in order to evaluate and rank various alternatives in mcdm problems of agriculture and water management also different extensions of fuzzy sets such as interval type 2 pythagorean spherical
