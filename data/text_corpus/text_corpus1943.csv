9715,growing demands for water energy and food put many systems at a composite risk of resource shortages there was a lack of approaches capable of effectively assessing tridimensional composite risk and describing non linear correlations among subsystem risks within a water energy food wef nexus system in this study an integrated approach was developed to assess the composite risk of wef nexus systems and generate risk based plans specifically a composite risk assessment model that could capture the interdependence among the risk for water energy and food shortage was proposed furthermore a generalized copula based chance constrained programming model and its solving algorithm were developed the proposed approach has been applied to an agricultural wef nexus system in northern china where the shortage of water energy and or land affected agricultural outputs results show that the composite risk of the entire system would be higher than the maximum value among subsystem risks but less than their sum higher composite risks could bring higher benefits under a certain composite risk the overall system benefit would vary with different combinations of subsystem risks and it could be promoted through coordinating resources supplied by different subsystems a risk benefit frontier consisting of optimal solutions corresponding to different combinations of composite and subsystem risks was identified through monte carlo simulation the scheme that could generate 12 76 billion yuan under a moderate composite risk level of 0 22 was recommended for the study problem accordingly net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area should be no less than 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively keywords water energy food nexus composite risk copula analysis optimization model agricultural water management 1 introduction water energy food wef security nexus has gained considerable attention from public and academia since the bonn conference held in 2011 hoff 2011 van vuuren et al 2019 the global risks report sixth edition 2011 published by the world economic forum highlighted wef nexus as one of the three important clusters of risks in focus wef 2011 water energy and food resources had long been separately managed as system inputs but their interactions were largely overlooked opejin et al 2020 tan and zhang 2018 c l zhang et al 2019 p zhang et al 2019 due to population growth and anthropogenic activities growing demands for water energy and food put many production systems at a composite risk of input insufficiencies thus it is desired to assess the system level composite risk and optimize risk based schemes on the basis of comprehensive considerations over interactions within a nexus system de amorim et al 2018 hussien et al 2018 liang et al 2020 to understand the overall risks of multiple interrelated subsystems a number of risk assessment methods have been proposed such as weighted sum methods liu and chen 2019 bayesian networks pang and sun 2014 shi et al 2020 and agent based models chen and lin 2019 terzi et al 2019 recently these methods have also been applied to assess the overall risk of wef nexus systems bieber et al 2018 memarzadeh et al 2019 namany et al 2020 nevertheless a major limitation of the above methods lied in their incapability of tackling multiple random variables with different types of probability distributions and unknown correlations superior to those methods copula theory is effective for merging multiple marginal distribution functions into a multivariate distribution function and modeling its multivariate dependence structure guo et al 2020 nelsen 2006 copula theory has been extensively used for addressing economic and environmental management problems fan et al 2016 yue et al 2018 and was recently applied to analyze composite risks of nexus systems for instance cai et al 2019 adopted bivariate copulas to assess the interactive risk of water and energy shortages in an urban agglomeration area in northern china unfortunately bivariate copulas cannot capture interdependence of multiple variables with higher dimensions trivariate copulas and other high dimensional copulas are thus desired trivariate copulas have been used in the fields of hydrology and finance bruneau et al 2020 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2015 yang and qian 2019 for instance ribeiro et al 2019 applied the copula approach to assess the risk of drought hazard on agricultural systems however to the best of our knowledge there are no reported studies measuring high dimensional composite risk of a wef nexus system caused by interdependent random inputs for wef nexus systems with complex interactions between subsystems the shortage of one resource can affect the use of other resources and lead to mismatched supply of multiple resources systematic planning is thus required to provide composite risk based management options for wef nexus systems dong et al 2014 tan et al 2010 mathematical programming methods have been extensively used for supporting risk based resources management amjath babu et al 2019 ji et al 2020 li et al 2019 nie et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2020 tan et al 2015 particularly stochastic mathematical programming methods have been prevalently used dong et al 2015 tan et al 2017 joint chance constrained programming jcp is effective for reflecting the system violation risk of a set of probabilistic constraints wang et al 2018 zhuang et al 2015 nevertheless conventional jcp methods only tackle random variables that separately followed normal distributions chen et al 2016 it is incapable for dealing with random variables following different types of distributions and without known correlations chen et al 2017 to overcome such limitations copula based chance constrained programming cbcp was proposed chen et al 2016 on the basis of it many copula based inexact programming methods were proposed for addressing the overall risks in solid waste management chen et al 2016 water resources management kong et al 2018 energy system management chen et al 2017 and energy water nexus management yu et al 2020a 2020b most of these cbcp studies were limited to bi variate copulas however cbcp and its algorithm cannot address the high dimensional composite risk of input insufficiencies therefore this study aims to bridge above mentioned research gaps through developing an integrated approach for assessing the composite risk of resource shortages and correspondingly identifying optimal planning schemes the contributions of this research include the following two aspects firstly a composite risk assessment model is established for measuring high dimensional composite risk of wef nexus systems secondly a generalized copula based chance constrained programming gcbcp approach and its solving algorithm are developed the proposed algorithm provides a paradigm for solving different types of gcbcp models and the general formulas for solving two typical types of gcbcp with high dimensional copula functions are given gcbcp can help support the management of composite risk and uncover the impacts of composite risk on wef systems the developed methodology is applied to the planning of an agricultural wef nexus system in northern china to exemplify its applicability 2 methodology the purpose of this study is to assess the composite risk of wef nexus systems and provide optimal planning schemes under such composite risks in this section an integrated approach is developed for composite risk assessment and resources management of wef nexus system the developing process of the integrated approach for wef nexus composite risk management is illustrated in fig 1 firstly in order to assess the risk of the wef nexus system a novel composite risk assessment model is developed on the basis of copula and probability theories it is capable of measuring the composite risk composed by multiple subsystem risks with complex interdependence then a generalized composite risk based optimization model with its solving algorithm is proposed gcbcp can effectively address the randomly distributed information with nonlinear dependence provide solutions under quantified composite risks and help identify desired alternatives it is effective for supporting composite risk based planning for wef nexus system and in depth analysis of the tradeoffs between system outputs and violation risks scenario analysis is then undertaken to explore the effect of subsystem risks with complex interactions given the risk levels of subsystem the composite risk level can be calculated by the copula function then the thresholds of water energy and food availability can be obtained and used as inputs of the composite risk based optimization model that is the right hand side parameters of chance constraints of gcbcp through solving gcbcp optimal planning for wef nexus system under different scenarios can be obtained then the impact of subsystem risks and composite risks on system outputs can be quantified 2 1 composite risk assessment model in this subsection the composite risk assessment model of wef nexus is developed after introducing the concept of copula theory copulas are functions that join or couple one dimensional marginal distribution functions to multivariate distribution functions nelsen 2006 any form of marginal distributions can be connected through copula functions to obtain their joint probability distribution functions wang et al 2017 sklar s theorem clarifies the important role of copula function in constructing joint distribution of multivariate functions sklar s theorem in n dimensions is expressed as 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n c u 1 u 2 u n where f x 1 x 2 x n is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of n dimensional distribution function with continuous marginal cdfs of random variables f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n and f k x k u k for k 1 n with u k u 0 1 bouye et al 2000 wong et al 2010 nelsen 2006 if the marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n are continuous the copula function c is unique the copula approach allows for marginal distributions and the joint behavior of variables to be modeled separately this is done by transforming the univariate variables x k into uniform variables u k by applying a suitable marginal distribution f k the copula function c can have different dependence structures and there are four categories of copula functions archimedean extreme value elliptical and other miscellaneous class wong et al 2010 a common n dimensional copula is a multivariate cdf c with the following properties bouye et al 2000 sun et al 2016 1 c is defined on i n 0 1 n 2 c is bounded and monotonically increasing 3 c has n one dimensional margins c k k 1 2 n which satisfy c kc u k c 1 1 u k 1 1 u k 0 u k 1 the composite risk is typically defined as the occurrence probability of adverse events the assessment of composite risk can be summarized into the following main steps firstly defining the adverse events secondly describing the correlation structure between subsystem risks through copula function finally calculating the occurrence probability of adverse events in detail the construction of the copula function is introduced in appendix a the maximum likelihood estimation method can be used to estimate parameters in marginal distribution functions and copula functions guo et al 2020 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 it should be emphasized that the probability of a joint distribution expressed as a copula function is not necessarily equivalent to the composite risk in fact the measurement of composite risk is made on a case by case basis take the composite risk of a wef system induced by insufficient input resources as an example as the inputs of wef nexus system the randomness in the availabilities of water energy and food leads to the composite risk of resource supply the adverse event refers to the shortage of at least one resource on the contrary the expected event is that the availabilities of all resources exceed certain thresholds thus the composite risk of input insufficiencies can be expressed as follows 2 1 c ˆ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where c ˆ is the survival copula of the x i representing the joint probability of exceedance and f i x i p x x i 1 f i x i is the survival function of x i the survival copula c ˆ can be obtained by 3 c ˆ u c 1 u 4 c u 1 i 1 n u i s p 1 s c s u i i s where c is the joint survival function associated with c p is the set of all subsets of 1 2 n with at least two elements s denotes the cardinality of s and c s represents the marginal copula of c with dimension equal to s salvadori et al 2016 2 2 composite risk based optimization model in this subsection gcbcp and its solving algorithm are proposed for planning wef nexus systems under composite risks a general gcbcp formulation can be expressed as 5 max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 6 pr j 1 n a i j x j b i t i 1 2 k j 1 n a i j x j b i t i k 1 k 2 m α 1 p 7 j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 l 8 x j 0 j 1 2 n where x j is the decision variable a i j c j and b i are deterministic parameters and b i is random variable with unknown probability distribution the entire set of chance constraints are enforced to be satisfied with at least a joint probability of α and the violation risk is p in gcbcp an increased individual risk level refers to the increase of constraint violation risk and decreased strictness for satisfying constraints and vice versa c l zhang et al 2019 p zhang et al 2019 increased composite risk means that there is a raised risk of violating the set of chance constrained constraints due to the presence of random variables in chance constraints gcbcp is nonlinear and need to be transferred to its deterministic equivalents according to the type of chance constraints gcbcp can be divided into the three types 1 chance constraints are all expressed as inequality with marked as type 1 model 2 chance constraints are all expressed as inequality with marked as type 2 model and 3 chance constraints have different combinations of inequalities with both and marked as type 3 model previously chen et al 2016 proposed and solved type 1 model through a case study of waste management problem gao et al 2018 studied type 2 model in a water resources management problem with bivariate copula nevertheless there is a lack of a general algorithm for solving these gcbcp problems in this study a general solving algorithm of gcbcp with high dimensional copulas is proposed the proposed solving algorithm consists of four steps 1 define the expected and adverse events 2 calculate the probability of adverse events i e the composite risk 3 transform joint chance constraints into individual chance constraints and 4 transform the chance constraints into linear expression in the following type 1 and type 2 models are used as examples to show the applicability of the proposed algorithm for type 3 model according to the definition of adverse events the composite risk can be assessed based on copula and probability theories then this model can be solved following the proposed solving algorithm 2 2 1 type 1 model for type 1 model the expected event is that j 1 n a i j x j b i t are all satisfied for constraints i 1 2 m k m the occurrence probability of expected event can be expressed as follows 9 pr b 1 t j 1 n a i j x j b 2 t j 1 n a i j x j b m t j 1 n a i j x j c f b 1 b 1 f b 2 b 2 f b m b m c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m where p i is the violation risk of constraint i 1 2 m adverse events are the opposite of expected events for type 1 model an adverse event occurs if any random variable b i is greater than j 1 n a i j x j thus the composite risk can be expressed as follows 10 1 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m by letting the random variables take a set of individual probabilistic constraints the set of chance constraints can be transformed into its linear expression as follows huang 1998 11 j 1 n a i j x j b i t 1 p i i 12 1 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m p where b i t 1 p i f b i 1 1 p i and f b i 1 is the inverse cdf of b i based on the algorithm introduced above the type 1 model can be transformed into the following linear deterministic version 13 max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 14 j 1 n a i j x j b i t 1 p i i 15 1 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m p 16 j 1 n a i j x j b i i 17 x j 0 j 2 2 2 type 2 model for type 2 model the expected event is that the random parameters b i in all chance constraints are no less than j 1 n a i j x j k 0 the probability of an expected event is expressed as the joint probability of exceedance c ˆ for type 2 model the adverse event occurs if any b i is less than j 1 n a i j x j thus the probability of adverse events that equal to 1 minus exceedance probability can be expressed as follows 18 1 pr b 1 t j 1 n a i j x j b n t j 1 n a i j x j 1 c ˆ f 1 x 1 f n x n i 1 m p i s p 1 s c s p i i s for type 2 model the eq 6 can be transformed into the following linear expression 19 j 1 n a i j x j b i t p i i 20 i 1 m p i s p 1 s c s p i i s p where b i t p i f b i 1 p i based on the algorithm introduced above the type 2 model can be transformed into the following linear deterministic version 21 max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 22 j 1 n a i j x j b i t p i i 23 i 1 m p i s p 1 s c s p i i s p 24 j 1 n a i j x j b i i 25 x j 0 j then the deterministic expression of gcbcp model can be solved as a linear programming model 3 application 3 1 problem statement and data collection bayan nur is a national key food base located in the west of inner mongolia northern china net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area are key factors for supporting the operation of agricultural production system due to the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors the availabilities of these three parameters cannot be estimated precisely in fact these parameters can be approximately expressed as random variables with distribution information moreover the utilization of water energy and land resources are closely interdependent for example the effective irrigation area refers to the area that can be irrigated normally which is affected by the availability of irrigation water resources increased net irrigation water and effective irrigation area also mean higher agricultural energy consumption in the studied agricultural wef nexus system the composite risk is arising from the randomness of the availability water energy and food inputs the composite risk is defined as the joint probability of a shortage of at least one resource that is the occurrence probability that either the availability of water energy and food resources is less than the corresponding threshold value the subsystem risk means the shortage risk of single resource there are many questions to be answered for instance how to assess the composite risk of the wef nexus system under what levels should the shortage risks of water energy and food be controlled what is the impact of individual sub system risk on system outputs to answer these questions it becomes urgent to develop tools for the composite risk assessment and management of agricultural wef nexus system therefore the integrated approach proposed in this study is deemed suitable for the studied problem there are five main crops in bayan nur including wheat maize sunflowers vegetables and melons the main irrigation method is flood irrigation with a small proportion of drip irrigation the relevant data including costs prices irrigation water requirements irrigation water efficiency production demands effective irrigation area etc are collected from bayan nur statistic year book 2000 2018 government official reports field research and related publications the historical data of net irrigation water is calculated from multiplying irrigation water resources by irrigation water utilization coefficient energy input for agriculture is the sum of rural electricity and agricultural diesel 3 2 assessment of composite risk the results of the dependence between water energy and food factors are shown in table 1 the three correlation coefficients of water energy and water food were greater than 0 5 with statistical significance indicating that water energy and water food have medium correlations particularly the correlation coefficients of energy food were higher than 0 8 showing strong correlation between energy and food resources these results proved that there are strong correlations between water energy and food that could not be neglected three commonly used theoretical distribution functions i e normal distribution lognormal distribution and weibull distribution were used to fit the distribution of net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area the estimated parameters of marginal distribution functions are shown in table 2 according to k s test shown in table 3 all the proposed distribution functions can be employed to model the distributions of available water energy and food resources with the significance level higher than 0 05 the best fitted marginal distribution functions were selected based on rmse the results reveal that lognormal distribution fitted the best for water and food while normal distribution was found to be more suitable for energy for the assessment of composite risk several copula functions are fitted to observe the interdependent of water energy and food resources availability for agricultural production with goodness of fit being assessed the archimedean family is the most popular copula family because of its ease of construction and wide range of choices for the strength of dependence khedun et al 2014 in this study four most commonly used one parameter copula function from archimedean family were tested for determining the joint probability distribution of water energy and food risks the mathematical expressions and estimated parameters of trivariate copulas including clayton gumbel frank and ali mikhail haq copula are shown in table 4 it was found that the clayton copula had the minimum rmse value thus it was selected to describe the joint distribution of available water energy and food resources of bayan nur city fig 2 displays the relationship between composite risk and three subsystem risks in fig 2 a the x y and z axis respectively represents the shortage risk of water energy and food resources the color of each point indicates the level of composite risk of wef nexus system this picture shows the coupling effect of subsystem risks on composite risk it can be observed that the composite risk would increase with the increase of subsystem risks under a given composite risk level value of each subsystem risk would be restricted to a certain range for instance when the composite risk is low the sub system risks would be low the orthogonal slice planes drew along the x y and z directions would be helpful for revealing the interactions among composite risk and subsystem risks it can be observed that under certain levels of composite risk and one of the subsystem risks the changes of the other two subsystem risks would be opposite fig 2 b d respectively displays the composite risk under 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 energy risk level as examples under certain levels of composite risk and energy risk the food risk would gradually decrease as the water risk increases it also can be seen that composite risk would be greater than the maximum value of subsystem risk 3 3 modelling formulation a gcbcp model for supporting agricultural production under the composite risk of resources shortage is established the objective of gcbcp is to maximize the agricultural system benefits the decision variable is a ijk denoting planting area of crop i in sub irrigation district j using irrigation method k hm2 this model is constrained by the limitation of water energy and food resources crop production demands and local planting habits the fitted copulas are used for describing the dependence structure of water energy and food resources the joint chance constraints restrict the availabilities of water energy and food resources not to exceed thresholds under a certain composite risk thresholds of water energy and food availability are obtained under given levels of composite risk and subsystem risks the gcbcp model for planning irrigated agricultural system under composite risk of wef nexus can be formulated as follows objective function 26 max f i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k y i k p r i a i j k c t i k constraints 1 water availability the field water consumption should be no more than the water resources availability under a certain level of subsystem risk 27 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k η f a i j k a i q i k β a w α 1 1 p 1 2 energy availability the irrigation energy consumption should be no more than the energy availability under a certain level of subsystem risk 28 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a e c i k e n α 2 1 p 2 3 arable land availability the crop planting area should be no more than the available effective irrigation area under a certain level of subsystem risk 29 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a l α 3 1 p 3 4 constraint of composite risk the composite risk of wef nexus system should be no more than the controlled composite risk level 30 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k η f a i j k a i q i k β a w i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a e c i k e n i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a l α 1 p 5 production

area in recent years 32 a i j k b a i j k i j k 7 nonnegative constraints 33 a i j k 0 i j k the abbreviation and detailed explanations of coefficients are given in appendix b 3 4 optimization of irrigated agricultural system scenario analysis would be helpful for exploring the impacts of composite and individual risks and the tradeoffs between violation risks and system benefits two composite risk levels representing low and high composite risk levels were considered which were 0 06 and 0 10 respectively under each composite risk level 7 different combinations of individual risk levels were provided the rule of scenario setting was to change two of the individual subsystem risks when the composite risk and the risk of the third subsystem are given detailed information of the scenario setting is shown in table 5 it can be observed that the composite risk would be no less than the highest subsystem risk and no more than the sum of subsystem risks this verifies that the composite risk would not be equivalent to the sum of subsystem risks due to the nonlinear interactions between subsystems 3 4 1 planting patterns the optimal crop planting plans under the constrained water energy and food resources can be obtained from solving gcbcp the interpretation of the results shows the usefulness of the optimized plans in guiding agricultural production as shown in fig 3 sunflowers and corn would be the most popular crops and their planting areas would rank among the top two in all scenarios wheat and vegetables would have the third or fourth largest planting areas alternately melons would have the least cultivation area moreover the planting of sunflowers and vegetables would be more sensitive to the variations of subsystem risks than the other crops particularly it can be observed that the variations of planting areas of these two crops would be in accordance with the changes of energy risk take high composite risk as an example under s8 s9 and s10 planting areas of sunflowers and vegetables would gradually increase with the increase of energy risk and the decrease of food risk under s10 s13 and s14 the planting area of sunflowers would gradually decrease with reduced energy risk the frequently changes of sunflowers and vegetables planting areas are mainly because of their higher economic benefits per unit of energy consumed the constantly changes of the planting of crop would also affect the amount of total cropping areas the variation of crop planting areas under drip irrigation and flood irrigation fig 4 and the amount of cultivation area for each sub irrigation district would have the same trend as the changes of energy risk fig 5 moreover the crop planting areas would increase non linearly with the growth of energy risks due to the complex non linear dependence structure of subsystem risks from the perspective of composite risk crop planting areas would be enlarged with the raise of composite risk for instance the maximum value of total planting area would be obtained in s3 under low composite risk and obtained in s10 under high composite risk compared with s3 the total amount of crop planting area would increase by 27 in s10 besides the planting area of sunflowers and vegetables would respectively increase by 60 and 24 increase of flood irrigation and drip irrigation areas would also be observed with the increase of composite risks 3 4 2 resource consumption the setting of different combinations of subsystem risk would substantially affect resource consumption fig 6 represents the net water consumption energy use and cultivated land area under different scenarios it can be observed that agricultural energy consumption would be equal to its availability while the supply of the other two resources would have surplus these imply that energy would be the main limiting factor in these studied scenarios though such results may go against the intuitive impression that water is a major constraint on local agricultural production results indicate that availability of energy for agriculture should receive more attention when composite risk was strictly controlled it also can be observed that resource consumption would climb with increased composite risk this is because that with a higher composite risk being tolerated there would be a larger relaxed decision domain therefore more resources can be consumed to obtain higher benefits 3 4 3 system benefits optimal crop planting schemes obtained under different scenarios would lead to different system benefits shown in fig 6 under the same composite risk level changes of system economic benefits would have the same trend as threshold of energy availability under all analyzed scenarios indicating energy risk would have substantial impacts on the system benefits meanwhile the system benefits would change non linearly due to the complex non linear dependence structure of subsystem risks when composite risk remained unchanged system economic benefits would increase sharply with a more coordinated supply of water energy and food resources for instance the economic benefits under s3 would be higher than those of s1 and s2 though these three scenarios had same level of composite risk this is mainly because of the coordinating of resources supplied by different subsystems to be specific available energy resource had been fully utilized in s1 while available water and land resources had not been fully utilized and there was surplus of these two resources as energy risk increase from s1 to s3 the surplus water and arable land resources could be used to support agricultural production with the increased availability of energy resources such trends would also be observed under scenarios with high composite risk level i e s8 s10 as the acceptable composite risk getting higher the economic benefits would increase rapidly for instance system benefits obtained under low and high composite risk level would vary between 6 31 109 and 9 12 109 yuan and between 6 31 109 and 11 29 109 yuan respectively the highest attainable system benefits would increase with aroused composite risk it should be noted that increase of system benefits would also be accompanied by raised violation risks of constraints results also indicate that low system benefits could also occur under higher composite risk levels further clarifying the importance of synergy management of resource supply in summary gcbcp can effectively provide a series of optimal planning schemes for agricultural planting under different shortage risks of water energy and food resources from a methodological point of view gcbcp is capable of providing in depth analyses of interactions among multiple subsystem risks and the tradeoffs between composite system violation risks and system benefits from a practical application perspective decision makers can screen optimal alternatives based on tradeoffs between benefits and risks thus the obtained solutions can better assist in risk management and further support sustainable development of wef nexus system 3 5 discussions 3 5 1 monte carlo simulation in order to investigate the impacts of composite risk on system outputs monte carlo simulation was conducted bouye et al 2000 a total of 10 000 triplets of scenarios p p 1 p 2 p 3 were generated through random sampling through solving gcbcp optimal solutions under various combinations of composite and subsystem risks were acquired results obtained from monte carlo simulation are depicted in fig 7 in this figure each point represents a feasible solution the vertical ordinate represents the system benefit corresponding to each optimal scheme and the horizontal ordinate represents the composite risk of the optimized scheme meanwhile each point is colored based on the risk level of water energy and food in fig 7 a b and c respectively visualizing system benefits with both sub system and compromise risks can be helpful for examining the interactive impacts of sub system risks on system benefits on the whole the system benefits would vary from 5 61 to 14 27 billion yuan with the increase of composite risk the system benefits would be relatively low under a lower level of composite risk this is because that resource availabilities would be controlled at a lower level as the composite risk increased the economic benefits would increase significantly in most of the scenarios the supply of all three resources under higher composite risk levels would be sufficient for achieving high economic benefits however a few schemes would have extremely low system benefits under higher composite risks serious shortage of one or two resources existed in these scenarios whether it would be water energy food resource or their combinations thus severely hampered economic growth this implies that focusing on the risk of one or two resources cannot guarantee the security of the whole system under the same composite risk level the schemes obtained under different sub system risk combinations would have different system benefits the outermost points in fig 7 form a composite risk system benefit frontier shown in fig 8 this curve provided a range of highest attainable system benefits under different composite risks decision makers could thus screen the most beneficial schemes based on tradeoffs between system benefits and composite risks it can be seen from fig 8 that the minimum composite risk among all feasible solutions would be 0 06 correspondingly the highest attainable system economic benefit under 0 06 composite risk would be 8 62 109 yuan subsequently system benefits would increase with raised composite risk the system benefits would have a rapid growth until composite risk reach to 0 22 then the growth rate would gradually slow down the highest attainable system benefits under 0 22 composite risk would be 12 76 109 yuan under this circumstance subsystem risks of water energy and food would be 0 08 0 17 and 0 15 respectively accordingly the net irrigation water energy for agriculture and cultivation land resources would be 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively eventually the system benefits would stay steady around 14 109 yuan under a composite risk level of 0 99 representing the ultimate highest benefits that system could achieve considering the real world restriction nevertheless this point suggests that high economic benefits could be achieved with high composite risks and reduced marginal benefits although the economic benefits would increase by nearly 10 the composite risk would expand 3 5 times in summary the combined effects of composite risk would be very complex analyzing the effects of compromised risk on system output not only need to consider the limitations of a single resource but also include the interaction between them simulation results showed that serious shortage of one or two resources would hamper economic growth it is suggested to coordinate resources supplied by each subsystem so as to promote system benefits moreover a composite risk benefit frontier consisting of a range of optimal solutions with different combinations of risks were identified through monte carol simulation it is suggested that net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area should be no less than 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively by this means a satisfactory system benefits of 12 76 109 yuan could be achieved with a moderate composite risk level of 0 22 3 5 2 practical implications the integrated approach proposed in this study would facilitate the in depth analyses of wef nexus with twofold first of all it assessed the composite risk of agricultural wef systems integrating subsystem risks and quantifying the correlation between subsystem risks from a wef nexus perspective are the distinctive characteristic of this research in contrast commonly employed agricultural management methods that solely focus on water shortage risk are strongly limited in their ability to respond to varied combinations of water energy and food risks successfully balancing the tradeoffs between system benefits and composite risks is another contribution of this work results highlight that higher composite risks could bring higher system benefits under a certain composite risk coordinated allocation of resources can significantly improve benefits if not properly managed the imbalanced resource inputs can lead to a significant reduction in system benefits decision makers are remained that not only water but also energy are key resources constraining agricultural production especially under low composite risk levels moreover monte carlo simulation identified an efficient composite risk system benefit frontier providing a series of optimal solutions with the highest attainable system benefits under different composite risks consequently decision makers can choose the optimal planting scheme according to their risk preferences the consumption of water energy and land resources corresponding to the optimal schemes can be viewed as the minimum resource demands for supporting agricultural production these key parameters provide decision makers with scientific basis for input resource management beyond the applied case this study also has implications on other wef nexus systems across the globe confronting with composite risk management problems it should be noted that identifying and defining adverse events is the most crucial link for assessing composite risk and developing risk based planning for nexus systems the lack of this procedure hindered the practical applications of previous cbcp methods cbcp can be viewed as a special case of gcbcp in comparison gcbcp is more versatile than cbcp for being able to handle problems with complex composite risk more importantly the measured composite risk is not necessarily equivalent to the result from a copula function for instance in this study the composite risk refers to the occurrence probability that either the availability of water energy and food resources is less than a certain threshold value if the copula function is directly used to assess the composite risk it partially ignores the risk of water shortage when energy and food resources are sufficient furthermore real world problems are often more complicated for example the composite risk can be expressed as the probability that at least one variable is less than the threshold or the probability that only one of multiple variables is less than the threshold the application of the developed integrated approach certainly has limitations generally speaking three dimensional copula is difficult to obtain for the sake of simplicity this study only used multivariate archimedean copulas with one dependence parameter θ for describing the trivariate domain and each pair of variables this can be remedied by introducing nested copulas or other families of copulas such as plackett family kao and govindaraju 2008 if there are more than three representative parameters the acquisition of copula function will be more complicated consider using vine copula for characterization 4 conclusions growing demands for water energy and food put many production systems at a composite risk of resource shortages ignoring the complicated correlations between resource availability leads to inaccurate assessment of composite risk thus it is importance to assess the high dimensional composite risks and optimize risk based planning schemes in this study an integrated approach was developed for composite risk assessment and management firstly a composite risk assessment model was developed it could assess the composite risk of wef nexus induced by random uncertainty and capture the dependence structure of sub system risks then gcbcp and its solving algorithms were proposed for supporting composite risk management it could not only provide composite risk based solutions but also reflect the effect of subsystem risks on system outputs overall this integrated approach could help examine the influences of interactions of subsystem risks and analyze the tradeoffs between system profits and composite risks the applicability of the developed integrated approach has been demonstrated in an agricultural wef nexus system net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area are key factors for supporting agricultural production the results show that the copula theory could be employed to estimate the joint distribution of water energy and food resources the composite risk of the entire system would be higher than the maximum value of subsystem risks but less than their sum optimal solutions for crop planting patterns were generated under different scenarios higher composite risks could bring higher benefits under the same composite risk system benefits could be promoted by coordinating resource supplies a composite risk benefit frontier consisting of a range of optimal solutions under different scenarios was identified through monte carlo simulation decision makers could thus screen optimal alternatives based on tradeoffs between benefits and risks results indicate that 12 76 billion yuan achieved under a moderate composite risk level of 0 22 would be a reasonable solution for the study problem accordingly net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area should be controlled at 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively definition of the adverse event is the most crucial process of the proposed approach given extensive attention to the application of copula theory to risk management there exists potential in the future research to improve gcbcp including but not limited to the introduction of other families of copulas to quantify the relationship of wef nexus more accurately the

and suggestions appendix a detailed steps for constructing copula functions the construction of copula function is further divided into three steps firstly clarify the dependences of availability of water energy and food resources secondly build the respective marginal distribution function and lastly build copula function specifically for the first step pearson r n spearman ρ n and kendall τ n correlation coefficients are utilized for fitting the linear dependence the correlation between the pairs r i s i of ranks and the ranks of the observations respectively the mathematical expressions

favre 2007 the second step is to build and choose the most appropriate marginal distribution functions of water energy and food resources to fit the observed water energy and food variables a suite of commonly used theoretical probability distributions can be used the deviations of the empirical distribution from the hypothesized distribution are used to test the fit kole et al 2007 the empirical joint distribution function is obtained from the gringorten plotting position formula expressed as gringorten 1963 a 4 p k k k 0 44 n 0 12 where n refers to the sample size k refers to the k th smallest observation in the data set which was arranged in an increasing order kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate goodness of fit for the established marginal cumulative distribution functions the k s test statistic can be defined as a 5 d max 1 i n f e x i f h x i where n refers to the sample size f e x i refers to the empirical distribution of sample data and f h x i refers to the hypothesized distribution of sample data the k s test reflects the conformity between the empirical distribution and the hypothesized distribution the rmse can be expressed as a 6 r m s e i 1 n x i e s t x i o b s 2 n where x i e s t refers to the estimated value from the fitted univariate probability distribution and x i o b s refers to the corresponding observed value in the third step the joint distribution function of resources availability is built using copula theory and the appropriate copula function is chosen through making goodness of fit test the goodness of fit of the tested copula functions was assessed through rmse between the empirical copula and the theoretical copula where low values of rmse indicate a good fit of the copula

9715,growing demands for water energy and food put many systems at a composite risk of resource shortages there was a lack of approaches capable of effectively assessing tridimensional composite risk and describing non linear correlations among subsystem risks within a water energy food wef nexus system in this study an integrated approach was developed to assess the composite risk of wef nexus systems and generate risk based plans specifically a composite risk assessment model that could capture the interdependence among the risk for water energy and food shortage was proposed furthermore a generalized copula based chance constrained programming model and its solving algorithm were developed the proposed approach has been applied to an agricultural wef nexus system in northern china where the shortage of water energy and or land affected agricultural outputs results show that the composite risk of the entire system would be higher than the maximum value among subsystem risks but less than their sum higher composite risks could bring higher benefits under a certain composite risk the overall system benefit would vary with different combinations of subsystem risks and it could be promoted through coordinating resources supplied by different subsystems a risk benefit frontier consisting of optimal solutions corresponding to different combinations of composite and subsystem risks was identified through monte carlo simulation the scheme that could generate 12 76 billion yuan under a moderate composite risk level of 0 22 was recommended for the study problem accordingly net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area should be no less than 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively keywords water energy food nexus composite risk copula analysis optimization model agricultural water management 1 introduction water energy food wef security nexus has gained considerable attention from public and academia since the bonn conference held in 2011 hoff 2011 van vuuren et al 2019 the global risks report sixth edition 2011 published by the world economic forum highlighted wef nexus as one of the three important clusters of risks in focus wef 2011 water energy and food resources had long been separately managed as system inputs but their interactions were largely overlooked opejin et al 2020 tan and zhang 2018 c l zhang et al 2019 p zhang et al 2019 due to population growth and anthropogenic activities growing demands for water energy and food put many production systems at a composite risk of input insufficiencies thus it is desired to assess the system level composite risk and optimize risk based schemes on the basis of comprehensive considerations over interactions within a nexus system de amorim et al 2018 hussien et al 2018 liang et al 2020 to understand the overall risks of multiple interrelated subsystems a number of risk assessment methods have been proposed such as weighted sum methods liu and chen 2019 bayesian networks pang and sun 2014 shi et al 2020 and agent based models chen and lin 2019 terzi et al 2019 recently these methods have also been applied to assess the overall risk of wef nexus systems bieber et al 2018 memarzadeh et al 2019 namany et al 2020 nevertheless a major limitation of the above methods lied in their incapability of tackling multiple random variables with different types of probability distributions and unknown correlations superior to those methods copula theory is effective for merging multiple marginal distribution functions into a multivariate distribution function and modeling its multivariate dependence structure guo et al 2020 nelsen 2006 copula theory has been extensively used for addressing economic and environmental management problems fan et al 2016 yue et al 2018 and was recently applied to analyze composite risks of nexus systems for instance cai et al 2019 adopted bivariate copulas to assess the interactive risk of water and energy shortages in an urban agglomeration area in northern china unfortunately bivariate copulas cannot capture interdependence of multiple variables with higher dimensions trivariate copulas and other high dimensional copulas are thus desired trivariate copulas have been used in the fields of hydrology and finance bruneau et al 2020 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2015 yang and qian 2019 for instance ribeiro et al 2019 applied the copula approach to assess the risk of drought hazard on agricultural systems however to the best of our knowledge there are no reported studies measuring high dimensional composite risk of a wef nexus system caused by interdependent random inputs for wef nexus systems with complex interactions between subsystems the shortage of one resource can affect the use of other resources and lead to mismatched supply of multiple resources systematic planning is thus required to provide composite risk based management options for wef nexus systems dong et al 2014 tan et al 2010 mathematical programming methods have been extensively used for supporting risk based resources management amjath babu et al 2019 ji et al 2020 li et al 2019 nie et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2020 tan et al 2015 particularly stochastic mathematical programming methods have been prevalently used dong et al 2015 tan et al 2017 joint chance constrained programming jcp is effective for reflecting the system violation risk of a set of probabilistic constraints wang et al 2018 zhuang et al 2015 nevertheless conventional jcp methods only tackle random variables that separately followed normal distributions chen et al 2016 it is incapable for dealing with random variables following different types of distributions and without known correlations chen et al 2017 to overcome such limitations copula based chance constrained programming cbcp was proposed chen et al 2016 on the basis of it many copula based inexact programming methods were proposed for addressing the overall risks in solid waste management chen et al 2016 water resources management kong et al 2018 energy system management chen et al 2017 and energy water nexus management yu et al 2020a 2020b most of these cbcp studies were limited to bi variate copulas however cbcp and its algorithm cannot address the high dimensional composite risk of input insufficiencies therefore this study aims to bridge above mentioned research gaps through developing an integrated approach for assessing the composite risk of resource shortages and correspondingly identifying optimal planning schemes the contributions of this research include the following two aspects firstly a composite risk assessment model is established for measuring high dimensional composite risk of wef nexus systems secondly a generalized copula based chance constrained programming gcbcp approach and its solving algorithm are developed the proposed algorithm provides a paradigm for solving different types of gcbcp models and the general formulas for solving two typical types of gcbcp with high dimensional copula functions are given gcbcp can help support the management of composite risk and uncover the impacts of composite risk on wef systems the developed methodology is applied to the planning of an agricultural wef nexus system in northern china to exemplify its applicability 2 methodology the purpose of this study is to assess the composite risk of wef nexus systems and provide optimal planning schemes under such composite risks in this section an integrated approach is developed for composite risk assessment and resources management of wef nexus system the developing process of the integrated approach for wef nexus composite risk management is illustrated in fig 1 firstly in order to assess the risk of the wef nexus system a novel composite risk assessment model is developed on the basis of copula and probability theories it is capable of measuring the composite risk composed by multiple subsystem risks with complex interdependence then a generalized composite risk based optimization model with its solving algorithm is proposed gcbcp can effectively address the randomly distributed information with nonlinear dependence provide solutions under quantified composite risks and help identify desired alternatives it is effective for supporting composite risk based planning for wef nexus system and in depth analysis of the tradeoffs between system outputs and violation risks scenario analysis is then undertaken to explore the effect of subsystem risks with complex interactions given the risk levels of subsystem the composite risk level can be calculated by the copula function then the thresholds of water energy and food availability can be obtained and used as inputs of the composite risk based optimization model that is the right hand side parameters of chance constraints of gcbcp through solving gcbcp optimal planning for wef nexus system under different scenarios can be obtained then the impact of subsystem risks and composite risks on system outputs can be quantified 2 1 composite risk assessment model in this subsection the composite risk assessment model of wef nexus is developed after introducing the concept of copula theory copulas are functions that join or couple one dimensional marginal distribution functions to multivariate distribution functions nelsen 2006 any form of marginal distributions can be connected through copula functions to obtain their joint probability distribution functions wang et al 2017 sklar s theorem clarifies the important role of copula function in constructing joint distribution of multivariate functions sklar s theorem in n dimensions is expressed as 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n c u 1 u 2 u n where f x 1 x 2 x n is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of n dimensional distribution function with continuous marginal cdfs of random variables f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n and f k x k u k for k 1 n with u k u 0 1 bouye et al 2000 wong et al 2010 nelsen 2006 if the marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n are continuous the copula function c is unique the copula approach allows for marginal distributions and the joint behavior of variables to be modeled separately this is done by transforming the univariate variables x k into uniform variables u k by applying a suitable marginal distribution f k the copula function c can have different dependence structures and there are four categories of copula functions archimedean extreme value elliptical and other miscellaneous class wong et al 2010 a common n dimensional copula is a multivariate cdf c with the following properties bouye et al 2000 sun et al 2016 1 c is defined on i n 0 1 n 2 c is bounded and monotonically increasing 3 c has n one dimensional margins c k k 1 2 n which satisfy c kc u k c 1 1 u k 1 1 u k 0 u k 1 the composite risk is typically defined as the occurrence probability of adverse events the assessment of composite risk can be summarized into the following main steps firstly defining the adverse events secondly describing the correlation structure between subsystem risks through copula function finally calculating the occurrence probability of adverse events in detail the construction of the copula function is introduced in appendix a the maximum likelihood estimation method can be used to estimate parameters in marginal distribution functions and copula functions guo et al 2020 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 it should be emphasized that the probability of a joint distribution expressed as a copula function is not necessarily equivalent to the composite risk in fact the measurement of composite risk is made on a case by case basis take the composite risk of a wef system induced by insufficient input resources as an example as the inputs of wef nexus system the randomness in the availabilities of water energy and food leads to the composite risk of resource supply the adverse event refers to the shortage of at least one resource on the contrary the expected event is that the availabilities of all resources exceed certain thresholds thus the composite risk of input insufficiencies can be expressed as follows 2 1 c ˆ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where c ˆ is the survival copula of the x i representing the joint probability of exceedance and f i x i p x x i 1 f i x i is the survival function of x i the survival copula c ˆ can be obtained by 3 c ˆ u c 1 u 4 c u 1 i 1 n u i s p 1 s c s u i i s where c is the joint survival function associated with c p is the set of all subsets of 1 2 n with at least two elements s denotes the cardinality of s and c s represents the marginal copula of c with dimension equal to s salvadori et al 2016 2 2 composite risk based optimization model in this subsection gcbcp and its solving algorithm are proposed for planning wef nexus systems under composite risks a general gcbcp formulation can be expressed as 5 max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 6 pr j 1 n a i j x j b i t i 1 2 k j 1 n a i j x j b i t i k 1 k 2 m α 1 p 7 j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 l 8 x j 0 j 1 2 n where x j is the decision variable a i j c j and b i are deterministic parameters and b i is random variable with unknown probability distribution the entire set of chance constraints are enforced to be satisfied with at least a joint probability of α and the violation risk is p in gcbcp an increased individual risk level refers to the increase of constraint violation risk and decreased strictness for satisfying constraints and vice versa c l zhang et al 2019 p zhang et al 2019 increased composite risk means that there is a raised risk of violating the set of chance constrained constraints due to the presence of random variables in chance constraints gcbcp is nonlinear and need to be transferred to its deterministic equivalents according to the type of chance constraints gcbcp can be divided into the three types 1 chance constraints are all expressed as inequality with marked as type 1 model 2 chance constraints are all expressed as inequality with marked as type 2 model and 3 chance constraints have different combinations of inequalities with both and marked as type 3 model previously chen et al 2016 proposed and solved type 1 model through a case study of waste management problem gao et al 2018 studied type 2 model in a water resources management problem with bivariate copula nevertheless there is a lack of a general algorithm for solving these gcbcp problems in this study a general solving algorithm of gcbcp with high dimensional copulas is proposed the proposed solving algorithm consists of four steps 1 define the expected and adverse events 2 calculate the probability of adverse events i e the composite risk 3 transform joint chance constraints into individual chance constraints and 4 transform the chance constraints into linear expression in the following type 1 and type 2 models are used as examples to show the applicability of the proposed algorithm for type 3 model according to the definition of adverse events the composite risk can be assessed based on copula and probability theories then this model can be solved following the proposed solving algorithm 2 2 1 type 1 model for type 1 model the expected event is that j 1 n a i j x j b i t are all satisfied for constraints i 1 2 m k m the occurrence probability of expected event can be expressed as follows 9 pr b 1 t j 1 n a i j x j b 2 t j 1 n a i j x j b m t j 1 n a i j x j c f b 1 b 1 f b 2 b 2 f b m b m c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m where p i is the violation risk of constraint i 1 2 m adverse events are the opposite of expected events for type 1 model an adverse event occurs if any random variable b i is greater than j 1 n a i j x j thus the composite risk can be expressed as follows 10 1 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m by letting the random variables take a set of individual probabilistic constraints the set of chance constraints can be transformed into its linear expression as follows huang 1998 11 j 1 n a i j x j b i t 1 p i i 12 1 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m p where b i t 1 p i f b i 1 1 p i and f b i 1 is the inverse cdf of b i based on the algorithm introduced above the type 1 model can be transformed into the following linear deterministic version 13 max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 14 j 1 n a i j x j b i t 1 p i i 15 1 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p m p 16 j 1 n a i j x j b i i 17 x j 0 j 2 2 2 type 2 model for type 2 model the expected event is that the random parameters b i in all chance constraints are no less than j 1 n a i j x j k 0 the probability of an expected event is expressed as the joint probability of exceedance c ˆ for type 2 model the adverse event occurs if any b i is less than j 1 n a i j x j thus the probability of adverse events that equal to 1 minus exceedance probability can be expressed as follows 18 1 pr b 1 t j 1 n a i j x j b n t j 1 n a i j x j 1 c ˆ f 1 x 1 f n x n i 1 m p i s p 1 s c s p i i s for type 2 model the eq 6 can be transformed into the following linear expression 19 j 1 n a i j x j b i t p i i 20 i 1 m p i s p 1 s c s p i i s p where b i t p i f b i 1 p i based on the algorithm introduced above the type 2 model can be transformed into the following linear deterministic version 21 max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 22 j 1 n a i j x j b i t p i i 23 i 1 m p i s p 1 s c s p i i s p 24 j 1 n a i j x j b i i 25 x j 0 j then the deterministic expression of gcbcp model can be solved as a linear programming model 3 application 3 1 problem statement and data collection bayan nur is a national key food base located in the west of inner mongolia northern china net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area are key factors for supporting the operation of agricultural production system due to the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors the availabilities of these three parameters cannot be estimated precisely in fact these parameters can be approximately expressed as random variables with distribution information moreover the utilization of water energy and land resources are closely interdependent for example the effective irrigation area refers to the area that can be irrigated normally which is affected by the availability of irrigation water resources increased net irrigation water and effective irrigation area also mean higher agricultural energy consumption in the studied agricultural wef nexus system the composite risk is arising from the randomness of the availability water energy and food inputs the composite risk is defined as the joint probability of a shortage of at least one resource that is the occurrence probability that either the availability of water energy and food resources is less than the corresponding threshold value the subsystem risk means the shortage risk of single resource there are many questions to be answered for instance how to assess the composite risk of the wef nexus system under what levels should the shortage risks of water energy and food be controlled what is the impact of individual sub system risk on system outputs to answer these questions it becomes urgent to develop tools for the composite risk assessment and management of agricultural wef nexus system therefore the integrated approach proposed in this study is deemed suitable for the studied problem there are five main crops in bayan nur including wheat maize sunflowers vegetables and melons the main irrigation method is flood irrigation with a small proportion of drip irrigation the relevant data including costs prices irrigation water requirements irrigation water efficiency production demands effective irrigation area etc are collected from bayan nur statistic year book 2000 2018 government official reports field research and related publications the historical data of net irrigation water is calculated from multiplying irrigation water resources by irrigation water utilization coefficient energy input for agriculture is the sum of rural electricity and agricultural diesel 3 2 assessment of composite risk the results of the dependence between water energy and food factors are shown in table 1 the three correlation coefficients of water energy and water food were greater than 0 5 with statistical significance indicating that water energy and water food have medium correlations particularly the correlation coefficients of energy food were higher than 0 8 showing strong correlation between energy and food resources these results proved that there are strong correlations between water energy and food that could not be neglected three commonly used theoretical distribution functions i e normal distribution lognormal distribution and weibull distribution were used to fit the distribution of net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area the estimated parameters of marginal distribution functions are shown in table 2 according to k s test shown in table 3 all the proposed distribution functions can be employed to model the distributions of available water energy and food resources with the significance level higher than 0 05 the best fitted marginal distribution functions were selected based on rmse the results reveal that lognormal distribution fitted the best for water and food while normal distribution was found to be more suitable for energy for the assessment of composite risk several copula functions are fitted to observe the interdependent of water energy and food resources availability for agricultural production with goodness of fit being assessed the archimedean family is the most popular copula family because of its ease of construction and wide range of choices for the strength of dependence khedun et al 2014 in this study four most commonly used one parameter copula function from archimedean family were tested for determining the joint probability distribution of water energy and food risks the mathematical expressions and estimated parameters of trivariate copulas including clayton gumbel frank and ali mikhail haq copula are shown in table 4 it was found that the clayton copula had the minimum rmse value thus it was selected to describe the joint distribution of available water energy and food resources of bayan nur city fig 2 displays the relationship between composite risk and three subsystem risks in fig 2 a the x y and z axis respectively represents the shortage risk of water energy and food resources the color of each point indicates the level of composite risk of wef nexus system this picture shows the coupling effect of subsystem risks on composite risk it can be observed that the composite risk would increase with the increase of subsystem risks under a given composite risk level value of each subsystem risk would be restricted to a certain range for instance when the composite risk is low the sub system risks would be low the orthogonal slice planes drew along the x y and z directions would be helpful for revealing the interactions among composite risk and subsystem risks it can be observed that under certain levels of composite risk and one of the subsystem risks the changes of the other two subsystem risks would be opposite fig 2 b d respectively displays the composite risk under 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 energy risk level as examples under certain levels of composite risk and energy risk the food risk would gradually decrease as the water risk increases it also can be seen that composite risk would be greater than the maximum value of subsystem risk 3 3 modelling formulation a gcbcp model for supporting agricultural production under the composite risk of resources shortage is established the objective of gcbcp is to maximize the agricultural system benefits the decision variable is a ijk denoting planting area of crop i in sub irrigation district j using irrigation method k hm2 this model is constrained by the limitation of water energy and food resources crop production demands and local planting habits the fitted copulas are used for describing the dependence structure of water energy and food resources the joint chance constraints restrict the availabilities of water energy and food resources not to exceed thresholds under a certain composite risk thresholds of water energy and food availability are obtained under given levels of composite risk and subsystem risks the gcbcp model for planning irrigated agricultural system under composite risk of wef nexus can be formulated as follows objective function 26 max f i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k y i k p r i a i j k c t i k constraints 1 water availability the field water consumption should be no more than the water resources availability under a certain level of subsystem risk 27 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k η f a i j k a i q i k β a w α 1 1 p 1 2 energy availability the irrigation energy consumption should be no more than the energy availability under a certain level of subsystem risk 28 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a e c i k e n α 2 1 p 2 3 arable land availability the crop planting area should be no more than the available effective irrigation area under a certain level of subsystem risk 29 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a l α 3 1 p 3 4 constraint of composite risk the composite risk of wef nexus system should be no more than the controlled composite risk level 30 pr i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k η f a i j k a i q i k β a w i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a e c i k e n i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k a i j k a l α 1 p 5 production

area in recent years 32 a i j k b a i j k i j k 7 nonnegative constraints 33 a i j k 0 i j k the abbreviation and detailed explanations of coefficients are given in appendix b 3 4 optimization of irrigated agricultural system scenario analysis would be helpful for exploring the impacts of composite and individual risks and the tradeoffs between violation risks and system benefits two composite risk levels representing low and high composite risk levels were considered which were 0 06 and 0 10 respectively under each composite risk level 7 different combinations of individual risk levels were provided the rule of scenario setting was to change two of the individual subsystem risks when the composite risk and the risk of the third subsystem are given detailed information of the scenario setting is shown in table 5 it can be observed that the composite risk would be no less than the highest subsystem risk and no more than the sum of subsystem risks this verifies that the composite risk would not be equivalent to the sum of subsystem risks due to the nonlinear interactions between subsystems 3 4 1 planting patterns the optimal crop planting plans under the constrained water energy and food resources can be obtained from solving gcbcp the interpretation of the results shows the usefulness of the optimized plans in guiding agricultural production as shown in fig 3 sunflowers and corn would be the most popular crops and their planting areas would rank among the top two in all scenarios wheat and vegetables would have the third or fourth largest planting areas alternately melons would have the least cultivation area moreover the planting of sunflowers and vegetables would be more sensitive to the variations of subsystem risks than the other crops particularly it can be observed that the variations of planting areas of these two crops would be in accordance with the changes of energy risk take high composite risk as an example under s8 s9 and s10 planting areas of sunflowers and vegetables would gradually increase with the increase of energy risk and the decrease of food risk under s10 s13 and s14 the planting area of sunflowers would gradually decrease with reduced energy risk the frequently changes of sunflowers and vegetables planting areas are mainly because of their higher economic benefits per unit of energy consumed the constantly changes of the planting of crop would also affect the amount of total cropping areas the variation of crop planting areas under drip irrigation and flood irrigation fig 4 and the amount of cultivation area for each sub irrigation district would have the same trend as the changes of energy risk fig 5 moreover the crop planting areas would increase non linearly with the growth of energy risks due to the complex non linear dependence structure of subsystem risks from the perspective of composite risk crop planting areas would be enlarged with the raise of composite risk for instance the maximum value of total planting area would be obtained in s3 under low composite risk and obtained in s10 under high composite risk compared with s3 the total amount of crop planting area would increase by 27 in s10 besides the planting area of sunflowers and vegetables would respectively increase by 60 and 24 increase of flood irrigation and drip irrigation areas would also be observed with the increase of composite risks 3 4 2 resource consumption the setting of different combinations of subsystem risk would substantially affect resource consumption fig 6 represents the net water consumption energy use and cultivated land area under different scenarios it can be observed that agricultural energy consumption would be equal to its availability while the supply of the other two resources would have surplus these imply that energy would be the main limiting factor in these studied scenarios though such results may go against the intuitive impression that water is a major constraint on local agricultural production results indicate that availability of energy for agriculture should receive more attention when composite risk was strictly controlled it also can be observed that resource consumption would climb with increased composite risk this is because that with a higher composite risk being tolerated there would be a larger relaxed decision domain therefore more resources can be consumed to obtain higher benefits 3 4 3 system benefits optimal crop planting schemes obtained under different scenarios would lead to different system benefits shown in fig 6 under the same composite risk level changes of system economic benefits would have the same trend as threshold of energy availability under all analyzed scenarios indicating energy risk would have substantial impacts on the system benefits meanwhile the system benefits would change non linearly due to the complex non linear dependence structure of subsystem risks when composite risk remained unchanged system economic benefits would increase sharply with a more coordinated supply of water energy and food resources for instance the economic benefits under s3 would be higher than those of s1 and s2 though these three scenarios had same level of composite risk this is mainly because of the coordinating of resources supplied by different subsystems to be specific available energy resource had been fully utilized in s1 while available water and land resources had not been fully utilized and there was surplus of these two resources as energy risk increase from s1 to s3 the surplus water and arable land resources could be used to support agricultural production with the increased availability of energy resources such trends would also be observed under scenarios with high composite risk level i e s8 s10 as the acceptable composite risk getting higher the economic benefits would increase rapidly for instance system benefits obtained under low and high composite risk level would vary between 6 31 109 and 9 12 109 yuan and between 6 31 109 and 11 29 109 yuan respectively the highest attainable system benefits would increase with aroused composite risk it should be noted that increase of system benefits would also be accompanied by raised violation risks of constraints results also indicate that low system benefits could also occur under higher composite risk levels further clarifying the importance of synergy management of resource supply in summary gcbcp can effectively provide a series of optimal planning schemes for agricultural planting under different shortage risks of water energy and food resources from a methodological point of view gcbcp is capable of providing in depth analyses of interactions among multiple subsystem risks and the tradeoffs between composite system violation risks and system benefits from a practical application perspective decision makers can screen optimal alternatives based on tradeoffs between benefits and risks thus the obtained solutions can better assist in risk management and further support sustainable development of wef nexus system 3 5 discussions 3 5 1 monte carlo simulation in order to investigate the impacts of composite risk on system outputs monte carlo simulation was conducted bouye et al 2000 a total of 10 000 triplets of scenarios p p 1 p 2 p 3 were generated through random sampling through solving gcbcp optimal solutions under various combinations of composite and subsystem risks were acquired results obtained from monte carlo simulation are depicted in fig 7 in this figure each point represents a feasible solution the vertical ordinate represents the system benefit corresponding to each optimal scheme and the horizontal ordinate represents the composite risk of the optimized scheme meanwhile each point is colored based on the risk level of water energy and food in fig 7 a b and c respectively visualizing system benefits with both sub system and compromise risks can be helpful for examining the interactive impacts of sub system risks on system benefits on the whole the system benefits would vary from 5 61 to 14 27 billion yuan with the increase of composite risk the system benefits would be relatively low under a lower level of composite risk this is because that resource availabilities would be controlled at a lower level as the composite risk increased the economic benefits would increase significantly in most of the scenarios the supply of all three resources under higher composite risk levels would be sufficient for achieving high economic benefits however a few schemes would have extremely low system benefits under higher composite risks serious shortage of one or two resources existed in these scenarios whether it would be water energy food resource or their combinations thus severely hampered economic growth this implies that focusing on the risk of one or two resources cannot guarantee the security of the whole system under the same composite risk level the schemes obtained under different sub system risk combinations would have different system benefits the outermost points in fig 7 form a composite risk system benefit frontier shown in fig 8 this curve provided a range of highest attainable system benefits under different composite risks decision makers could thus screen the most beneficial schemes based on tradeoffs between system benefits and composite risks it can be seen from fig 8 that the minimum composite risk among all feasible solutions would be 0 06 correspondingly the highest attainable system economic benefit under 0 06 composite risk would be 8 62 109 yuan subsequently system benefits would increase with raised composite risk the system benefits would have a rapid growth until composite risk reach to 0 22 then the growth rate would gradually slow down the highest attainable system benefits under 0 22 composite risk would be 12 76 109 yuan under this circumstance subsystem risks of water energy and food would be 0 08 0 17 and 0 15 respectively accordingly the net irrigation water energy for agriculture and cultivation land resources would be 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively eventually the system benefits would stay steady around 14 109 yuan under a composite risk level of 0 99 representing the ultimate highest benefits that system could achieve considering the real world restriction nevertheless this point suggests that high economic benefits could be achieved with high composite risks and reduced marginal benefits although the economic benefits would increase by nearly 10 the composite risk would expand 3 5 times in summary the combined effects of composite risk would be very complex analyzing the effects of compromised risk on system output not only need to consider the limitations of a single resource but also include the interaction between them simulation results showed that serious shortage of one or two resources would hamper economic growth it is suggested to coordinate resources supplied by each subsystem so as to promote system benefits moreover a composite risk benefit frontier consisting of a range of optimal solutions with different combinations of risks were identified through monte carol simulation it is suggested that net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area should be no less than 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively by this means a satisfactory system benefits of 12 76 109 yuan could be achieved with a moderate composite risk level of 0 22 3 5 2 practical implications the integrated approach proposed in this study would facilitate the in depth analyses of wef nexus with twofold first of all it assessed the composite risk of agricultural wef systems integrating subsystem risks and quantifying the correlation between subsystem risks from a wef nexus perspective are the distinctive characteristic of this research in contrast commonly employed agricultural management methods that solely focus on water shortage risk are strongly limited in their ability to respond to varied combinations of water energy and food risks successfully balancing the tradeoffs between system benefits and composite risks is another contribution of this work results highlight that higher composite risks could bring higher system benefits under a certain composite risk coordinated allocation of resources can significantly improve benefits if not properly managed the imbalanced resource inputs can lead to a significant reduction in system benefits decision makers are remained that not only water but also energy are key resources constraining agricultural production especially under low composite risk levels moreover monte carlo simulation identified an efficient composite risk system benefit frontier providing a series of optimal solutions with the highest attainable system benefits under different composite risks consequently decision makers can choose the optimal planting scheme according to their risk preferences the consumption of water energy and land resources corresponding to the optimal schemes can be viewed as the minimum resource demands for supporting agricultural production these key parameters provide decision makers with scientific basis for input resource management beyond the applied case this study also has implications on other wef nexus systems across the globe confronting with composite risk management problems it should be noted that identifying and defining adverse events is the most crucial link for assessing composite risk and developing risk based planning for nexus systems the lack of this procedure hindered the practical applications of previous cbcp methods cbcp can be viewed as a special case of gcbcp in comparison gcbcp is more versatile than cbcp for being able to handle problems with complex composite risk more importantly the measured composite risk is not necessarily equivalent to the result from a copula function for instance in this study the composite risk refers to the occurrence probability that either the availability of water energy and food resources is less than a certain threshold value if the copula function is directly used to assess the composite risk it partially ignores the risk of water shortage when energy and food resources are sufficient furthermore real world problems are often more complicated for example the composite risk can be expressed as the probability that at least one variable is less than the threshold or the probability that only one of multiple variables is less than the threshold the application of the developed integrated approach certainly has limitations generally speaking three dimensional copula is difficult to obtain for the sake of simplicity this study only used multivariate archimedean copulas with one dependence parameter θ for describing the trivariate domain and each pair of variables this can be remedied by introducing nested copulas or other families of copulas such as plackett family kao and govindaraju 2008 if there are more than three representative parameters the acquisition of copula function will be more complicated consider using vine copula for characterization 4 conclusions growing demands for water energy and food put many production systems at a composite risk of resource shortages ignoring the complicated correlations between resource availability leads to inaccurate assessment of composite risk thus it is importance to assess the high dimensional composite risks and optimize risk based planning schemes in this study an integrated approach was developed for composite risk assessment and management firstly a composite risk assessment model was developed it could assess the composite risk of wef nexus induced by random uncertainty and capture the dependence structure of sub system risks then gcbcp and its solving algorithms were proposed for supporting composite risk management it could not only provide composite risk based solutions but also reflect the effect of subsystem risks on system outputs overall this integrated approach could help examine the influences of interactions of subsystem risks and analyze the tradeoffs between system profits and composite risks the applicability of the developed integrated approach has been demonstrated in an agricultural wef nexus system net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area are key factors for supporting agricultural production the results show that the copula theory could be employed to estimate the joint distribution of water energy and food resources the composite risk of the entire system would be higher than the maximum value of subsystem risks but less than their sum optimal solutions for crop planting patterns were generated under different scenarios higher composite risks could bring higher benefits under the same composite risk system benefits could be promoted by coordinating resource supplies a composite risk benefit frontier consisting of a range of optimal solutions under different scenarios was identified through monte carlo simulation decision makers could thus screen optimal alternatives based on tradeoffs between benefits and risks results indicate that 12 76 billion yuan achieved under a moderate composite risk level of 0 22 would be a reasonable solution for the study problem accordingly net irrigation water energy for agriculture and effective irrigation area should be controlled at 1 66 109 m3 81 08 103 tce and 509 12 103 hm2 respectively definition of the adverse event is the most crucial process of the proposed approach given extensive attention to the application of copula theory to risk management there exists potential in the future research to improve gcbcp including but not limited to the introduction of other families of copulas to quantify the relationship of wef nexus more accurately the

and suggestions appendix a detailed steps for constructing copula functions the construction of copula function is further divided into three steps firstly clarify the dependences of availability of water energy and food resources secondly build the respective marginal distribution function and lastly build copula function specifically for the first step pearson r n spearman ρ n and kendall τ n correlation coefficients are utilized for fitting the linear dependence the correlation between the pairs r i s i of ranks and the ranks of the observations respectively the mathematical expressions

favre 2007 the second step is to build and choose the most appropriate marginal distribution functions of water energy and food resources to fit the observed water energy and food variables a suite of commonly used theoretical probability distributions can be used the deviations of the empirical distribution from the hypothesized distribution are used to test the fit kole et al 2007 the empirical

9716,reference evapotranspiration eto is a key parameter in hydrometeorological studies but dependent climatic drivers can induce uncertainties when attributing changes of eto to climate change and many studies have neglected this issue in this study two sets of climatic drivers the independent dependent driver system were used to attribute changes of penman monteith eto to climatic variables in china results show eto presented an upward downward upward trend with the change points in 1978 and 1996 using the dependent driver system the sensitivity coefficient and the contribution of average air temperature tmean were underestimated by at least 57 and 46 during three periods 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 the largest relative changes of contribution of tmean c tmean were found in southeast of china with high temperatures while largest relative changes of c tmean peaked in autumn therefore in order to promote the acquisition of relatively objective results in attributing changes of eto the independence of climatic drivers must be carefully addressed using the independent driver system we found eto was most sensitive to tmean in spring summer and winter tmean was always a dominant factor for the largest percentage at least 41 of grids across china followed by ws at most 30 during three periods however the large changes of ws in northwest of china promote the changes of eto during 1960 1978 and 1979 1996 leading to increased ws decreased ws and increased tmean responsible for the upward downward upward trend of eto for entire china as a whole during three periods this study emphasizes the effect of tmean in changing eto during the entire study area and help improve our understanding of the evolution of eto and providing a guideline for water resource management and water use planning for agriculture keywords evaporative demand climate change independent climatic variables trend analysis attribution analysis data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available in the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn 1 introduction evapotranspiration is often used as a significant hydrometeorological indicator to reflect climate change and hydrological processes tao et al 2015 xu et al 2018 due to the lack of experimental measurements especially on large spatial and temporal scales reference evapotranspiration eto is usually used to estimate actual evapotranspiration liu and zhang 2013 eto is also an important component of agricultural activities as it affects crop water requirements irrigation schedules and water scarcity li et al 2017 ma et al 2012 therefore research on eto trends and their causes can provide insights into how hydrological processes respond to climate change and offer great significance for regional agricultural water management air temperature humidity radiation and wind speed were found to jointly affect eto changes air is supposed to be drier and evaporative demands such as eto are expected to increase with increasing air temperature however the opposite trend for evaporative demand has been reported worldwide jhajharia et al 2012 mcvicar et al 2012 papaioannou et al 2011 this is known as the evaporation paradox brutsaert and parlange 1998 mcvicar et al 2012 roderick and farquhar 2002 global temperature change is always regarded as having a much lower impact on the change in eto compared to decreases in wind speed stilling and radiation dimming han et al 2018 mcvicar et al 2012 nouri and bannayan 2019 wang et al 2017 ye et al 2014 more recently eto was reported to have recovered in many regions of the world since 1980s or 1990s such as in greece papaioannou et al 2011 iran bahrami et al 2019 the republic of moldova piticar et al 2016 and china dong et al 2020 han et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 liu and zhang 2013 wang et al 2013 2020 some studies have shown that the recovery of wind speed is responsible for the reversion of eto li et al 2014 ye et al 2014 however improper radiation and humidity drivers such as net solar radiation rn relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd are frequently used when attributing changes in eto which may cause uncertainties in this process for example rh and vpd are partial functions of air temperature tmean whereas rn is a partial function of actual vapor pressure ea and air temperature high relevance exists between humidity drivers radiation drivers and air temperature and using rn as a radiation driver or using rh or vpd as humidity drivers makes it difficult to differentiate the respective contribution of these variables from that of air temperature hobbins 2016 sun et al 2020 zheng et al 2009 also highlighted the independence of drivers when quantifying the contribution of each climatic driver to eto trends in the haihe basin china hobbins 2016 proposed that covariances between drivers can bring in large uncertainties and that using downward shortwave radiation and specific humidity in the attribution of trends of eto can distinguish the contribution of air temperature radiation and humidity in addition sun et al 2020 found that using temperature related humidity and radiation drivers could underrate the effect of air temperature on changes in eto in the hengduan mountains therefore using dependent variables can raise large uncertainties due to large overlap between the contributing variables leading to controversial results in contribution analysis while attributing trends of eto using independent climatic drivers may characterize the joint effects of driving factors more accurately and objectively however few studies have concerned this issue or quantitatively evaluated differences in attributing changes of eto to dependent independent driver systems china feeds about one fifth of the world s population from only 7 of all arable land worldwide piao et al 2010 resulting in significant pressure on food production processes an objective understanding of variation in eto and its main causes can also promote the development of suitable irrigation systems and have a profound effect on food security in china therefore objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the trends of annual eto in china from 1960 to 2019 2 assess the differences in attributing changes of eto to climatic variables using independent and dependent driver systems and 3 attribute variations in annual and seasonal eto to climatic drivers objectively 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data processing china is geographically diverse extending from the tropical temperate zone in the south to the cold temperate zone in the north its climate ranges from humid to arid from southeast coastal areas to northwest inland areas it also has a conflicting landscape characterized by low elevation in the east and high elevation in the west which contributes to the complex hydrothermal conditions in the area considering these environmental features we divided china into seven subregions according to wang et al 2019 land use climate agriculture and topography were also considered the seven subregions include fig 1 1 northeast china ne 2 northwest china nw and 3 northern china nc 4 central china cc 5 eastern china ec 6 southern china sc and finally 7 southwest china sw details for these subregions can be found in wang et al 2019 the climate datasets used to estimate eto in this study were taken from the national meteorological information center nmic of china http data cma cn with data spanning from 1960 to 2019 the datasets were published after quality control and homogeneity adjustment china meteorological administration 2003 with the data accuracy nearly 100 the stations are well distributed in most of the study area except for extreme western and northwestern where few meteorological stations located due to the bad environment of desert the datasets used in this study include average air temperature tmean c maximum air temperature tmax c minimum air temperature tmin c sunlight duration sd h relative humidity rh wind speed at 10 m height m s and atmospheric pressure kpa precipitation pre mm meteorological stations were removed if 1 the station was built after 1960 or 2 the station was removed before 2019 or 3 more than 5 of the data from the station was missing or 4 the dataset had a consecutive data missing more than 12 months in the study period finally 754 meteorological stations were selected in this study fig 1 to ensure the completeness and continuity of the data the missing values for the remained stations were interpolated from nearby stations using linear regression during the same period daily datasets were transformed into monthly mean datasets to estimate the monthly mean eto climatic variables were then interpolated into a raster surface by cokriging with extended drift using srtm dem derived from https earthexplorer usgs gov as an auxiliary predictor in arcgis 10 2 the time series were from 1960 to 2019 and each year was divided into four seasons spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december january and february 2 2 fao penman monteith method the penman monteith equation was used to calculate eto in this study it was recommended by the fao in 1998 as the only standard method to estimate eto and has been widely used worldwide allen et al 1998 the equation is as follows 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 ws e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 ws where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 tmean is the 2 m mean air temperature c δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure related to air temperature kpa c 1 rn is the net solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 which can be calculated from sunlight duration g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 ws is the wind speed at 2 m m s 1 calculated from the wind speed at 10 m es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and finally ea kpa is the actual vapor pressure details for estimating eto can be found in allen et al 1998 2 3 aridity index aridity index ai an indicator of agricultural water demand was used to discuss the impact of eto variations on agricultural water management in this study ai was calculated as follows thornthwaite 1948 ai et o p et o where ai is defined as the ratio of the difference between eto and p to eto if ai is equal to 1 it means there is no precipitation and the aridity reaches the highest if ai is equal to 0 or negative it means precipitation is equal to or higher than reference evapotranspiration 2 4 trend test and abrupt change detection linear least square regression was used to analyze the trends of climatic variables and eto series due to its simplicity and the mann kendall test m k test was adopted to explore whether the trend was significant at the 95 confidence level kendall 1948 mann 1945 the m k test is a nonparametric trend test method that is applicable to non normally distributed data series and which frequently appears in hydrometric researches han et al 2018 huo et al 2013 the test statistic s is calculated as follows 2 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i 3 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 n t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 4 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where x i and x j are generic sequential values of the variable n is the length of the variable var s is the variance of s and z is the standardized test statistic value if z z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is rejected at a given significance level of α and z 1 α 2 1 96 when α 0 05 the moving t test was used to test whether the change points existed in the time series by assessing whether the average values of two subseries divided by a moving point significantly differed from each other jia et al 2015 karl and riebsame 1984 to better define the shift time of the annual eto the moving t test was applied in this study the eto time series was divided into two subsequences by a moving datum point and n 1 and n 2 are the lengths of the subsequences before and after the datum point x 1 and x 2 are the mean values of the two subsequences and s 1 and s 2 are the standard deviations the two statistical values of this method t and s are defined as follows 5 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 6 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 for a given significance level t a once t t a the annual eto is supposed to experience an abrupt change and the datum point is accepted as a change point 2 5 attributing eto changes and selecting climatic drivers 2 5 1 contribution assessment method partial derivation can reveal how climatic variables influence eto in the penman monteith method however it is inadequate for comparing the sensitivity of different variables owing to the difference in dimensions therefore a mathematically defined sensitivity coefficient was used to estimate the sensitivity of eto to climatic variables mccuen 1974 the sensitivity coefficient of a climatic variable xi to eto can be described as follows 7 s xi lim xi et 0 et 0 xi xi et 0 xi xi et 0 where s xi is a non dimensional form representing the sensitivity coefficient of the climatic driver xi a positive s xi value indicates that eto increases with increasing xi and vice versa when s xi 0 1 it indicates that when other variables remain unchanged a 10 increase in the climatic variable xi may lead to a 1 increase in eto to attribute the changes of eto to climatic drivers the following method was used zheng et al 2009 8 d et 0 dt et 0 rx drx dt et 0 tx dtx dt et 0 hx dhx dt et 0 ws dws dt δ where rx is the radiation driver tx is the temperature driver hx is the humidity driver ws is the wind speed driver dx dt is calculated using linear regression and δ is the systemic error eq 8 can be simplified as 9 c et o c rx c tx c hx c ws δ where c rx c tx c hx and c ws are the respective contributions of changes in rx tx hx and ws to eto changes to obtain objective results when attributing changes in annual eto tmean rs ea and ws were selected as a independent climatic driver system in this study tmean has a positive relationship with tmax and tmin and it can include the impact of tmax and tmin when attributing changes of eto by using rs and ea as the radiation and humidity drivers respectively the humidity and radiation drivers selected can be expressed independently of other drivers therefore eq 9 can be rewritten as 10 c et o c rs c tmean c e a c ws δ 2 5 2 importance of the independency of climatic drivers in attribution analysis based on the penman monteith method eq 1 rn and vpd es ea were often selected as the radiation driver and humidity driver respectively in addition rh is also a common choice for humidity drivers as it can be directly derived from meteorological stations however rn is a function of rs ea and air temperature and both vpd and rh were also partial functions of ea and temperature when temperature related humidity rh or vpd and radiation rn are used as contributing factors the impacts of tmean humidity and radiation cannot be differentiated effectively hobbins 2016 sun et al 2020 zheng et al 2009 however many previous studies have neglected this issue when analyzing the response of eto to climate change dong et al 2020 han et al 2018 jerin et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 zuo et al 2012 which may bring uncertainties and obtain incorrect conclusions to highlight the importance of using dependent climatic drivers in attribution analysis we also selected a dependent climatic driver system including tmean rn rh and ws for comparison eq 9 is transferred to 11 c et o c rn c tmean c rh c ws δ results show that large differences were observed in the sensitivity coefficients when the independent and dependent driver systems were used respectively fig 2 and table 1 for ease of description we use s tmean s rx s rs or s rn s hx s ea or s rh and s ws to represent the sensitivity coefficients of temperature tmean radiation rs or rn humidity rh or ea and wind speed ws respectively only ws and tmean was in both the independent and dependent driver system in addition ws is not a function of temperature radiation or humidity and the change in the climatic driver system had no impact on s ws therefore only s tmean was compared here values of s tmean over subregions are presented at annual scale fig 2 and seasonal scale figs s2 and s3 using the dependent driver system s tmean was underestimated by 14 91 in subregions for annual scale resulting in a decrease in s tmean from 0 32 to 0 13 by 60 for the entire region under study from 1960 to 1978 table 1 similarly the percentage decline varied from 29 to 109 and from 31 to 153 in subregions resulting in decreases in s tmean by 59 and 57 for the entire area under study during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively during the entire study period nc showed the largest relative change in annual scale in seasonal scale the highest relative change of s tmean occurred in sc and ec for seasons except for winter while highest relative change of s tmean occurred in sw for winter few differences existed among seasons for china as a whole although the changes of s tmean showed the largest uncertainties in autumn the contributions of variables from the independent and dependent driver systems can be calculated using partial derivatives and climate driver trends according to eq 8 the regional average trends of eto for subregions calculated using the equation ceto independent and ceto dependent fit well with the trends of eto calculated using linear regression leto with r2 0 995 and r2 0 999 for leto vs ceto independent and leto vs ceto dependent respectively fig s1 for china as a whole the error item δ 0 02 mm year 0 16 mm year and 0 15 mm year with relative errors of 2 7 and 15 for ceto independent for the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively the error item δ 0 01 mm year 0 06 mm year and 0 08 mm year with relative errors of 1 3 and 7 for ceto dependent during 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively the results show that the method used in this study can effectively attribute the changes in eto to climatic variables figs 3 s4 and s5 shows the respective contributions of climatic variables on eto changes over subregions using different driver systems in annual and seasonal scales and the relative changes of contribution of tmean to eto were also identified in subregions table 2 for ease of description we use c tmean c rx c rs or c rn c hx c ea or c rh and c ws to represent the contributions of temperature radiation humidity and wind speed respectively when the dependent climatic driver system was used c tmean was underestimated by 84 54 and 46 respectively during the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 at annual scale compared to the independent climatic driver system the largest relative changes were found in ec at least 67 followed by sc nw showed the lowest relative change less than 49 relative changes in contributions of radiation driver changed by 48 27 and 44 for china varying from 42 to 5 104 to 4 and 126 to 134 for subregions for the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 contributions of humidity driver changed by 47 46 and 346 for the entire region under study from 1960 to 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively it is worth mentioning that c ea showed the lowest magnitudes in cc sw and ec from 1997 to 2019 using the independent driver system leading to extremely large relative changes in contributions of humidity driver using the dependent driver system and an overestimation of 346 for china as a whole in seasonal scale the largest relative change of c tmean was found in autumn with c tmean being underestimated by 115 96 and 98 respectively despite no uniform trend exists in seasons the largest deviations of c tmean were found in sc ec and cc in annual scale indicating uncertainties was greater in southeast of china with high temperatures 3 results and discussions 3 1 trends of eto and climatic variables area averaged eto was calculated to explore the change points of eto for entire country as a whole the temporal variations of the area averaged annual and seasonal eto for the entire study area from 1960 to 2019 are plotted in fig 4 two change points for the annual eto series in 1978 and 1996 were found using the moving t test fig 4 a annual eto for china demonstrated a slight positive trend of 0 96 mm year2 during 1960 1978 a strong decrease p 0 001 of 2 38 mm year2 from 1979 to 1996 and after that a significant increase p 0 05 of 1 05 mm year2 from 1997 to 2019 the downward trend of eto was ended in 1996 similar to other studies fan et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2017 indicating that evaporation paradox in china ended at the end of the 20th century and that eto has gradually increased in the past two decades different patterns of seasonal eto are shown in fig 4 b for 1960 1978 only autumn showed a significant increase p 0 05 of 0 24 mm season year for 1979 1996 the decreasing trends of eto for spring summer autumn were significant p 0 05 with the largest decrease in summer of 1 14 mm season year for 1997 2019 the largest increase of eto was found in spring of 0 54 mm season year it is worth noting that eto experienced the highest variations in spring and summer while winter experienced the lowest variation during the entire study period eto was calculated using the interpolated climatic variable in grid scale and then the spatial trends of eto for three periods 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 divided by the change points were calculated in both annual and seasonal scales fig 5 the results of the grids indicate that eto shows an increasing trend from 1960 to 1978 across 66 of the country with 10 of the region showing a significant decrease p 0 05 additionally 90 of the total grids decreased in the period 1979 1996 with 16 of the region presenting a significant decrease from 1979 to 1996 75 of the total area increased from 1997 to 2019 with 30 recording an increasing trend as shown in fig 5 the annual eto for the whole region primarily increased from 1960 to 1978 and large differences were observed between subregions eto primarily showed increasing trends in the north and west of the study area ne nw nc and sw and decreasing trends in the south and east cc ec and sc resulting in an insignificant increase of 0 91 mm year2 for the whole region the annual eto primarily decreased from 1979 to 1996 this was especially true for nw and sw with a significant p 0 05 decrease of 4 36 mm year2 and 2 36 mm year2 respectively annual eto also showed a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend of 2 36 mm year2 over the whole study area with the largest magnitude in summer with 4 52 mm year2 after the decrease annual eto increased again for the whole region from 1997 to 2019 with a significant p 0 05 trend of 1 03 mm year2 with the exception of ne and sc which showed a slight decrease the annual eto showed increases in other subregions especially for sw with a significant increase of 2 32 mm year2 the changes in eto consist of the jointed results of climatic variables therefore understanding how climatic variables change is crucial to understanding how eto changes fig 6 presents the annual trends of the four climatic variables from the independent driver system in china and its seven regions for china as a whole tmean slightly decreased by 0 002 c year except for ne and nw from 1960 to 1978 wherein it increased significantly p 0 05 at 0 029 c year and 0 020 c year during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1998 2019 respectively except for ne and nw tmean decreased from 1960 through 1978 for all subregions all subregions showed increasing trends during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 rs increased slightly at 0 003 mj m2 day year for the period 1960 1978 and decreased significantly p 0 05 to 0 022 mj m2 day year and 0 013 mj m2 day year during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively rs showed increasing trends in each subregion except for cc ec and sc from 1960 to 1978 but decreasing trends in all subregions during 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 ea showed a slight decrease over the whole region during the periods 1960 1978 and 1997 2019 but a significant p 0 05 increase from 1979 to 1996 ws also experienced complex variations throughout the study period and ws increased significantly p 0 05 from 1960 to 1978 and 1997 2019 and decreased significantly p 0 05 at 0 020 m s year from 1979 to 1996 3 2 sensitivity of eto to climate change according to the analysis in section 2 5 the sensitivity of tmean was largely underestimated throughout china when the dependent driver system was used especially in southeast coast therefore using the independent driver system to attribute changes of eto can promote to get objective results the annual results of the sensitivity coefficients of climatic variables from the independent driver system at the grid and regional scales are plotted in figs 7 and 2 a respectively during the entire study period climatic driver sensitivities remained stable therefore we just analysis the sensitivity coefficients during 1960 1978 for illustration eto presented positive correlations with tmean rs and ws and a negative correlation with ea in most subregions as expected s tmean decreased sharply from southeast to northwest over china with the largest values occurring in sc and ec and the smallest values in nw s tmean was primarily positive over the entire study area but negative for ne and nc where annual tmean was below zero s rs was positive and decreased from south to north and the largest and lowest values were found in sc and ne respectively s ea was negative over china showing different patterns with s tmean and s rs mainly decreasing from east to west the highest and lowest values were observed for ne and sw respectively s ws was positive over china and presented patterns opposite to that of s rs decreasing from north to south and the largest and lowest values were found in nw and sc ea exhibited the highest sensitivity to annual eto with sensitivity coefficients of 0 55 followed by s rs 0 34 s tmean 0 34 and s ws 0 20 for china as a whole which is consistent with the results of wang et al 2019 and zheng et al 2009 but large differences are found among subregions cc sc and ec were most sensitive to tmean while ne nw and nc were most sensitive to ea the seasonal results at the grid and regional scales are plotted in figs s6 s7 s8 and s2 respectively for subregions except for ne and nc eto are most sensitive to tmean in spring and tmean was also the most sensitive driver in all subregions in summer in autumn tmean was the most sensitive factor in subregions except for ne nw and nc where eto was most sensitive to ea in winter tmean was the most sensitive factor in subregions except for cc sw and ec where eto were most sensitive to ea for china as a whole tmean was the most sensitive variable in spring 0 62 summer 1 09 and winter 1 02 and eto was most sensitive to ea 0 59 for autumn slightly larger than tmean 0 56 however tmean the second least sensitive factor in annual scale which is because that negative values of tmean in winter led to negative values of s tmean offsetting the positive values of s tmean in other three seasons making the magnitude of s tmean 0 34 much smaller than that of s ea 0 55 therefore tmean instead of ea was the most sensitive factor in china and it is important to explore the sensitivity of eto trends to climatic drivers in seasonal scale 3 3 attribution of changes in eto 3 3 1 causes of eto changes in regional scale the respective contributions of tmean rs ea and ws to annual eto trends at the grid and regional scales are plotted in figs 8 and 3 a respectively during 1960 1978 for china as a whole increases in ws and rs and decrease in ea promoted the annual eto trends leading to c ws c rs and c ea positive while the decrease in tmean hindered the eto process and resulting in a negative contribution c tmean varied from 1 59 0 85 mm year2 between subregions and the largest magnitude of c tmean was found in ec 1 59 mm year2 c tmean for china as a whole was only 0 24 mm year2 due to the positive values in ne and nw which offset the negative values in other subregions c rs was positive in subregions except for cc ec and sc with maximum magnitude 1 28 mm year2 and minimum magnitude 0 12 mm year2 in sc and nc respectively a positive contribution was exhibited by ea in all subregions and c ea was 0 31 mm year2 for china as a whole c ws was positive in most subregions and nw showed the highest c ws of 1 41 mm year2 and the increased ws accounted for a 0 72 mm year2 increase in eto for all of china according to the respective contributions of climatic drivers on eto trends in regional scale the driving force of annual and seasonal eto can be obtained c tmean c rs c ea and c ws were 0 24 mm year2 0 13 mm year2 0 31 mm year2 and 0 73 mm year2 respectively and therefore an increase in ws was responsible for the increase of annual eto for subregions increased ws are responsible for the increase of annual eto in nw nc and sw while decrease in tmean lead to the decreases of annual eto in cc ec and sc in seasonal scale increase in ws should be responsible for the regional eto decrease in spring and winter while decrease in ea should be responsible for eto decrease in autumn decrease in tmean however was the largest contributing factor in summer leading to a 0 32 mm season year decrease for eto decrease but offset by the jointed positive effects of other three drivers contributions of each driver changed among different subregions and seasons consequently leading to different dominant factors during the period 1979 1996 the increased tmean led to a 1 41 mm year2 increase of eto while rs ea and ws led to the decrease of eto at a rate of 1 93 mm year2 c tmean varies from 0 51 mm year2 to 3 14 mm year2 with the largest value in ne c rs varied from 1 11 mm year2 to 0 29 mm year2 with the largest magnitude in ec and the highest magnitude of c ea was found in ne at the rate of 2 09 mm year2 decreasing ws led to a 3 61 mm year2 decrease in eto for nw and the lowest magnitude was found in sc at a rate of 0 21 mm year2 an increase in tmean was the largest contributing factor for the changes of eto in subregions except for nw sw and sc in annual scale however the positive effects of tmean were offset by the negative effects of decreases in ws rs and an increase in ea consequently leading annual eto to decrease during 1979 1996 decreased ws the largest contributing factor only in nw and sw promoted the decrease in annual eto leading to ws the dominant factor for china as a whole resulting in the decrease of annual eto during 1979 1996 in seasonal scale decrease in ws should be responsible for regional eto decrease in spring and summer while increase in tmean was the largest contributor in autumn and winter for entire country as a whole decrease in ws was the main cause for eto changes in spring for nw nc and sw and decrease in rs should be responsible for eto decrease in cc and ec in summer decrease in ws rs was the main cause for eto decrease in nw nc and sw cc ec and sc while ea was the largest contributor in ne for subregions except for nw and sw which had a dominant decrease in ws the major contributor was increased tmean in autumn and winter during 1997 2019 decreasing rs led to a decrease of 0 38 mm year2 in eto for entire country as a whole meanwhile the changes in tmean ea and ws led to an increase in eto at a rate of 1 06 mm year2 0 17 mm year2 and 0 35 mm year2 respectively for subregions increased tmean made the largest contribution to sw 1 96 mm year2 and the smallest contribution to nc 0 33 mm year2 c rs varies from 0 74 mm year2 to 0 10 mm year2 with the maximum magnitude in ne and minimum magnitude in ec c tmean varies from 0 35 mm year2 to 1 96 mm year2 with the largest value in sw and minimum values in nc c rs varied from 0 09 0 74 mm year2 to 0 74 mm year2 with the largest magnitude in ne and the smallest value in ec the highest magnitude of c ea was found in sc at the rate of 0 79 mm year2 while the lowest magnitude of c ea was found in cc at the rate of 0 03 mm year2 increased ws led to a 0 76 mm year2 decrease in eto for nw and the lowest magnitude was found in cc at a rate of 0 10 mm year2 for entire country as a whole and subregions except for ne and nc which were dominated by decreased rs the major cause of increased annual eto was increased tmean in seasonal scale decreased ea and increased tmean were the main cause for the eto increases in winter and other three season respectively figs s4 s9 s10 and s11 except for sc increased tmean was the main cause for regional eto increase in spring increased tmean was also the major contributor for increased eto in summer except for ne nw and nc which had a dominant decrease in rs and in autumn except for ne nw and cc in winter except for nw sw and sc decreased ea was the main cause for increased eto in winter 3 3 2 causes of eto changes in grid scale based on individual contributions of each climatic driver from the independent driver system we can identify the dominant drivers in annual and seasonal scales fig 9 and calculate their percentages in all grids table 3 in the annual scale tmean appeared to be the most important factor effecting changes in eto followed by ws from 1960 1978 tmean was the dominant factor covering the largest percentage 41 of grids and mainly located in ne the east of sw and the west of sw while ws followed closely covering 37 of the grids mainly located in the middle of sw and west of sw tmean was also found to be a dominant factor that corresponded to the largest percentage of grids 39 55 over china in seasons except for summer while 40 of grids are dominated by rs in summer followed by tmean 39 from 1979 1996 tmean was the most widely distributed dominant factor in annual scale covering 46 of grids followed by ws 30 the dominance of tmean was mainly found in ne nc cc ec and the east of sw while the dominance of ws was mainly found in the west and middle of nw in seasonal scale tmean was also the most widely distributed dominant factor in autumn and winter covering at least 53 of grids while ws and rs were found to be a dominant factor that corresponded to the large percentage of grids 42 and 32 from 1997 through 2019 tmean and ws dominated eto in 47 and 33 of grids respectively the dominance of tmean was mainly found in sw cc and ec while the dominance of ws was mainly located in nc and the west of nw increased tmean was found to be a dominant factor covering the largest percentage of grids at least 42 in all seasons ws was also an important dominant factor in autumn and winter covering 32 of grids while the dominance of rs covering 38 of grids in summer 3 4 the important role of air temperature in eto changes we can easily conclude that tmean at least 41 instead of ws at most 37 was the most widely distributed dominant factor during the entire study period this conclusion was not contradictory with the dominance of ws for entire country as a whole during 1960 1978 and 1979 1996 during 1960 1978 tmean was the most widely distributed dominant factor for changes of eto but the positive effect of tmean in ne nw and nc was offset by the negative effects of decreasing tmean in other subregions leading to a smaller contribution of tmean than ws for china as a whole during 1979 1996 although tmean was a dominant factor covering the largest percentage of the grids the positive effect of increasing tmean was offset by the combined negative effects of decreasing ws rs and increasing ea resulting in a decrease in eto additionally decreased ws led to a strong negative impact on eto in nw 3 59 mm year2 much larger than the impacts of other drivers promoting the negative trend of eto making ws the largest contributor for entire china as a whole during 1979 1996 the dominance of decrease of ws in nw is consistent with wang et al 2019 thomas 2000 also found ws to be the dominant factor in water limited area of west china in our study nw showed the largest variations in ws leading to the dominance of ws in changes of eto during 1960 1978 and 1979 1996 therefore our results highlight the importance of tmean in changes in eto which is consistent with those of several other studies that using independent driver systems such as hobbins 2016 who used an independent driver system to affirm that air temperature is the most significant driver covering the largest percentage of the grid in daily monthly and annual scales in conus wide in addition zheng et al 2009 also found that air temperature was the second largest contributor to changes in eto in the haihe river basin zhang et al 2013 reported that the contribution of tmean is 2 99 mm year2 dominating 62 of stations for china after 1993 zhang et al 2013 by using an independent climatic driver system sun et al 2020 also highlighted the importance of tmean to eto changes in hengduan mountains however the importance of tmean in changing eto was often covered when dependent driver systems are used decreases in ws and radiation were always regarded as the largest contributing factors for evaporation paradox for example fan et al 2018 concluded that climate warming does not exactly increase the atmospheric evaporative demand due to low significance of temperature by using a dependent driver system in mainland china chai et al 2018 suggested that a decline in ws should be responsible for the negative trend of eto in china while only 1 3 of grids are dominated by air temperature by using rn and vpd as radiation and humidity drivers chai et al 2018 ye et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and fan et al 2016 also found that decreasing wind speed was the dominant climatic factor for the decrease of eto by using a temperature related humidity driver rh wang et al 2016 found radiation to be the most contributing factor in decrease of eto in three river source by using rn as the radiation factor these findings corresponded with the contribution analysis using the dependent climatic driver system with eq 11 in this study fig s12 b and table s1 when the dependent climatic driver system was used the dominance of tmean decreased greatly across china resulting in the lowest percentages of grids dominated by tmean 6 16 and 14 during three periods while ws 42 50 and 38 was the most influential climatic factor affecting changes in annual eto therefore the independence of climatic drivers which has been neglected in many studies should be carefully addressed in future research which can help us understand the causes of eto trends more objectively and accurately 3 5 impacts of eto variations on agriculture eto represents the evaporative demand of the land surface and its increase will lead to the increase of plant transpiration and soil evaporation resulting in the increasing need of agricultural water requirement ai can reflect the combined effects of precipitation and evaporative demand and a positive trend of ai indicates a drier regional climate which indicates more irrigation water may be needed to crops tabari and aghajanloo 2013 the precipitation in whole china showed an increasing trend from 1960 to 2019 leading to the decreasing trend of ai indicating a wetter pattern during the whole study period this might lead to a decrease of agricultural water demand especially in wet regions such as ne nw and nc fig 10 however the case was different in recent years as the evaporative evaporation changed some studies recommended the adjustment of agricultural irrigation method estes et al 2014 fan et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the increase in eto and uneven distribution of precipitation can lead to a remarkable increase in the irrigated water requirement from the perspective of agriculture cao et al 2017 in this study both precipitation and eto increased during 1997 2019 for mainland china as a whole leading to a slight increase of ai indicating a drier pattern after 1996 which might lead to an increase of agricultural water demand especially in ne and nc however increase in eto did not always result in a drier condition and the irrigation strategy can be different in subregions for example both nc and nw had high ai values indicating the drought condition of these subregions but ai for nc had an increasing trend after 1996 while ai for nw had a decreasing trend because the precipitation of nw increased more significantly than the increase of eto while that of nc was on the contrary indicating nw experienced a humidified climate while nc experienced a drier climate this suggests an adjustment of agricultural water supply that regulators could reduce the water supply in nw while increase water supply in nc and also indicating enormous challenges for agricultural water management in nc 4 conclusion the spatial and temporal changes in penman monteith eto were investigated from 1960 to 2019 in china and its seven subregions area averaged annual eto in china exhibited an upward downward upward trend with change points occurring in 1978 and 1996 a slight increase of 0 91 mm year2 during 1960 1978 a significant decrease p 0 05 of 2 36 mm year2 from 1979 to 1996 and a significant increase p 0 05 of 1 03 mm year2 were detected for the entire region studied two sets of climatic variables for an independent driver system tmean rs ea and ws and a dependent driver system tmean rn rh and ws were used to discuss the potential causes of variations in eto in both annual and seasonal scales the results show that the sensitivities of eto to tmean can be largely underestimated by 60 59 and 57 in 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively while the contributions of tmean were underestimated by 84 54 and 46 respectively during the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 at annual scale with the largest relative changes in ec at least 67 followed by sc the largest relative change of c tmean was found in autumn with c tmean being underestimated by at least 96 during the entire period and the largest relative change of c tmean was found in southeast of china with high temperatures therefore a dependent driver can raise large uncertainties when attributing changes of eto to climatic variables using the independent driver system tmean was found to be the most sensitive variable in seasons except for autumn during the entire study period in which eto was most sensitive to ea with the magnitude of s ea slightly larger than that of s tmean tmean rather than ws was the dominant factor covering the largest percentage 41 46 and 48 of grids during 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively closely followed by ws 37 30 and 33 in regional scale change in tmean should be responsible for annual eto trends in subregions except for nw nc and sw during 1960 1978 which had a dominance in increased ws however the positive values of c tmean in ne and nw were offset by negative effect of tmean in other regions leading to the magnitude of c tmean much smaller than that of c ws during 1979 1996 in annual scale increases in air temperature was the largest contributing factor for the changes of eto in subregions except for nw sw and sc however the positive effects of tmean were offset by the negative effects of decreases in ws rs and an increase in ea consequently leading annual eto to decrease decreased ws the largest contributing factor only in nw and sw promoted the decrease in annual eto leading to ws the dominant factor for china as a whole resulting in the decrease of annual eto during 1979 1996 during 1997 2019 for entire country as a whole and subregions except for ne and nc which were dominated by decreased rs the major cause of increased annual eto was increased tmean our results highlight the effect of tmean in changing eto during the entire study area our results emphasized the importance of using independent climatic variables when attributing changes in eto temperature related radiation and humidity drivers can greatly influence the results of attribution and underestimate the impact of air temperature on trends in eto the independence of climatic drivers which has frequently been neglected previously should be considered in future research and a relatively independent driver system can help us understand the evolution of eto changes and the respective impact of climatic drivers

9716,reference evapotranspiration eto is a key parameter in hydrometeorological studies but dependent climatic drivers can induce uncertainties when attributing changes of eto to climate change and many studies have neglected this issue in this study two sets of climatic drivers the independent dependent driver system were used to attribute changes of penman monteith eto to climatic variables in china results show eto presented an upward downward upward trend with the change points in 1978 and 1996 using the dependent driver system the sensitivity coefficient and the contribution of average air temperature tmean were underestimated by at least 57 and 46 during three periods 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 the largest relative changes of contribution of tmean c tmean were found in southeast of china with high temperatures while largest relative changes of c tmean peaked in autumn therefore in order to promote the acquisition of relatively objective results in attributing changes of eto the independence of climatic drivers must be carefully addressed using the independent driver system we found eto was most sensitive to tmean in spring summer and winter tmean was always a dominant factor for the largest percentage at least 41 of grids across china followed by ws at most 30 during three periods however the large changes of ws in northwest of china promote the changes of eto during 1960 1978 and 1979 1996 leading to increased ws decreased ws and increased tmean responsible for the upward downward upward trend of eto for entire china as a whole during three periods this study emphasizes the effect of tmean in changing eto during the entire study area and help improve our understanding of the evolution of eto and providing a guideline for water resource management and water use planning for agriculture keywords evaporative demand climate change independent climatic variables trend analysis attribution analysis data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available in the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn 1 introduction evapotranspiration is often used as a significant hydrometeorological indicator to reflect climate change and hydrological processes tao et al 2015 xu et al 2018 due to the lack of experimental measurements especially on large spatial and temporal scales reference evapotranspiration eto is usually used to estimate actual evapotranspiration liu and zhang 2013 eto is also an important component of agricultural activities as it affects crop water requirements irrigation schedules and water scarcity li et al 2017 ma et al 2012 therefore research on eto trends and their causes can provide insights into how hydrological processes respond to climate change and offer great significance for regional agricultural water management air temperature humidity radiation and wind speed were found to jointly affect eto changes air is supposed to be drier and evaporative demands such as eto are expected to increase with increasing air temperature however the opposite trend for evaporative demand has been reported worldwide jhajharia et al 2012 mcvicar et al 2012 papaioannou et al 2011 this is known as the evaporation paradox brutsaert and parlange 1998 mcvicar et al 2012 roderick and farquhar 2002 global temperature change is always regarded as having a much lower impact on the change in eto compared to decreases in wind speed stilling and radiation dimming han et al 2018 mcvicar et al 2012 nouri and bannayan 2019 wang et al 2017 ye et al 2014 more recently eto was reported to have recovered in many regions of the world since 1980s or 1990s such as in greece papaioannou et al 2011 iran bahrami et al 2019 the republic of moldova piticar et al 2016 and china dong et al 2020 han et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 liu and zhang 2013 wang et al 2013 2020 some studies have shown that the recovery of wind speed is responsible for the reversion of eto li et al 2014 ye et al 2014 however improper radiation and humidity drivers such as net solar radiation rn relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd are frequently used when attributing changes in eto which may cause uncertainties in this process for example rh and vpd are partial functions of air temperature tmean whereas rn is a partial function of actual vapor pressure ea and air temperature high relevance exists between humidity drivers radiation drivers and air temperature and using rn as a radiation driver or using rh or vpd as humidity drivers makes it difficult to differentiate the respective contribution of these variables from that of air temperature hobbins 2016 sun et al 2020 zheng et al 2009 also highlighted the independence of drivers when quantifying the contribution of each climatic driver to eto trends in the haihe basin china hobbins 2016 proposed that covariances between drivers can bring in large uncertainties and that using downward shortwave radiation and specific humidity in the attribution of trends of eto can distinguish the contribution of air temperature radiation and humidity in addition sun et al 2020 found that using temperature related humidity and radiation drivers could underrate the effect of air temperature on changes in eto in the hengduan mountains therefore using dependent variables can raise large uncertainties due to large overlap between the contributing variables leading to controversial results in contribution analysis while attributing trends of eto using independent climatic drivers may characterize the joint effects of driving factors more accurately and objectively however few studies have concerned this issue or quantitatively evaluated differences in attributing changes of eto to dependent independent driver systems china feeds about one fifth of the world s population from only 7 of all arable land worldwide piao et al 2010 resulting in significant pressure on food production processes an objective understanding of variation in eto and its main causes can also promote the development of suitable irrigation systems and have a profound effect on food security in china therefore objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the trends of annual eto in china from 1960 to 2019 2 assess the differences in attributing changes of eto to climatic variables using independent and dependent driver systems and 3 attribute variations in annual and seasonal eto to climatic drivers objectively 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data processing china is geographically diverse extending from the tropical temperate zone in the south to the cold temperate zone in the north its climate ranges from humid to arid from southeast coastal areas to northwest inland areas it also has a conflicting landscape characterized by low elevation in the east and high elevation in the west which contributes to the complex hydrothermal conditions in the area considering these environmental features we divided china into seven subregions according to wang et al 2019 land use climate agriculture and topography were also considered the seven subregions include fig 1 1 northeast china ne 2 northwest china nw and 3 northern china nc 4 central china cc 5 eastern china ec 6 southern china sc and finally 7 southwest china sw details for these subregions can be found in wang et al 2019 the climate datasets used to estimate eto in this study were taken from the national meteorological information center nmic of china http data cma cn with data spanning from 1960 to 2019 the datasets were published after quality control and homogeneity adjustment china meteorological administration 2003 with the data accuracy nearly 100 the stations are well distributed in most of the study area except for extreme western and northwestern where few meteorological stations located due to the bad environment of desert the datasets used in this study include average air temperature tmean c maximum air temperature tmax c minimum air temperature tmin c sunlight duration sd h relative humidity rh wind speed at 10 m height m s and atmospheric pressure kpa precipitation pre mm meteorological stations were removed if 1 the station was built after 1960 or 2 the station was removed before 2019 or 3 more than 5 of the data from the station was missing or 4 the dataset had a consecutive data missing more than 12 months in the study period finally 754 meteorological stations were selected in this study fig 1 to ensure the completeness and continuity of the data the missing values for the remained stations were interpolated from nearby stations using linear regression during the same period daily datasets were transformed into monthly mean datasets to estimate the monthly mean eto climatic variables were then interpolated into a raster surface by cokriging with extended drift using srtm dem derived from https earthexplorer usgs gov as an auxiliary predictor in arcgis 10 2 the time series were from 1960 to 2019 and each year was divided into four seasons spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december january and february 2 2 fao penman monteith method the penman monteith equation was used to calculate eto in this study it was recommended by the fao in 1998 as the only standard method to estimate eto and has been widely used worldwide allen et al 1998 the equation is as follows 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 ws e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 ws where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 tmean is the 2 m mean air temperature c δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure related to air temperature kpa c 1 rn is the net solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 which can be calculated from sunlight duration g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 ws is the wind speed at 2 m m s 1 calculated from the wind speed at 10 m es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and finally ea kpa is the actual vapor pressure details for estimating eto can be found in allen et al 1998 2 3 aridity index aridity index ai an indicator of agricultural water demand was used to discuss the impact of eto variations on agricultural water management in this study ai was calculated as follows thornthwaite 1948 ai et o p et o where ai is defined as the ratio of the difference between eto and p to eto if ai is equal to 1 it means there is no precipitation and the aridity reaches the highest if ai is equal to 0 or negative it means precipitation is equal to or higher than reference evapotranspiration 2 4 trend test and abrupt change detection linear least square regression was used to analyze the trends of climatic variables and eto series due to its simplicity and the mann kendall test m k test was adopted to explore whether the trend was significant at the 95 confidence level kendall 1948 mann 1945 the m k test is a nonparametric trend test method that is applicable to non normally distributed data series and which frequently appears in hydrometric researches han et al 2018 huo et al 2013 the test statistic s is calculated as follows 2 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i 3 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 n t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 4 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where x i and x j are generic sequential values of the variable n is the length of the variable var s is the variance of s and z is the standardized test statistic value if z z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is rejected at a given significance level of α and z 1 α 2 1 96 when α 0 05 the moving t test was used to test whether the change points existed in the time series by assessing whether the average values of two subseries divided by a moving point significantly differed from each other jia et al 2015 karl and riebsame 1984 to better define the shift time of the annual eto the moving t test was applied in this study the eto time series was divided into two subsequences by a moving datum point and n 1 and n 2 are the lengths of the subsequences before and after the datum point x 1 and x 2 are the mean values of the two subsequences and s 1 and s 2 are the standard deviations the two statistical values of this method t and s are defined as follows 5 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 6 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 for a given significance level t a once t t a the annual eto is supposed to experience an abrupt change and the datum point is accepted as a change point 2 5 attributing eto changes and selecting climatic drivers 2 5 1 contribution assessment method partial derivation can reveal how climatic variables influence eto in the penman monteith method however it is inadequate for comparing the sensitivity of different variables owing to the difference in dimensions therefore a mathematically defined sensitivity coefficient was used to estimate the sensitivity of eto to climatic variables mccuen 1974 the sensitivity coefficient of a climatic variable xi to eto can be described as follows 7 s xi lim xi et 0 et 0 xi xi et 0 xi xi et 0 where s xi is a non dimensional form representing the sensitivity coefficient of the climatic driver xi a positive s xi value indicates that eto increases with increasing xi and vice versa when s xi 0 1 it indicates that when other variables remain unchanged a 10 increase in the climatic variable xi may lead to a 1 increase in eto to attribute the changes of eto to climatic drivers the following method was used zheng et al 2009 8 d et 0 dt et 0 rx drx dt et 0 tx dtx dt et 0 hx dhx dt et 0 ws dws dt δ where rx is the radiation driver tx is the temperature driver hx is the humidity driver ws is the wind speed driver dx dt is calculated using linear regression and δ is the systemic error eq 8 can be simplified as 9 c et o c rx c tx c hx c ws δ where c rx c tx c hx and c ws are the respective contributions of changes in rx tx hx and ws to eto changes to obtain objective results when attributing changes in annual eto tmean rs ea and ws were selected as a independent climatic driver system in this study tmean has a positive relationship with tmax and tmin and it can include the impact of tmax and tmin when attributing changes of eto by using rs and ea as the radiation and humidity drivers respectively the humidity and radiation drivers selected can be expressed independently of other drivers therefore eq 9 can be rewritten as 10 c et o c rs c tmean c e a c ws δ 2 5 2 importance of the independency of climatic drivers in attribution analysis based on the penman monteith method eq 1 rn and vpd es ea were often selected as the radiation driver and humidity driver respectively in addition rh is also a common choice for humidity drivers as it can be directly derived from meteorological stations however rn is a function of rs ea and air temperature and both vpd and rh were also partial functions of ea and temperature when temperature related humidity rh or vpd and radiation rn are used as contributing factors the impacts of tmean humidity and radiation cannot be differentiated effectively hobbins 2016 sun et al 2020 zheng et al 2009 however many previous studies have neglected this issue when analyzing the response of eto to climate change dong et al 2020 han et al 2018 jerin et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2014 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 zuo et al 2012 which may bring uncertainties and obtain incorrect conclusions to highlight the importance of using dependent climatic drivers in attribution analysis we also selected a dependent climatic driver system including tmean rn rh and ws for comparison eq 9 is transferred to 11 c et o c rn c tmean c rh c ws δ results show that large differences were observed in the sensitivity coefficients when the independent and dependent driver systems were used respectively fig 2 and table 1 for ease of description we use s tmean s rx s rs or s rn s hx s ea or s rh and s ws to represent the sensitivity coefficients of temperature tmean radiation rs or rn humidity rh or ea and wind speed ws respectively only ws and tmean was in both the independent and dependent driver system in addition ws is not a function of temperature radiation or humidity and the change in the climatic driver system had no impact on s ws therefore only s tmean was compared here values of s tmean over subregions are presented at annual scale fig 2 and seasonal scale figs s2 and s3 using the dependent driver system s tmean was underestimated by 14 91 in subregions for annual scale resulting in a decrease in s tmean from 0 32 to 0 13 by 60 for the entire region under study from 1960 to 1978 table 1 similarly the percentage decline varied from 29 to 109 and from 31 to 153 in subregions resulting in decreases in s tmean by 59 and 57 for the entire area under study during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively during the entire study period nc showed the largest relative change in annual scale in seasonal scale the highest relative change of s tmean occurred in sc and ec for seasons except for winter while highest relative change of s tmean occurred in sw for winter few differences existed among seasons for china as a whole although the changes of s tmean showed the largest uncertainties in autumn the contributions of variables from the independent and dependent driver systems can be calculated using partial derivatives and climate driver trends according to eq 8 the regional average trends of eto for subregions calculated using the equation ceto independent and ceto dependent fit well with the trends of eto calculated using linear regression leto with r2 0 995 and r2 0 999 for leto vs ceto independent and leto vs ceto dependent respectively fig s1 for china as a whole the error item δ 0 02 mm year 0 16 mm year and 0 15 mm year with relative errors of 2 7 and 15 for ceto independent for the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively the error item δ 0 01 mm year 0 06 mm year and 0 08 mm year with relative errors of 1 3 and 7 for ceto dependent during 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively the results show that the method used in this study can effectively attribute the changes in eto to climatic variables figs 3 s4 and s5 shows the respective contributions of climatic variables on eto changes over subregions using different driver systems in annual and seasonal scales and the relative changes of contribution of tmean to eto were also identified in subregions table 2 for ease of description we use c tmean c rx c rs or c rn c hx c ea or c rh and c ws to represent the contributions of temperature radiation humidity and wind speed respectively when the dependent climatic driver system was used c tmean was underestimated by 84 54 and 46 respectively during the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 at annual scale compared to the independent climatic driver system the largest relative changes were found in ec at least 67 followed by sc nw showed the lowest relative change less than 49 relative changes in contributions of radiation driver changed by 48 27 and 44 for china varying from 42 to 5 104 to 4 and 126 to 134 for subregions for the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 contributions of humidity driver changed by 47 46 and 346 for the entire region under study from 1960 to 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively it is worth mentioning that c ea showed the lowest magnitudes in cc sw and ec from 1997 to 2019 using the independent driver system leading to extremely large relative changes in contributions of humidity driver using the dependent driver system and an overestimation of 346 for china as a whole in seasonal scale the largest relative change of c tmean was found in autumn with c tmean being underestimated by 115 96 and 98 respectively despite no uniform trend exists in seasons the largest deviations of c tmean were found in sc ec and cc in annual scale indicating uncertainties was greater in southeast of china with high temperatures 3 results and discussions 3 1 trends of eto and climatic variables area averaged eto was calculated to explore the change points of eto for entire country as a whole the temporal variations of the area averaged annual and seasonal eto for the entire study area from 1960 to 2019 are plotted in fig 4 two change points for the annual eto series in 1978 and 1996 were found using the moving t test fig 4 a annual eto for china demonstrated a slight positive trend of 0 96 mm year2 during 1960 1978 a strong decrease p 0 001 of 2 38 mm year2 from 1979 to 1996 and after that a significant increase p 0 05 of 1 05 mm year2 from 1997 to 2019 the downward trend of eto was ended in 1996 similar to other studies fan et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2017 indicating that evaporation paradox in china ended at the end of the 20th century and that eto has gradually increased in the past two decades different patterns of seasonal eto are shown in fig 4 b for 1960 1978 only autumn showed a significant increase p 0 05 of 0 24 mm season year for 1979 1996 the decreasing trends of eto for spring summer autumn were significant p 0 05 with the largest decrease in summer of 1 14 mm season year for 1997 2019 the largest increase of eto was found in spring of 0 54 mm season year it is worth noting that eto experienced the highest variations in spring and summer while winter experienced the lowest variation during the entire study period eto was calculated using the interpolated climatic variable in grid scale and then the spatial trends of eto for three periods 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 divided by the change points were calculated in both annual and seasonal scales fig 5 the results of the grids indicate that eto shows an increasing trend from 1960 to 1978 across 66 of the country with 10 of the region showing a significant decrease p 0 05 additionally 90 of the total grids decreased in the period 1979 1996 with 16 of the region presenting a significant decrease from 1979 to 1996 75 of the total area increased from 1997 to 2019 with 30 recording an increasing trend as shown in fig 5 the annual eto for the whole region primarily increased from 1960 to 1978 and large differences were observed between subregions eto primarily showed increasing trends in the north and west of the study area ne nw nc and sw and decreasing trends in the south and east cc ec and sc resulting in an insignificant increase of 0 91 mm year2 for the whole region the annual eto primarily decreased from 1979 to 1996 this was especially true for nw and sw with a significant p 0 05 decrease of 4 36 mm year2 and 2 36 mm year2 respectively annual eto also showed a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend of 2 36 mm year2 over the whole study area with the largest magnitude in summer with 4 52 mm year2 after the decrease annual eto increased again for the whole region from 1997 to 2019 with a significant p 0 05 trend of 1 03 mm year2 with the exception of ne and sc which showed a slight decrease the annual eto showed increases in other subregions especially for sw with a significant increase of 2 32 mm year2 the changes in eto consist of the jointed results of climatic variables therefore understanding how climatic variables change is crucial to understanding how eto changes fig 6 presents the annual trends of the four climatic variables from the independent driver system in china and its seven regions for china as a whole tmean slightly decreased by 0 002 c year except for ne and nw from 1960 to 1978 wherein it increased significantly p 0 05 at 0 029 c year and 0 020 c year during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1998 2019 respectively except for ne and nw tmean decreased from 1960 through 1978 for all subregions all subregions showed increasing trends during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 rs increased slightly at 0 003 mj m2 day year for the period 1960 1978 and decreased significantly p 0 05 to 0 022 mj m2 day year and 0 013 mj m2 day year during the periods of 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively rs showed increasing trends in each subregion except for cc ec and sc from 1960 to 1978 but decreasing trends in all subregions during 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 ea showed a slight decrease over the whole region during the periods 1960 1978 and 1997 2019 but a significant p 0 05 increase from 1979 to 1996 ws also experienced complex variations throughout the study period and ws increased significantly p 0 05 from 1960 to 1978 and 1997 2019 and decreased significantly p 0 05 at 0 020 m s year from 1979 to 1996 3 2 sensitivity of eto to climate change according to the analysis in section 2 5 the sensitivity of tmean was largely underestimated throughout china when the dependent driver system was used especially in southeast coast therefore using the independent driver system to attribute changes of eto can promote to get objective results the annual results of the sensitivity coefficients of climatic variables from the independent driver system at the grid and regional scales are plotted in figs 7 and 2 a respectively during the entire study period climatic driver sensitivities remained stable therefore we just analysis the sensitivity coefficients during 1960 1978 for illustration eto presented positive correlations with tmean rs and ws and a negative correlation with ea in most subregions as expected s tmean decreased sharply from southeast to northwest over china with the largest values occurring in sc and ec and the smallest values in nw s tmean was primarily positive over the entire study area but negative for ne and nc where annual tmean was below zero s rs was positive and decreased from south to north and the largest and lowest values were found in sc and ne respectively s ea was negative over china showing different patterns with s tmean and s rs mainly decreasing from east to west the highest and lowest values were observed for ne and sw respectively s ws was positive over china and presented patterns opposite to that of s rs decreasing from north to south and the largest and lowest values were found in nw and sc ea exhibited the highest sensitivity to annual eto with sensitivity coefficients of 0 55 followed by s rs 0 34 s tmean 0 34 and s ws 0 20 for china as a whole which is consistent with the results of wang et al 2019 and zheng et al 2009 but large differences are found among subregions cc sc and ec were most sensitive to tmean while ne nw and nc were most sensitive to ea the seasonal results at the grid and regional scales are plotted in figs s6 s7 s8 and s2 respectively for subregions except for ne and nc eto are most sensitive to tmean in spring and tmean was also the most sensitive driver in all subregions in summer in autumn tmean was the most sensitive factor in subregions except for ne nw and nc where eto was most sensitive to ea in winter tmean was the most sensitive factor in subregions except for cc sw and ec where eto were most sensitive to ea for china as a whole tmean was the most sensitive variable in spring 0 62 summer 1 09 and winter 1 02 and eto was most sensitive to ea 0 59 for autumn slightly larger than tmean 0 56 however tmean the second least sensitive factor in annual scale which is because that negative values of tmean in winter led to negative values of s tmean offsetting the positive values of s tmean in other three seasons making the magnitude of s tmean 0 34 much smaller than that of s ea 0 55 therefore tmean instead of ea was the most sensitive factor in china and it is important to explore the sensitivity of eto trends to climatic drivers in seasonal scale 3 3 attribution of changes in eto 3 3 1 causes of eto changes in regional scale the respective contributions of tmean rs ea and ws to annual eto trends at the grid and regional scales are plotted in figs 8 and 3 a respectively during 1960 1978 for china as a whole increases in ws and rs and decrease in ea promoted the annual eto trends leading to c ws c rs and c ea positive while the decrease in tmean hindered the eto process and resulting in a negative contribution c tmean varied from 1 59 0 85 mm year2 between subregions and the largest magnitude of c tmean was found in ec 1 59 mm year2 c tmean for china as a whole was only 0 24 mm year2 due to the positive values in ne and nw which offset the negative values in other subregions c rs was positive in subregions except for cc ec and sc with maximum magnitude 1 28 mm year2 and minimum magnitude 0 12 mm year2 in sc and nc respectively a positive contribution was exhibited by ea in all subregions and c ea was 0 31 mm year2 for china as a whole c ws was positive in most subregions and nw showed the highest c ws of 1 41 mm year2 and the increased ws accounted for a 0 72 mm year2 increase in eto for all of china according to the respective contributions of climatic drivers on eto trends in regional scale the driving force of annual and seasonal eto can be obtained c tmean c rs c ea and c ws were 0 24 mm year2 0 13 mm year2 0 31 mm year2 and 0 73 mm year2 respectively and therefore an increase in ws was responsible for the increase of annual eto for subregions increased ws are responsible for the increase of annual eto in nw nc and sw while decrease in tmean lead to the decreases of annual eto in cc ec and sc in seasonal scale increase in ws should be responsible for the regional eto decrease in spring and winter while decrease in ea should be responsible for eto decrease in autumn decrease in tmean however was the largest contributing factor in summer leading to a 0 32 mm season year decrease for eto decrease but offset by the jointed positive effects of other three drivers contributions of each driver changed among different subregions and seasons consequently leading to different dominant factors during the period 1979 1996 the increased tmean led to a 1 41 mm year2 increase of eto while rs ea and ws led to the decrease of eto at a rate of 1 93 mm year2 c tmean varies from 0 51 mm year2 to 3 14 mm year2 with the largest value in ne c rs varied from 1 11 mm year2 to 0 29 mm year2 with the largest magnitude in ec and the highest magnitude of c ea was found in ne at the rate of 2 09 mm year2 decreasing ws led to a 3 61 mm year2 decrease in eto for nw and the lowest magnitude was found in sc at a rate of 0 21 mm year2 an increase in tmean was the largest contributing factor for the changes of eto in subregions except for nw sw and sc in annual scale however the positive effects of tmean were offset by the negative effects of decreases in ws rs and an increase in ea consequently leading annual eto to decrease during 1979 1996 decreased ws the largest contributing factor only in nw and sw promoted the decrease in annual eto leading to ws the dominant factor for china as a whole resulting in the decrease of annual eto during 1979 1996 in seasonal scale decrease in ws should be responsible for regional eto decrease in spring and summer while increase in tmean was the largest contributor in autumn and winter for entire country as a whole decrease in ws was the main cause for eto changes in spring for nw nc and sw and decrease in rs should be responsible for eto decrease in cc and ec in summer decrease in ws rs was the main cause for eto decrease in nw nc and sw cc ec and sc while ea was the largest contributor in ne for subregions except for nw and sw which had a dominant decrease in ws the major contributor was increased tmean in autumn and winter during 1997 2019 decreasing rs led to a decrease of 0 38 mm year2 in eto for entire country as a whole meanwhile the changes in tmean ea and ws led to an increase in eto at a rate of 1 06 mm year2 0 17 mm year2 and 0 35 mm year2 respectively for subregions increased tmean made the largest contribution to sw 1 96 mm year2 and the smallest contribution to nc 0 33 mm year2 c rs varies from 0 74 mm year2 to 0 10 mm year2 with the maximum magnitude in ne and minimum magnitude in ec c tmean varies from 0 35 mm year2 to 1 96 mm year2 with the largest value in sw and minimum values in nc c rs varied from 0 09 0 74 mm year2 to 0 74 mm year2 with the largest magnitude in ne and the smallest value in ec the highest magnitude of c ea was found in sc at the rate of 0 79 mm year2 while the lowest magnitude of c ea was found in cc at the rate of 0 03 mm year2 increased ws led to a 0 76 mm year2 decrease in eto for nw and the lowest magnitude was found in cc at a rate of 0 10 mm year2 for entire country as a whole and subregions except for ne and nc which were dominated by decreased rs the major cause of increased annual eto was increased tmean in seasonal scale decreased ea and increased tmean were the main cause for the eto increases in winter and other three season respectively figs s4 s9 s10 and s11 except for sc increased tmean was the main cause for regional eto increase in spring increased tmean was also the major contributor for increased eto in summer except for ne nw and nc which had a dominant decrease in rs and in autumn except for ne nw and cc in winter except for nw sw and sc decreased ea was the main cause for increased eto in winter 3 3 2 causes of eto changes in grid scale based on individual contributions of each climatic driver from the independent driver system we can identify the dominant drivers in annual and seasonal scales fig 9 and calculate their percentages in all grids table 3 in the annual scale tmean appeared to be the most important factor effecting changes in eto followed by ws from 1960 1978 tmean was the dominant factor covering the largest percentage 41 of grids and mainly located in ne the east of sw and the west of sw while ws followed closely covering 37 of the grids mainly located in the middle of sw and west of sw tmean was also found to be a dominant factor that corresponded to the largest percentage of grids 39 55 over china in seasons except for summer while 40 of grids are dominated by rs in summer followed by tmean 39 from 1979 1996 tmean was the most widely distributed dominant factor in annual scale covering 46 of grids followed by ws 30 the dominance of tmean was mainly found in ne nc cc ec and the east of sw while the dominance of ws was mainly found in the west and middle of nw in seasonal scale tmean was also the most widely distributed dominant factor in autumn and winter covering at least 53 of grids while ws and rs were found to be a dominant factor that corresponded to the large percentage of grids 42 and 32 from 1997 through 2019 tmean and ws dominated eto in 47 and 33 of grids respectively the dominance of tmean was mainly found in sw cc and ec while the dominance of ws was mainly located in nc and the west of nw increased tmean was found to be a dominant factor covering the largest percentage of grids at least 42 in all seasons ws was also an important dominant factor in autumn and winter covering 32 of grids while the dominance of rs covering 38 of grids in summer 3 4 the important role of air temperature in eto changes we can easily conclude that tmean at least 41 instead of ws at most 37 was the most widely distributed dominant factor during the entire study period this conclusion was not contradictory with the dominance of ws for entire country as a whole during 1960 1978 and 1979 1996 during 1960 1978 tmean was the most widely distributed dominant factor for changes of eto but the positive effect of tmean in ne nw and nc was offset by the negative effects of decreasing tmean in other subregions leading to a smaller contribution of tmean than ws for china as a whole during 1979 1996 although tmean was a dominant factor covering the largest percentage of the grids the positive effect of increasing tmean was offset by the combined negative effects of decreasing ws rs and increasing ea resulting in a decrease in eto additionally decreased ws led to a strong negative impact on eto in nw 3 59 mm year2 much larger than the impacts of other drivers promoting the negative trend of eto making ws the largest contributor for entire china as a whole during 1979 1996 the dominance of decrease of ws in nw is consistent with wang et al 2019 thomas 2000 also found ws to be the dominant factor in water limited area of west china in our study nw showed the largest variations in ws leading to the dominance of ws in changes of eto during 1960 1978 and 1979 1996 therefore our results highlight the importance of tmean in changes in eto which is consistent with those of several other studies that using independent driver systems such as hobbins 2016 who used an independent driver system to affirm that air temperature is the most significant driver covering the largest percentage of the grid in daily monthly and annual scales in conus wide in addition zheng et al 2009 also found that air temperature was the second largest contributor to changes in eto in the haihe river basin zhang et al 2013 reported that the contribution of tmean is 2 99 mm year2 dominating 62 of stations for china after 1993 zhang et al 2013 by using an independent climatic driver system sun et al 2020 also highlighted the importance of tmean to eto changes in hengduan mountains however the importance of tmean in changing eto was often covered when dependent driver systems are used decreases in ws and radiation were always regarded as the largest contributing factors for evaporation paradox for example fan et al 2018 concluded that climate warming does not exactly increase the atmospheric evaporative demand due to low significance of temperature by using a dependent driver system in mainland china chai et al 2018 suggested that a decline in ws should be responsible for the negative trend of eto in china while only 1 3 of grids are dominated by air temperature by using rn and vpd as radiation and humidity drivers chai et al 2018 ye et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and fan et al 2016 also found that decreasing wind speed was the dominant climatic factor for the decrease of eto by using a temperature related humidity driver rh wang et al 2016 found radiation to be the most contributing factor in decrease of eto in three river source by using rn as the radiation factor these findings corresponded with the contribution analysis using the dependent climatic driver system with eq 11 in this study fig s12 b and table s1 when the dependent climatic driver system was used the dominance of tmean decreased greatly across china resulting in the lowest percentages of grids dominated by tmean 6 16 and 14 during three periods while ws 42 50 and 38 was the most influential climatic factor affecting changes in annual eto therefore the independence of climatic drivers which has been neglected in many studies should be carefully addressed in future research which can help us understand the causes of eto trends more objectively and accurately 3 5 impacts of eto variations on agriculture eto represents the evaporative demand of the land surface and its increase will lead to the increase of plant transpiration and soil evaporation resulting in the increasing need of agricultural water requirement ai can reflect the combined effects of precipitation and evaporative demand and a positive trend of ai indicates a drier regional climate which indicates more irrigation water may be needed to crops tabari and aghajanloo 2013 the precipitation in whole china showed an increasing trend from 1960 to 2019 leading to the decreasing trend of ai indicating a wetter pattern during the whole study period this might lead to a decrease of agricultural water demand especially in wet regions such as ne nw and nc fig 10 however the case was different in recent years as the evaporative evaporation changed some studies recommended the adjustment of agricultural irrigation method estes et al 2014 fan et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the increase in eto and uneven distribution of precipitation can lead to a remarkable increase in the irrigated water requirement from the perspective of agriculture cao et al 2017 in this study both precipitation and eto increased during 1997 2019 for mainland china as a whole leading to a slight increase of ai indicating a drier pattern after 1996 which might lead to an increase of agricultural water demand especially in ne and nc however increase in eto did not always result in a drier condition and the irrigation strategy can be different in subregions for example both nc and nw had high ai values indicating the drought condition of these subregions but ai for nc had an increasing trend after 1996 while ai for nw had a decreasing trend because the precipitation of nw increased more significantly than the increase of eto while that of nc was on the contrary indicating nw experienced a humidified climate while nc experienced a drier climate this suggests an adjustment of agricultural water supply that regulators could reduce the water supply in nw while increase water supply in nc and also indicating enormous challenges for agricultural water management in nc 4 conclusion the spatial and temporal changes in penman monteith eto were investigated from 1960 to 2019 in china and its seven subregions area averaged annual eto in china exhibited an upward downward upward trend with change points occurring in 1978 and 1996 a slight increase of 0 91 mm year2 during 1960 1978 a significant decrease p 0 05 of 2 36 mm year2 from 1979 to 1996 and a significant increase p 0 05 of 1 03 mm year2 were detected for the entire region studied two sets of climatic variables for an independent driver system tmean rs ea and ws and a dependent driver system tmean rn rh and ws were used to discuss the potential causes of variations in eto in both annual and seasonal scales the results show that the sensitivities of eto to tmean can be largely underestimated by 60 59 and 57 in 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively while the contributions of tmean were underestimated by 84 54 and 46 respectively during the periods of 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 at annual scale with the largest relative changes in ec at least 67 followed by sc the largest relative change of c tmean was found in autumn with c tmean being underestimated by at least 96 during the entire period and the largest relative change of c tmean was found in southeast of china with high temperatures therefore a dependent driver can raise large uncertainties when attributing changes of eto to climatic variables using the independent driver system tmean was found to be the most sensitive variable in seasons except for autumn during the entire study period in which eto was most sensitive to ea with the magnitude of s ea slightly larger than that of s tmean tmean rather than ws was the dominant factor covering the largest percentage 41 46 and 48 of grids during 1960 1978 1979 1996 and 1997 2019 respectively closely followed by ws 37 30 and 33 in regional scale change in tmean should be responsible for annual eto trends in subregions except for nw nc and sw during 1960 1978 which had a dominance in increased ws however the positive values of c tmean in ne and nw were offset by negative effect of tmean in other regions leading to the magnitude of c tmean much smaller than that of c ws during 1979 1996 in annual scale increases in air temperature was the largest contributing factor for the changes of eto in subregions except for nw sw and sc however the positive effects of tmean were offset by the negative effects of decreases in ws rs and an increase in ea consequently leading annual eto to decrease decreased ws the largest contributing factor only in nw and sw promoted the decrease in annual eto leading to ws the dominant factor for china as a whole resulting in the decrease of annual eto during 1979 1996 during 1997 2019 for entire country as a whole and subregions except for ne and nc which were dominated by decreased rs the major cause of increased annual eto was increased tmean our results highlight the effect of tmean in changing eto during the entire study area our results emphasized the importance of using independent climatic variables when attributing changes in eto temperature related radiation and humidity drivers can greatly influence the results of attribution and underestimate the impact of air temperature on trends in eto the independence of climatic drivers which has frequently been neglected previously should be considered in future research and a relatively independent driver system can help us understand the evolution of eto changes and the respective impact of climatic drivers

9717,increasing the capacity of plants to assimilate carbon source or to tap into the internal carbon reservoir sink has the potential of realizing high and stable yield under a more variable climate a three year field experiment was conducted to explore the source sink relationships of two maize zea mays l cultivars in response to various water and fertilizer inputs and evaluate the yield sustainability in northwest china there were two fertilization rates unfertilized f0 fertilized f1 two irrigation strategies rainfed rf supplemental drip irrigation di and two maize cultivars zd958 and ql14 the results showed that the newly released maize cultivar ql14 had higher leaf chlorophyll content at the silking and grain filling stages than the old one zd958 meanwhile ql14 had higher root dry matter at maturity than zd958 under dif1 the aboveground and root dry matter increased with the amount of water and fertilizer while the root shoot ratio decreased cultivar significantly affected the vegetative organ dry matter partitioning especially under severe drought at the silking stage ql14 had stronger root system and larger leaf dry matter than zd958 and was more drought resistant under serious water stressed conditions dry matter translocation dmt was crucial for grain yield formation under limited nutrients conditions and 55 of total dry matter at maturity was accumulated at the grain filling stage under adequate water and fertilizer conditions dif1 had higher sustainable yield index syi than rff1 there was no significant difference in grain yield between the two maize cultivars under dif1 but the average syi of ql14 0 94 was greater than that of zd958 0 89 the present study indicates that the newly released maize cultivar ql14 with stronger root system and stay green characteristics is beneficial for increasing drought resistance and keeping yield stable in the semi humid and drought prone region of northwest china keywords g e m source sink relationship supplemental irrigation leaf chlorophyll content sustainable yield index 1 introduction to meet the food demands of an increasing world population crop production as a main source for foods needs to be significantly increased kang et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2019 recently understanding the response of crop yield to alterations in assimilate availability has been a major advance in source sink relations borrás et al 2004 dordas 2009a venkateswarlu and visperas 1987 source strength for photoassimilates is dictated by both the net photosynthetic rate and the rate of photoassimilate remobilization from source tissues smith et al 2018 therefore increasing the capacity of plants to assimilate carbon source strength or to tap into the internal carbon reservoir sink strength has the potential of improving crop productivity in the field under a more variable climate smith et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 despite the importance and complex of such a source sink relation the mechanistic basis for this regulation is still poorly described smith et al 2018 source sink relations are influenced by genotypes environments and agronomic practices e g irrigation fertilization plant density and pest control but also by the capacity of plants to capture light use its energy to assimilate carbon and allocate this carbon into harvestable organs dai et al 2015 dordas and sioulas 2009b serrago et al 2013 shi et al 2013 to date the supplementation of resources such as water and nutrients is the basic crop management strategy to regulate plant growth and improve crop yield maize zea mays l is one of the most important cereals around the world which is primarily constrained by water and nutrient deficiency especially in arid and semi arid regions zheng et al 2018b fan et al 2021 water turns to be an important input and the most limiting factor for achieving high crop yields in the water scare regions el naggar et al 2019 yan et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the guanzhong plain is one of the areas in water resources shortage due to the uneven rainfall and high evaporation which is also an important maize producing area on the loess plateau of northwest china wang et al 2011 wu et al 2017 yan et al 2020a zheng et al 2018b maize production is always constrained by water storage during the vegetative period although most precipitation 65 occurred during the maize growing season bu et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 kang et al 2002 declared that the only way to sustain cereal production in semi arid regions was to efficiently use irrigation water and develop water saving strategies the loess plateau will become drier and warmer in the future liu et al 2017 and agricultural irrigation water resources depletion is becoming increasingly severe with the growing population and global climate change elliott et al 2014 drip irrigation is regarded as the most effective water saving technology for saving water and increasing crop yields which has been widely used for maize production around the world fan et al 2017 tian et al 2017 chilundo et al 2018 wang et al 2018a brar and vashist 2020 besides crop production is also constrained by nutrient deficiency in semi arid regions yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b chilundo et al 2018 fertilization alters the source sink relationships and affects dry matter accumulation as well as the translocation and its partitioning into the plant s various parts dordas and sioulas 2009b soil moisture and nutrient availability are the most important factors that affect the assimilate production and distribution and influence directly or indirectly the source sink relation and yield stability dordas 2009a yang et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to understand the relationships between dry matter accumulation partitioning translocation and grain yield of maize under various water and nutrient conditions in addition various genotypes also affect the source sink relations chen et al 2013 ning et al 2013 barraclough et al 2014 the greater dry matter yield of hybrids was mainly attributed to the greater dry matter accumulation rate at the grain filling stage rajcan and tollenaar 1999b the harvest index has largely remained constant while the increase in total dry matter accumulation attributed 85 to the genetic gain in total grain yield tollenaar 1989 various genotypes differ in their capacities to overcome environmental stresses and capture resources for growth and grain formation wang et al 2018b understanding genotype g management m environment e interactions is beneficial for selecting culitivars and suiting sustainable agricultrue magistrali et al 2020 munaro et al 2020 rotili et al 2020 therefore selecting suitable cultivar for sustainable maize production under various agronomic management strategies in the semi humid and drought prone regions is important grain filling the main phase of final yield formation is characterized by the transfer of assimilates and nutrient acclimation from vegetative plant tissues source to grains in the ear sink adjusting grain proportion is a crucial approach to improve yield based on genotype irrigation and fertilization practices changes in the partitioning of photosynthates in crop plants have been an important view of improving grain yield under adequate and limited water and nutrient conditions worku et al 2012 to better understand the dry matter dm accumulation partitioning and translocation in sustainable yielding maize is essential to realize high and stable yields under various water and fertilizer inputs

significant delay at the dough stage and physiological maturity were recorded under well irrigated condition compared with under water stress conditions brar and vashist 2020 according to our observations supplemental drip irrigation and fertilization extended the maize growth stage especially the grain filling stage additionally chlorophyll plays an important role in the absorption of light energy and is regards as a proxy for leaf photosynthetic capacity higher leaf chlorophyll content is more conducive to assimilating more carbohydrates croft et al 2017 hafeez et al 2019 liu et al 2020a this study showed that ql14 had higher leaf chlorophyll content at the silking and grain filling stages than zd958 meanwhile ql14 had higher root dry matter at maturity than zd958 fig 3 which was helpful for absorbing water and nutrients from deep soils and keeping higher photosynthetic capacity however rf significantly reduced leaf chlorophyll content at the reproductive growth stage in 2016 which may cause long term severe drought stress data not shown this is consistent with the finding of song et al 2019 who found that water stress could reduce leaf chlorophyll content stay green characteristics is a beneficial trait that may increase grain yield through the sustained photosynthetic competence during leaf senescence in cereal crops at the grain filling stage fu and lee 2008 this study showed that leaf chlorophyll content at silking and grain filling stages was positively related to grain yield r 2 0 63 and r 2 0 73 p 0 001 fig 6 leaf chlorophyll content at reproductive stage was more sensitive to final grain yield and functional stay green was an effective way to increase yield 4 2 source sink relationship of maize cultivars in response to various water and fertilizer strategies maize grains are formed after silking and about 50 of total dry matter in maize at maturity was accumulated at the grain filling stage rajcan and tollenaar 1999a ning et al 2013 dry matter partitioning depends on sink number and activity and grain number is strongly associated with assimilate availability at silking dordas and sioulas 2009b this study showed that leaf chlorophyll content at silking as a photosynthetic capacity index was positively related to post silking dry matter accumulation r 2 0 70 p 0 001 fig 6 and higher aboveground dry matter at silking was also beneficial to increasing grain yield r 2 0 81 p 0 001 besides the aboveground and root dry matter increased with increasing irrigation and fertilizer amounts while the root shoot ratio decreased and dry matter translocation dmt was negatively associated with root shoot ratio p 0 01 fig 6 similar results were also found by lambers 1983 and gonzalez et al 2019 when there is not enough available soil water for plant development the balance between sink and source strength is disrupted resulting in significant reduction in crop yield during water deficit harrison et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2019 longer high temperature and drought at the grain filling stage under rf in 2016 led to a sharp decline in the water absorption function of the root system and inactivation of vegetative organs which in turn caused a reduction in grain dry matter translocation and accumulation table s2 and significantly reduced grain yield fig 4 this finding is consistent with that of zhang et al 2017b 2019 who found that weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation affected dry matter accumulation and partitioning under rainfed conditions besides cultivar was the main factor influencing dry matter accumulation and partitioning chen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b this study also found that cultivars significantly affected vegetative organ partitioning the newly released cultivar ql14 had stronger root system fig 3 and larger leaf dry matter than zd958 table 3 which can resist serious water stress at the grain filling stage and maintain relatively high grain yield water stress is the most dominant factor causing the yield gap zou et al 2020 and drought impact on plant growth regulation dry matter accumulation and translocation is crucial for sustaining crop production comas et al 2019 grain yield is mainly composed of pre silking vegetative organ translocation and post silking dry matter accumulation dordas and sioulas 2009b liu et al 2020b zhang et al 2017b this study showed that post silking dry matter accumulation post dm was positively related to grain yield in the semi humid and drought prone region r 2 0 97 p 0 001 and dry matter translocation was relatively less important than post dm r 2 0 77 p 0 001 the reason might be that the local rainfall was mainly concentrated during the grain filling stage and water stress at the early stage and relatively sufficient soil moisture after silking promoted the assimilation of dry matter avramova et al 2015 molla et al 2019 also indicated that dmt was relatively less important in case of any drought episode at the pre anthesis or bracketing flowering stages besides the dry matter translocation efficiency dmte contribution of pre silking assimilates to total aboveground dry matter at maturity caadm contribution of pre silking assimilates to grain caag under f1 compared to those under unfertilized treatments decreased by 19 85 24 24 and 20 23 respectively while the harvest index increased by 4 76 dordas 2012 found that fertilization not only increased the dry matter partitioning in leaves stems seeds and head vegetative components at maturity but also increased n retranslocation from the vegetative parts of the plant to the seed nutrient deficiency mainly reduces the radiation use efficiency radiation interception and dry matter partitioning delays the vegetative phenological development and decreases grain yield and its components molla et al 2019 srivastava et al 2018 yan et al 2020b this indicates that dmt is crucial for grain yield formation of maize under limited nutrient conditions at the grain filling stage the chlorophyll content of leaves decreased obviously fig 2 meanwhile the photosynthetic efficiency reduced due to the lack of soil nutrient supply these results are in agreement with findings of molla et al 2019 who found that relatively higher dmt and dmte in plants not receiving nitrogen might be due to the failure of its leaves to meet the sink demand through current photo assimilation maize varieties with a greater contribution of pre anthesis dry matter to grain tended to produce lower yields molla et al 2019 the longer duration of reproductive growth stage resulted in longer duration of photosynthesis in new varieties and longer duration of post silking photosynthesis was beneficial for post silking nutrient uptake of the plant rajcan and tollenaar 1999a ning et al 2013 similarly this study concluded that zd958 had higher dmt and caadm than ql14 while the grain yield of ql14 was higher table 4 4 3 harvest index and grain yield stability of maize cultivars in response to various water and fertilizer strategies harvest index hi is an important and widely used agronomic indicator which reflects the relationship between yield and biomass as well as the reasonableness of farmland management strategies chen et al 2015 ding et al 2016 ran et al 2019 this study found that hi under dif1 was significantly higher than that in the other treatments table 4 hi had no significant difference between the two cultivars but ql14 had higher hi under the rainfed condition especially in 2016 moreover sustainable yield index syi is a quantitative measure to assess sustainability of any agricultural system or practice wanjari et al 2004 ghosh et al 2012 and higher syi means more secure production system which is beneficial to crop productivity this study showed that dif1 had higher syi than rff1 fig 5 and dif1 also had highest water use efficiency average 2 99 kg m 3 fig s2 than other treatments there was no significant difference in grain yield and water use efficiency between the two cultivars under dif1 but the average syi of ql14 0 94 was higher than that of zd958 0 89 and ql14 also had higher syi than zd958 under rainfed condition especially during rainfall scare season therefore the newly released cultivar with stronger root system and stay green characteristics is encouraged to increase drought resistance and keep yield stable in the semi humid and drought prone regions 5 conclusions both supplemental drip irrigation and fertilization extended the maize growth stage and increased leaf chlorophyll content especially at the grain filling stage as well as increased grain yield stability higher aboveground dry matter at silking was also beneficial to increasing grain yield relatively higher dry matter translocation efficiency in plants were obtained under limited nutrient conditions while increasing water and fertilizer supply significantly improved post silking dry matter accumulation the modern cultivar retained higher leaf chlorophyll content had larger root system kept leaves green for continued photosynthesis that allowed plants to increase kernel number and weight dif1 had the highest sustainable yield index syi there was no significant difference in grain yield between the two cultivars under dif1 but the average syi of ql14 0 94 was greater thus more attention should be paid to appropriate dry matter partitioning and keeping leaves green at silking as well as increasing post silking dry matter accumulation for agronomic

9717,increasing the capacity of plants to assimilate carbon source or to tap into the internal carbon reservoir sink has the potential of realizing high and stable yield under a more variable climate a three year field experiment was conducted to explore the source sink relationships of two maize zea mays l cultivars in response to various water and fertilizer inputs and evaluate the yield sustainability in northwest china there were two fertilization rates unfertilized f0 fertilized f1 two irrigation strategies rainfed rf supplemental drip irrigation di and two maize cultivars zd958 and ql14 the results showed that the newly released maize cultivar ql14 had higher leaf chlorophyll content at the silking and grain filling stages than the old one zd958 meanwhile ql14 had higher root dry matter at maturity than zd958 under dif1 the aboveground and root dry matter increased with the amount of water and fertilizer while the root shoot ratio decreased cultivar significantly affected the vegetative organ dry matter partitioning especially under severe drought at the silking stage ql14 had stronger root system and larger leaf dry matter than zd958 and was more drought resistant under serious water stressed conditions dry matter translocation dmt was crucial for grain yield formation under limited nutrients conditions and 55 of total dry matter at maturity was accumulated at the grain filling stage under adequate water and fertilizer conditions dif1 had higher sustainable yield index syi than rff1 there was no significant difference in grain yield between the two maize cultivars under dif1 but the average syi of ql14 0 94 was greater than that of zd958 0 89 the present study indicates that the newly released maize cultivar ql14 with stronger root system and stay green characteristics is beneficial for increasing drought resistance and keeping yield stable in the semi humid and drought prone region of northwest china keywords g e m source sink relationship supplemental irrigation leaf chlorophyll content sustainable yield index 1 introduction to meet the food demands of an increasing world population crop production as a main source for foods needs to be significantly increased kang et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2019 recently understanding the response of crop yield to alterations in assimilate availability has been a major advance in source sink relations borrás et al 2004 dordas 2009a venkateswarlu and visperas 1987 source strength for photoassimilates is dictated by both the net photosynthetic rate and the rate of photoassimilate remobilization from source tissues smith et al 2018 therefore increasing the capacity of plants to assimilate carbon source strength or to tap into the internal carbon reservoir sink strength has the potential of improving crop productivity in the field under a more variable climate smith et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 despite the importance and complex of such a source sink relation the mechanistic basis for this regulation is still poorly described smith et al 2018 source sink relations are influenced by genotypes environments and agronomic practices e g irrigation fertilization plant density and pest control but also by the capacity of plants to capture light use its energy to assimilate carbon and allocate this carbon into harvestable organs dai et al 2015 dordas and sioulas 2009b serrago et al 2013 shi et al 2013 to date the supplementation of resources such as water and nutrients is the basic crop management strategy to regulate plant growth and improve crop yield maize zea mays l is one of the most important cereals around the world which is primarily constrained by water and nutrient deficiency especially in arid and semi arid regions zheng et al 2018b fan et al 2021 water turns to be an important input and the most limiting factor for achieving high crop yields in the water scare regions el naggar et al 2019 yan et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the guanzhong plain is one of the areas in water resources shortage due to the uneven rainfall and high evaporation which is also an important maize producing area on the loess plateau of northwest china wang et al 2011 wu et al 2017 yan et al 2020a zheng et al 2018b maize production is always constrained by water storage during the vegetative period although most precipitation 65 occurred during the maize growing season bu et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 kang et al 2002 declared that the only way to sustain cereal production in semi arid regions was to efficiently use irrigation water and develop water saving strategies the loess plateau will become drier and warmer in the future liu et al 2017 and agricultural irrigation water resources depletion is becoming increasingly severe with the growing population and global climate change elliott et al 2014 drip irrigation is regarded as the most effective water saving technology for saving water and increasing crop yields which has been widely used for maize production around the world fan et al 2017 tian et al 2017 chilundo et al 2018 wang et al 2018a brar and vashist 2020 besides crop production is also constrained by nutrient deficiency in semi arid regions yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b chilundo et al 2018 fertilization alters the source sink relationships and affects dry matter accumulation as well as the translocation and its partitioning into the plant s various parts dordas and sioulas 2009b soil moisture and nutrient availability are the most important factors that affect the assimilate production and distribution and influence directly or indirectly the source sink relation and yield stability dordas 2009a yang et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to understand the relationships between dry matter accumulation partitioning translocation and grain yield of maize under various water and nutrient conditions in addition various genotypes also affect the source sink relations chen et al 2013 ning et al 2013 barraclough et al 2014 the greater dry matter yield of hybrids was mainly attributed to the greater dry matter accumulation rate at the grain filling stage rajcan and tollenaar 1999b the harvest index has largely remained constant while the increase in total dry matter accumulation attributed 85 to the genetic gain in total grain yield tollenaar 1989 various genotypes differ in their capacities to overcome environmental stresses and capture resources for growth and grain formation wang et al 2018b understanding genotype g management m environment e interactions is beneficial for selecting culitivars and suiting sustainable agricultrue magistrali et al 2020 munaro et al 2020 rotili et al 2020 therefore selecting suitable cultivar for sustainable maize production under various agronomic management strategies in the semi humid and drought prone regions is important grain filling the main phase of final yield formation is characterized by the transfer of assimilates and nutrient acclimation from vegetative plant tissues source to grains in the ear sink adjusting grain proportion is a crucial approach to improve yield based on genotype irrigation and fertilization practices changes in the partitioning of photosynthates in crop plants have been an important view of improving grain yield under adequate and limited water and nutrient conditions worku et al 2012 to better understand the dry matter dm accumulation partitioning and translocation in sustainable yielding maize is essential to realize high and stable yields under various water and fertilizer inputs

al 2020a this study showed that ql14 had higher leaf chlorophyll content at the silking and grain filling stages than zd958 meanwhile ql14 had higher root dry matter at maturity than zd958 fig 3 which was helpful for absorbing water and nutrients from deep soils and keeping higher photosynthetic capacity however rf significantly reduced leaf chlorophyll content at the reproductive growth stage in 2016 which may cause long term severe drought stress data not shown this is consistent with the finding of song et al 2019 who found that water stress could reduce leaf chlorophyll content stay green characteristics is a beneficial trait that may increase grain yield through the sustained photosynthetic competence during leaf senescence in cereal crops at the grain filling stage fu and lee 2008 this study showed that leaf chlorophyll content at silking and grain filling stages was positively related to grain yield r 2 0 63 and r 2 0 73 p 0 001 fig 6 leaf chlorophyll content at reproductive stage was more sensitive to final grain yield and functional stay green was an effective way to increase yield 4 2 source sink relationship of maize cultivars in response to various water and fertilizer strategies maize grains are formed after silking and about 50 of total dry matter in maize at maturity was accumulated at the grain filling stage rajcan and tollenaar 1999a ning et al 2013 dry matter partitioning depends on sink number and activity and grain number is strongly associated with assimilate availability at silking dordas and sioulas 2009b this study showed that leaf chlorophyll content at silking as a photosynthetic capacity index was positively related to post silking dry matter accumulation r 2 0 70 p 0 001 fig 6 and higher aboveground dry matter at silking was also beneficial to increasing grain yield r 2 0 81 p 0 001 besides the aboveground and root dry matter increased with increasing irrigation and fertilizer amounts while the root shoot ratio decreased and dry matter translocation dmt was negatively associated with root shoot ratio p 0 01 fig 6 similar results were also found by lambers 1983 and gonzalez et al 2019 when there is not enough available soil water for plant development the balance between sink and source strength is disrupted resulting in significant reduction in crop yield during water deficit harrison et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2019 longer high temperature and drought at the grain filling stage under rf in 2016 led to a sharp decline in the water absorption function of the root system and inactivation of vegetative organs which in turn caused a reduction in grain dry matter translocation and accumulation table s2 and significantly reduced grain yield fig 4 this finding is consistent with that of zhang et al 2017b 2019 who found that weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation affected dry matter accumulation and partitioning under rainfed conditions besides cultivar was the main factor influencing dry matter accumulation and partitioning chen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b this study also found that cultivars significantly affected vegetative organ partitioning the newly released cultivar ql14 had stronger root system fig 3 and larger leaf dry matter than zd958 table 3 which can resist serious water stress at the grain filling stage and maintain relatively high grain yield water stress is the most dominant factor causing the yield gap zou et al 2020 and drought impact on plant growth regulation dry matter accumulation and translocation is crucial for sustaining crop production comas et al 2019 grain yield is mainly composed of pre silking vegetative organ translocation and post silking dry matter accumulation dordas and sioulas 2009b liu et al 2020b zhang et al 2017b this study showed that post silking dry matter accumulation post dm was positively related to grain yield in the semi humid and drought prone region r 2 0 97 p 0 001 and dry matter translocation was relatively less important than post dm r 2 0 77 p 0 001 the reason might be that the local rainfall was mainly concentrated during the grain filling stage and water stress at the early stage and relatively sufficient soil moisture after silking promoted the assimilation of dry matter avramova et al 2015 molla et al 2019 also indicated that dmt was relatively less important in case of any drought episode at the pre anthesis or bracketing flowering stages besides the dry matter translocation efficiency dmte contribution of pre silking assimilates to total aboveground dry matter at maturity caadm contribution of pre silking assimilates to grain caag under f1 compared to those under unfertilized treatments decreased by 19 85 24 24 and 20 23 respectively while the harvest index increased by 4 76 dordas 2012 found that fertilization not only increased the dry matter partitioning in leaves stems seeds and head vegetative components at maturity but also increased n retranslocation from the vegetative parts of the plant to the seed nutrient deficiency mainly reduces the radiation use efficiency radiation interception and dry matter partitioning delays the vegetative phenological development and decreases grain yield and its components molla et al 2019 srivastava et al 2018 yan et al 2020b this indicates that dmt is crucial for grain yield formation of maize under limited nutrient conditions at the grain filling stage the chlorophyll content of leaves decreased obviously fig 2 meanwhile the photosynthetic efficiency reduced due to the lack of soil nutrient supply these results are in agreement with findings of molla et al 2019 who found that relatively higher dmt and dmte in plants not receiving nitrogen might be due to the failure of its leaves to meet the sink demand through current photo assimilation maize varieties with a greater contribution of pre anthesis dry matter to grain tended to produce lower yields molla et al 2019 the longer duration of reproductive growth stage resulted in longer duration of photosynthesis in new varieties and longer duration of post silking photosynthesis was beneficial for post silking nutrient uptake of the plant rajcan and tollenaar 1999a ning et al 2013 similarly this study concluded that zd958 had higher dmt and caadm than ql14 while the grain yield of ql14 was higher table 4 4 3 harvest index and grain yield stability of maize cultivars in response to various water and fertilizer strategies harvest index hi is an important and widely used agronomic indicator which reflects the relationship between yield and biomass as well as the reasonableness of farmland management strategies chen et al 2015 ding et al 2016 ran et al 2019 this study found that hi under dif1 was significantly higher than that in the other treatments table 4 hi had no significant difference between the two cultivars but ql14 had higher hi under the rainfed condition especially in 2016 moreover sustainable yield index syi is a quantitative measure to assess sustainability of any agricultural system or practice wanjari et al 2004 ghosh et al 2012 and higher syi means more secure production system which is beneficial to crop productivity this study showed that dif1 had higher syi than rff1 fig 5 and dif1 also had highest water use efficiency average 2 99 kg m 3 fig s2 than other treatments there was no significant difference in grain yield and water use efficiency between the two cultivars under dif1 but the average syi of ql14 0 94 was higher than that of zd958 0 89 and ql14 also had higher syi than zd958 under rainfed condition especially during rainfall scare season therefore the newly released cultivar with stronger root system and stay green characteristics is encouraged to increase drought resistance and keep yield stable in the semi humid and drought prone regions 5 conclusions both supplemental drip irrigation and fertilization extended the maize growth stage and increased leaf chlorophyll content especially at the grain filling stage as well as increased grain yield stability higher aboveground dry matter at silking was also beneficial to increasing grain yield relatively higher dry matter translocation efficiency in plants were obtained under limited nutrient conditions while increasing water and fertilizer supply significantly improved post silking dry matter accumulation the modern cultivar retained higher leaf chlorophyll content had larger root system kept leaves green for continued photosynthesis that allowed plants to increase kernel number and weight dif1 had the highest sustainable yield index syi there was no significant difference in grain yield between the two cultivars under dif1 but the average syi of ql14 0 94 was greater thus more attention should be paid to appropriate dry matter partitioning and keeping leaves green at silking as well as increasing post silking dry matter accumulation for agronomic

9718,in the past several decades the irrigation of high intensity cropping systems has caused serious groundwater depletion in the beijing tianjin hebei region optimizing the planting structure is a key method for mitigating groundwater decline however the optimal planting structure has not been confirmed and the effect of planting structures has not been quantified in groundwater overdraft areas in this study based on a model for planting structure optimization and the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm the water saving potential was estimated and the trade off between water resources and agricultural production was quantified the results showed the following 1 the current planting structure is a highly water consuming system the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system and vegetable and fruit cropping systems are the dominant contributors to crop water consumption accounting for 90 of the total water deficit 2 constrained by regional water resources it is difficult to achieve the objectives of halting groundwater decline and food self sufficiency simultaneously unless at least 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 water from the mid route of the south to north water transfer snwt project is used for agriculture or wheat imports account for more than 25 2 84 million ton yr 1 of the regional wheat demand 3 it is almost impossible to achieve a balance between groundwater exploitation and replenishment only by optimizing the planting structure without decreasing the agricultural output or without using external water when the planting structure is optimized to coordinate grain crops cash crops and water use at least 81 96 4 6 5 5 billion m3 yr 1 of the planned water from the snwt project will need to be used for agriculture 4 a viable option for restructuring planting should consider the regional self sufficiency for wheat a moderate surplus of vegetables fruits to boost farmers income and appropriate water transfer for groundwater sustainability the results provide a compromise between food and water in severe groundwater overdraft areas and serve as a quantitative reference for making decisions regarding agricultural and water resource policies graphical abstract ga1 the current planting structure is a highly water consuming system which leading to sever groundwater depletion in the beijing tianjin hebei bth region it is generally difficult to achieve groundwater neutrality by only optimizing the planting structure or by importing water from the snwt project if considering wheat self sufficiency or maintaining current agricultural production to achieve a good trade off between groundwater sustainability and agricultural production by optimizing the planting structure the minimum amount of water imported would need to be 1 billion m3 yr 1 in the future appropriate grain transfers or water diversions will be necessary to ensure the coordinated development of regional water use and grain supply in the bth region s1 present trend scenario s2 self sufficiency in agricultural products s3 maximum grain output under the constraints of water resources s4 coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs keywords evapotranspiration groundwater overdraft agricultural production cropping system water saving trade off between water and agriculture 1 introduction agricultural water use dominates the world s water withdrawal accounting for 70 of all water use siebert et al 2010 foley et al 2011 wada et al 2012 and is critical for global food safety with the expansion of cropland areas groundwater use has increased continuously providing more than 40 of irrigation water siebert et al 2010 over the past 50 years the world s irrigated farmland area has roughly doubled foley et al 2011 while global groundwater depletion has increased by more than two times in the past 40 years wada et al 2010 groundwater depletion actually occurs as the result of a trade off between water and agricultural products in the agricultural sector this is especially true in the plain area of the beijing tianjin hebei bth region located in the northern part of the north china plain groundwater depletion is severe and widespread in the north china plain wada et al 2010 2012 feng et al 2018 because of the long term pumping of groundwater for irrigation aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 the shallow groundwater level declined by approximately 38 m from the 1970 s to 2018 on the piedmont plain in the north china plain luo et al 2018 subsequently a series of environmental problems have occurred such as wetland atrophy river drying ground fissures ground subsidence and groundwater funnels moiwo et al 2010 yuan and shen 2013 saving water from agriculture may be the most effective way to alleviate or reverse this situation because of the large amount of water consumption in agriculture improving water use efficiency per unit area and downsizing the total irrigation area are effective measures for saving water based on the intensity and scale of water use respectively over decades of agricultural practice water use efficiency has been greatly improved by multiple water saving techniques for instance the water use efficiency of maize has increased by 73 in a piedmont plain study area over the past 40 years zhang et al 2021 however the groundwater level continues to decline as the irrigation area continues to increase with an increasing gross agricultural production owing to the rebound effect namely the more water saving the more water consumption berbel et al 2019 based on 20 cases from 14 countries the fao reported that after using water saving technologies the total water consumption by irrigation does not decrease but tends to increase at the regional scale which is mainly because saved water is used to expand the irrigation area berbel et al 2019 perry et al 2017 therefore improving water use efficiency can save water at the farmland scale but controlling the irrigation area is important for saving water at the regional scale grafton et al 2018 in the bth region the current planting area exceeds the carrying capacity of water resources and shallow aquifers on the piedmont plain of the study area may dry up in the next 80 years zhang et al 2016 therefore reducing the planting areas has become not only an effective way to achieve massive water savings at the regional scale but also an urgent task optimizing cropping systems is a common method for reducing the planting scale researchers have explored more sustainable cropping systems for groundwater sustainability based on field experiments crop models and remote sensing methods it was confirmed that reducing the planting intensity can help mitigate groundwater decline and winter wheat has been reported to be the main contributor to groundwater consumption yang et al 2006 sun et al 2006 gao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 2018 the cropping system of three harvests over two years has been suggested to be a better alternative cropping system for water savings than the current winter wheat summer maize double cropping system which could save 19 45 of the water each year with a grain yield loss of approximately 16 sun et al 2011 meng et al 2012 gao et al 2015 luo et al 2018 for the optimization of planting structures most studies have focused on maximizing the economic benefits of water use under the restrictions of regional water resources su et al 2014 tan et al 2017 hao et al 2018 liu and wang 2018 it was found that the optimal planting structure could increase economic benefits by 5 24 su et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 tan et al 2017 liu et al 2019 and could increase the scale of irrigated agriculture by 26 li et al 2020 these studies focused on the allocation of water resources and an increasing agricultural output by per unit water use which has typically leads to an increase in the area of planting economic crops such as fruits vegetables and cotton and indicated that the agricultural production could always be improved with a certain amount of water consumption su et al 2014 tan et al 2017 liu and wang 2018 liu et al 2019 despite these results substantial attention has been paid to water saving measures involving mainly a fallow measure during winter wheat season but other major crops with high water consumption have not been investigated in groundwater overdraft regions therefore the planting scale of high water consuming crops may increase after optimizing the planting structure furthermore the objectives for adjusting the planting structure always focus on the economic output of water use not on water savings few studies have focused on reducing the total groundwater use and quantifying the trade off between water use and agricultural production by optimizing planting structures especially those constrained by regional water resources and the future food demand based on energy requirements of residents in this study the water resource bearing capacity and food requirements were estimated under the scenario of future population changes based on the model for planting structure optimization and the elitist version of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the water saving potential was simulated and the trade off between water resources and agricultural production was quantified under different optimal planting structure scenarios the objectives were to 1 identify the optimal planting structure and its effect on water use water savings and groundwater consumption under the conditions of natural evolution regional water resources groundwater conservation and food self sufficiency or coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs in the bth region a serious groundwater depletion area 2 evaluate the sustainability of agricultural water use with respect to the available water resources regional water resources water resources imported from water transfer projects in different scenarios based on a constructed sustainability assessment framework in the study area and 3 explore methods for the sustainable reorientation of planting structure corresponding to an appropriate trade off between water resources and crop production in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bth region 36 03 42 40 n 113 27 119 50 e has a total area of 21 7 104 km2 and includes the beijing and tianjin municipalities and hebei province fig 1 the coordinated development of beijing tianjin and hebei is currently an important development strategy in china beijing and tianjin have limited farmland while hebei province is a typical agricultural region in china the plain area of the bth region located in the northern part of the north china plain is the dominant area for agricultural production and groundwater depletion accounting for 44 of the total area and approximately 90 of the total grain production in the bth region in this study the plain region was considered to be the production area while the boundary of food supply demand for residents included the entire bth region climatic conditions are suitable for farming purposes precipitation often occurs from june to august with an annual average value of 540 mm 1958 2017 song et al 2019 it is always less than the water requirement of 688 740 mm for the dominant cropping system of winter wheat summer maize in the bth region luo et al 2018 drought often occurs during the winter wheat season and groundwater irrigation is necessary for grain production wheat is the dominant food crop in the bth region in recent decades the sown area of coarse cereals has decreased while that of vegetables and fruits has increased the dominant planting pattern of is the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize followed by the fruit and vegetable cropping systems each system requires 3 5 irrigation events during the crop growth period and more irrigation times are implemented if water saving irrigation methods are adopted wheat maize vegetables and fruits are the four dominant crops accounting for 83 of the total planting area of crops followed by cotton groundnut and millet the production of winter wheat summer maize vegetables and fruit has increased greatly over time at a relative increase of 16 17 1949 2015 11 and 21 fold 1971 2015 respectively fig 2b the farming method changed gradually from rain fed agriculture before the 1970 s to irrigated agriculture currently the total sown area of crops is 10 17 million hm2 and the grain output is 36 million tons yr 1 of which wheat and maize production account for 92 of the total grain produced vegetable and fruit production are 86 million tons yr 1 and 21 million tons yr 1 respectively accounting for 8 6 and 11 9 of the national total respectively and 3 3 and 7 5 of the global total respectively the total economic value the main crop outputs is 239 9 billion rmb and the ecological benefit is 32 8 billion rmb 2011 2015 2 2 data the regional water resources water supply and agricultural water supply data were obtained from the national bureau of statistics 2004 2015 crop cost benefit and price data used to calculate the economic benefit of the planting structure were obtained from the hebei rural statistical yearbook 2011 2015 and the compilation of cost and benefit of agricultural products in china 2011 2015 the crop yields sown areas population data and per capita food consumption data were mainly obtained from the hebei rural statistical yearbook 2003 2015 the beijing statistical yearbook 2003 2015 and the tianjin statistical yearbook 2003 2015 population data were mainly from beijing 60 years tianjin 60 years hebei 60 years and glorious history 30 years since the reform and opening up of tianjin meteorological data were used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration of crops these data were obtained from the chinese meteorological data sharing service system and include sunshine duration maximal and minimal temperatures relative humidity wind speed and precipitation at 21 stations from 2000 to2017 agricultural meteorological data were used to determine the stages during the crop growing periods which were also obtained from the chinese meteorological data website the recommended amount of energy intake was taken from the reference dietary intake of nutrients in chinese residents compiled by the chinese society of nutrition the energy content of the dominant food was based on data from the fao and chinese food composition table 2017 there was a tendency for variations and annual fluctuations in meteorological data sowing area and crop yields we used a five year average value 2011 2015 for the sowing area and crop yields which have lower annual fluctuations and greater tendency variations but five years was too short for the meteorological data which have substantial annual fluctuations and low tendency variations therefore we selected a longer time series 2000 2017 to calculate the meteorological data the caliber of surveys regarding food requirements for urban and rural residents was different before 2012 surveys were unified in 2012 and the data became stable in 2013 in the hebei economic statistical yearbook therefore the food requirements of residents were estimated from the average value from 2013 to 2016 we estimated the area of the double cropping system based on the wheat area from the statistical material because more than 99 of wheat in the bth region is winter wheat and most of the winter wheat planting area is planted with summer maize according to the practices of the local farmers xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 2 3 methods based on a multi objective optimization model and a fast elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm method this study aims to optimize the crop planting structure for agriculture and water sustainability in the bth region we assumed that the crop yield water saving technology water use efficiency and etc would all be stable in the future whereas the food consumption of the residents was estimated by predicting the future population urbanization rate and per capita food consumption of urban and rural residents the estimated food consumption based on a scenario of high population growth and food self sufficiency in the entire region should be greater than the actual needs because the study area includes the capital city beijing and a large municipal city tianjin of china where most food is supplied from external areas even from abroad therefore residents food consumption will be met the irrigation water demand was roughly calculated from the annual average water deficit of the planting system which was estimated from the annual average differences between the crop water requirements etc mm for a cropping systems and precipitation p mm in a year in this study the optimized planting structure was a generalization situation and anomalous variations were not considered for example some statistics may change based on new survey results and population data may vary depending on new fertility policies we also did not consider the effect of water saving technologies in agriculture 2 3 1 crop water use the irrigation water demand w i was estimated by the annual average water deficit of the planting system which was estimated by the annual average diﬀerences between the etc mm of a cropping system and the p mm in a year the equation is 1 wi etc p where w i mm is the irrigation water demand water deficit of crop i et c mm is the average evapotranspiration of a cropping system including the value during the crop growing period and the fallow period and p mm is the annual average precipitation et c mm was calculated using reference crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients allen et al 1998 the equation is 2 etc et0 kc where et 0 mm is the reference crop evapotranspiration and k c is the crop coefficient because of the fluctuating characteristics of meteorological elements the average values from 2000 to 2017 were used to estimate the crop water demand and water deficit to eliminate the influence of fluctuations in meteorological factors on crop water demand and water deficit 1 reference crop evapotranspiration et0 the reference evapotranspiration was estimated by using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 3 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 μ 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 μ 2 where r n mj m 2 d 1 is the surface net radiation g mj m 2 d 1 is the soil heat flux density t is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 m height u 2 m s 1 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m e s kpa is the saturation vapor pressure e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure δ kpa 1 is the slope vapor pressure curve and γ kpa 1 is a psychrometric constant allen et al 1998 2 crop coefficient kc kc is the ratio of crop evapotranspiration etc to reference evapotranspiration et0 without water salinity fertilization crop competition disease or other stresses in this study the kc of the crop growing period was derived from the irrigation water quota of the main crop in northern china duan 2004 which was calculated based on the experimental data of relevant stations using the standard algorithm recommended in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 crop growing stages were defined using data from the agricultural meteorological stations a simplified treatment was performed for vegetables to estimate the water consumption during the growth period because of their diversity and complexity that is instead of analyzing a specific type of vegetable all vegetables were regarded as a special crop with vigorous growth all year round except during the overwintering period duan et al 2004 the kc of vegetables was obtained from fao cropwat due to the lack of vegetable data in duan et al 2004 during the fallow period kc was calculated using the kc value of a crop during its sowing date 2 3 2 food supply and requirement 1 current food supply and requirement the food surplus was estimated based on the food supply and demand the formula is 4 q sc ni 5 ni ki rui pu rri pr where q kg is the food surplus s c kg is the food supply and n i kg is the food requirement of crop i r ui kg per capita and r ri kg per capita are the requirements of food i for urban and rural residents respectively p u person and p r person are the population numbers of urban and rural residents respectively and k i isthe coeﬃcient of food requirement where k i 1 the food requirements mainly included the food consumption of residents the loss of agricultural products after harvest and the grain for seeds the data for food consumption per capita from the statistical year books do not include food consumption from eating out and in this study we used 20 and 10 of the total food consumption for urban and rural residents respectively li 2005 ma et al 2005 2006 dong et al 2008 hu 2016 the postharvest loss rate of agricultural products was estimated based on data from thoughts on the development of china s agricultural processing industry published on the official website of the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china the values are 7 11 15 20 15 20 and 20 25 for grains potatoes fruits and vegetables respectively zong 2014 the median values were used in this study grain for seed was mainly considered for wheat which accounted for approximately 2 of the output in the study area the grain volume of seeds is small for the other crops and can be neglected in this study 2 prediction of food requirement in the 2030 s the future food requirements were estimated by predicting the future population urbanization rate and per capita food consumption of urban and rural residents based on formula 5 per capita food consumption was estimated by the recommended energy intake amount food energy content and consumption structure in this study to simplify the calculation the regional average yield in the past five years at the current level of agricultural technologies was used and the promotion of agro technologies was not considered such that the current yield level was only used to simulate and evaluate the effects of water saving or balancing by optimizing the planting structure in addition the feed requirements for meat eggs and milk were calculated by the ratio of feed to meat xin et al 2015 the feed consumption was mainly calculated using corn in this study current coefficients were used for food consumption from eating out the loss of agricultural products after harvest and the grain for seed i prediction of population and urbanization rate in this study we used a population of 127 million in 2030 which was estimated by logistic growth model 126 million and also considered another 1 million people under the national development strategy of building the xiongan new area luo 2019 this is similar to the results reported by zhai 2007 they found a population peak of 126 million in approximately 2027 in bth region and also similar to the population value of 122 million in 2030 estimated by guo et al 2020 and 128 5 million in 2030 based on hebei urban system planning 2016 2030 tianjin urban master plan 2015 2030 draft for review and beijing urban master plan 2016 2035 department of housing urban rural development hebei 2017 tianjin municipal bureau of planning and natural resources 2016 the people s government of beijing municipality 2017 the urbanization rate of the bth region was 70 80 and was calculated to be 75 in 2030 li 2014 ii prediction of food requirement per capita assuming that people s diets tend to be healthy and balanced with the development of society and the economy and that the energy consumption structure is stable for both urban and rural residents the food requirement per capita was estimated by the recommended energy intake amount food energy content and consumption structure 6 r i r foodi e rec e total r foodi e rec i 1 m r foodi e foodi where r i kg yr 1 per capita and r foodi kg yr 1 per capita are the food requirement per capita of food i in the future and at present respectively e rec kcal yr 1 per capita and e total kcal yr 1 per capita are the recommended energy intake amount per capita and the total energy intake amount at present per capita respectively e foodi kcal kg 1 is the energy content of food i and m is the number of types of food the data for the recommended energy intake were from the reference intake of dietary nutrients in chinese residents compiled by the chinese nutrition society which was estimated on the basis of the value for moderate labor except at ages between 14 and 64 years which are working ages and were divided into two parts light manual labor and heavy manual labor based on the gender labor structure age structure and urban rural population structure the average recommended energy intake of the residents in the bth region was estimated the energy content of the dominant food was based on data from the fao and the chinese food composition table 2017 the consumption structure of the residents was the average value 2013 2016 from the statistical yearbooks all these factors were estimated based on the data from urban and rural residents 2 3 3 crop planting structure scenarios groundwater depletion and subsequent environmental problems are the most serious problems during agricultural production in the bth region therefore balancing the development of water resources and agricultural production is an emerging concern in this study four planting structure scenarios were simulated to estimate the threshold of water and grain relationships in terms of land use water use and economic and ecological benefits 1 present trend scenario s1 this scenario assumes that the planting structure of crops will be optimized and evolve automatically according to current trends without being affected by a macro control and management policies the planting structure was predicted based on the present trend in the crop planting scale after optimization the total economic output values of farmland will improved and change slightly table 1 2 self sufficiency in main agricultural products s2 in this scenario the planting structure of crops depends on the needs defined by self sufficiency in the main agricultural products in the bth area excluding rice rice cannot adapt to local natural conditions widely and presents a self sufficiency of 17 therefore the self sufficiency of rice in 2030 is not practical and is not considered in this scenario the total planting area and total water consumption of crops is reduced greatly so that proper fallow can be introduced to save water this scenario involves a planting structure with the greatest water savings if the self sufficiency of the main crops can be achieved in the region the economic output value of farmland would decrease and the ecological output value would increase table 1 3 maximum grain output under water resource constraints s3 in this scenario the planting structure of crops is aimed at the maximum grain output scale which can be supported by the regional water resources not including external water from the mid route of the south to north water transfer snwt project to achieve a balance between groundwater exploitation and replenishment the scale of other high water consumption crops e g vegetables fruits and potatoes is constrained by the area s self sufficiency in these crops the total planting area and total water consumption of crops are largely reduced so appropriate fallowing can be carried out the total water consumption decreases to the amount that can be supported by regional water resources the economic output value of farmland is reduced and the value of ecological output increases 4 coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs s4 in this scenario the optimized planting structure is constrained by the planting scale needed to ensure grain self sufficiency total requirement of wheat and rice where the rice deficit is converted into wheat while maximizing the economic output the total planting area is less than that at present the total water consumption is reduced while external water may be necessary for the coordination of grain crops cash crops and groundwater sustainability 2 3 4 optimizing model of planting structure the planting structure was optimized mainly for scenario2 to scenario4 table 1 the planting structure was predicted by the present trend of the crop planting scale under scenario1 which will evolve based on the current development trend table 1 1 objective function reducing water use is the most important objective for the sustainable use of groundwater and economic and ecological benefits are desired as much as possible the objective functions of the optimization model are multiple objectives including the minimum water use maximum economic benefit and maximum ecological benefit the three objectives were formulated as follows a minimal total water

in this study the sowing areas of different crops xi were obtained from the national statistical yearbooks of china and the annual average data for 2011 2015 were used as the present situation the water deficit for different crops wi was calculated using the annual average 2000 2017 differences between the etc mm of cropping system i and p mm in a year 2 constraints imposing constraint conditions is necessary to solve optimization problems in this study different constraints were used for different scenarios with three primary aspects of constraints for the objectives the crop sown area crop water use and water resources and food supply and requirements the optimal principle of the planting structures mainly aimed at restricting the planting scale of high water consuming crops and giving priority to crops with low water consumption and high benefits the sum of crop sown area should not be greater than the current total planting area the sown area of high water consuming crops after optimization should be less than that at present 10 i 1 m x i s 11 x ih s ihnow where s hm2 is the total area of the main crops and xih hm2 and sihnow hm2 are the planting areas after optimization and at present for the high water consuming crops respectively which mainly include winter wheat rice vegetables fruit and cotton and xi and m are the same as above the total amount of water used should be less than the regional water resources the amount of water saved should be greater than a preset value under certain optimal planting scenarios 12 wuse wres where wuse m3 and wres m3 are the total irrigation water requirements of all cropping systems at present and after optimization respectively the irrigation water requirement was estimated based on the water deficit of each cropping system the planting area of highly water consuming crops such as wheat vegetables and fruit should be restricted by the food requirement kg because the food supply was much greater than the food requirement for these crops in the study area the grain ration should meet a 90 self sufficiency rate for the coordination of food water and benefit scenarios 13 n ilow y i x i n ihigh 14 i 1 g y i x i 0 9 i 1 g n i 15 ni ppop ni where nilow kg and nihigh kg are the upper and lower boundaries of food supply respectively which are determined by considering the food requirement and crop water consumption ni kg is the food requirement of crop i g is the number of grain ration crops ppop is the population and ni kg per capita is the per capita food requirement of crop i and yi and xi are the same as above the main characteristic of senario2 is self sufficiency in the main agricultural products while that for senario3 is the maximum wheat scale under the constraints of self sufficiency in the main crops with high water consumption except for wheat that for senario4 is to satisfy the total grain wheat and rice the insufficient rice was converted according to wheat demand and to maximize the cash crops such as vegetables and fruits 2 3 5 genetic algorithms genetic algorithms are random search and optimization algorithms based on darwin s theory of evolution and mandel s theory of genetics proposed by professor holland in america a fast elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is one of the most popular pareto dominances based on multi objective evolutionary algorithms li and zhang 2009 with the properties of a fast non dominated sorting procedure an elitist approach and a parameter less sharing approach deb et al 2000 it has the characteristics of simplicity generality global parallelism and strong anti interference in this study there were three objectives and three main constraint conditions 3 results 3 1 food supply demand 3 1 1 current status of food supply demand food self sufficiency is an important basis for agricultural production especially in areas with depleted groundwater food surplus is widespread for many agricultural products in the bth region fig 3 shows that the food demand for grain rations was the greatest followed by that for vegetables and fruits the surpluses of fruits vegetables eggs milk and aquatic products account for more than 50 of the food supply the grain surplus was 3 12 million tons 9 of the grain supply when considering the grain demand for food and livestock feed mainly estimated as maize among the four dominant crops the surpluses of wheat maize considering the grain demand for both food and livestock feed vegetables and fruit were 21 19 83 and 75 of the supply respectively fig 3 thus much of the agricultural output serves areas outside the region and a large amount of water is exported to other areas with the export of agricultural products 3 1 2 future food supply demand in the 2030 s the per capita food demand was estimated by using the energy consumption structure the energy content of crops and the recommended energy intake amounts of residents of different ages genders and labor intensities overall the per capita food demand should decrease for a healthy and balanced diet the per capita energy intake amount in the bth region in the 2030 s is predicted to be 2165 and 2017 kcal capita 1 day 1 for urban and rural residents respectively which is 10 and 13 lower respectively than those at present the population will be 127 million luo 2019 and the urbanization rate will increase to 0 75 in 2030 li 2014 with urban and rural populations of 95 25 million and 31 75 million respectively in the bth region overall the food supply will be greater than the food demand in the 2030 s with population growth urbanization rate increase and energy intake reduction food demand is not likely to change too much relative to the current status the surpluses of wheat vegetables and fruits will be 22 82 and 73 respectively and those of meat egg and milk will be 37 58 of the food supply in the bth region fig 4 therefore from the perspective of food supply and demand overproduction is common in the bth region both at present and in the 2030 s this does not correspond very well with the severe groundwater depletion 3 2 agricultural water use 3 2 1 water requirements and deficits of cropping systems the irrigation water requirement was estimated based on the water deficit of the cropping systems negative values indicate a water surplus during the entire year for the cropping system which was not considered when estimating the total irrigation water requirement on an annual basis water requirements and consumption are essential for sustainable development with regard to water resource availability the growing season and fallow period should be considered for the annual water requirements of a cropping system for the vegetable cropping system fruit cropping system winter wheat summer maize double cropping system and rice cotton potato and groundnut single cropping systems the average water requirements were high 855 702 797 830 644 627 and 567 mm yr 1 respectively each of which was more than the annual average precipitation amount of 542 mm table 2 the average water deficits for these crops are high at 313 160 255 288 102 85 and 25 mm yr 1 respectively 2000 2017 therefore there is a substantial water deficit in the agricultural sector that is met by irrigation from groundwater extraction 3 2 2 water consumption of the current planting structure the current planting structure is a high water consuming system with a water deficit of 12 3 billion m3 yr 1 and a crop planting area of 10 17 million hectares for the main crops in the study area the water deficit for the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was the greatest with a value of 6 4 billion m3 yr 1 followed by those for the vegetable cropping system and fruit cropping system with values of 2 8 billion m3 yr 1 and 1 9 billion m3 yr 1 respectively table 2 these three cropping systems were the dominant water deficit cropping systems accounting for 90 of the total water deficit of the current planting structure in the bth region wheat vegetables and fruit are the dominant crops with high water consumption in the study area 3 3 optimizing the planting structure for tradeoffs between agriculture outputs and groundwater use in the current development trend scenario the planting scale is based on the current trends of each crop for the other three scenarios the optimized model of the planting structure is solved based on nsga ii fig 5 shows the optimized scale of the planting structure under s2 s3 and s4 most of the crops with high water consumption have a relatively small range of solutions and the total planting scale is 7 24 7 77 million hm2 under self sufficiency for the main agricultural products scenario s2 the solutions will require 1 46 1 49 million hm2 and 3 42 4 12 million hm2 for wheat and maize respectively under s3 the scales for vegetables and fruits have a relatively small range of solutions for self sufficiency constraints and the total planting scale is 6 90 7 79 million hm2 in s3 the planting scale range is 2 32 2 33 3 57 4 12 1 09 1 36 and 0 93 0 97 million hm2 for wheat maize vegetables and fruits respectively and the total planting scale is 9 08 10 01 million hm2 in s4 3 3 1 present trend scenario s1 in the current development trend scenario the total planting area of crops decreased by 2 compared to the current scale the relative decreases in wheat and fruit acreage were 11 and 3 respectively and the relative increases in maize and vegetable acreage were 20 and 11 respectively the total water deficit of cropping systems was 11 3 billion m3 yr 1 and the water saving amount was 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 or 8 of the irrigation water requirement at present mainly because of a scale reduction in wheat followed by that in cotton and fruits table 3 the total grain output increased by approximately 5 with a wheat self sufficiency rate of 1 1 and a small change in economic benefits the ecological benefits improved and irrigation water requirements decreased in farmlands this scenario is good for improving the groundwater overdraft problem however because of the small amount of water saved it is difficult to change the situation of groundwater overexploitation in the bth region 3 3 2 self sufficiency of agricultural products scenario s2 the self sufficiency of grain rations is an important basis for formulating agricultural policies in this scenario the total sown area of crops decreased by 24 29 compared to the status quo the sown scale of wheat vegetables and fruit will decrease by 22 82 and 73 respectively the total grain output will decrease by approximately 11 with reduced economic benefits and increased ecological benefits the total water saving for the cropping systems was 5 4 5 8 billion m3 yr 1 or 44 47 in this scenario relative to the current planting structure the winter wheat summer maize cropping system vegetable cropping system and fruit cropping system saved 5 1 billion m3 of water per year table 3 this is the maximum potential for water savings if the self sufficiency of grain is taken into consideration in the bth region according to the national data on water resources and water use the regional water overexploitation is 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 not including the water imported from the snwt project therefore it is difficult to solve the problem of groundwater depletion by optimizing the planting structure while also ensuring the self sufficiency of crops that have a high water consumption approximately 1 billion m3 yr 1 of external water is required to stop groundwater decline in this study the irrigation water demand was roughly expressed by the perennial average water deficit of the cropping system the present values for the sown area and water deficit in the table were calculated from the average data in 2011 2015 and 2000 2017 respectively the negative data indicate a water surplus during the entire year for the cropping system which was not considered when estimating the total irrigation water requirement 3 3 3 maximum grain output under the constraints of regional water resources s3 under this scenario the total sown area of crops decreased by 23 32 relative to the present structure vegetable fruit and potato production were self sufficient and decreased the maximum amount of water to ensure that the water demands of wheat were met then the maximum wheat planting area supported by the regional water resources was 1 46 1 49 million hm2 equivalent to 58 59 of the current wheat area and less than the wheat area required for self sufficiency 78 of the status quo i e groundwater overdraft is inevitable to achieve the self sufficiency of wheat under the constraint of regional water resources not including external water from water transfer project table 3 in this scenario the self sufficiency rate of wheat was 74 76 the total grain output decreased by approximately 13 the economic benefits decreased and the ecological benefits improved the total amount of water savings was 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 or 54 relative to the current irrigation water requirement among which wheat vegetables and fruit contributed 95 table 3 water use was constrained within the regional water resources and the groundwater was balanced between exploitation and supply therefore this is beneficial to the agroecosystem and water environment 3 3 4 coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs scenario s4 considering the coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs the planting structure was similar to the current status quo with a 2 11 reduction in the total planting area wheat rice vegetables and fruits roughly maintained a scale similar to the current planting structure the water saving amount in s4 was 1 2 2 1 billion m3 yr 1 or 10 17 relative to the irrigation water requirement at present which is much less than the overexploitation of 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 therefore 4 6 5 5 billion m3 yr 1 of other water sources were still required for a balanced groundwater budget equivalent to 81 96 of the imported water from the snwt project this result indicates that the current planting structure is relatively reasonable without considering water limitations 4 discussion 4 1 sustainability of agricultural water use under present and optimal planting structures water sustainability depends on the equilibrium relationship between water use and water resources fig 6 shows three sustainable critical lines for water use in the bth region according to the ideas of red line for water use and water management lines i and ii are critical lines for balancing the total water overdraft of 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 including the water overdraft caused by agriculture industry living etc and the agricultural overdraft of 4 4 billion m3 yr 1 caused by agricultural water use respectively when considering the regional water resources in the bth region only excluding the water imported from the snwt project line iii is the boundary to balance the total overdraft amount considering both the water resources from the regional water resources and from the snwt project in the bth region fig 6 water resources would be sustainable if a distribution point of water use is located within less than the critical line value otherwise the water use would be true unsustainable 4 1 1 current sustainability of agricultural water use current agricultural water use is generally unsustainable in the bth region in the past 17 years the total sown area of crops has been relatively stable at 10 2 million hm2 while the total irrigation water consumption varies greatly owing to the various rainfall types in 2012 agricultural water use was sustainable due to the high regional water resources accompanied by substantial precipitation 774 mm in contrast agricultural water use was unsustainable in an extremely dry year in 2002 with a low precipitation of 359 mm fig 6a agricultural water use was unsustainable in most years 2000 2016 and the annual average agricultural water use was greater than the value of critical line iii fig 6a indicating that the current planting structure was unsustainable despite the planned input of water from the snwt project the planned amount was 5 7 billion m3 yr 1 this result was confirmed by the continuous depletion of groundwater in the study area shen et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 2011 feng et al 2013 2018 4 1 2 sustainability of agricultural water use under optimal planting structure scenarios the sustainability of agricultural water use improved under optimal planting structure scenarios relative to the current status fig 6 according to the present trend of planting structure s1 agricultural water use is developing toward more sustainable water use however it is still close to unsustainable even considering the use of 100 of the planned water from the snwt project in the 2030 s fig 6b under the coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs scenario s4 the sustainability of agricultural water use is similar to the status quo and s1 fig 6b indicating that the current planting structure could potentially balance food production and economic benefits if water consumption is unrestricted instead if water use is restricted some grain or economic output losses are inevitable in total s1 and s4 have low sustainability for agricultural water use there is a water requirement of more than 100 and 81 of the planned water from the snwt project to achieve a balanced groundwater budget of the total water overdraft amount under s1 and s4 respectively according to the self sufficiency of the agricultural products scenario s2 and the maximum grain output supported by the regional water resources s3 a high sustainability of agricultural water use is observed fig 6b shows that the water overdraft amount caused by agriculture is balanced but not the total water overdraft amount in s2 it is necessary to use approximately 18 of the water budget from the snwt project to achieve a balance of the total water overdraft amount in s2 in the bth region s3 can balance the agricultural water overdraft amount and the total water overdraft amount without using external water sources and allows sustainable groundwater use in the bth region fig 6b while the wheat self sufficiency is only 75 under the strategy of deciding production by water i e the wheat production is 59 of the status quo this result is confirmed by the results reported by zhang and ren 2021 they found that to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown and to improve water and energy productivities by wheat fallow rotations the minimum reduction in the annual average winter wheat yield would be 55 relative to the status quo on the piedmont plain in the bth region therefore it is difficult to stop groundwater decline by only optimizing the planting structure or importing water from the snwt project considering wheat self sufficiency or maintaining the previous status of agricultural production fig 6a b based on the apsim model van oort et al 2016 also found that the snwt project can relieve groundwater depletion but can not stop the groundwater decline at xinji station located in the bth region therefore even when optimizing the planting structure external water transfer is important for groundwater sustainability if the planned amount of water from the snwt project is fully used for agriculture a groundwater balance between exploitation and replenishment can be achieved under all optimal planting structure scenarios otherwise scenarios 2 and 3 are good alternatives to the current structure when the trade off between groundwater sustainability and food consumption is considered 4 2 effect on water use output and ecological benefit for each scenario the sustainable development of agriculture involves the sustainability of land agricultural production ecological environment farmer income etc the total planting area of crops can decrease by 24 282 million hm2 or 2 28 under different scenarios for optimal planting structure compared to the current status table 4 reducing the planting area is beneficial for fertilizing the soil in the fallow period and improving the subsequent soil production capacity which is beneficial not only to the sustainability of agricultural land but also to the chinese strategy of storing food in farmland reducing the water consumption of grain crops is accompanied by a loss in agricultural production grain production shows a relative change from 13 5 under different optimal planting structure scenarios relative to the status quo table 4 however the lowest grain production scenario meets approximately 90 of the predicted grain demand of the residents in the future and can have a small impact on the grain supply in the region for wheat the main grain in the study area the self sufficiency rate is 75 under the constraints of regional water resources not including external water from water transfer project therefore it is necessary to obtain wheat or water from external areas to meet the grain demand and balance the groundwater budget in the bth region for vegetables and fruits self sufficiency is satisfied in all scenarios owing to their high surplus scenario 1 present trend scenario scenario 2 self sufficiency of agricultural products scenario 3 maximum grain output under the constraints of water resources scenario 4 coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs the water deficit was roughly expressed by the perennial average water deficit of the cropping system the economic benefit declines owing to a reduction in the scale of cash crops e g vegetables and fruits and the decrease in the total sown area while the regional environmental quality and ecological benefit improve by reducing the planting scale of high water consuming crops ju et al 2009 meng et al 2012 pei et al 2015 van oort et al 2016 the ecological benefit of farmland increases by approximately 1 5 times under different optimal planting structure scenarios compared to the status quo which is similar or greater than the decrement in economic benefits table 4 furthermore if saved water is used in other sectors of production and life a higher economic benefit can be obtained based on the results of zhang and guo 2016 an economic of 90 2 93 1 rmb m 3 is expected if the water saved in agriculture is transferred to be used in the secondary and tertiary industries thus the water saving amount of 1 0 6 7 billion m3 in this study can increase the economic benefits by 90 2 623 7 billion rmb equivalent to 38 260 of the total economic benefit of the current cropping system and more than the direct economic loss under any scenario therefore the direct economic output declines while the potential benefits e g ecological benefit increase significantly under the optimal planting structure scenarios regarding farmers income although the total economic benefit of farmland decreases the government grants farmers a subsidy of 7500 rmb hm 2 yr 1 for following the wheat fallow rotation which is equivalent to the farmers income in a harvest year furthermore the water rights trading market has improved and saved water can lead to economic benefits through water rights transactions therefore farmers income can be ensured in the near future while in the long run subsidy policies may be uncertain with the continuous improvement in urbanization level most young and middle aged people are very unwilling to do traditional farm work thus land circulation large scale production and high quality outputs should be considered to improve agricultural benefits in the long term 4 3 planting structure options under the constraint of regional water resources it is difficult to achieve the goal of balancing groundwater budget and food mainly wheat self sufficiency according to the current development trend s1 and coordinating food benefits and water s4 the planting structure will be better optimized than it is currently wheat self sufficiency can be ensured but it is still unsustainable for agriculture and groundwater it is almost impossible to achieve the sustainability of agricultural water use by optimizing the planting structure if agricultural outputs and economic benefits are ensured together unless 81 96 of the planned water from the snwt project is used for agriculture in practice the self sufficiency of the agricultural products scenario s2 is a viable option for restructuring the current planting system because for food self sufficiency and balanced agricultural groundwater use nonetheless approximately 18 of the planned amount of water from the snwt project is still required to achieve a net neutral groundwater use this is consistent with the results reported by zhang et al 2018 they found that to ensure the self sufficiency of regional crop production shallow groundwater will need to present a depletion trend on the piedmont plain in the bth region scenario 3 maximum grain output under the constraints of water resources is also preferred for a balanced groundwater budget and the greatest sustainability of groundwater use however the self sufficiency of wheat is 75 and the import of wheat is necessary in total restricted by regional water resources there are two ways for water sustainability 1 balancing the agricultural water overdraft by reducing the planting area to the scale of self sufficiency fan 2014 and he 2013 also suggested reducing the total planting area or crop area with high water consumption to reduce agricultural water use however there are still some differences between the results of this study and those of previous studies in this study we suggested reducing the planting area of wheat vegetables and fruit the main contributors to groundwater depletion in the bth region some previous studies have reported an increase in the area of economic crops such as fruits vegetables and cotton su et al 2014 tan et al 2017 liu and wang 2018 liu et al 2019 this is mainly because most previous studies had the objective of optimizing the planting structure to achieve the maximum economic benefits of water use not for water saving and groundwater sustainability this is unsuitable for an area with severe groundwater depletion 2 achieving groundwater sustainability by importing wheat for food consumption or by importing water for food production this was confirmed by zhang et al 2018 they reported that if the constraint of stopping shallow groundwater drawdown by reducing the wheat planting scale is satisfied wheat would not be self sufficient on the piedmont plain in the bth region that is importing wheat for food will be necessary although their report almost only considered wheat a similar dilemma regarding the trade off between water and agricultural production in the study area was exposed herein 5 concluding remarks high intensity agricultural production in the bth region has contributed greatly to meeting the food demands in the study area and in china however the current planting structure is a highly water consuming system which has led to serious groundwater depletion over the past several decades although substantial attention has been given to the coordination of groundwater and food in the study area it is difficult to achieve groundwater sustainability and major food mainly wheat self sufficiency simultaneously under the constraints of regional water resources to achieve the major food mainly wheat self sufficiency total groundwater depletion caused by agriculture industry living etc can decrease if approximately 18 of the water from the snwt project is used for agriculture thereby stopping the groundwater drawdown to achieve groundwater sustainability wheat self sufficiency will be capped at 75 such that importing wheat for food consumption or importing external water for food production will be necessary in the bth region it is difficult to stop groundwater decline by only optimizing the planting structure without giving up any grain or economic output or without importing water from the snwt project since 2014 the snwt project has supplied 11 6 billion m3 of water to the bth region and the comprehensive treatment of groundwater overdraft has been implemented for approximately eight years in hebei province these measures have mitigated groundwater decline at the regional scale and the groundwater has even stopped fluctuating at some stations for example the groundwater depth has fluctuated from 42 to 46 m at luancheng station since 2016 with a horizontal trend line nevertheless in 2020 when the actual water supply exceeded the average planned water scale of the snwt project the groundwater storage was still negative at the regional scale in the study area therefore even in the case of importing the planned amount of water from the snwt project it is necessary to reduce the planting scale and optimize the planting structure for groundwater sustainability in order to optimize the planting structure while coordinating grain crops cash crops and water needs approximately 81 96 of the water imported from the snwt project will be needed for agriculture to achieve a good trade off between groundwater sustainability and agricultural production by reducing the wheat scale to only that required for self sufficiency the minimum amount of water imported would need to be 1 billion m3 yr 1 therefore in the bth region a severe groundwater depletion area a viable option for restructuring the planting structure should involve the regional self sufficient production of wheat and a moderate surplus of vegetables and fruits to boost farmer s income

9718,in the past several decades the irrigation of high intensity cropping systems has caused serious groundwater depletion in the beijing tianjin hebei region optimizing the planting structure is a key method for mitigating groundwater decline however the optimal planting structure has not been confirmed and the effect of planting structures has not been quantified in groundwater overdraft areas in this study based on a model for planting structure optimization and the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm the water saving potential was estimated and the trade off between water resources and agricultural production was quantified the results showed the following 1 the current planting structure is a highly water consuming system the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system and vegetable and fruit cropping systems are the dominant contributors to crop water consumption accounting for 90 of the total water deficit 2 constrained by regional water resources it is difficult to achieve the objectives of halting groundwater decline and food self sufficiency simultaneously unless at least 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 water from the mid route of the south to north water transfer snwt project is used for agriculture or wheat imports account for more than 25 2 84 million ton yr 1 of the regional wheat demand 3 it is almost impossible to achieve a balance between groundwater exploitation and replenishment only by optimizing the planting structure without decreasing the agricultural output or without using external water when the planting structure is optimized to coordinate grain crops cash crops and water use at least 81 96 4 6 5 5 billion m3 yr 1 of the planned water from the snwt project will need to be used for agriculture 4 a viable option for restructuring planting should consider the regional self sufficiency for wheat a moderate surplus of vegetables fruits to boost farmers income and appropriate water transfer for groundwater sustainability the results provide a compromise between food and water in severe groundwater overdraft areas and serve as a quantitative reference for making decisions regarding agricultural and water resource policies graphical abstract ga1 the current planting structure is a highly water consuming system which leading to sever groundwater depletion in the beijing tianjin hebei bth region it is generally difficult to achieve groundwater neutrality by only optimizing the planting structure or by importing water from the snwt project if considering wheat self sufficiency or maintaining current agricultural production to achieve a good trade off between groundwater sustainability and agricultural production by optimizing the planting structure the minimum amount of water imported would need to be 1 billion m3 yr 1 in the future appropriate grain transfers or water diversions will be necessary to ensure the coordinated development of regional water use and grain supply in the bth region

s water withdrawal accounting for 70 of all water use siebert et al 2010 foley et al 2011 wada et al 2012 and is critical for global food safety with the expansion of cropland areas groundwater use has increased continuously providing more than 40 of irrigation water siebert et al 2010 over the past 50 years the world s irrigated farmland area has roughly doubled foley et al 2011 while global groundwater depletion has increased by more than two times in the past 40 years wada et al 2010 groundwater depletion actually occurs as the result of a trade off between water and agricultural products in the agricultural sector this is especially true in the plain area of the beijing tianjin hebei bth region located in the northern part of the north china plain groundwater depletion is severe and widespread in the north china plain wada et al 2010 2012 feng et al 2018 because of the long term pumping of groundwater for irrigation aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 the shallow groundwater level declined by approximately 38 m from the 1970 s to 2018 on the piedmont plain in the north china plain luo et al 2018 subsequently a series of environmental problems have occurred such as wetland atrophy river drying ground fissures ground subsidence and groundwater funnels moiwo et al 2010 yuan and shen 2013 saving water from agriculture may be the most effective way to alleviate or reverse this situation because of the large amount of water consumption in agriculture improving water use efficiency per unit area and downsizing the total irrigation area are effective measures for saving water based on the intensity and scale of water use respectively over decades of agricultural practice water use efficiency has been greatly improved by multiple water saving techniques for instance the water use efficiency of maize has increased by 73 in a piedmont plain study area over the past 40 years zhang et al 2021 however the groundwater level continues to decline as the irrigation area continues to increase with an increasing gross agricultural production owing to the rebound effect namely the more water saving the more water consumption berbel et al 2019 based on 20 cases from 14 countries the fao reported that after using water saving technologies the total water consumption by irrigation does not decrease but tends to increase at the regional scale which is mainly because saved water is used to expand the irrigation area berbel et al 2019 perry et al 2017 therefore improving water use efficiency can save water at the farmland scale but controlling the irrigation area is important for saving water at the regional scale grafton et al 2018 in the bth region the current planting area exceeds the carrying capacity of water resources and shallow aquifers on the piedmont plain of the study area may dry up in the next 80 years zhang et al 2016 therefore reducing the planting areas has become not only an effective way to achieve massive water savings at the regional scale but also an urgent task optimizing cropping systems is a common method for reducing the planting scale researchers have explored more sustainable cropping systems for groundwater sustainability based on field experiments crop models and remote sensing methods it was confirmed that reducing the planting intensity can help mitigate groundwater decline and winter wheat has been reported to be the main contributor to groundwater consumption yang et al 2006 sun et al 2006 gao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 2018 the cropping system of three harvests over two years has been suggested to be a better alternative cropping system for water savings than the current winter wheat summer maize double cropping system which could save 19 45 of the water each year with a grain yield loss of approximately 16 sun et al 2011 meng et al 2012 gao et al 2015 luo et al 2018 for the optimization of planting structures most studies have focused on maximizing the economic benefits of water use under the restrictions of regional water resources su et al 2014 tan et al 2017 hao et al 2018 liu and wang 2018 it was found that the optimal planting structure could increase economic benefits by 5 24 su et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 tan et al 2017 liu et al 2019 and could increase the scale of irrigated agriculture by 26 li et al 2020 these studies focused on the allocation of water resources and an increasing agricultural output by per unit water use which has typically leads to an increase in the area of planting economic crops such as fruits vegetables and cotton and indicated that the agricultural production could always be improved with a certain amount of water consumption su et al 2014 tan et al 2017 liu and wang 2018 liu et al 2019 despite these results substantial attention has been paid to water saving measures involving mainly a fallow measure during winter wheat season but other major crops with high water consumption have not been investigated in groundwater overdraft regions therefore the planting scale of high water consuming crops may increase after optimizing the planting structure furthermore the objectives for adjusting the planting structure always focus on the economic output of water use not on water savings few studies have focused on reducing the total groundwater use and quantifying the trade off between water use and agricultural production by optimizing planting structures especially those constrained by regional water resources and the future food demand based on energy requirements of residents in this study the water resource bearing capacity and food requirements were estimated under the scenario of future population changes based on the model for planting structure optimization and the elitist version of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the water saving potential was simulated and the trade off between water resources and agricultural production was quantified under different optimal planting structure scenarios the objectives were to 1 identify the optimal planting structure and its effect on water use water savings and groundwater consumption under the conditions of natural evolution regional water resources groundwater conservation and food self sufficiency or coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs in the bth region a serious groundwater depletion area 2 evaluate the sustainability of agricultural water use with respect to the available water resources regional water resources water resources imported from water transfer projects in different scenarios based on a constructed sustainability assessment framework in the study area and 3 explore methods for the sustainable reorientation of planting structure corresponding to an appropriate trade off between water resources and crop production in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bth region 36 03 42 40 n 113 27 119 50 e has a total area of 21 7 104 km2 and includes the beijing and tianjin municipalities and hebei province fig 1 the coordinated development of beijing tianjin and hebei is currently an important development strategy in china beijing and tianjin have limited farmland while hebei province is a typical agricultural region in china the plain area of the bth region located in the northern part of the north china plain is the dominant area for agricultural production and groundwater depletion accounting for 44 of the total area and approximately 90 of the total grain production in the bth region in this study the plain region was considered to be the production area while the boundary of food supply demand for residents included the entire bth region climatic conditions are suitable for farming purposes precipitation often occurs from june to august with an annual average value of 540 mm 1958 2017 song et al 2019 it is always less than the water requirement of 688 740 mm for the dominant cropping system of winter wheat summer maize in the bth region luo et al 2018 drought often occurs during the winter wheat season and groundwater irrigation is necessary for grain production wheat is the dominant food crop in the bth region in recent decades the sown area of coarse cereals has decreased while that of vegetables and fruits has increased the dominant planting pattern of is the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize followed by the fruit and vegetable cropping systems each system requires 3 5 irrigation events during the crop growth period and more irrigation times are implemented if water saving irrigation methods are adopted wheat maize vegetables and fruits are the four dominant crops accounting for 83 of the total planting area of crops followed by cotton groundnut and millet the production of winter wheat summer maize vegetables and fruit has increased greatly over time at a relative increase of 16 17 1949 2015 11 and 21 fold 1971 2015 respectively fig 2b the farming method changed gradually from rain fed agriculture before the 1970 s to irrigated agriculture currently the total sown area of crops is 10 17 million hm2 and the grain output is 36 million tons yr 1 of which wheat and maize production account for 92 of the total grain produced vegetable and fruit production are 86 million tons yr 1 and 21 million tons yr 1 respectively accounting for 8 6 and 11 9 of the national total respectively and 3 3 and 7 5 of the global total respectively the total economic value the main crop outputs is 239 9 billion rmb and the ecological benefit is 32 8 billion rmb 2011 2015 2 2 data the regional water resources water supply and agricultural water supply data were obtained from the national bureau of statistics 2004 2015 crop cost benefit and price data used to calculate the economic benefit of the planting structure were obtained from the hebei rural statistical yearbook 2011 2015 and the compilation of cost and benefit of agricultural products in china 2011 2015 the crop yields sown areas population data and per capita food consumption data were mainly obtained from the hebei rural statistical yearbook 2003 2015 the beijing statistical yearbook 2003 2015 and the tianjin statistical yearbook 2003 2015 population data were mainly from beijing 60 years tianjin 60 years hebei 60 years and glorious history 30 years since the reform and opening up of tianjin meteorological data were used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration of crops these data were obtained from the chinese meteorological data sharing service system and include sunshine duration maximal and minimal temperatures relative humidity wind speed and precipitation at 21 stations from 2000 to2017 agricultural meteorological data were used to determine the stages during the crop growing periods which were also obtained from the chinese meteorological data website the recommended amount of energy intake was taken from the reference dietary intake of nutrients in chinese residents compiled by the chinese society of nutrition the energy content of the dominant food was based on data from the fao and chinese food composition table 2017 there was a tendency for variations and annual fluctuations in meteorological data sowing area and crop yields we used a five year average value 2011 2015 for the sowing area and crop yields which have lower annual fluctuations and greater tendency variations but five years was too short for the meteorological data which have substantial annual fluctuations and low tendency variations therefore we selected a longer time series 2000 2017 to calculate the meteorological data the caliber of surveys regarding food requirements for urban and rural residents was different before 2012 surveys were unified in 2012 and the data became stable in 2013 in the hebei economic statistical yearbook therefore the food requirements of residents were estimated from the average value from 2013 to 2016 we estimated the area of the double cropping system based on the wheat area from the statistical material because more than 99 of wheat in the bth region is winter wheat and most of the winter wheat planting area is planted with summer maize according to the practices of the local farmers xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 2 3 methods based on a multi objective optimization model and a fast elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm method this study aims to optimize the crop planting structure for agriculture and water sustainability in the bth region we assumed that the crop yield water saving technology water use efficiency and etc would all be stable in the future whereas the food consumption of the residents was estimated by predicting the future population urbanization rate and per capita food consumption of urban and rural residents the estimated food consumption based on a scenario of high population growth and food self sufficiency in the entire region should be greater than the actual needs because the study area includes the capital city beijing and a large municipal city tianjin of china where most food is supplied from external areas even from abroad therefore residents food consumption will be met the irrigation water demand was roughly calculated from the annual average water deficit of the planting system which was estimated from the annual average differences between the crop water requirements etc mm for a cropping systems and precipitation p mm in a year in this study the optimized planting structure was a generalization situation and anomalous variations were not considered for example some statistics may change based on new survey results and population data may vary depending on new fertility policies we also did not consider the effect of water saving technologies in agriculture 2 3 1 crop water use the irrigation water demand w i was estimated by the annual average water deficit of the planting system which was estimated by the annual average diﬀerences between the etc mm of a cropping system and the p mm in a year the equation is 1 wi etc p where w i mm is the irrigation water demand water deficit of crop i et c mm is the average evapotranspiration of a cropping system including the value during the crop growing period and the fallow period and p mm is the annual average precipitation et c mm was calculated using reference crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients allen et al 1998 the equation is 2 etc et0 kc where et 0 mm is the reference crop evapotranspiration and k c is the crop coefficient because of the fluctuating characteristics of meteorological elements the average values from 2000 to 2017 were used to estimate the crop water demand and water deficit to eliminate the influence of fluctuations in meteorological factors on crop water demand and water deficit 1 reference crop evapotranspiration et0 the reference evapotranspiration was estimated by using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 3 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 μ 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 μ 2 where r n mj m 2 d 1 is the surface net radiation g mj m 2 d 1 is the soil heat

the slope vapor pressure curve and γ kpa 1 is a psychrometric constant allen et al 1998 2 crop coefficient kc kc is the ratio of crop evapotranspiration etc to reference evapotranspiration et0 without water salinity fertilization crop competition disease or other stresses in this study the kc of the crop growing period was derived from the irrigation water quota of the main crop in northern china duan 2004 which was calculated based on the experimental data of relevant stations using the standard algorithm recommended in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 crop growing stages were defined using data from the agricultural meteorological stations a simplified treatment was performed for vegetables to estimate the water consumption during the growth period because of their diversity and complexity that is instead of analyzing a specific type of vegetable all vegetables were regarded as a special crop with vigorous growth all year round except during the overwintering period duan et al 2004 the kc of vegetables was obtained from fao cropwat due to the lack of vegetable data in duan et al 2004 during the fallow period kc was calculated using the kc value of a crop during its sowing date 2 3 2 food supply and requirement 1 current food supply and requirement the food surplus was estimated based on the food supply and demand the formula is 4 q sc ni 5 ni ki rui pu rri pr where q kg is the food surplus s c kg is the food supply and n i kg is the food requirement of crop i r ui kg per capita and r ri kg per capita are the requirements of food i for urban and rural residents respectively p u person and p r person are the population numbers of urban and rural residents respectively and k i isthe coeﬃcient of food requirement where k i 1 the food requirements mainly included the food consumption of residents the loss of agricultural products after harvest and the grain for seeds the data for food consumption per capita from the statistical year books do not include food consumption from eating out and in this study we used 20 and 10 of the total food consumption for urban and rural residents respectively li 2005 ma et al 2005 2006 dong et al 2008 hu 2016 the postharvest loss rate of agricultural products was estimated based on data from thoughts on the development of china s agricultural processing industry published on the official website of the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china the values are 7 11 15 20 15 20 and 20 25 for grains potatoes fruits and vegetables respectively zong 2014 the median values were used in this study grain for seed was mainly considered for wheat which accounted for approximately 2 of the output in the study area the grain volume of seeds is small for the other crops and can be neglected in this study 2 prediction of food requirement in the 2030 s the future food requirements were estimated by predicting the future population urbanization rate and per capita food consumption of urban and rural residents based on formula 5 per capita food consumption was estimated by the recommended energy intake amount food energy content and consumption structure in this study to simplify the calculation the regional average yield in the past five years at the current level of agricultural technologies was used and the promotion of agro technologies was not considered such that the current yield level was only used to simulate and evaluate the effects of water saving or balancing by optimizing the planting structure in addition the feed requirements for meat eggs and milk were calculated by the ratio of feed to meat xin et al 2015 the feed consumption was mainly calculated using corn in this study current coefficients were used for food consumption from eating out the loss of agricultural products after harvest and the grain for seed i prediction of population and urbanization rate in this study we used a population of 127 million in 2030 which was estimated by logistic growth model 126 million and also considered another 1 million people under the national development strategy of building the xiongan new area luo 2019 this is similar to the results reported by zhai 2007 they found a population peak of 126 million in approximately 2027 in bth region and also similar to the population value of 122 million in 2030 estimated by guo et al 2020 and 128 5 million in 2030 based on hebei urban system planning 2016 2030 tianjin urban master plan 2015 2030 draft for review and beijing urban master plan 2016 2035 department of housing urban rural development hebei 2017 tianjin municipal bureau of planning and natural resources 2016 the people s government of beijing municipality 2017 the urbanization rate of the bth region was 70 80 and was calculated to be 75 in 2030 li 2014 ii prediction of food requirement per capita assuming that people s diets tend to be healthy and balanced with the development of society and the economy and that the energy consumption structure is stable for both urban and rural residents the food requirement per capita was estimated by the recommended energy intake amount food energy content and consumption structure 6 r i r foodi e rec e total r foodi e rec i 1 m r foodi e foodi where r i kg yr 1 per capita and r foodi kg yr 1 per capita are the food requirement per capita of food i in the future and at present respectively e rec kcal yr 1 per capita and e total kcal yr 1 per capita are the recommended energy intake amount per capita and the total energy intake amount at present per capita respectively e foodi kcal kg 1 is the energy content of food i and m is the number of types of food the data for the recommended energy intake were from the reference intake of dietary nutrients in chinese residents compiled by the chinese nutrition society which was estimated on the basis of the value for moderate labor except at ages between 14 and 64 years which are working ages and were divided into two parts light manual labor and heavy manual labor based on the gender labor structure age structure and urban rural population structure the average recommended energy intake of the residents in the bth region was estimated the energy content of the dominant food was based on data from the fao and the chinese food composition table 2017 the consumption structure of the residents was the average value 2013 2016 from the statistical yearbooks all these factors were estimated based on the data from urban and rural residents 2 3 3 crop planting structure scenarios groundwater depletion and subsequent environmental problems are the most serious problems during agricultural production in the bth region therefore balancing the development of water resources and agricultural production is an emerging concern in this study four planting structure scenarios were simulated to estimate the threshold of water and grain relationships in terms of land use water use and economic and ecological benefits 1 present trend scenario s1 this scenario assumes that the planting structure of crops will be optimized and evolve automatically according to current trends without being affected by a macro control and management policies the planting structure was predicted based on the present trend in the crop planting scale after optimization the total economic output values of farmland will improved and change slightly table 1 2 self sufficiency in main agricultural products s2 in this scenario the planting structure of crops depends on the needs defined by self sufficiency in the main agricultural products in the bth area excluding rice rice cannot adapt to local natural conditions widely and presents a self sufficiency of 17 therefore the self sufficiency of rice in 2030 is not practical and is not considered in this scenario the total planting area and total water consumption of crops is reduced greatly so that proper fallow can be introduced to save water this scenario involves a planting structure with the greatest water savings if the self sufficiency of the main crops can be achieved in the region the economic output value of farmland would decrease and the ecological output value would increase table 1 3 maximum grain output under water resource constraints s3 in this scenario the planting structure of crops is aimed at the maximum grain output scale which can be supported by the regional water resources not including external water from the mid route of the south to north water transfer snwt project to achieve a balance between groundwater exploitation and replenishment the scale of other high water consumption crops e g vegetables fruits and potatoes is constrained by the area s self sufficiency in these crops the total planting area and total water consumption of crops are largely reduced so appropriate fallowing can be carried out the total water consumption decreases to the amount that can be supported by regional water resources the economic output value of farmland is reduced and the value of ecological output increases 4 coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs s4 in this scenario the optimized planting structure is constrained by the planting scale needed to ensure grain self sufficiency total requirement of wheat and rice where the rice deficit is converted into wheat while maximizing the economic output the total planting area is less than that at present the total water consumption is reduced while external water may be necessary for the coordination of grain crops cash crops and groundwater sustainability 2 3 4 optimizing model of planting structure the planting structure was optimized mainly for scenario2 to scenario4 table 1 the planting structure was predicted by the present trend of the crop planting scale under scenario1 which will evolve based on the current development trend table 1 1 objective function reducing water use is the most important objective for the sustainable use of groundwater and economic and ecological benefits are desired as much as possible the objective functions of the optimization model are multiple objectives including the minimum water use maximum economic benefit and maximum ecological benefit the three objectives were formulated as follows a minimal total water use minf 1 b maximum total economic benefit maxf 2 c maximum total ecological benefit maxf 3 7 min f 1 10 i 1 n w i x i 8 max f 2 i 1 m p i y i x i 9 max f 3 i 1 m 1 7 j 1 9 e j x i p i y i e wi e ws

in this study the sowing areas of different crops xi were obtained from the national statistical yearbooks of china and the annual average data for 2011 2015 were used as the present situation the water deficit for different crops wi was calculated using the annual average 2000 2017 differences between the etc mm of cropping system i and p mm in a year 2 constraints imposing constraint conditions is necessary to solve optimization problems in this study different constraints were used for different scenarios with three primary aspects of constraints for the objectives the crop sown area crop water use and water resources and food supply and requirements the optimal principle of the planting structures mainly aimed at restricting the planting scale of high water consuming crops and giving priority to crops with low water consumption and high benefits the sum of crop sown area should not be greater than the current total planting area the sown area of high water consuming crops after optimization should be less than that at present 10 i 1 m x i s 11 x ih s ihnow where s hm2 is the total area of the main crops and xih hm2 and sihnow hm2 are the planting areas after optimization and at present for the high water consuming crops respectively which mainly include winter wheat rice vegetables fruit and cotton and xi and m are the same as above the total amount of water used should be less than the regional water resources the amount of water saved should be greater than a preset value under certain optimal planting scenarios 12 wuse wres where wuse m3 and wres m3 are the total irrigation water requirements of all cropping systems at present and after optimization respectively the irrigation water requirement was estimated based on the water deficit of each cropping system the planting area of highly water consuming crops such as wheat vegetables and fruit should be restricted by the food requirement kg because the food supply was much greater than the food requirement for these crops in the study area the grain ration should meet a 90 self sufficiency rate for the coordination of food water and benefit scenarios 13 n ilow y i x i n ihigh 14 i 1 g y i x i 0 9 i 1 g n i 15 ni ppop ni where nilow kg and nihigh kg are the upper and lower boundaries of food supply respectively which are determined by considering the food requirement and crop water consumption ni kg is the food requirement of crop i g is the number of grain ration crops ppop is the population and ni kg per capita is the per capita food requirement of crop i and yi and xi are the same as above the main characteristic of senario2 is self sufficiency in the main agricultural products while that for senario3 is the maximum wheat scale under the constraints of self sufficiency in the main crops with high water consumption except for wheat that for senario4 is to satisfy the total grain wheat and rice the insufficient rice was converted according to wheat demand and to maximize the cash crops such as vegetables and fruits 2 3 5 genetic algorithms genetic algorithms are random search and optimization algorithms based on darwin s theory of evolution and mandel s theory of genetics proposed by professor holland in america a fast elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is one of the most popular pareto dominances based on multi objective evolutionary algorithms li and zhang 2009 with the properties of a fast non dominated sorting procedure an elitist approach and a parameter less sharing approach deb et al 2000 it has the characteristics of simplicity generality global parallelism and strong anti interference in this study there were three objectives and three main constraint conditions 3 results 3 1 food supply demand 3 1 1 current status of food supply demand food self sufficiency is an important basis for agricultural production especially in areas with depleted groundwater food surplus is widespread for many agricultural products in the bth region fig 3 shows that the food demand for grain rations was the greatest followed by that for vegetables and fruits the surpluses of fruits vegetables eggs milk and aquatic products account for more than 50 of the food supply the grain surplus was 3 12 million tons 9 of the grain supply when considering the grain demand for food and livestock feed mainly estimated as maize among the four dominant crops the surpluses of wheat maize considering the grain demand for both food and livestock feed vegetables and fruit were 21 19 83 and 75 of the supply respectively fig 3 thus much of the agricultural output serves areas outside the region and a large amount of water is exported to other areas with the export of agricultural products 3 1 2 future food supply demand in the 2030 s the per capita food demand was estimated by using the energy consumption structure the energy content of crops and the recommended energy intake amounts of residents of different ages genders and labor intensities overall the per capita food demand should decrease for a healthy and balanced diet the per capita energy intake amount in the bth region in the 2030 s is predicted to be 2165 and 2017 kcal capita 1 day 1 for urban and rural residents respectively which is 10 and 13 lower respectively than those at present the population will be 127 million luo 2019 and the urbanization rate will increase to 0 75 in 2030 li 2014 with urban and rural populations of 95 25 million and 31 75 million respectively in the bth region overall the food supply will be greater than the food demand in the 2030 s with population growth urbanization rate increase and energy intake reduction food demand is not likely to change too much relative to the current status the surpluses of wheat vegetables and fruits will be 22 82 and 73 respectively and those of meat egg and milk will be 37 58 of the food supply in the bth region fig 4 therefore from the perspective of food supply and demand overproduction is common in the bth region both at present and in the 2030 s this does not correspond very well with the severe groundwater depletion 3 2 agricultural water use 3 2 1 water requirements and deficits of cropping systems the irrigation water requirement was estimated based on the water deficit of the cropping systems negative values indicate a water surplus during the entire year for the cropping system which was not considered when estimating the total irrigation water requirement on an annual basis water requirements and consumption are essential for sustainable development with regard to water resource availability the growing season and fallow period should be considered for the annual water requirements of a cropping system for the vegetable cropping system fruit cropping system winter wheat summer maize double cropping system and rice cotton potato and groundnut single cropping systems the average water requirements were high 855 702 797 830 644 627 and 567 mm yr 1 respectively each of which was more than the annual average precipitation amount of 542 mm table 2 the average water deficits for these crops are high at 313 160 255 288 102 85 and 25 mm yr 1 respectively 2000 2017 therefore there is a substantial water deficit in the agricultural sector that is met by irrigation from groundwater extraction 3 2 2 water consumption of the current planting structure the current planting structure is a high water consuming system with a water deficit of 12 3 billion m3 yr 1 and a crop planting area of 10 17 million hectares for the main crops in the study area the water deficit for the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was the greatest with a value of 6 4 billion m3 yr 1 followed by those for the vegetable cropping system and fruit cropping system with values of 2 8 billion m3 yr 1 and 1 9 billion m3 yr 1 respectively table 2 these three cropping systems were the dominant water deficit cropping systems accounting for 90 of the total water deficit of the current planting structure in the bth region wheat vegetables and fruit are the dominant crops with high water consumption in the study area 3 3 optimizing the planting structure for tradeoffs between agriculture outputs and groundwater use in the current development trend scenario the planting scale is based on the current trends of each crop for the other three scenarios the optimized model of the planting structure is solved based on nsga ii fig 5 shows the optimized scale of the planting structure under s2 s3 and s4 most of the crops with high water consumption have a relatively small range of solutions and the total planting scale is 7 24 7 77 million hm2 under self sufficiency for the main agricultural products scenario s2 the solutions will require 1 46 1 49 million hm2 and 3 42 4 12 million hm2 for wheat and maize respectively under s3 the scales for vegetables and fruits have a relatively small range of solutions for self sufficiency constraints and the total planting scale is 6 90 7 79 million hm2 in s3 the planting scale range is 2 32 2 33 3 57 4 12 1 09 1 36 and 0 93 0 97 million hm2 for wheat maize vegetables and fruits respectively and the total planting scale is 9 08 10 01 million hm2 in s4 3 3 1 present trend scenario s1 in the current development trend scenario the total planting area of crops decreased by 2 compared to the current scale the relative decreases in wheat and fruit acreage were 11 and 3 respectively and the relative increases in maize and vegetable acreage were 20 and 11 respectively the total water deficit of cropping systems was 11 3 billion m3 yr 1 and the water saving amount was 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 or 8 of the irrigation water requirement at present mainly because of a scale reduction in wheat followed by that in cotton and fruits table 3 the total grain output increased by approximately 5 with a wheat self sufficiency rate of 1 1 and a small change in economic benefits the ecological benefits improved and irrigation water requirements decreased in farmlands this scenario is good for improving the groundwater overdraft problem however because of the small amount of water saved it is difficult to change the situation of groundwater overexploitation in the bth region 3 3 2 self sufficiency of agricultural products scenario s2 the self sufficiency of grain rations is an important basis for formulating agricultural policies in this scenario the total sown area of crops decreased by 24 29 compared to the status quo the sown scale of wheat vegetables and fruit will decrease by 22 82 and 73 respectively the total grain output will decrease by approximately 11 with reduced economic benefits and increased ecological benefits the total water saving for the cropping systems was 5 4 5 8 billion m3 yr 1 or 44 47 in this scenario relative to the current planting structure the winter wheat summer maize cropping system vegetable cropping system and fruit cropping system saved 5 1 billion m3 of water per year table 3 this is the maximum potential for water savings if the self sufficiency of grain is taken into consideration in the bth region according to the national data on water resources and water use the regional water overexploitation is 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 not including the water imported from the snwt project therefore it is difficult to solve the problem of groundwater depletion by optimizing the planting structure while also ensuring the self sufficiency of crops that have a high water consumption approximately 1 billion m3 yr 1 of external water is required to stop groundwater decline in this study the irrigation water demand was roughly expressed by the perennial average water deficit of the cropping system the present values for the sown area and water deficit in the table were calculated from the average data in 2011 2015 and 2000 2017 respectively the negative data indicate a water surplus during the entire year for the cropping system which was not considered when estimating the total irrigation water requirement 3 3 3 maximum grain output under the constraints of regional water resources s3 under this scenario the total sown area of crops decreased by 23 32 relative to the present structure vegetable fruit and potato production were self sufficient and decreased the maximum amount of water to ensure that the water demands of wheat were met then the maximum wheat planting area supported by the regional water resources was 1 46 1 49 million hm2 equivalent to 58 59 of the current wheat area and less than the wheat area required for self sufficiency 78 of the status quo i e groundwater overdraft is inevitable to achieve the self sufficiency of wheat under the constraint of regional water resources not including external water from water transfer project table 3 in this scenario the self sufficiency rate of wheat was 74 76 the total grain output decreased by approximately 13 the economic benefits decreased and the ecological benefits improved the total amount of water savings was 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 or 54 relative to the current irrigation water requirement among which wheat vegetables and fruit contributed 95 table 3 water use was constrained within the regional water resources and the groundwater was balanced between exploitation and supply therefore this is beneficial to the agroecosystem and water environment 3 3 4 coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs scenario s4 considering the coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs the planting structure was similar to the current status quo with a 2 11 reduction in the total planting area wheat rice vegetables and fruits roughly maintained a scale similar to the current planting structure the water saving amount in s4 was 1 2 2 1 billion m3 yr 1 or 10 17 relative to the irrigation water requirement at present which is much less than the overexploitation of 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 therefore 4 6 5 5 billion m3 yr 1 of other water sources were still required for a balanced groundwater budget equivalent to 81 96 of the imported water from the snwt project this result indicates that the current planting structure is relatively reasonable without considering water limitations 4 discussion 4 1 sustainability of agricultural water use under present and optimal planting structures water sustainability depends on the equilibrium relationship between water use and water resources fig 6 shows three sustainable critical lines for water use in the bth region according to the ideas of red line for water use and water management lines i and ii are critical lines for balancing the total water overdraft of 6 7 billion m3 yr 1 including the water overdraft caused by agriculture industry living etc and the agricultural overdraft of 4 4 billion m3 yr 1 caused by agricultural water use respectively when considering the regional water resources in the bth region only excluding the water imported from the snwt project line iii is the boundary to balance the total overdraft amount considering both the water resources from the regional water resources and from the snwt project in the bth region fig 6 water resources would be sustainable if a distribution point of water use is located within less than the critical line value otherwise the water use would be true unsustainable 4 1 1 current sustainability of agricultural water use current agricultural water use is generally unsustainable in the bth region in the past 17 years the total sown area of crops has been relatively stable at 10 2 million hm2 while the total irrigation water consumption varies greatly owing to the various rainfall types in 2012 agricultural water use was sustainable due to the high regional water resources accompanied by substantial precipitation 774 mm in contrast agricultural water use was unsustainable in an extremely dry year in 2002 with a low precipitation of 359 mm fig 6a agricultural water use was unsustainable in most years 2000 2016 and the annual average agricultural water use was greater than the value of critical line iii fig 6a indicating that the current planting structure was unsustainable despite the planned input of water from the snwt project the planned amount was 5 7 billion m3 yr 1 this result was confirmed by the continuous depletion of groundwater in the study area shen et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 2011 feng et al 2013 2018 4 1 2 sustainability of agricultural water use under optimal planting structure scenarios the sustainability of agricultural water use improved under optimal planting structure scenarios relative to the current status fig 6 according to the present trend of planting structure s1 agricultural water use is developing toward more sustainable water use however it is still close to unsustainable even considering the use of 100 of the planned water from the snwt project in the 2030 s fig 6b under the coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs scenario s4 the sustainability of agricultural water use is similar to the status quo and s1 fig 6b indicating that the current planting structure could potentially balance food production and economic benefits if water consumption is unrestricted instead if water use is restricted some grain or economic output losses are inevitable in total s1 and s4 have low sustainability for agricultural water use there is a water requirement of more than 100 and 81 of the planned water from the snwt project to achieve a balanced groundwater budget of the total water overdraft amount under s1 and s4 respectively according to the self sufficiency of the agricultural products scenario s2 and the maximum grain output supported by the regional water resources s3 a high sustainability of agricultural water use is observed fig 6b shows that the water overdraft amount caused by agriculture is balanced but not the total water overdraft amount in s2 it is necessary to use approximately 18 of the water budget from the snwt project to achieve a balance of the total water overdraft amount in s2 in the bth region s3 can balance the agricultural water overdraft amount and the total water overdraft amount without using external water sources and allows sustainable groundwater use in the bth region fig 6b while the wheat self sufficiency is only 75 under the strategy of deciding production by water i e the wheat production is 59 of the status quo this result is confirmed by the results reported by zhang and ren 2021 they found that to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown and to improve water and energy productivities by wheat fallow rotations the minimum reduction in the annual average winter wheat yield would be 55 relative to the status quo on the piedmont plain in the bth region therefore it is difficult to stop groundwater decline by only optimizing the planting structure or importing water from the snwt project considering wheat self sufficiency or maintaining the previous status of agricultural production fig 6a b based on the apsim model van oort et al 2016 also found that the snwt project can relieve groundwater depletion but can not stop the groundwater decline at xinji station located in the bth region therefore even when optimizing the planting structure external water transfer is important for groundwater sustainability if the planned amount of water from the snwt project is fully used for agriculture a groundwater balance between exploitation and replenishment can be achieved under all optimal planting structure scenarios otherwise scenarios 2 and 3 are good alternatives to the current structure when the trade off between groundwater sustainability and food consumption is considered 4 2 effect on water use output and ecological benefit for each scenario the sustainable development of agriculture involves the sustainability of land agricultural production ecological environment farmer income etc the total planting area of crops can decrease by 24 282 million hm2 or 2 28 under different scenarios for optimal planting structure compared to the current status table 4 reducing the planting area is beneficial for fertilizing the soil in the fallow period and improving the subsequent soil production capacity which is beneficial not only to the sustainability of agricultural land but also to the chinese strategy of storing food in farmland reducing the water consumption of grain crops is accompanied by a loss in agricultural production grain production shows a relative change from 13 5 under different optimal planting structure scenarios relative to the status quo table 4 however the lowest grain production scenario meets approximately 90 of the predicted grain demand of the residents in the future and can have a small impact on the grain supply in the region for wheat the main grain in the study area the self sufficiency rate is 75 under the constraints of regional water resources not including external water from water transfer project therefore it is necessary to obtain wheat or water from external areas to meet the grain demand and balance the groundwater budget in the bth region for vegetables and fruits self sufficiency is satisfied in all scenarios owing to their high surplus scenario 1 present trend scenario scenario 2 self sufficiency of agricultural products scenario 3 maximum grain output under the constraints of water resources scenario 4 coordination of grain crops cash crops and water needs the water deficit was roughly expressed by the perennial average water deficit of the cropping system the economic benefit declines owing to a reduction in the scale of cash crops e g vegetables and fruits and the decrease in the total sown area while the regional environmental quality and ecological benefit improve by reducing the planting scale of high water consuming crops ju et al 2009 meng et al 2012 pei et al 2015 van oort et al 2016 the ecological benefit of farmland increases by approximately 1 5 times under different optimal planting structure scenarios compared to the status quo which is similar or greater than the decrement in economic benefits table 4 furthermore if saved water is used in other sectors of production and life a higher economic benefit can be obtained based on the results of zhang and guo 2016 an economic of 90 2 93 1 rmb m 3 is expected if the water saved in agriculture is transferred to be used in the secondary and tertiary industries thus the water saving amount of 1 0 6 7 billion m3 in this study can increase the economic benefits by 90 2 623 7 billion rmb equivalent to 38 260 of the total economic benefit of the current cropping system and more than the direct economic loss under any scenario therefore the direct economic output declines while the potential benefits e g ecological benefit increase significantly under the optimal planting structure scenarios regarding farmers income although the total economic benefit of farmland decreases the government grants farmers a subsidy of 7500 rmb hm 2 yr 1 for following the wheat fallow rotation which is equivalent to the farmers income in a harvest year furthermore the water rights trading market has improved and saved water can lead to economic benefits through water rights transactions therefore farmers income can be ensured in the near future while in the long run subsidy policies may be uncertain with the continuous improvement in urbanization level most young and middle aged people are very unwilling to do traditional farm work thus land circulation large scale production and high quality outputs should be considered to improve agricultural benefits in the long term 4 3 planting structure options under the constraint of regional water resources it is difficult to achieve the goal of balancing groundwater budget and food mainly wheat self sufficiency according to the current development trend s1 and coordinating food benefits and water s4 the planting structure will be better optimized than it is currently wheat self sufficiency can be ensured but it is still unsustainable for agriculture and groundwater it is almost impossible to achieve the sustainability of agricultural water use by optimizing the planting structure if agricultural outputs and economic benefits are ensured together unless 81 96 of the planned water from the snwt project is used for agriculture in practice the self sufficiency of the agricultural products scenario s2 is a viable option for restructuring the current planting system because for food self sufficiency and balanced agricultural groundwater use nonetheless approximately 18 of the planned amount of water from the snwt project is still required to achieve a net neutral groundwater use this is consistent with the results reported by zhang et al 2018 they found that to ensure the self sufficiency of regional crop production shallow groundwater will need to present a depletion trend on the piedmont plain in the bth region scenario 3 maximum grain output under the constraints of water resources is also preferred for a balanced groundwater budget and the greatest sustainability of groundwater use however the self sufficiency of wheat is 75 and the import of wheat is necessary in total restricted by regional water resources there are two ways for water sustainability 1 balancing the agricultural water overdraft by reducing the planting area to the scale of self sufficiency fan 2014 and he 2013 also suggested reducing the total planting area or crop area with high water consumption to reduce agricultural water use however there are still some differences between the results of this study and those of previous studies in this study we suggested reducing the planting area of wheat vegetables and fruit the main contributors to groundwater depletion in the bth region some previous studies have reported an increase in the area of economic crops such as fruits vegetables and cotton su et al 2014 tan et al 2017 liu and wang 2018 liu et al 2019 this is mainly because most previous studies had the objective of optimizing the planting structure to achieve the maximum economic benefits of water use not for water saving and groundwater sustainability this is unsuitable for an area with severe groundwater depletion 2 achieving groundwater sustainability by importing wheat for food consumption or by importing water for food production this was confirmed by zhang et al 2018 they reported that if the constraint of stopping shallow groundwater drawdown by reducing the wheat planting scale is satisfied wheat would not be self sufficient on the piedmont plain in the bth region that is importing wheat for food will be necessary although their report almost only considered wheat a similar dilemma regarding the trade off between water and agricultural production in the study area was exposed herein 5 concluding remarks high intensity agricultural production in the bth region has contributed greatly to meeting the food demands in the study area and in china however the current planting structure is a highly water consuming system which has led to serious groundwater depletion over the past several decades although substantial attention has been given to the coordination of groundwater and food in the study area it is difficult to achieve groundwater sustainability and major food mainly wheat self sufficiency simultaneously under the constraints of regional water resources to achieve the major food mainly wheat self sufficiency total groundwater depletion caused by agriculture industry living etc can decrease if approximately 18 of the water from the snwt project is used for agriculture thereby stopping the groundwater drawdown to achieve groundwater sustainability wheat self sufficiency will be capped at 75 such that importing wheat for food consumption or importing external water for food production will be necessary in the bth region it is difficult to stop groundwater decline by only optimizing the planting structure without giving up any grain or economic output or without importing water from the snwt project since 2014 the snwt project has supplied 11 6 billion m3 of water to the bth region and the comprehensive treatment of groundwater overdraft has been implemented for approximately eight years in hebei province these measures have mitigated groundwater decline at the regional scale and the groundwater has even stopped fluctuating at some stations for example the groundwater depth has fluctuated from 42 to 46 m at luancheng station since 2016 with a horizontal trend line nevertheless in 2020 when the actual water supply exceeded the average planned water scale of the snwt project the groundwater storage was still negative at the regional scale in the study area therefore even in the case of importing the planned amount of water from the snwt project it is necessary to reduce the planting scale and optimize the planting structure for groundwater sustainability in order to optimize the planting structure while coordinating grain crops cash crops and water needs approximately 81 96 of the water imported from the snwt project will be needed for agriculture to achieve a good trade off between groundwater sustainability and agricultural production by reducing the wheat scale to only that required for self sufficiency the minimum amount of water imported would need to be 1 billion m3 yr 1 therefore in the bth region a severe groundwater depletion area a viable option for restructuring the planting structure should involve the regional self sufficient production of wheat and a moderate surplus of vegetables and fruits to boost farmer s income

9719,this study quantified the crop water consumption crop specific irrigation requirements and availability of water resources to catchments under climate change in the czech republic cz within the soilclim model and bilan wateres hydrological water balance modeling process we tried to answer the question of whether there are at least theoretical water resources in the individual catchments of the cz that could cover possible higher demands for irrigation an ensemble of five global climate models under the moderate representative concentration pathway rcp4 5 from the euro cordex initiative was chosen to project the future water use indicators the irrigation water requirement indicators for the growing season gs of vineyards hop gardens orchards vegetables and fodder crops were calculated in 1143 catchments for two periods 2031 2050 sc1 and 2061 2080 sc2 compared to the observed period 1961 2020 obs to project irrigation scenarios in agricultural water management the following water use indicators were quantified relative soil moisture at 0 40 cm awr1 and 0 100 cm awr crop water balance rain et a irrigation water requirement irrig and the ratio of actual and reference evapotranspiration et ratio to assess areas with a critically low water supply and quantify the frequency of water deficit during the gs of each crop we calculated the number of days with extreme values of water use indicators quantification of the extreme irrigation characteristics reflected the highest depletion of soil moisture and the highest water demands i e when the assessed indicators reached the 25th percentiles for highly marketable vegetables the largest deficit in rain et a during the gs for sc1 was projected if current vegetable growing areas and cropping systems remain unchanged irrig will increase by 10 2 by the end of the 21st century under rcp4 5 although current potato planting areas have soils with a high available water capacity they will become controlled by the water deficit over the next few decades the accumulated vineyard water required suggests that 15 and 25 of irrigation water will be lost by evaporation from the soil surface during the 2030s and 2080s respectively however changes in future hopyard irrigation extent and amounts may have important implications in largely cropped irrigation hotspots in the main traditional hop region for the 2030s we project a 25 depletion of soil moisture and an increase of et ratio 0 4 by up to 5 3 the projection of a high frequency of days with an et ratio 0 4 and awr1 30 for fodder crops was related to the most risk prone areas with an extreme lack of moisture in the regions with the most developed animal production thus there will be insufficient fodder supply to the livestock sector due to any water stress during the production season under climate change conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords crop water consumption crop specific irrigation requirements water use

40 of the world s food supply cody 2018 approximately 70 of global water consumption is used for irrigation of crops wisser et al 2008 and harmonization of water requirements with limited water resources is a significant political dilemma grafton et al 2018 water saving irrigation has benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as for sustainable economic development zou et al 2013 thiery et al 2020 irrigation water demand has increased in recent decades drastig et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in connection with anthropogenic climate change water requirements for crop irrigation are likely to increase with considerable regional variation and irrigation requirements might increase to such an extent that established regional agricultural practices might be challenging to retain in some regions riediger et al 2016 wang et al 2016 excessive irrigation leads to drainage problems so reduced irrigation strategies need to be implemented to protect water resources mondaca duarte et al 2020 for example the mediterranean region could save 35 of water by implementing more efficient irrigation and conveyance systems fader et al 2016 at the same time irrigation influences many land components it modulates the terrestrial water budget shah et al 2019 and affects local hydrological and energy cycles de vrese et al 2016 as well as weather and climate conditions chen et al 2018 cook et al 2015 especially hot extremes thiery et al 2020 potopová et al 2021a 2021b while global warming increases the likelihood of hot extremes almost globally irrigation can regionally cancel or even reverse the effects of all other forcing combined cook et al 2015 chen et al 2018 it seems likely that demand and supply can be brought into a sustainable balance only by changing and moderating the pattern of requirements by introducing new sources of supply or both cody 2018 earlier studies dusenge et al 2019 have already described the effect of elevated co2 on plant growth as a result of climate change but the effects on crop water use and water use efficiency are less studied lenka et al 2020 2021 few studies have projected future impacts of climate change land use change and changes in water consumption on water resources for the european continent schaldach et al 2012 bisselink et al 2020 wriedt et al 2009 simulated irrigation water requirements in europe taking into account the spatial distribution of crops soil conditions climate and crop management riediger et al 2016 modeled a generally increasing water demand with increasing temperatures in the northern german plain that is most likely of equal relevance for central european regions southern european countries are projected to face decreasing water availability sordo ward et al 2019 potopová et al 2019 2020 central and northern european countries show increasing annual water availability van vliet et al 2015 but projected temperature and precipitation changes show large subannual variability trnka et al 2015a 2015b 2020 žalud et al 2017 zahradníček et al 2020 therefore a seasonal assessment of both water availability and demand should be undertaken for farmland management pfister et al 2020 regional implications of global climate change will likely affect evapotranspiration which is an important aspect of crop cultivation and the most important influence on irrigation requirements for central european regions even today compound climate events and less developed irrigation systems are significant issues in the agriculture of the czech republic trnka et al 2014 duffková et al 2019 potopová et al 2021a 2021b balvín et al 2021 the required amount of irrigation water depends on how much water the cultivation of a particular crop type requires and how much water is available from local sources el naggar et al 2020 therefore irrigation requirements estimated by independent modeling approaches will be useful to assist in irrigation planning and water management

investigate water availability has made significant progress in recent years e g perea et al 2018 dang et al 2020 and there is still a need to better assess future crop water consumption two different modeling frameworks have been applied to analyze their suitability for simulating time series of crop specific irrigation requirements the first framework refers to soft coupling a dynamic vegetation model with a land use model yalew et al 2018 whereas the second framework relies on conceptual modeling of crop evapotranspiration zhao et al 2019 bastiaanssen et al 2007 provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of irrigation modeling by many methods direct observations are often used for comparison of measured temperatures and precipitation within different areas or seasons and evaluation of spatial temporal changes e g fowler and helvey 1974 or an assessment of crop yields kresovic et al 2014 models and simulations are commonly used to study the influence of different parameters on complex systems de vrese and hagemann 2018 for example the effect of irrigation on hydrology sorooshian et al 2014 the effects of climate change climatic variability and water trade on irrigation operations king et al 2019 the influence of heatwaves on vegetation boeck et al 2016 irrigation water requirements döll and siebert 2002 and crop coefficients mahmoud and gan 2019 can all be studied by different types of models the results of these analyses can be used for example for planning and management of sustainable water use in different regions mahmoud and gan 2019 or for adopting policy responses to reduce climate change impacts wang et al 2016 the influence of irrigation on vegetation health and land surface temperature ambika and mishra 2019 or the spatial and temporal distribution of evapotranspiration mahmoud and gan 2019 can also be studied by remote sensing methods the effect of the management system on irrigation efficiency largely depends on the socioeconomic factors of the country in the czech republic cz the water management system is marked by intensive agriculture large settlement and intensive human activities as well as by extensive artificial modifications of watercourses and floodplains although there are 76 000 km of watercourses in total of which approximately 15 300 km is important for the management of water resources and approximately 60 700 km of other small watercourses the majority of watercourses drain into neighboring states moreover the long term fluctuations in climatic variables are reflected in the variabilities of river streamflow and water level that have relatively short residence times therefore our hypothesis assumes that the current and future available water resources are not sufficient for optimal crop growth with the highest water requirements according to their water demand in the cz the main aim was to project the water demands and irrigation strategies for vineyards hop gardens orchards areas with vegetables and fodder crops under climate change at the catchment level the objectives of this study were i to project water needs to cover the moisture deficit and water need to ensure stable yields of fodder orchards vineyards hop gardens and vegetables for two periods 2031 2050 sc1 and 2061 2080 sc2 compared to the observed period 1961 2020 obs ii to identify deficit areas and distribution of water needs for the growing season gs of 15 crops iii to quantify the extreme irrigation characteristics to reflect the highest depletion of soil moisture the most negative water balance and the highest water demands for the obs sc1 and sc2 periods and iv to quantify the availability of water resources to catchments and the contribution of the use of irrigation systems to mitigate the effects of drought 2 target area and their irrigation system the target area of this study is the cz a dry warming country in central europe with a less developed irrigation system alterations in water deficit and water excess events are becoming common even during the same year e g 2020 and the balance between water supply and demand is becoming fragile according to the predictions of the models under rcp4 5 the lowest precipitation totals for various recurrence intervals of 5 yr were 170 mm for the 2041 2060 period whereas the highest precipitation totals for 100 yr were 311 mm for the 2021 2040 period dolák et al 2017 the improvement of drainage and irrigation systems the conservation of water and the use of water saving technologies seem to be crucial for farmers adaptation measures therefore we aim to provide new results about interactions between irrigation and farming systems for the current and future climate over the cz approximately 160 000 ha of irrigation is built in the fertile and driest areas of the country of which 88 000 ha is in czech lands and 72 000 ha is in moravia the national irrigation system is usually limited to crops that cannot be grown without irrigation or that gain more value through irrigation vegetables early potatoes hops orchards and vineyards the sprinkler irrigation system dominates but approximately 4000 ha of drip irrigation is applied for vegetable crops most of the irrigation systems approximately 127 000 ha were privatized in 1997 and 1998 at present approximately 40 of the original extent of irrigation systems is in use while the remaining portion is not operated the water demand was evaluated in the irrigated grid area for the following crops potatoes garlic onion carrot peppers cucumbers cauliflower cabbage apple trees peaches cherries apricots alfalfa for hay and hop the gs of crop growth when an adequate supply of water is critical for high quality production is shown in table 1 where we have also classified crop irrigation needs this selection covers highly water demanding crops with high economic returns per unit of land and thus offers promising prospects regarding income the study used a catchment area upov as a basic water management unit the upov areas belong to medium sized catchments 100 1000 km2 integration of crop water requirements water supply and specific cropland use under the present and future climates was aggregated for 1143 catchments information regarding the land cover relies on the corine land cover 2015 2020 dataset 3 data and methods the entire study was based on a cascade of models fig 1a b that utilized a carefully compiled quality controlled and homogenized dataset of daily meteorological data from 268 climatological and 787 rain gauge stations of the czech hydrometeorological institute for the period 1961 2020 these data combine all key weather variables including daily mean 2 pm maximum and minimum temperatures c daily mean air relative humidity precipitation mmday 1 global solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and wind speed ms 1 as they are used in the national drought monitoring system cz last accessed 15 october 2021 covering the whole cz with daily weather inputs interpolated to 500 500 m grids for each gridpoint land use was considered and data on slope and land exposure were taken into account in radiation and energy balance calculations for each gridpoint data on retention capacity in the individual layers soil depth and possible impact of groundwater were also available meteorological and grid specific data were used in the soilclim model to estimate soil moisture and irrigation requirements on a 500 m grid these were then aggregated for each upov and used as input for the bilan wateres hydrological models which in turn estimated the water available for irrigation the final procedure required to generate water requirements at the catchment level for the present and future climate is captured in fig 1a b to estimate the potential of irrigation water needs at the upov level the following items are required i knowledge of the crop composition which will be irrigated ideally to the level of the soil block or at least at the level of the catchment area ii the optimal composition and distribution of crops in individual catchments and soil blocks and or iii the optimal use of available water resources however in that case it is necessary to allocate moisture water for individual river basins or set priorities for its distribution e g the lowest catchment areas have the highest priority the following daily series of irrigation water requirements indicators were calculated for 1143 catchments reference evapotranspiration eto mm actual evapotranspiration eta mm growth coefficient kc

indicators were estimated by a nonparametric mann kendall trend p value 0 05 same hereafter we averaged the magnitude of changes across a range of ensemble models to reduce the effect of natural variability 3 1 quantification of crop water balance under irrigated areas to evaluate differences between the crop water availability and the atmospheric water demand for each crop we applied the soilclim tool hlavinka et al 2011 the soilclim model is based on one of the most frequently used approaches to irrigation scheduling by allen et al 1998 which has been adopted for czech conditions with some additional features e g snow cover model modification of bucket approach phenologically dependent kc and root depth values added e g hlavinka et al 2011 trnka et al 2020 similar to the original work by allen et al 1998 in this study i eto was calculated by the penman monteith method ii daily eta for each crop was calculated by multiplying kc and eto and iii differences between daily precipitation and eta were used to calculate crop water balance rain eta to determine the period of the highest crop water consumption table 1 eta was expressed as follows 1 eta eta1 eta2 2 eta1 eto kc ks1 ratio1 3 eta2 eto kc ks2 ratio2 where eta1 and eta2 are the values of actual evapotranspiration from the top layer and rootzone layer eto is the value of reference evapotranspiration kc is the coefficient describing the properties of the crop canopy and its phenological stage i e crop height and the leaf area index concerning reference grassland ks is the soil water stress coefficient expressed as ks1 and ks2 according to the availability of soil water for evapotranspiration topsoil layer and subsoil layers and ratio1 and ratio2 are the shares of water absorption from the topsoil and subsoil layers according to the relevant crop root depth the crop coefficient kc was defined based on the crop coefficient approach with possible modifications as a function of growing degree days gdd the crop coefficient kc was formulated by the following eq 4 4 kc kc tab 0 04 u2 2 0 004 rhmin 45 h 3 0 3 where k c tab was the value of kc ini kc mid or kc end rhmin was the mean daily minimum relative humidity for both mid season or late stages and h was the mean crop height m during the growing stages in mid season and late season the soil water stress coefficient ks was estimated in soilclim hlavinka et al 2011 using the fao 56 1998 approach the ks standard equation is given below 5 ks 1 for θi raw 6 k s taw d taw raw taw d 1 taw for θ i raw where taw θ fc θ wp was the total

the actual soil water content the p has been derived during calibration of the soilclim model and set at 0 3 for top layer and 0 2 for the lower soil layer based on the experimentally data driven soilclim model calibration runs hlavinka et al 2011 the ratio1 and ratio2 were based on the experimental data collected by soilclim team hlavinka pers comm and accounting for available studies e g fan

simulates the vegetation cover and considers changes in its parameters in daily time steps e g changing the rooting depth or crop height in the case of crops or the presence absence of leaves in the case of deciduous trees the changes are driven by the gdd and vernalization requirements depending on the crop cover type therefore the crop parameter k c allen et al 1998 and the root growth dynamics vary for individual vegetation covers throughout the year or the vegetation season for instance the values for kc in fig s1 are values for nonstressed crops cultivated under excellent agronomic and water management conditions and achieving maximum crop yield the establishment of individual k c parameters as well as water requirements in this study followed obligatory technical standards czech state standard 1994 which are mandatory e g for irrigation project building permits or water withdrawal permit requests tables 2 3 the rain eta in the soilclim model was calculated for each grid with a resolution of 0 5 km x 0 5 km throughout the cz then the results were aggregated into cadaster units which represent the smallest administrative area in the cz the calculation was limited to grids with agricultural land or irrigable grids for the gs of each crop as well as the time series of rain et a for individual years under optimal growth conditions rain et a50 and drought conditions rain et a10 and rain et a20 for the current and future climates 3 2 quantification of irrigation water requirement we quantified the potential irrig mm m2 for each crop gs for the current and future climates all calculations of irrig were performed at the level of individual grids in a daily step and an irrigation dose was applied whenever the saturation of the current root layer fell below 30 retention capacity i e the lower limit was reached subsequently from the area of selected grids with irrigation we calculated the sum of water that must be supplied in the topsoil 0 40 cm awr1 and rootzone 0 100 cm awr layers the abbreviation awr stands for the relative content of plant available water and is expressed in where 0 is reached at the wilting point and 100 at field capacity the root depth during gs was dynamically simulated by a crop growth model that was incorporated into soilclim the soil moisture available to plants was calculated as the difference between soil moisture at field capacity and wilting point multiplied by layer depth the indicators of awr1 50 and awr 50 were calculated as productive irrigation while awr1 30 and awr 30 were calculated as maintenance irrigation i e ensuring the survival of the commodity a special regime was used for weeks when the value of the irrigation efficiency factor taken from the czech state standard 1994 table s1 for a given week and a given crop indicated an efficiency factor higher than 40 which means a significant effect of irrigation on economic yield this means that the awr1 and awr for the whole gs are always greater than 0 3 and if the irrigation efficiency is greater than 40 mm each week the soil moisture level is kept at a level equal to or greater than 0 5 in these cases the saturation of the root layer was maintained at least 50 irrigation designed in this way would be relatively very effective the frequency of soil dry days is defined as awr1 awr 50 3 3 quantification of the ratio of actual and reference evapotranspiration the ratio of actual and reference evapotranspiration et ratio provided basic information on the potential water deficit and its course within the gs for the entire territory of the cz we focused on the quantification of et ratio for each crop during current and future climates we calculated the long term time series for individual years normal years and 5 yr and 10 yr droughts i e in the sense of the highest water demands 3 4 estimating the number of days with required irrigation to quantify the frequency of water deficit during gs that may result in drought the number of days where etratio awr1 and awr met specific threshold criteria was calculated the number of days with an et ratio 0 4 was chosen as the indicator of drought stress i e a state where we can assume a significant lack of moisture in the root layer and the soil moisture content is below the point of reduced availability therefore plant growth is beginning to be limited by water to express the available soil moisture for each crop in the root layer of the soil the number of days with awr1 30 awr1 50 and awr 30 awr 50 was calculated to assess areas with critically low water supply gis based high resolution mapping of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the number of days for awr1 30 awr1 50 awr 30 and awr 50 was applied the results were processed as average overall catchments as the 10th and 25th percentiles for obs sc1 and sc2 awr1 10 30 awr1 10 50 awr 25 30 and awr25 50 in the sense of the highest depletion of soil moisture 3 5 estimating the availability of water resources to catchments this section describes the stepwise iterative calculation of irrigable areas for selected commodities the available water sources were estimated daily based on the bilan wateres hydrological models vizina et al 2015 melišová et al 2020 this model runs in daily steps with precipitation mean temperatures and humidity as necessary inputs time series of total runoff direct runoff plus baseflow actual evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater storage are among the outputs a more in depth description of the model can be seen in melišova 2020 the site specific outputs are routed using muskingum cunge and dam operational rules in wateres the process flowchart is shown in fig 1a the calculations considered the impact of both the water management system and real extractions and discharges compatibility between bilan wateres and soilclim parameters e g available water in the soil was ensured by common input parameters aggregated to the upov level the bilan model corresponds very well with soil profile moisture from the soilclim model to a depth of 1 m for better interpretability the management of water resources and their availability were analyzed both at the level of individual catchments i e each catchment manages only its resources and at the level of systems i e each upov has water resources obtained by optimized management within the water system areas with the highest quality soil will be selected as a priority for the implementation of irrigation the available water in each catchment was divided into individual grids and water was initially distributed to irrigable grids by the creditworthiness of the soil if the water in the given catchment basin was sufficient to cover the requirements of all irrigable grids the moisture was subsequently distributed to other grids according to the soil quality twenty percent of this available amount was subtracted to cover losses during the transport of water to irrigated land finally the output of the calculation was a potentially irrigable area the calculation for the sources of available water in each upov and subsequently at the eight subbasins upper and middle labe elbe berounka upper vltava lower vltava lower labe elbe and ohře odra oder morava and dyje thaya was compared the suitability of chosen crop cultivation in the given catchment area was not considered in the calculations 3 6 estimating irrigation characteristics for 15 sensitive commodities under the future climate all future climate estimates were based on rcp4 5 which describes possible future changes under radiative forcing changing by 4 5 wm 2 by 2100 based on the validation of the individual global climate models gcms from the cmip5 database and regional climate from the euro cordex giorgi and gutowski 2015 initiative the gcms were found to better represent the climate projection uncertainty instead of using daily data from gcms directly the delta approach method for more details see trnka et al 2016 was used to obtain daily climate data for each 500 500 m grid for the 2031 2050 and 2061 2080 periods the differences deltas between the control period and future projections of individual gcms were used to modify the observed weather data series this was done according to the methodology described by dubrovsky et al 2014 the rcp4 5 and climatic sensitivity of 3 0 c were used out of the cmip 5 database taylor et al 2011 of 40 global circulation models only five gcms were used the ipsl institute of pierre simone laplace france was found to best represent the centroid of the future temperature and precipitation values over the territory of the cz the four remaining models were found through dubrovsky et al s 2014 methodology to best capture the variability

hadgem hadley center global environment model uk 4 results 4 1 patterns of crop water consumption and irrigation requirements under future climate change scenarios changes in crop water consumption and irrigation water requirements under optimal growth conditions and drought stress in the sc1 and sc2 periods of the 21st century relative to the obs period are averaged in tables 4 6 the largest change in projected water use indicators for some commodities can be seen in sc1 while the smallest change is seen in sc2 models project minor changes in the future soil moisture at the rootzone and topsoil across the country due to differences in climatic factors soil properties and crop types moreover models tend to project a nonnegligible reduction in the relative soil moisture indicators in topsoil in drought years table 4 the awr1 decreased for orchards vineyards hopyards and fodder crops under mid century conditions even in potato planting areas the awr1 was generally higher yet the deficit of rain et a was higher than that of fodder crops the frequency of days with a lack of soil moisture differs significantly among crops with the highest for orchards and fodder crops fig s2a f awr1 50 ranged from 15 to 30 days in the obs 28 42 days for sc1 and 32 48 days for sc2 for orchards in the mean gs the spatiotemporal distribution of crop water consumption fig 2a c and irrigation water requirements fig 2d f were also determined the future water consumption of hopyards apples and vineyards was predominantly negative which means that within the overall growing season the rain et a was not sufficiently met and the assessed crops were exposed to water stress broadly similar anomalies with the highest frequency of drought stress days with et ratio 0 4 fig s3a c and et ratio 0 5 fig s3d f occurred for hopyards and vineyards while the lowest number of days with drought stress occurred for vegetable commodities compared to nonirrigated crops cherries or apples however the water content in the deeper layers of the soil after irrigated vegetables is still higher due to the shorter growth time and shallower root system irrespective of scenario onion 50 mm and cauliflower 50 mm presented greater water demand than the other vegetables in the case of garlic there was a reduction in water demands for both scenarios the moisture deficit of carrots increases in traditional cultivated areas which indicates that carrots have one of the highest water demands among the root vegetables 6500 m3 ha 1 and are susceptible to water shortages during the early development stages positive values of irrig indicate an increase in irrigation demands for the majority of the crops throughout the century tables 5 6 averaged results from five gcms for orchards show that irrig would increase by 14 5 in the 2030s average for sc1 and 10 2 in the 2080s average for sc2 relative to the observed period irrig for vineyards will increase by 8 2 in the 2030s and 4 4 in the 2080s for hopyards irrig would change by 25 under sc1 which is 2 2 3 5 more water than for vineyards over the 2030s the increased irrig under drought conditions would be larger in the hopyards which is 2 2 more water than the observed period for 2031 2050 there is a 50 chance that the extreme irrig for vineyards will become 1 0 1 5 times that of obs moreover the required amount of irrig was increased by 20 for losses in water transport by the valid czech state standard 1994 4 2 trends of projection water use indicators the changes in trend magnitudes of water use indicators were comparatively higher during the 2030s than during the 2080s figs 3 4 figs s4 7 however the results for some commodities were related to initially small decreasing trends sc1 followed later by large increasing trends sc2 in water use indicators for an observed period the trends of soil moisture at the topsoil of sensitive commodities were already decreased by up to 15 however there are significant differences between the magnitude of trends of individual commodities in the projection awr1 and awr indicators a statistically significant decrease in the trend of awr1 and awr 3 9 to 6 3 10 yr was detected during the gs of each crop by the 25th percentiles during the 2030s the magnitude of the changes for the two future periods for the number of days with awr 50 50 awr 25 50 awr1 50 50 and awr1 25 50 exhibited an increase of up to 17 which was linked to the steep decline in soil moisture fig s6 such behavior is closely related to the increasing trends of warming 0 51 0 99 c decade in daily soil temperature series at all depths and in all seasons in the cz potopová et al 2021a 2021b which was also linked to the sharp decline in soil moisture similar results have been found for trends of et ratio50 under optimal growth conditions and drought years with values of et ratio25 further water use indicators also identified a prevalence of moisture deficit rain et a under drought years by 20 0 mm and 50 0 mm for orchards and vineyards respectively and by 5 3 mm and 40 0 mm for vegetables respectively for the 2030s compared to the observed period fig 4a b the averaged results for apples apricots and peaches show that the magnitudes of irrig trends in the mid 21st century would increase by 30 mm decade comparing the irrig results among crops we identified two patterns fig 4a b first there is a generally stronger increase in irrigation water requirements for orchards fodder and hopyards than for vegetable and potato commodities due to longer gs lengths to fulfill the respective crop production goals second analyzing each irrigation indicator separately this irrig trend is strengthened by the climate impact on soil atmosphere drought conditions which leads to increasing demand for the irrigated area 4 3 spatiotemporal distributions of crop irrigation water requirements for sensitive commodities key results of irrigation water requirements for 15 crops are mapped in figs 5 7 using the multimodel mean time series of irrigation characteristics of vegetables garlic onion carrot pepper cucumber cauliflower and cabbage for 1961 2020 2031 2050 and 2061 2080 are mapped fig 5a f here projected irrigation water requirements range from 10 mm per irrigated grid cell in the brassicas cauliflower and cabbage and root producing carrot regions to 100 mm per irrigated grid cell in the fruiting vegetable producing region pepper cucumber which can be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of climate parameters we find that the potential irrigation areas increase in the brassicas and root producing regions for 2031 2050 a more significant increase in irrig 50 of the bulb vegetables was expected in all the cultivated regions especially for garlic and onion which reflects the predominantly rain fed system of cultivation the lowest et ratio was found to be the dominant type of adverse event for pepper and cucumber production regions due to its effect on increased soil water demand which increased transpiration rates potopová et al 2017 whereas changes in irrigation water requirements were associated with minimal increases due to short growing season cauliflower and cabbage vegetables are widely irrigated but irrigation does not fully mitigate drought effects hence rain et a50 variability largely controls crop production in growing catchments although current potato planting areas have soils with high available water capacity as apparent from fig 6a early potatoes will become controlled by the water deficit over the next few decades these changes will be driven by an increase in et ratio combined with low values of awr1 and awr a higher potato potential water deficit area was detected in the berounka lower vltava odra lower labe and ohře river subbasins when rain et a affected most potato production regions the area of potatoes with a suboptimal soil moisture regime increased threefold to 25 in the 2031 2050 period while the area of potatoes on soils with high available water capacity decreased fig 6b illustrates the spatial patterns of the most risk prone areas for each of these irrigation indicators over vineyard production regions for the mid century the greatest increases would occur in critical thresholds of the rain et a et ratio and awr1 for catchments of the middle and lower labe berounka the ohře river odra river morava and dyje river basins the results of rain et a and et ratio are influenced by growth dynamics and the different onset of phenological phases but also by differences in the ability of the soil to retain water therefore 15 and 25 of irrigation water will be lost by evaporation from the soil surface in the morava and dyje river basins during the 2030s and 2080s respectively for the end century the increasing rate of et a exceeds that of precipitation across the grapevine production region which will inevitably aggravate awr1 and awr however the et a and awr in the rootzone tend to show a reduced irrig due to decreases in transpiration and increases in water use efficiency fig 6c documents the median irrigation during hop gs for obs and two future periods under rcp4 5 for the 2030s in žatec the main traditional hop region we project the highest depletion of soil moisture values of awr1 to decrease by 25 and in tršice and úštěcko hop regions to decrease by 5 and 9 respectively this means that summer irrigation is essential for maintaining adequate soil moisture levels fig 6d documents the median irrigation characteristics during the gs of alfalfa for hay in forage production regions under the current and future climates the lowest values of rain et a 11 50 mm etratio 0 62 0 64 awr 75 1 80 and awr1 60 1 65 occurred frequently throughout the grassland regions during both scenarios however the highest irrigation water demand for the same period ranged from 15 1 to 25 mm this change consequently led to water deficits and could result in yield depressions for productive grasslands which were indeed observed e g during the 2015 summer drought žalud et al 2017 fig 7a d demonstrates the magnitude of the difference in irrigable area between trees here the lowest values of rain et a 101 to 50 mm etratio 0 42 0 45 awr 44 8 60 and awr1 42 7 50 occurred mainly throughout the orchard regions in future scenarios conversely the highest irrigation water demand ranged from 80 1 to 116 mm these results indicate that the functions of water use indicators within fruit trees can adapt to high depletion of soil moisture if the trees are sufficiently irrigated the higher water consumption in the case of apple trees compared to other crops is due to their long vegetation and relatively high irrigation efficiency at a time when water resources are generally insufficient table s1 4 4 mapping the extreme water requirement indicators the maps of the extreme irrigation characteristics that reflect the highest depletion of soil moisture and the highest water demands are shown in fig 8a f fig s8 the results of this section were not to determine the real irrigation needs but to outline the area with the potential highest water requirement in over irrigation hotspots the higher risk areas for orchards and vineyards are widespread covering more than 25 of the country due to exceedance of thresholds for both high depletion of soil moisture and water demands in most catchments while risk areas where et ratio 0 4 exceeds the threshold are found mainly in hopyards maps from fig 8a fig s8 illustrate spatial patterns of the most risk prone areas for each of these indicators which have varied relevance across a range of vegetables and overlay observed and future periods growing vegetables with supplemental irrigation would be presumed on 33 of upovs toward the middle of the century the sharp increase in areas with days et ratio 0 4 and awr1 50 extremely limited water availability has been most apparent for onion in the catchments of the lower labe and ohře the middle labe lower vltava morava and dyje overall the results suggest that onion conditions are generally likely to become less favorable without irrigation the current suitable cultivated proportion of brassicas producing regions will be reduced by the 2050s due to large water deficits by the end of the century 28 2 of upovs increased the number of days with the highest depletion of topsoil moisture awr1 30 and awr1 50 for late cabbage and cauliflower 160 m2 ha 1 per tonne yield the high numbers of days with et ratio 0 4 resulted in cucumber and pepper fruit qualities 150 m2 ha 1 per tonne yield that were more sensitive to short drought stress during the fruit setting stage in all producing regions we find a relatively similar but more pronounced result for potato water requirement indicators fig 8b the projected future anomalies of the number of days with the highest depletion of soil moisture will increase at approximately two thirds of the upovs in the topsoil layer awr1 30 awr1 50 by the end of the 21st century compared to the obs the number of days with water deficit et ratio 0 4 for vineyards was projected to increase with deficit irrigation and would require supplemental irrigation up to 22 fig 8c the number of expected days with the highest depletion of topsoil moisture for vineyards will be approximately 27 of upovs for the period 2031 2050 and 15 of upovs for 2061 2080 this increase in soil water stress will harm sunburn risks and will be strongly related to vintage quality sugar color and aroma these findings agree with those of trnka et al 2021 who reported that the extent of grapevine production regions is considerable as is the massive increase in the warmer and drier regional conditions of grapevines maps of the number of days with water use indicators of hopyards for the observed and two future periods are shown in fig 8d changes in future hopyard irrigation extent and amounts may have important implications in largely cropped irrigation hotspots approximately 22 of the hilly catchment areas would require supplemental irrigation while in the lowland catchment areas these percentages reached 28 35 we determined that days with water deficit occurred 1 3 times per gs in the observed period while in the 2031 2050 and 2061 2080 periods days with water deficit occurred more than 2 4 times even with the modest warming thus far experienced yields have stagnated and quality has declined this fact means further expenses and higher water requirements in over irrigation hotspots for premium beer production potopová et al 2021a the spatial distribution of the extreme water requirement indicators of alfalfa for hay under current and future climates is documented in fig 8e maps of the number of days with et ratio 0 4 35 42 days and awr1 50 65 135 days define areas where an extreme lack of soil moisture occurs with fodder production to keep the optimum demand for the livestock sector areas with significant water requirements are evident as there is a significantly higher need for production and maintenance irrigation in south moravian than in other regions these indicators also suggest the economic risk of attaining sustainable fodder production in the regions with the most developed animal production south bohemian region and vysočina region thus there will be insufficient fodder supply to the livestock sector due to any water stress during the production season under climate change conditions at the same time a substantial increase in the amount of water consumed by livestock is expected in areas vulnerable because of water scarcity regional differences in orchards with water use indicators are shown in fig 8f fig s16 even though two regions are expecting strong increases in the number of days with high depletion of soil moisture awr1 30 and water demands et ratio 0 4 i e central bohemia 25 and south moravia 47 the total amount of irrigation water requirements decreases by 5 as these two regions only have a small share of the total water requirements for orchards thus irrigation is helpful to maintain the regular functioning of photosynthesis and carbohydrate translocation even under drought stress conditions the increase in the number of days with et ratio 0 4 and 0 5 for the years 2061 2080 relative to 1961 2020 is likely to be in the range of 10 25 days unless countermeasures are taken in orchard regions a high number of days with depletion of soil moisture can lead to dramatically decreasing yields 4 5 comparison of available water resources and estimated irrigation needs for the assessment of water resources three categories of conditions normal 5 yr and 10 yr drought were used based on current water demands and irrigation projections for apple trees water intensive and cabbage under current climatic conditions 1961 2020 and projected climatic conditions according to 5 different climate models fig 9a b fig 10a b within the scenario of the current demands real withdrawals are considered instead of the permitted withdrawals which are approximately 40 higher in the cz within the hydrological and water balance modeling process we tried to answer the question of whether there are at least theoretical water resources in the cz in individual upovs that could cover possible higher demands for irrigation fig 9a b shows available water resources for each upov under normal conditions and drought periods only the minimum residual flows balvín et al 2021 from the reservoirs until full retention capacity or the interbasin and the demand for all water uses i e surface and groundwater extractions the wet gcms simulate comparable results of available water resources with current conditions irrigation needs for cabbage while the remaining gcms simulate a decline from 18 to 26 in water resources for both horizons especially for dry periods when no water resources are available in most of the area water resources are available only in the mountainous areas of the cz which are not suitable for agriculture and the lower elbe river the available water resources are mainly in the first half of the hydrological year november september and therefore do not occur at the same time as the gs in the cz during which time there are water deficits especially where there is insufficient water management infrastructure the modeling results were aggregated into eight subbasins and for the whole cz fig 10a b depict available water resources irrigation needs for cabbage for subbasins that are decreasing or are not available under current conditions available water resources decrease the most in normal and wet years provided that this water is available for example the decrease in the dyje thaya basin according to all gcms ranges from 44 million m3 20 of available water resources to 145 m3 64 in a normal year it should be noted that water resources are still very limited or almost unavailable in the subbasins of the berounka dyje and morava rivers since larger reservoirs are not present the change in available resources is also related to their deficits figs s10 11 shows the deficits for current and future climatic conditions based on current needs and the needs for irrigation of apple trees and cabbage for current needs the water deficits vary in units of percent for all gcms when irrigation is considered the deficits increase even for wet gcms for the bnu hadgem2 and ipsl models the change in deficit is almost double for the period 2061 2080 figs s10 11 show aggregated available water for the cz which remains almost the same under the cnrm and mri gcms and decreases significantly for the bnu ipsl and hadgem2 gcms these declines are observed throughout and as mentioned occur primarily in the first half of the hydrologic year without water management infrastructure these resources cannot then be used particularly in the second half of the growing season simulations of the hydrological and water balance according to the 5 gcms indicate that the main catalyst for changes in the natural water regime in the cz is the change in air temperature as the main proxy for evapotranspiration where the water regime changes significantly in the summer months 30 50 decrease and the streams are mainly supported by baseflow and direct runoff an increase in runoff of 10 30 can be expected in the winter months due to changes in the total amount of snowpack the hydrological model estimates a significant decrease up to 40 based on the chosen gcm in the median annual flow compared to 1961 2020 up to 55 in drought periods this phenomenon is predicted across all river basins with a more pronounced decline in catchments prone to produce water deficit thaya and berounka crop specific irrigation needs produce shifts in units of a percent to this value to meet the increased irrigation needs it will be necessary to retain this water so that it can be used later in the year especially in catchments where this infrastructure is lacking 5 discussion in our study we implemented hydrological models with crop models that consider future crop production developments and climate data of the entire gs and compute the most suitable crop for each raster cell within upov in this kind of research there are two main constraints i cropland area and length of gs would remain unmodified by climate change however considering the future higher temperatures potopová et al 2018 zahradníček et al 2020 both patterns might change and ii these results represent just one realization of the possible future irrigation water requirements therefore our focus was to discuss the uncertainties related to the choice of the model and scenario the soilclim model has been shown to explain between 74 and 80 of the daily eta variability measured by eddy covariance and bowen ratio systems over 3 sites and 6 crops with root mean square errors rmses ranging from 0 49 and 0 99 mm day trnka et al 2015a 2015b soilclim also performed well at the lysimetric station hirschstetten in austria over several years for three soils explaining up to 63 topsoil and 74 subsoil of the observed soil moisture with rmses ranging from 2 82 to 4 23 for both layers under field conditions we found soilclim to explain 63 of topsoil and 74 of subsoil soil moisture variability trnka et al 2015a soilclim reproduces well changes in the long term soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil especially during april to september periods i e the window critical for irrigation soilclim also reproduced well trends in the reference evapotranspiration proxy i e pan evaporation between 1968 and 2010 trnka et al 2015b soilclim was shown to explain over 62 of the daily topsoil soil moisture variability for april september during 1961 2018 at doksany station this is an improvement of over 55 reported for the 1961 2012 period by trnka et al 2015a arising from using the improved soil parametrization of soilclim used in this study the soilclim model has also been used several times in combination with the gcm models and coupled with the bilan model before this irrigation study in a number of other regions vizina et al 2015 trnka et al 2016 melišová et al 2020 the comparison of projected irrigation characteristics with other studies is difficult due to the different climate models used in our study which reach different levels of regional warming toward the end of the 21st century mri wet and cold cnmr wettest and hot ipsl hot bnu cold and hadgem dry and hot another problem is that the projection of 21st century irrigation water requirements and available water for sensitive agricultural crop commodities across the cz has not yet been thoroughly assessed there is also the issue that decreases in water consumption in current irrigation water requirements in many upovs were not based on a reduction in the water demands of crops but only on the decline in irrigation equipment more detailed information on the categorization of crop water balance is provided by duffková et al 2020 who showed that over 80 of spring crop regions in the cz were threatened with medium to severe water scarcity another study conducted in the southern part of the cz lamačová et al 2018 projected future water balance scenarios under rcp4 5 for the periods of 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 both studies underline that the growing trend for the occurrence of dry periods will lead to the expansion of irrigated fields in addition the water supply within both underground and surface resources has been declining there is concern about whether there will be enough water for irrigation in dry years duffková et al 2020 the estimation of potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration in cmip5 multimodel future projections for europe was also discussed by dezsi et al 2018 the study concluded that eto increases by approximately 50 100 mm by the 2020s and approximately 75 125 mm by the 2050s for europe another challenge lies in the representation of how crop cover affects actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions concerning changes under rising temperature and co2 levels dusenge et al 2019 lenka et al 2020 2021 our mapping results figs 5 7 demonstrated that the changes in awr and awr1 under nonirrigated arable land permanently irrigated land and complex cultivation patterns may not be monotonic rather it is possible that in some croplands soil moisture might first increase in response to increasing precipitation but then decrease because et0 may increase faster than precipitation as temperature rises cook et al 2015 chen et al 2018 the topsoil may have a lower water loss probably due to the decreased evaporation from the soil surface under irrigated vegetables in contrast to alfalfa for hay orchards and vineyards where the soil has permanent plant cover the low water content of the root zone limits the et a to rates below the potential and the reduction in et o due to increasing co2 has a relatively high impact on the optimization of irrigation water productivity therefore the et ratio is a good indicator for designing irrigation scheduling in agricultural water management especially for vegetables where the water supply is mainly through irrigation in this case the variations in et ratio are highly influenced by irrigation water supply especially under different irrigation levels since the depth of 60 cm represents a limit for most types of vegetables where the roots almost no longer penetrate it is evident that the greatest economic effect of irrigation occurs in years with 5 yr and 10 yr drought this would consequently lead to water deficits and the possibility of irrigation provides benefits in drought years when the full water capacity to guarantee a high yield will be 70 on lighter to medium soils and 55 40 on heavy soils however it is precisely in these crops that efficient irrigation systems especially drip irrigation can be used which offsets the relatively higher need for awr by higher irrigation efficiency this finding was consistent with siebert et al 2017 and thiery et al 2020 who emphasized that irrigated crops which account for more than 40 of global yields benefited from capped temperature extremes however these favorable influences only occurred because the irrigation extent more than quadrupled during the 20th century in the areas with low soil retention capacity the stabilizing effect of irrigation on hops and orchards is evident with a relatively small increase in water consumption tsuchida and yakushiji 2017 related that the dry weight of apricot trees declined over an approximately 3 month period of drought stress therefore a period of drought stress longer than two months is likely to cause visible tree growth inhibition cherry trees under dry soil conditions resulted in decreased accumulation of carbohydrates irrigated apricot trees maintained a high leaf water potential photosynthetic rate and et ratio rate regardless of lower awr1 and awr the largest effect in the expected climate is irrigation for fodder crops which is partly due to the highest water demands however it is evident that the greatest economic effect of irrigation occurs in years with 5 yr and 10 yr drought however in these years the risk of lack of moisture will be significantly higher the same results were achieved by žalud et al 2017 and trnka et al 2015 2020 2021 at the pan european level schaldach et al 2012 highlighted that changes in the irrigated area between 2000 and 2050 increase by 18 from 181 202 km2 to 214 028 km2 6 conclusion this research combined the existing national irrigation standard with the well calibrated soilclim model and bilan wateres hydrological models to develop projections of irrigation water requirements under future climate conditions the study identified regions with likely increases in irrigation water requirements due to climate change additionally catchments that would not be able to support such an increase in the water demand with the existing water reservoir infrastructure were demarcated most water consumption catchments were detected in lowland catchments with high farm stocking rates characterized by the highest frequency of days with a lack of soil moisture and days with high irrigation needs in the current climatic conditions and the normal year at least 90 of the water sources for existing irrigation systems can be ensured from existing water sources except for some catchments in the dyje river basin with an increase in drought events with a probability of 5 yr it is impossible to satisfy the demands on water resources in the dyje river basin south moravia and in the rakovnicka and louny regions central bohemia during drought events with a probability of 10 yr significant problems will manifest in several catchments in the upper elbe and upper vltava regions vegetable crops have relatively lower requirements while orchards are very demanding the average irrigation water requirement will increase by 10 2 and the water requirement will be higher in orchards

9719,this study quantified the crop water consumption crop specific irrigation requirements and availability of water resources to catchments under climate change in the czech republic cz within the soilclim model and bilan wateres hydrological water balance modeling process we tried to answer the question of whether there are at least theoretical water resources in the individual catchments of the cz that could cover possible higher demands for irrigation an ensemble of five global climate models under the moderate representative concentration pathway rcp4 5 from the euro cordex initiative was chosen to project the future water use indicators the irrigation water requirement indicators for the growing season gs of vineyards hop gardens orchards vegetables and fodder crops were calculated in 1143 catchments for two periods 2031 2050 sc1 and 2061 2080 sc2 compared to the observed period 1961 2020 obs to project irrigation scenarios in agricultural water management the following water use indicators were quantified relative soil moisture at 0 40 cm awr1 and 0 100 cm awr crop water balance rain et a irrigation water requirement irrig and the ratio of actual and reference evapotranspiration et ratio to assess areas with a critically low water supply and quantify the frequency of water deficit during the gs of each crop we calculated the number of days with extreme values of water use indicators quantification of the extreme irrigation characteristics reflected the highest depletion of soil moisture and the highest water demands i e when the assessed indicators reached the 25th percentiles for highly marketable vegetables the largest deficit in rain et a during the gs for sc1 was projected if current vegetable growing areas and cropping systems remain unchanged irrig will increase by 10 2 by the end of the 21st century under rcp4 5 although current potato planting areas have soils with a high available water capacity they will become controlled by the water deficit over the next few decades the accumulated vineyard water required suggests that 15 and 25 of irrigation water will be lost by evaporation from the soil surface during the 2030s and 2080s respectively however changes in future hopyard irrigation extent and amounts may have important implications in largely cropped irrigation hotspots in the main traditional hop region for the 2030s we project a 25 depletion of soil moisture and an increase of et ratio 0 4 by up to 5 3 the projection of a high frequency of days with an et ratio 0 4 and awr1 30 for fodder crops was related to the most risk prone areas with an extreme lack of moisture in the regions with the most developed animal production thus there will be insufficient fodder supply to the livestock sector due to any water stress during the production season under climate change conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords crop water consumption crop specific irrigation requirements water use

40 of the world s food supply cody 2018 approximately 70 of global water consumption is used for irrigation of crops wisser et al 2008 and harmonization of water requirements with limited water resources is a significant political dilemma grafton et al 2018 water saving irrigation has benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as for sustainable economic development zou et al 2013 thiery et al 2020 irrigation water demand has increased in recent decades drastig et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in connection with anthropogenic climate change water requirements for crop irrigation are likely to increase with considerable regional variation and irrigation requirements might increase to such an extent that established regional agricultural practices might be challenging to retain in some regions riediger et al 2016 wang et al 2016 excessive irrigation leads to drainage problems so reduced irrigation strategies need to be implemented to protect water resources mondaca duarte et al 2020 for example the mediterranean region could save 35 of water by implementing more efficient irrigation and conveyance systems fader et al 2016 at the same time irrigation influences many land components it modulates the terrestrial water budget shah et al 2019 and affects local hydrological and energy cycles de vrese et al 2016 as well as weather and climate conditions chen et al 2018 cook et al 2015 especially hot extremes thiery et al 2020 potopová et al 2021a 2021b while global warming increases the likelihood of hot extremes almost globally irrigation can regionally cancel or even reverse the effects of all other forcing combined cook et al 2015 chen et al 2018 it seems likely that demand and supply can be brought into a sustainable balance only by changing and moderating the pattern of requirements by introducing new sources of supply or both cody 2018 earlier studies dusenge et al 2019 have already described the effect of elevated co2 on plant growth as a result of climate change but the effects on crop water use and water use efficiency are less studied lenka et al 2020 2021 few studies have projected future impacts of climate change land use change and changes in water consumption on water resources for the european continent schaldach et al 2012 bisselink et al 2020 wriedt et al 2009 simulated irrigation water requirements in europe taking into account the spatial distribution of crops soil conditions climate and crop management riediger et al 2016 modeled a generally increasing water demand with increasing temperatures in the northern german plain that is most likely of equal relevance for central european regions southern european countries are projected to face decreasing water availability sordo ward et al 2019 potopová et al 2019 2020 central and northern european countries show increasing annual water availability van vliet et al 2015 but projected temperature and precipitation changes show large subannual variability trnka et al 2015a 2015b 2020 žalud et al 2017 zahradníček et al 2020 therefore a seasonal assessment of both water availability and demand should be undertaken for farmland management pfister et al 2020 regional implications of global climate change will likely affect evapotranspiration which is an important aspect of crop cultivation and the most important influence on irrigation requirements for central european regions even today compound climate events and less developed irrigation systems are significant issues in the agriculture of the czech republic trnka et al 2014 duffková et al 2019 potopová et al 2021a 2021b balvín et al 2021 the required amount of irrigation water depends on how much water the cultivation of a particular crop type requires and how much water is available from local sources el naggar et al 2020 therefore irrigation requirements estimated by independent modeling approaches will be useful to assist in irrigation planning and water management at high spatial resolution with large geographical coverage recently improved detail in water use scenarios nadal and flexas 2019 which foreshadow possible future water consumption in europe bisselink et al 2020 further open new opportunities for an integrated assessment of water resources machlica et al 2012 hanel et al 2014 melišová et al 2020 vyskoč et al 2021 large scale irrigation modeling to investigate water availability has made significant progress in recent years e g perea et al 2018 dang et al 2020 and there is still a need to better assess future crop water consumption two different modeling frameworks have been applied to analyze their suitability for simulating time series of crop specific irrigation requirements the first framework refers to soft coupling a dynamic vegetation model with a land use model yalew et al 2018 whereas the second framework relies on conceptual modeling of crop evapotranspiration zhao et al 2019 bastiaanssen et al 2007 provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of irrigation modeling by many methods direct observations are often used for comparison of measured temperatures and precipitation within different areas or seasons and evaluation of spatial temporal changes e g fowler and helvey 1974 or an assessment of crop yields kresovic et al 2014 models and simulations are commonly used to study the influence of different parameters on complex systems de vrese and hagemann 2018 for example the effect of irrigation on hydrology sorooshian et al 2014 the effects of climate change climatic variability and water trade on irrigation operations king et al 2019 the influence of heatwaves on vegetation boeck et al 2016 irrigation water requirements döll and siebert 2002 and crop coefficients mahmoud and gan 2019 can all be studied by different types of models the results of these analyses can be used for example for planning and management of sustainable water use in different regions mahmoud and gan 2019 or for adopting policy responses to reduce climate change impacts wang et al 2016 the influence of irrigation on vegetation health and land surface temperature ambika and mishra 2019 or the spatial and temporal distribution of evapotranspiration mahmoud and gan 2019 can also be studied by remote sensing methods the effect of the management system on irrigation efficiency largely depends on the socioeconomic factors of the country in the czech republic cz the water management system is marked by intensive agriculture large settlement and intensive human activities as well as by extensive artificial modifications of watercourses and floodplains although there are 76 000 km of watercourses in total of which approximately 15 300 km is important for the management of water resources and approximately 60 700 km of other small watercourses the majority of watercourses drain into neighboring states moreover the long term fluctuations in climatic variables are reflected in the variabilities of river streamflow and water level that have relatively short residence times therefore our hypothesis assumes that the current and future available water resources are not sufficient for optimal crop growth with the highest water requirements according to their water demand in the cz the main aim was to project the water demands and irrigation strategies for vineyards hop gardens orchards areas with vegetables and fodder crops under climate change at the catchment level the objectives of this study were i to project water needs to cover the moisture deficit and water need to ensure stable yields of fodder orchards vineyards hop gardens and vegetables for two periods 2031 2050 sc1 and 2061 2080 sc2 compared to the observed period 1961 2020 obs ii to identify deficit areas and distribution of water needs for the growing season gs of 15 crops iii to quantify the extreme irrigation characteristics to reflect the highest depletion of soil moisture the most negative water balance and the highest water demands for the obs sc1 and sc2 periods and iv to quantify the availability of water resources to catchments and the contribution of the use of irrigation systems to mitigate the effects of drought 2 target area and their irrigation system the target area of this study is the cz a dry warming country in central europe with a less developed irrigation system alterations in water deficit and water excess events are becoming common even during the same year e g 2020 and the balance between water supply and demand is becoming fragile according to the predictions of the models under rcp4 5 the lowest precipitation totals for various recurrence intervals of 5 yr were 170 mm for the 2041 2060 period whereas the highest precipitation totals for 100 yr were 311 mm for the 2021 2040 period dolák et al 2017 the improvement of drainage and irrigation systems the conservation of water and the use of water saving technologies seem to be crucial for farmers adaptation measures therefore we aim to provide new results about interactions between irrigation and farming systems for the current and future climate over the cz approximately 160 000 ha of irrigation is built in the fertile and driest areas of the country of which 88 000 ha is in czech lands and 72 000 ha is in moravia the national irrigation system is usually limited to crops that cannot be grown without irrigation or that gain more value through irrigation vegetables early potatoes hops orchards and vineyards the sprinkler irrigation system dominates but approximately 4000 ha of drip irrigation is applied for vegetable crops most of the irrigation systems approximately 127 000 ha were privatized in 1997 and 1998 at present approximately 40 of the original extent of irrigation systems is in use while the remaining portion is not operated the water demand was evaluated in the irrigated grid area for the following crops potatoes garlic onion carrot peppers cucumbers cauliflower cabbage apple trees peaches cherries apricots alfalfa for hay and hop the gs of crop growth when an adequate supply of water is critical for high quality production is shown in table 1 where we have also classified crop irrigation needs this selection covers highly water demanding crops with high economic returns per unit of land and thus offers promising prospects regarding income the study used a catchment area upov as a basic water management unit the upov areas belong to medium sized catchments 100 1000 km2 integration of crop water requirements water supply and specific cropland use under the present and future climates was aggregated for 1143 catchments information regarding the land cover relies on the corine land cover 2015 2020 dataset 3 data and methods the entire study was based on a cascade of models fig 1a b that utilized a carefully compiled quality controlled and homogenized dataset of daily meteorological data from 268 climatological and 787 rain gauge stations of the czech hydrometeorological institute for the period 1961 2020 these data combine all key weather variables including daily mean 2 pm maximum and minimum temperatures c daily mean air relative humidity precipitation mmday 1 global solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and wind speed ms 1 as they are used in the national drought monitoring system cz last accessed 15 october 2021 covering the whole cz with daily weather inputs interpolated to 500 500 m grids for each gridpoint land use was considered and data on slope and land exposure were taken into account in radiation and energy balance calculations for each gridpoint data on retention capacity in the individual layers soil depth and possible impact of groundwater were also available meteorological and grid specific data were used in the soilclim model to estimate soil moisture and irrigation requirements on a 500 m grid these were then aggregated for each upov and used as input for the bilan wateres hydrological models which in turn estimated the water available for irrigation the final procedure required to generate water requirements at the catchment level for the present and future climate is captured in fig 1a b to estimate the potential of irrigation water needs at the upov level the following items are required i knowledge of the crop composition which will be irrigated ideally to the level of the soil block or at least at the level of the catchment area ii the optimal composition and distribution of crops in individual catchments and soil blocks and or iii the optimal use of available water resources however in that case it is necessary to allocate moisture water for individual river basins or set priorities for its distribution e g the lowest catchment areas have the highest priority the following daily series of irrigation water requirements indicators were calculated for 1143 catchments reference evapotranspiration eto mm actual evapotranspiration eta mm growth coefficient kc relative soil moisture 0 40 cm awr1 and 0 100 cm awr crop water balance rain eta mm irrigation water requirement irrig mm and the ratio of actual and reference evapotranspiration etratio the indicators used here were the average values from all catchments at the median and 5th 10th 25th 75th 90th and 95th percentiles for 1961 2100 obs sc1 and sc2 future trend magnitudes of water use indicators were estimated by a nonparametric mann kendall trend p value 0 05 same hereafter we averaged the magnitude of changes across a range of ensemble models to reduce the effect of natural variability 3 1 quantification of crop water balance under irrigated areas to evaluate differences between the crop water availability and the atmospheric water demand for each crop we applied the soilclim tool hlavinka et al 2011 the soilclim model is based on one of the most frequently used approaches to irrigation scheduling by allen et al 1998 which has been adopted for czech conditions with some additional features e g snow cover model modification of bucket approach phenologically dependent kc and root depth values added e g hlavinka et al 2011 trnka et al 2020 similar to the original work by allen et al 1998 in this study i eto was calculated by the penman monteith method ii daily eta for each crop was calculated by multiplying kc and eto and iii differences between daily precipitation and eta were used to calculate crop water balance rain eta to determine the period of the highest crop water consumption table 1 eta was expressed as follows 1 eta eta1 eta2 2 eta1 eto kc ks1 ratio1 3 eta2 eto kc ks2 ratio2 where eta1 and eta2 are the values of actual evapotranspiration from the top layer and rootzone layer eto is the value of reference evapotranspiration kc is the coefficient describing the properties of the crop canopy and its phenological stage i e crop height and the leaf area index concerning reference grassland ks is the soil water stress coefficient expressed as ks1 and ks2 according to the availability of soil water for evapotranspiration topsoil layer and subsoil layers and ratio1 and ratio2 are the shares of water absorption from the topsoil and subsoil layers according to the relevant crop root depth the crop coefficient kc was defined based on the crop coefficient approach with possible modifications as a function of growing degree days gdd the crop coefficient kc was formulated by the following eq 4 4 kc kc tab 0 04 u2 2 0 004 rhmin 45 h 3 0 3 where k c tab was the value of kc ini kc mid or kc end rhmin was the mean daily minimum relative humidity for both mid season or late stages and h was the mean crop height m during the growing stages in mid season and late season the soil water stress coefficient ks was estimated in soilclim hlavinka et al 2011 using the fao 56 1998 approach the ks standard equation is given below 5 ks 1 for θi raw 6 k s taw d taw raw taw d 1 taw for θ i raw where taw θ fc θ wp was the total available soil water raw p taw was the readily available soil water d θ fc θ i was the soil water depletion p was the fractional part of the soil water that could be absorbed by the crop without any water stress soil water depletion fraction for no stress θ fc m3 m 3 and θ wp m3 m 3 were the soil water content at the field capacity and the permanent wilting point respectively and θi m3 m 3 was the actual soil water content the p has been derived during calibration of the soilclim model and set at 0 3 for top layer and 0 2 for the lower soil layer based on the experimentally data driven soilclim model calibration runs hlavinka et al 2011 the ratio1 and ratio2 were based on the experimental data collected by soilclim team hlavinka pers comm and accounting for available studies e g fan et al 2016 the ratio for the crops and non perennials differed based on the phenological development while it has been held constant for perennial cultures e g orchards grape wine soilclim dynamically simulates the vegetation cover and considers changes in its parameters in daily time steps e g changing the rooting depth or crop height in the case of crops or the presence absence of leaves in the case of deciduous trees the changes are driven by the gdd and vernalization requirements depending on the crop cover type therefore the crop parameter k c allen et al 1998 and the root growth dynamics vary for individual vegetation covers throughout the year or the vegetation season for instance the values for kc in fig s1 are values for nonstressed crops cultivated under excellent agronomic and water management conditions and achieving maximum crop yield the establishment of individual k c parameters as well as water requirements in this study followed obligatory technical standards czech state standard 1994 which are mandatory e g for irrigation project building permits or water withdrawal permit requests tables 2 3 the rain eta in the soilclim model was calculated for each grid with a resolution of 0 5 km x 0 5 km throughout the cz then the results were aggregated into cadaster units which represent the smallest administrative area in the cz the calculation was limited to grids with agricultural land or irrigable grids for the gs of each crop as well as the time series of rain et a for individual years under optimal growth conditions rain et a50 and drought conditions rain et a10 and rain et a20 for the current and future climates 3 2 quantification of irrigation water requirement we quantified the potential irrig mm m2 for each crop gs for the current and future climates all calculations of irrig were performed at the level of individual grids in a daily step and an irrigation dose was applied whenever the saturation of the current root layer fell below 30 retention capacity i e the lower limit was reached subsequently from the area of selected grids with irrigation we calculated the sum of water that must be supplied in the topsoil 0 40 cm awr1 and rootzone 0 100 cm awr layers the abbreviation awr stands for the relative content of plant available water and is expressed in where 0 is reached at the wilting point and 100 at field capacity the root depth during gs was dynamically simulated by a crop growth model that was incorporated into soilclim the soil moisture available to plants was calculated as the difference between soil moisture at field capacity and wilting point multiplied by layer depth the indicators of awr1 50 and awr 50 were calculated as productive irrigation while awr1 30 and awr 30 were calculated as maintenance irrigation i e ensuring the survival of the commodity a special regime was used for weeks when the value of the irrigation efficiency factor taken from the czech state standard 1994 table s1 for a given week and a given crop indicated an efficiency factor higher than 40 which means a significant effect of irrigation on economic yield this means that the awr1 and awr for the whole gs are always greater than 0 3 and if the irrigation efficiency is greater than 40 mm each week the soil moisture level is kept at a level equal to or greater than 0 5 in these cases the saturation of the root layer was maintained at least 50 irrigation designed in this way would be relatively very effective the frequency of soil dry days is defined as awr1 awr 50 3 3 quantification of the ratio of actual and reference evapotranspiration the ratio of actual and reference evapotranspiration et ratio provided basic information on the potential water deficit and its course within the gs for the entire territory of the cz we focused on the quantification of et ratio for each crop during current and future climates we calculated the long term time series for individual years normal years and 5 yr and 10 yr droughts i e in the sense of the highest water demands 3 4 estimating the number of days with required irrigation to quantify the frequency of water deficit during gs that may result in drought the number of days where etratio awr1 and awr met specific threshold criteria was calculated the number of days with an et ratio 0 4 was chosen as the indicator of drought stress i e a state where we can assume a significant lack of moisture in the root layer and the soil moisture content is below the point of reduced availability therefore plant growth is beginning to be limited by water to express the available soil moisture for each crop in the root layer of the soil the number of days with awr1 30 awr1 50 and awr 30 awr 50 was calculated to assess areas with critically low water supply gis based high resolution mapping of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the number of days for awr1 30 awr1 50 awr 30 and awr 50 was applied the results were processed as average overall catchments as the 10th and 25th percentiles for obs sc1 and sc2 awr1 10 30 awr1 10 50 awr 25 30 and awr25 50 in the sense of the highest depletion of soil moisture 3 5 estimating the availability of water resources to catchments this section describes the stepwise iterative calculation of irrigable areas for selected commodities the available water sources were estimated daily based on the bilan wateres hydrological models vizina et al 2015 melišová et al 2020 this model runs in daily steps with precipitation mean temperatures and humidity as necessary inputs time series of total runoff direct runoff plus baseflow actual evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater storage are among the outputs a more in depth description of the model can be seen in melišova 2020 the site specific outputs are routed using muskingum cunge and dam operational rules in wateres the process flowchart is shown in fig 1a the calculations considered the impact of both the water management system and real extractions and discharges compatibility between bilan wateres and soilclim parameters e g available water in the soil was ensured by common input parameters aggregated to the upov level the bilan model corresponds very well with soil profile moisture from the soilclim model to a depth of 1 m for better interpretability the management of water resources and their availability were analyzed both at the level of individual catchments i e each catchment manages only its resources and at the level of systems i e each upov has water resources obtained by optimized management within the water system areas with the highest quality soil will be selected as a priority for the implementation of irrigation the available water in each catchment was divided into individual grids and water was initially distributed to irrigable grids by the creditworthiness of the soil if the water in the given catchment basin was sufficient to cover the requirements of all irrigable grids the moisture was subsequently distributed to other grids according to the soil quality twenty percent of this available amount was subtracted to cover losses during the transport of water to irrigated land finally the output of the calculation was a potentially irrigable area the calculation for the sources of available water in each upov and subsequently at the eight subbasins upper and middle labe elbe berounka upper vltava lower vltava lower labe elbe and ohře odra oder morava and dyje thaya was compared the suitability of chosen crop cultivation in the given catchment area was not considered in the calculations 3 6 estimating irrigation characteristics for 15 sensitive commodities under the future climate all future climate estimates were based on rcp4 5 which describes possible future changes under radiative forcing changing by 4 5 wm 2 by 2100 based on the validation of the individual global climate models gcms from the cmip5 database and regional climate from the euro cordex giorgi and gutowski 2015 initiative the gcms were found to better represent the climate projection uncertainty instead of using daily data from gcms directly the delta approach method for more details see trnka et al 2016 was used to obtain daily climate data for each 500 500 m grid for the 2031 2050 and 2061 2080 periods the differences deltas between the control period and future projections of individual gcms were used to modify the observed weather data series this was done according to the methodology described by dubrovsky et al 2014 the rcp4 5 and climatic sensitivity of 3 0 c were used out of the cmip 5 database taylor et al 2011 of 40 global circulation models only five gcms were used the ipsl institute of pierre simone laplace france was found to best represent the centroid of the future temperature and precipitation values over the territory of the cz the four remaining models were found through dubrovsky et al s 2014 methodology to best capture the variability

hadgem hadley center global environment model uk 4 results 4 1 patterns of crop water consumption and irrigation requirements under future climate change scenarios changes in crop water consumption and irrigation water requirements under optimal growth conditions and drought stress in the sc1 and sc2 periods of the 21st century relative to the obs period are averaged in tables 4 6 the largest change in projected water use indicators for some commodities can be seen in sc1 while the smallest change is seen in sc2 models project minor changes in the future soil moisture at the rootzone and topsoil across the country due to differences in climatic factors soil properties and crop types moreover models tend to project a nonnegligible reduction in the relative soil moisture indicators in topsoil in drought years table 4 the awr1 decreased for orchards vineyards hopyards and fodder crops under mid century conditions even in potato planting areas the awr1 was generally higher yet the deficit of rain et a was higher than that of fodder crops the frequency of days with a lack of soil moisture differs significantly among crops with the highest for orchards and fodder crops fig s2a f awr1 50 ranged from 15 to 30 days in the obs 28 42 days for sc1 and 32 48 days for sc2 for orchards in the mean gs the spatiotemporal distribution of crop water consumption fig 2a c and irrigation water requirements fig 2d f were also determined the future water consumption of hopyards apples and vineyards was predominantly negative which means that within the overall growing season the rain et a was not sufficiently met and the assessed crops were exposed to water stress broadly similar anomalies with the highest frequency of drought stress days with et ratio 0 4 fig s3a c and et ratio 0 5 fig s3d f occurred for hopyards and vineyards while the lowest number of days with drought stress occurred for vegetable commodities compared to nonirrigated crops cherries or apples however the water content in the deeper layers of the soil after irrigated vegetables is still higher due to the shorter growth time and shallower root system irrespective of scenario onion 50 mm and cauliflower 50 mm presented greater water demand than the other vegetables in the case of garlic there was a reduction in water demands for both scenarios the moisture deficit of carrots increases in traditional cultivated areas which indicates that carrots have one of the highest water demands among the root vegetables 6500 m3 ha 1 and are susceptible to water shortages during the early development stages positive values of irrig indicate an increase in irrigation demands for the majority of the crops throughout the century tables 5 6 averaged results from five gcms for orchards show that irrig would increase by 14 5 in the 2030s average for sc1 and 10 2 in the 2080s average for sc2 relative to the observed period irrig for vineyards will increase by 8 2 in the 2030s and 4 4 in the 2080s for hopyards irrig would change by 25 under sc1 which is 2 2 3 5 more water than for vineyards over the 2030s the increased irrig under drought conditions would be larger in the hopyards which is 2 2 more water than the observed period for 2031 2050 there is a 50 chance that the extreme irrig for vineyards will become 1 0 1 5 times that of obs moreover the required amount of irrig was increased by 20 for losses in water transport by the valid czech state standard 1994 4 2 trends of projection water use indicators the changes in trend magnitudes of water use indicators were comparatively higher during the 2030s than during the 2080s figs 3 4 figs s4 7 however the results for some commodities were related to initially small decreasing trends sc1 followed later by large increasing trends sc2 in water use indicators for an observed period the trends of soil moisture at the topsoil of sensitive commodities were already decreased by up to 15 however there are significant differences between the magnitude of trends of individual commodities in the projection awr1 and awr indicators a statistically significant decrease in the trend of awr1 and awr 3 9 to 6 3 10 yr was detected during the gs of each crop by the 25th percentiles during the 2030s the magnitude of the changes for the two future periods for the number of days with awr 50 50 awr 25 50 awr1 50 50 and awr1 25 50 exhibited an increase of up to 17 which was linked to the steep decline in soil moisture fig s6 such behavior is closely related to the increasing trends of warming 0 51 0 99 c decade in daily soil temperature series at all depths and in all seasons in the cz potopová et al 2021a 2021b which was also linked to the sharp decline in soil moisture similar results have been found for trends of et ratio50 under optimal growth conditions and drought years with values of et ratio25 further water use indicators also identified a prevalence of moisture deficit rain et a under drought years by 20 0 mm and 50 0 mm for orchards and vineyards respectively and by 5 3 mm and 40 0 mm for vegetables respectively for the 2030s compared to the observed period fig 4a b the averaged results for apples apricots and peaches show that the magnitudes of irrig trends in the mid 21st century would increase by 30 mm decade comparing the irrig results among crops we identified two patterns fig 4a b first there is a generally stronger increase in irrigation water requirements for orchards fodder and hopyards than for vegetable and potato commodities due to longer gs lengths to fulfill the respective crop production goals second analyzing each irrigation indicator separately this irrig trend is strengthened by the climate impact on soil atmosphere drought conditions which leads to increasing demand for the irrigated area 4 3 spatiotemporal distributions of crop irrigation water requirements for sensitive commodities key results of irrigation water requirements for 15 crops are mapped in figs 5 7 using the multimodel mean time series of irrigation characteristics of vegetables garlic onion carrot pepper cucumber cauliflower and cabbage for 1961 2020 2031 2050 and 2061 2080 are mapped fig 5a f here projected irrigation water requirements range from 10 mm per irrigated grid cell in the brassicas cauliflower and cabbage and root producing carrot regions to 100 mm per irrigated grid cell in the fruiting vegetable producing region pepper cucumber which can be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of climate parameters we find that the potential irrigation areas increase in the brassicas and root producing regions for 2031 2050 a more significant increase in irrig 50 of the bulb vegetables was expected in all the cultivated regions especially for garlic and onion which reflects the predominantly rain fed system of cultivation the lowest et ratio was found to be the dominant type of adverse event for pepper and cucumber production regions due to its effect on increased soil water demand which increased transpiration rates potopová et al 2017 whereas changes in irrigation water requirements were associated with minimal increases due to short growing season cauliflower and cabbage vegetables are widely irrigated but irrigation does not fully mitigate drought effects hence rain et a50 variability largely controls crop production in growing catchments although current potato planting areas have soils with high available water capacity as apparent from fig 6a early potatoes will become controlled by the water deficit over the next few decades these changes will be driven by an increase in et ratio combined with low values of awr1 and awr a higher potato potential water deficit area was detected in the berounka lower vltava odra lower labe and ohře river subbasins when rain et a affected most potato production regions the area of potatoes with a suboptimal soil moisture regime increased threefold to 25 in the 2031 2050 period while the area of potatoes on soils with high available water capacity decreased fig 6b illustrates the spatial patterns of the most risk prone areas for each of these irrigation indicators over vineyard production regions for the mid century the greatest increases would occur in critical thresholds of the rain et a et ratio and awr1 for catchments of the middle and lower labe berounka the ohře river odra river morava and dyje river basins the results of rain et a and et ratio are influenced by growth dynamics and the different onset of phenological phases but also by differences in the ability of the soil to retain water therefore 15 and 25 of irrigation water will be lost by evaporation from the soil surface in the morava and dyje river basins during the 2030s and 2080s respectively for the end century the increasing rate of et a exceeds that of precipitation across the grapevine production region which will inevitably aggravate awr1 and awr however the et a and awr in the rootzone tend to show a reduced irrig due to decreases in transpiration and increases in water use efficiency fig 6c documents the median irrigation during hop gs for obs and two future periods under rcp4 5 for the 2030s in žatec the main traditional hop region we project the highest depletion of soil moisture values of awr1 to decrease by 25 and in tršice and úštěcko hop regions to decrease by 5 and 9 respectively this means that summer irrigation is essential for maintaining adequate soil moisture levels fig 6d documents the median irrigation characteristics during the gs of alfalfa for hay in forage production regions under the current and future climates the lowest values of rain et a 11 50 mm etratio 0 62 0 64 awr 75 1 80 and awr1 60 1 65 occurred frequently throughout the grassland regions during both scenarios however the highest irrigation water demand for the same period ranged from 15 1 to 25 mm this change consequently led to water deficits and could result in yield depressions for productive grasslands which were indeed observed e g during the 2015 summer drought žalud et al 2017 fig 7a d demonstrates the magnitude of the difference in irrigable area between trees here the lowest values of rain et a 101 to 50 mm etratio 0 42 0 45 awr 44 8 60 and awr1 42 7 50 occurred mainly throughout the orchard regions in future scenarios conversely the highest irrigation water demand ranged from 80 1 to 116 mm these results indicate that the functions of water use indicators within fruit trees can adapt to high depletion of soil moisture if the trees are sufficiently irrigated the higher water consumption in the case of apple trees compared to other crops is due to their long vegetation and relatively high irrigation efficiency at a time when water resources are generally insufficient table s1 4 4 mapping the extreme water requirement indicators the maps of the extreme irrigation characteristics that reflect the highest depletion of soil moisture and the highest water demands are shown in fig 8a f fig s8 the results of this section were not to determine the real irrigation needs but to outline the area with the potential highest water requirement in over irrigation hotspots the higher risk areas for orchards and vineyards are widespread covering more than 25 of the country due to exceedance of thresholds for both high depletion of soil moisture and water demands in most catchments while risk areas where et ratio 0 4 exceeds the threshold are found mainly in hopyards maps from fig 8a fig s8 illustrate spatial patterns of the most risk prone areas for each of these indicators which have varied relevance across a range of vegetables and overlay observed and future periods growing vegetables with supplemental irrigation would be presumed on 33 of upovs toward the middle of the century the sharp increase in areas with days et ratio 0 4 and awr1 50 extremely limited water availability has been most apparent for onion in the catchments of the lower labe and ohře the middle labe lower vltava morava and dyje overall the results suggest that onion conditions are generally likely to become less favorable without irrigation the current suitable cultivated proportion of brassicas producing regions will be reduced by the 2050s due to large water deficits by the end of the century 28 2 of upovs increased the number of days with the highest depletion of topsoil moisture awr1 30 and awr1 50 for late cabbage and cauliflower 160 m2 ha 1 per tonne yield the high numbers of days with et ratio 0 4 resulted in cucumber and pepper fruit qualities 150 m2 ha 1 per tonne yield that were more sensitive to short drought stress during the fruit setting stage in all producing regions we find a relatively similar but more pronounced result for potato water requirement indicators fig 8b the projected future anomalies of the number of days with the highest depletion of soil moisture will increase at approximately two thirds of the upovs in the topsoil layer awr1 30 awr1 50 by the end of the 21st century compared to the obs the number of days with water deficit et ratio 0 4 for vineyards was projected to increase with deficit irrigation and would require supplemental irrigation up to 22 fig 8c the number of expected days with the highest depletion of topsoil moisture for vineyards will be approximately 27 of upovs for the period 2031 2050 and 15 of upovs for 2061 2080 this increase in soil water stress will harm sunburn risks and will be strongly related to vintage quality sugar color and aroma these findings agree with those of trnka et al 2021 who reported that the extent of grapevine production regions is considerable as is the massive increase in the warmer and drier regional conditions of grapevines maps of the number of days with water use indicators of hopyards for the observed and two future periods are shown in fig 8d changes in future hopyard irrigation extent and amounts may have important implications in largely cropped irrigation hotspots approximately 22 of the hilly catchment areas would require supplemental irrigation while in the lowland catchment areas these percentages reached 28 35 we determined that days with water deficit occurred 1 3 times per gs in the observed period while in the 2031 2050 and 2061 2080 periods days with water deficit occurred more than 2 4 times even with the modest warming thus far experienced yields have stagnated and quality has declined this fact means further expenses and higher water requirements in over irrigation hotspots for premium beer production potopová et al 2021a the spatial distribution of the extreme water requirement indicators of alfalfa for hay under current and future climates is documented in fig 8e maps of the number of days with et ratio 0 4 35 42 days and awr1 50 65 135 days define areas where an extreme lack of soil moisture occurs with fodder production to keep the optimum demand for the livestock sector areas with significant water requirements are evident as there is a significantly higher need for production and maintenance irrigation in south moravian than in other regions these indicators also suggest the economic risk of attaining sustainable fodder production in the regions with the most developed animal production south bohemian region and vysočina region thus there will be insufficient fodder supply to the livestock sector due to any water stress during the production season under climate change conditions at the same time a substantial increase in the amount of water consumed by livestock is expected in areas vulnerable because of water scarcity regional differences in orchards with water use indicators are shown in fig 8f fig s16 even though two regions are expecting strong increases in the number of days with high depletion of soil moisture awr1 30 and water demands et ratio 0 4 i e central bohemia 25 and south moravia 47 the total amount of irrigation water requirements decreases by 5 as these two regions only have a small share of the total water requirements for orchards thus irrigation is helpful to maintain the regular functioning of photosynthesis and carbohydrate translocation even under drought stress conditions the increase in the number of days with et ratio 0 4 and 0 5 for the years 2061 2080 relative to 1961 2020 is likely to be in the range of 10 25 days unless countermeasures are taken in orchard regions a high number of days with depletion of soil moisture can lead to dramatically decreasing yields 4 5 comparison of available water resources and estimated irrigation needs for the assessment of water resources three categories of conditions normal 5 yr and 10 yr drought were used based on current water demands and irrigation projections for apple trees water intensive and cabbage under current climatic conditions 1961 2020 and projected climatic conditions according to 5 different climate models fig 9a b fig 10a b within the scenario of the current demands real withdrawals are considered instead of the permitted withdrawals which are approximately 40 higher in the cz within the hydrological and water balance modeling process we tried to answer the question of whether there are at least theoretical water resources in the cz in individual upovs that could cover possible higher demands for irrigation fig 9a b shows available water resources for each upov under normal conditions and drought periods only the minimum residual flows balvín et al 2021 from the reservoirs until full retention capacity or the interbasin and the demand for all water uses i e surface and groundwater extractions the wet gcms simulate comparable results of available water resources with current conditions irrigation needs for cabbage while the remaining gcms simulate a decline from 18 to 26 in water resources for both horizons especially for dry periods when no water resources are available in most of the area water resources are available only in the mountainous areas of the cz which are not suitable for agriculture and the lower elbe river the available water resources are mainly in the first half of the hydrological year november september and therefore do not occur at the same time as the gs in the cz during which time there are water deficits especially where there is insufficient water management infrastructure the modeling results were aggregated into eight subbasins and for the whole cz fig 10a b depict available water resources irrigation needs for cabbage for subbasins that are decreasing or are not available under current conditions available water resources decrease the most in normal and wet years provided that this water is available for example the decrease in the dyje thaya basin according to all gcms ranges from 44 million m3 20 of available water resources to 145 m3 64 in a normal year it should be noted that water resources are still very limited or almost unavailable in the subbasins of the berounka dyje and morava rivers since larger reservoirs are not present the change in available resources is also related to their deficits figs s10 11 shows the deficits for current and future climatic conditions based on current needs and the needs for irrigation of apple trees and cabbage for current needs the water deficits vary in units of percent for all gcms when irrigation is considered the deficits increase even for wet gcms for the bnu hadgem2 and ipsl models the change in deficit is almost double for the period 2061 2080 figs s10 11 show aggregated available water for the cz which remains almost the same under the cnrm and mri gcms and decreases significantly for the bnu ipsl and hadgem2 gcms these declines are observed throughout and as mentioned occur primarily in the first half of the hydrologic year without water management infrastructure these resources cannot then be used particularly in the second half of the growing season simulations of the hydrological and water balance according to the 5 gcms indicate that the main catalyst for changes in the natural water regime in the cz is the change in air temperature as the main proxy for evapotranspiration where the water regime changes significantly in the summer months 30 50 decrease and the streams are mainly supported by baseflow and direct runoff an increase in runoff of 10 30 can be expected in the winter months due to changes in the total amount of snowpack the hydrological model estimates a significant decrease up to 40 based on the chosen gcm in the median annual flow compared to 1961 2020 up to 55 in drought periods this phenomenon is predicted across all river basins with a more pronounced decline in catchments prone to produce water deficit thaya and berounka crop specific irrigation needs produce shifts in units of a percent to this value to meet the increased irrigation needs it will be necessary to retain this water so that it can be used later in the year especially in catchments where this infrastructure is lacking 5 discussion in our study we implemented hydrological models with crop models that consider future crop production developments and climate data of the entire gs and compute the most suitable crop for each raster cell within upov in this kind of research there are two main constraints i cropland area and length of gs would remain unmodified by climate change however considering the future higher temperatures potopová et al 2018 zahradníček et al 2020 both patterns might change and ii these results represent just one realization of the possible future irrigation water requirements therefore our focus was to discuss the uncertainties related to the choice of the model and scenario the soilclim model has been shown to explain between 74 and 80 of the daily eta variability measured by eddy covariance and bowen ratio systems over 3 sites and 6 crops with root mean square errors rmses ranging from 0 49 and 0 99 mm day trnka et al 2015a 2015b soilclim also performed well at the lysimetric station hirschstetten in austria over several years for three soils explaining up to 63 topsoil and 74 subsoil of the observed soil moisture with rmses ranging from 2 82 to 4 23 for both layers under field conditions we found soilclim to explain 63 of topsoil and 74 of subsoil soil moisture variability trnka et al 2015a soilclim reproduces well changes in the long term soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil especially during april to september periods i e the window critical for irrigation soilclim also reproduced well trends in the reference evapotranspiration proxy i e pan evaporation between 1968 and 2010 trnka et al 2015b soilclim was shown to explain over 62 of the daily topsoil soil moisture variability for april september during 1961 2018 at doksany station this is an improvement of over 55 reported for the 1961 2012 period by trnka et al 2015a arising from using the improved soil parametrization of soilclim used in this study the soilclim model has also been used several times in combination with the gcm models and coupled with the bilan model before this irrigation study in a number of other regions vizina et al 2015 trnka et al 2016 melišová et al 2020 the comparison of projected irrigation characteristics with other studies is difficult due to the different climate models used in our study which reach different levels of regional warming toward the end of the 21st century mri wet and cold cnmr wettest and hot ipsl hot bnu cold and hadgem dry and hot another problem is that the projection of 21st century irrigation water requirements and available water for sensitive agricultural crop commodities across the cz has not yet been thoroughly assessed there is also the issue that decreases in water consumption in current irrigation water requirements in many upovs were not based on a reduction in the water demands of crops but only on the decline in irrigation equipment more detailed information on the categorization of crop water balance is provided by duffková et al 2020 who showed that over 80 of spring crop regions in the cz were threatened with medium to severe water scarcity another study conducted in the southern part of the cz lamačová et al 2018 projected future water balance scenarios under rcp4 5 for the periods of 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 both studies underline that the growing trend for the occurrence of dry periods will lead to the expansion of irrigated fields in addition the water supply within both underground and surface resources has been declining there is concern about whether there will be enough water for irrigation in dry years duffková et al 2020 the estimation of potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration in cmip5 multimodel future projections for europe was also discussed by dezsi et al 2018 the study concluded that eto increases by approximately 50 100 mm by the 2020s and approximately 75 125 mm by the 2050s for europe another challenge lies in the representation of how crop cover affects actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions concerning changes under rising temperature and co2 levels dusenge et al 2019 lenka et al 2020 2021 our mapping results figs 5 7 demonstrated that the changes in awr and awr1 under nonirrigated arable land permanently irrigated land and complex cultivation patterns may not be monotonic rather it is possible that in some croplands soil moisture might first increase in response to increasing precipitation but then decrease because et0 may increase faster than precipitation as temperature rises cook et al 2015 chen et al 2018 the topsoil may have a lower water loss probably due to the decreased evaporation from the soil surface under irrigated vegetables in contrast to alfalfa for hay orchards and vineyards where the soil has permanent plant cover the low water content of the root zone limits the et a to rates below the potential and the reduction in et o due to increasing co2 has a relatively high impact on the optimization of irrigation water productivity therefore the et ratio is a good indicator for designing irrigation scheduling in agricultural water management especially for vegetables where the water supply is mainly through irrigation in this case the variations in et ratio are highly influenced by irrigation water supply especially under different irrigation levels since the depth of 60 cm represents a limit for most types of vegetables where the roots almost no longer penetrate it is evident that the greatest economic effect of irrigation occurs in years with 5 yr and 10 yr drought this would consequently lead to water deficits and the possibility of irrigation provides benefits in drought years when the full water capacity to guarantee a high yield will be 70 on lighter to medium soils and 55 40 on heavy soils however it is precisely in these crops that efficient irrigation systems especially drip irrigation can be used which offsets the relatively higher need for awr by higher irrigation efficiency this finding was consistent with siebert et al 2017 and thiery et al 2020 who emphasized that irrigated crops which account for more than 40 of global yields benefited from capped temperature extremes however these favorable influences only occurred because the irrigation extent more than quadrupled during the 20th century in the areas with low soil retention capacity the stabilizing effect of irrigation on hops and orchards is evident with a relatively small increase in water consumption tsuchida and yakushiji 2017 related that the dry weight of apricot trees declined over an approximately 3 month period of drought stress therefore a period of drought stress longer than two months is likely to cause visible tree growth inhibition cherry trees under dry soil conditions resulted in decreased accumulation of carbohydrates irrigated apricot trees maintained a high leaf water potential photosynthetic rate and et ratio rate regardless of lower awr1 and awr the largest effect in the expected climate is irrigation for fodder crops which is partly due to the highest water demands however it is evident that the greatest economic effect of irrigation occurs in years with 5 yr and 10 yr drought however in these years the risk of lack of moisture will be significantly higher the same results were achieved by žalud et al 2017 and trnka et al 2015 2020 2021 at the pan european level schaldach et al 2012 highlighted that changes in the irrigated area between 2000 and 2050 increase by 18 from 181 202 km2 to 214 028 km2 6 conclusion this research combined the existing national irrigation standard with the well calibrated soilclim model and bilan wateres hydrological models to develop projections of irrigation water requirements under future climate conditions the study identified regions with likely increases in irrigation water requirements due to climate change additionally catchments that would not be able to support such an increase in the water demand with the existing water reservoir infrastructure were demarcated most water consumption catchments were detected in lowland catchments with high farm stocking rates characterized by the highest frequency of days with a lack of soil moisture and days with high irrigation needs in the current climatic conditions and the normal year at least 90 of the water sources for existing irrigation systems can be ensured from existing water sources except for some catchments in the dyje river basin with an increase in drought events with a probability of 5 yr it is impossible to satisfy the demands on water resources in the dyje river basin south moravia and in the rakovnicka and louny regions central bohemia during drought events with a probability of 10 yr significant problems will manifest in several catchments in the upper elbe and upper vltava regions vegetable crops have relatively lower requirements while orchards are very demanding the average irrigation water requirement will increase by 10 2 and the water requirement will be higher in orchards hopyards vineyards and fodder crops and lower in early potatoes and vegetables an increase in future potential irrigation amount will be required to satisfy crop evapotranspiration it will not be possible to keep significant areas under irrigation in each growing season with respect to water resources construction or use of existing small reservoirs for irrigation will be a necessity
