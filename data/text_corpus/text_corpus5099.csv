25495,riparian zones can effectively reduce excess nitrogen loading to streams modeling nitrogen retention in riparian zones is useful especially at larger scales we evaluated select riparian nitrogen models for their robustness in representing hydrology vegetation soils nutrients and channel morphodynamics we used global time varying sensitivity analyses of remm riparian ecosystem management model and swat soil and water assessment tool to identify the most influential parameters for calculating water table depth and nitrogen processes both remm and swat were sensitive to topographic and soil parameters such as slope and soil layer thickness although spatial and temporal scale and hydroclimatic conditions affected parameter sensitivity neither model was sensitive to stream channel depth which is known to affect riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling it is necessary to incorporate stream morphodynamics like channel change into both riparian scale and watershed scale nitrogen models to provide useful management tools for addressing excessive nitrogen loading in stream networks keywords riparian zone nitrogen cycling remm swat sensitivity analysis numerical modeling 1 introduction eutrophication resulting from anthropogenic nutrient pollution is among the most substantial issues facing water resources professionals and society today more than 40 of stream length in the u s is impaired by nutrient pollution u s epa 2016 dissolved nitrate is an especially insidious pollutant because it is rapidly transported through groundwater and surface water and causes a variety of environmental problems from contaminating drinking water to eutrophication and associated algal blooms howarth et al 2011 nitrogen pollution is a primary driver of water quality degradation in coastal zones globally howarth 2008 including the dead zone in the gulf of mexico gro√üe et al 2019 nitrogen runoff from agricultural and urban areas is transported through river networks to the coast however less nitrogen reaches the coasts than is applied to land surfaces indicating that streams and riparian zones act as significant nutrient sinks peterson et al 2001 the protection and restoration of riparian zones is a cornerstone of effective nutrient management that complements source reductions nitrogen removal in riparian zones has long been an area of research often with the goal of restoring riparian functions to treat agricultural runoff hill 1979 1996 lowrance 1992 riparian zones effectively remove dissolved nitrate in runoff and groundwater e g hill 2019 mulholland et al 2008 newbold et al 2010 and these areas may contribute more to nitrogen removal than in stream processes craig et al 2008 lammers and bledsoe 2017 nitrogen is permanently removed in riparian zones through denitrification an anaerobic process in which microbes use organic soil carbon to reduce nitrate to inert dinitrogen gas hill 1996 under the right conditions riparian buffers can remove greater than 90 of the nitrate in inflowing groundwater balestrini et al 2016 peterjohn and correll 1984 pinay et al 1993 spruill 2000 wiseman et al 2014 these conditions include low oxygen and an organic carbon source usually from riparian vegetation mosier et al 2002 channel incision bed erosion can lower riparian groundwater tables hardison et al 2009 disconnecting nitrate laden groundwater with soil organic carbon and microbial communities reducing denitrification potential and increasing nitrate loading to streams gift et al 2010 groffman et al 2002 this paper compares the mechanisms relevant to riparian denitrification in existing models via global sensitivity analysis to improve future simulation of nitrogen loading to streams 1 1 riparian nitrogen modeling despite the importance of denitrification the process is notoriously difficult to measure groffman et al 2006 and can occur sporadically in space and time when conditions are favorable mcclain et al 2003 riparian nitrogen models are therefore valuable for providing quantitative estimates of riparian denitrification and nutrient sequestration and guiding management activities in cases where direct measurement of these processes is not feasible several models exist for evaluating the influence of riparian zones on nitrogen loading to streams ranging from field scale models specifically for riparian zones to watershed scale models that include riparian processes arnold et al 1998 bieger et al 2017 lowrance et al 2000 sun et al 2018 typical processes included in a riparian nitrogen model are shown in fig 1 the riparian ecosystem management model remm is a field scale model for estimating the influence of riparian ecosystems on nonpoint source pollution altier et al 2002 lowrance et al 2000 daily denitrification is calculated through the interaction of temperature nitrate soil aeration and soil organic carbon the riparian nitrogen model rnm is a watershed scale model for estimating nitrogen removal via denitrification in riparian buffers along low and middle order streams rassam et al 2005 denitrification is estimated using a depth integrated exponential decay function with a rate coefficient based on a maximum denitrification rate and rooting depth the soil and water assessment tool swat is a watershed scale model capable of estimating nitrogen loading and routing throughout the watershed arnold et al 1998 several variations of swat have been developed to differentiate riparian zones from the uplands for better hydrologic and water quality calculations bieger et al 2017 hoang et al 2017 sun et al 2016 including an integrated swat remm to study the influences of riparian buffers on hydrology and nutrient cycling at a watershed scale ryu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a 2017b swat is one of the newest and more commonly used variations but denitrification is modeled the same as previous swat versions with an exponential decay equation of denitrification rate temperature saturation and organic carbon bieger et al 2017 neitsch et al 2011 swat modflow rt3d is the result of recent work to couple swat with groundwater and reactive transport models for improved simulation of three dimensional solute movement throughout watersheds wei et al 2019 rt3d is the nitrate transport engine of this model and it uses an advection dispersion equation to simulate the fate and transport of nitrate modflow groundwater algorithms have also been integrated separately into the new swat bailey et al 2020 the trend toward increasing model complexity may allow for more realistic simulation of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes but also at a cost of increased data requirements computational power and uncertainty potentially making these models less useful for managers quantification of model sensitivity and uncertainty can help users interpret results and strike the balance between model complexity and utility 1 2 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses uncertainty is an unavoidable side effect of environmental modeling and quantifying this uncertainty is essential for assessing the accuracy and reliability of model outputs and better understanding model structure byrd and melching 2005 melching and bauwens 2001 pappenberger and beven 2006 an effective approach to uncertainty analysis is monte carlo simulations essentially a model is run hundreds or thousands of times with each model run using a slightly different set of model inputs this provides a distribution of model outputs directly accounting for the uncertainty in model inputs sensitivity analyses apportion the uncertainty in this distribution of model output to different input variables identifying which inputs most influence model results saltelli et al 2004 sensitivity analyses can be local or global saltelli et al 2004 local or one at a time sensitivity analyses focus on quantifying parameter influence while changing a single parameter from the base case and fixing the remaining parameters whereas global sensitivity analyses select across the entire parameter space for all inputs of interest tian 2013 in general global sensitivity analyses are preferable to local due to their ability to account for parameter influences across the entire range of reasonable values and compatibility with non linear models making results more generalizable and less influenced by modeler bias song et al 2015 nearly half of published sensitivity analyses in science related fields use global methods saltelli et al 2019 with a positive trend in prevalence of global sensitivity analyses in recent years ferretti et al 2016 global sensitivity analyses can belong to one of several sub classes regression based variance based and density based among others regression based global sensitivity analyses are one of the most common due to the moderate computing power required and easily understandable outputs i e regression coefficients and r2 but generally require a linear relationship between parameter and model output ferretti et al 2016 song et al 2015 variance based approaches use a variance ratio to determine both first order and total effects which can be advantageous because it works with models of varying type and complexity including those with significant parameter interactions however variance based methods can be computationally intensive or require strict sampling design saltelli et al 1999 2010 song et al 2015 density based methods provide a suite of probability density curves for each parameter across its selected range but sensitivity values are only informative for relative comparisons plischke et al 2013 the density based methods of plischke et al 2013 can be advantageous over other methods because they are less computationally intensive can be used with log transformed outputs and have been applied to various water resources related studies borgonovo et al 2017 herman et al 2015 lammers et al 2017 most sensitivity analyses determine parameter sensitivity aggregated across the entire time series which leads to incomplete information recent studies have investigated time varying sensitivity at preset intervals to determine how input importance changes under variable conditions ghoreishi et al 2021 herman et al 2013a 2013b pianosi and wagener 2016 reusser et al 2011 reusser and zehe 2011 wagener et al 2003 wu et al 2022 these studies have found that parameter sensitivities change in response to dominant real world processes that control hydrologic transport during wet and dry conditions such as interflow and snowmelt reusser et al 2011 reusser and zehe 2011 wu et al 2022 time varying sensitivity analyses improve understanding of how these different processes control model outputs and how well a model incorporates these processes sensitivity and uncertainty analyses on terrestrial nitrogen models have shown that soil and hydrologic parameters and processes are most important for simulating nitrogen transport mcintyre et al 2005 rankinen et al 2013 however modeled denitrification rates were perhaps unsurprisingly influenced by factors that are known to directly control denitrification such as temperature and nitrate concentration bouwman et al 2013 denitrification estimates are also sensitive to parameters influencing soil moisture including groundwater table depth heinen 2006 stream channel characteristics such as streamflow and depth can also influence simulated denitrification via their connection to the riparian groundwater table dukes and evans 2003 tilak 2012 using streamflow data to calibrate a denitrification model can constrain and reduce the uncertainty in values for soil parameters and thus the denitrification estimates emphasizing the inherent interplay between the two tague 2009 despite these results to our knowledge there are no comparative analyses of global sensitivity results for riparian nitrogen models many aspects of the models are complex and prohibitively data intensive to parameterize therefore there is a need for a comprehensive summary and comparison of riparian nitrogen models and investigation of uncertainty and sensitivity of model outputs a rigorous comparison of processes incorporated into these models can identify what is lacking and how that affects model utility furthermore this can help inform future research and model development as well as provide guidance for model users on which parameters should be most carefully quantified to reduce model uncertainty 1 3 objectives the objectives of this research are to 1 compare the mechanisms incorporated in existing riparian denitrification models and 2 conduct a global time varying sensitivity analysis of two of these models remm and swat comparing current tools for modeling riparian nitrogen processes including the specific model algorithms that are present inadequate or omitted provides insight into the state of riparian nitrogen modeling and pinpoint research directions that are most needed for improvement the global sensitivity analyses will allow for a critical evaluation of existing models to determine which parameters are most influential for hydrologic and nitrogen processes in those models time varying sensitivity analysis methods will show how these influential parameters change with variable hydroclimatic conditions while remm and swat operate at different spatial scales we can use our findings to draw general conclusions about processes that are either ubiquitously underrepresented in riparian nitrogen models or lacking at different scales the results from this study can be used to improve existing models and provide a basis for building a parsimonious riparian nitrogen model with the most relevant parameters and processes 2 methods we identified four riparian nitrogen models remm rnm swat and swat modflow rt3d to analyze for their mechanistic complexity number of parameters spatial and temporal resolution data requirements and fidelity to scientific processes we assigned a qualitative score from zero to three to model algorithms related to hydrology nutrients soils vegetation and stream connectivity see table 3 in section 3 1 scores were representative of the data requirements and physical robustness of the equation with zero meaning the process was completely omitted one indicating low complexity and three indicating high complexity complexity was scored based on the required parameterization to calculate that process relative to other known calculation methods hydrologic processes that were evaluated were surface runoff and infiltration evapotranspiration and subsurface flow the only nutrient process that we considered in this analysis was denitrification for soils we evaluated the number of soil layers and relationship between organic matter and depth along with the types and general parameterization of vegetation finally we assessed geomorphic bank storage and overbank flow algorithms to determine the ability of the models to connect the stream with the riparian zone although other riparian nitrogen models exist these four models were selected because they are prevalent in literature and representative of the spectrum of spatial scales regional applications complexity and the advances in riparian process modeling in the last few decades remm is a field scale model that was developed by the usda ars in georgia usa altier et al 2002 and has been applied in a variety of landscapes across the united states tamanna 2021 and internationally when coupled as swat remm ryu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a rnm is a catchment scale model developed for low and middle order streams in australia with capabilities of estimating denitrification for ephemeral and perennial channels rassam et al 2005 swat is a recent adaptation of the watershed scale swat to better represent watershed spatial connections including floodplain and upland flow and pollutant routing bieger et al 2017 similar to remm swat was initially tested at the little river experimental watershed in georgia swat modflow rt3d couples swat with modflow for improved groundwater process representation and rt3d for solute transport at the catchment scale wei et al 2019 this model was initially tested in a large watershed 4100 km2 in oregon usa comparing the mechanistic complexity of these models is useful because they are representative of the diversity in scale and landscape application of riparian nitrogen models we performed a global sensitivity analysis of remm and swat to identify model parameters that most affected model output and to identify processes that may not be adequately represented these two models were chosen due to their ease to implement and their intermediate complexity as determined in the prior assessment remm was selected due to its specificity to field scale riparian systems and detailed hydrology and vegetation models many past applications of remm have included a local sensitivity analysis dukes and evans 2003 graff et al 2005 kim et al 2007 lowrance et al 2000 tilak 2012 but only one attempted to use a global sensitivity analysis tamanna et al 2021 we analyzed swat because it is a recent improvement of the widely applied watershed scale swat model that explicitly differentiates riparian zones from uplands furthermore we chose to analyze these models that simulate at various spatial scales to investigate generalizable strengths and shortcomings in riparian nitrogen modeling the monte carlo and sensitivity analysis procedures for each of these models followed an identical structure 1 selection of parameters to test 2 identification of valid ranges for each parameter based on literature model documentation and expert judgement 3 random sampling of parameter values from a representative statistical distribution 4 simulations of the model using unique parameter sets 500 for swat 1000 for remm and 5 global density based sensitivity analysis using methods of plischke et al 2013 sensitivity analyses were performed for the entire simulation and repeated with annual seasonal and 30 day non moving time windows to investigate how parameter sensitivity varied across temporal scales seasonal time windows were initiated at the associated solstice or equinox while 30 day time windows were initiated on the first day of the simulation and segmented every 30 days only time windows with an end date that was completely encompassed in the simulation timeframe were used results using the plischke et al method for the full simulation were compared to a more recent approach baroni and francke 2020 that combines variance and distribution based cvd methods and estimates main effect and interactions separately since results using these two methods were similar only the plischke et al method was used for the time varying analysis for shorter time scales the cvd method failed because some outputs did not change sufficiently over a month or season 2 1 remm sensitivity analysis the riparian ecosystem management model is a continuous field scale model that performs daily balances on water sediment and nutrients in riparian buffers altier et al 2002 the model code was edited to accommodate this sensitivity analysis parameter modifications were made relative to an example dataset from the gibbs farm in the little river watershed near tifton georgia usa we selected 47 of the more than 150 remm parameters for this sensitivity analysis table 1 focusing on those that we hypothesized would influence riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling parameters describing the buffer soil vegetation and rate coefficients were varied while time series data i e weather and field inputs were not adjusted because we assumed that they were inherently influential on the studied outputs and must be specified in future modeling regardless we chose distributions and ranges for each parameter based on literature if data were not found in literature then we based distributions and ranges on remm documentation or 50 100 variations of remm example data many soil parameters were treated as uniform distributions across their common ranges so that all soil types could be reasonably tested log normal distributions used the natural logarithm we defined means and standard deviations for selection of random values from each distribution mean values were assumed to be either middle of the chosen range a literature value assumed based on expert judgement or the value used in the default gibbs farm remm model standard deviations when not found were specified as one fourth the range hozo et al 2005 complete tables of distributions and statistics for these parameters can be found in the supplemental materials tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 we accounted for several simple correlations among parameters to ensure that the parameter sets represented realistic conditions e g soil bulk density was based off of clay content additionally we checked logical relationships between parameters and adjusted them accordingly e g field capacity could not exceed porosity see the supplemental materials for more details parameter values in each of the three riparian zones fig 2 were changed identically meaning that the only differences among the zones were in the parameters that remained as defaults of the gibbs farm model excluding the correlation for clay content we changed each of the three soil layers homogeneously we performed more than 1000 remm simulations each driven by the four years of daily time series data collected at gibbs farm representing wet dry and average amounts of precipitation precipitation was above average for the first and third years approximately average in the second year and drier than average in the final year only the first 1000 model results with outputs that were greater than zero and did not include any n a values were included in the sensitivity analysis we analyzed the following model outputs near stream water table depth subsurface dissolved nitrogen load to stream total denitrification and total nitrogen balanced in the near stream zone zone 1 in fig 2 for each model run we used the standard deviation of the four years or whichever time window was used of daily values for water table depth and the sum of the four years of daily values for nitrogen outputs in the density based sensitivity analysis plischke et al 2013 in this method probability distributions of model output were conditioned on different modeled inputs we then compared these distributions to the total unconditioned probability distribution of all modeled output larger differences between conditioned and unconditioned probability distributions indicated that input variable had a larger effect on model output we performed 500 bootstrapping iterations to minimize bias and calculate confidence intervals and used natural logarithm transformations when output distributions were skewed a dummy variable a purely random set of numbers not used in remm was included as a baseline to account for noise in the sensitivity method highly sensitive input parameters are those with a minimum sensitivity index value larger than the maximum sensitivity of the dummy variable all monte carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses were conducted in r r core team 2021 using the following packages kernsmooth wand 2021 envstats millard 2013 dplyr wickham et al 2020 rcpp eddelbuettel 2013 eddelbuettel and balamuta 2017 eddelbuettel and francois 2011 rcolorbrewer neuwirth 2014 ks duong 2021 randtoolbox dutang and savicky 2021 plyr wickham 2011 lattice sarkar 2008 and matrix bates and maechler 2021 2 2 swat sensitivity analysis swat rev 59 3 an updated version of swat is a semi distributed continuous watershed scale model which differentiates riparian zone processes from both channel and upland processes of the hundreds of available parameters in swat we selected 19 for this analysis table 2 including those hypothesized to influence riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling and focusing on ones that can be reasonably quantified by a user the default model like remm was a simulation in the little river experimental watershed in southern georgia a model that was used to test swat during its development bieger et al 2017 we ran the model at a daily time step for four years representing wet dry and average amounts of precipitation with three years of model warmup the first two simulation years had above average precipitation followed by a drier than average third year and an average fourth year of precipitation we defined distributions ranges means and standard deviations using the same procedures as outlined for remm maintaining similarities for parameters that were identical between the two models swat recommended minima and maxima were set as parameter range boundaries when reasonable the most notable difference for swat was that most parameters were spatially distributed in hydrologic response units hrus rather than given as a single value we modified these spatial parameters based on percent changes to the base value this ensured that all parameters were changed directionally and proportionally while maintaining the spatial relations values for spatially invariable defaults were changed using the same selection procedure as for remm a complete table of parameters distributions and statistics can be found in the supplemental materials table s5 we also used correlations similar to those in remm which are discussed in the supplemental materials swatplusr an r package for automating swat simulations sch√ºrz 2019 was used to perform monte carlo simulations along with the same r packages from the remm analysis we conducted 500 error free simulations due to high computational time the same density based sensitivity analysis methods were performed using standard deviations of daily water table depth and sums of daily nitrogen outputs outputs selected for analysis were basin averaged water table depth and denitrification plus basin output riverine nitrate load 3 results 3 1 model comparison we analyzed four innovative and representative riparian nitrogen models remm rnm swat and swat modflow rt3d for their completeness and complexity of algorithms for hydrology nutrients soils vegetation and stream connections table 3 all four models had similar methods for performing hydrologic calculations using either or both of the curve number hawkins 1980 and green ampt green and ampt 1911 equations for infiltration evapotranspiration in all four models was highly complex since each was capable of applying the data intensive penman monteith equation groundwater was represented at low complexity in all models except swat modflow rt3d which used the complex groundwater algorithms from modflow remm utilized the most detailed approach for estimating denitrification with a first order decay equation that incorporated multiplicative factors based on ph saturation carbon available nitrate and temperature this was much more complex than the simple first order decay equations in rnm and swat or the advection dispersion equation used in swat modflow rt3d the designation of soil layers was most complex in swat and swat modflow rt3d which allowed up to 25 layers estimation of organic matter with depth was most complex in remm which performed a carbon balance in every soil layer vegetation algorithms were also most intricate in remm with specification of one of a dozen types of vegetation for each zone of the riparian buffer and detailed calculations of vegetative growth the only model that included a geomorphic connection between the stream and riparian water table was remm which used the thalweg elevation of the stream to set the hydraulic gradient for the water table depth in the near stream riparian zone however there was no bank storage calculation in remm despite all other models including it swat was the only model of those selected that accounted for overbank flows which was done by defining a floodplain landscape unit and routing water onto it when a known or calculated bankfull discharge was exceeded bieger et al 2017 detailed information on each of these models can be found in their respective documentation altier et al 2002 rassam et al 2005 texas a m university 2022 wei et al 2019 3 2 remm sensitivity analysis results select results of the remm sensitivity analysis using the methods of plischke et al 2013 for the full simulation are displayed in fig 3 showing only sensitive parameters and those of most interest complete results can be found in supplemental materials fig s1 we determined 1000 simulations to be adequate by visually verifying parameter sensitivity values stabilized for each output as simulations increased in increments of 50 fig s2 parameters were considered highly sensitive if there was no overlap with the dummy variable parameters were considered slightly sensitive if there was only slight overlap but no overlap in interquartile range water table depth was highly sensitive to soil layer thickness and slightly sensitive to drainage area surface slope and field capacity for the plischke et al method fig 3a subsurface dissolved nitrate loading to the stream was highly sensitive to permeability and percent clay fig 3b slope and bulk density showed slight sensitivity despite the overlap of the error bars and mean dummy sensitivity in the plot denitrification was highly sensitive to the denitrification rate coefficient k and soil layer thickness fig 3c slope drainage area permeability stream depth and various carbon and nitrogen concentrations slightly influenced denitrification total nitrogen was highly sensitive to drainage area and surface slope and slightly sensitive to permeability field capacity and soil layer thickness fig 3d each output was overall sensitive to only a few parameters aligning with the pareto principle that the majority of the consequences in this case sensitivity result from the vital few causes results for the full simulation using the baroni and francke 2020 combined variance and distribution based cvd method are shown in fig 4 the most influential parameters were similar between the two methods with total nitrogen showing additional sensitivity to riparian zone width for the cvd method fig 4d high interaction effects for subsurface dissolved nitrate fig 4b signified that although most parameters were not individually sensitive they had substantial interactions with other parameters interaction effects were relatively low for the other outputs results for the remm time varying water table depth sensitivity analyses are shown in fig 5 only parameters that were influential at multiple window sizes are shown drainage area surface slope field capacity permeability and percent clay drainage area and surface slope had the most consistent sensitivity across time periods with the highest sensitivity occurring during spring of years 2 and 4 the importance of other variables was sporadic but most substantial during year 4 water table depth was not sensitive to layer thickness at finer time scales despite it being the most influential parameter across the full simulation similar figures for the other outputs are shown in the supplementary materials figs s3 and s4 subsurface dissolved nitrate did not change enough across the shorter time scales to provide reliable sensitivity outputs and was therefore excluded from the time varying analysis denitrification was most sensitive to the denitrification rate coefficient and soil layer thickness for all or most of the simulation but sensitive to surface slope and drainage area only when denitrification was high fig s3 volumetric water content permeability percent clay and rooting depth became influential at several 30 day time windows but not during any longer periods total nitrogen was consistently sensitive to drainage area and slope and sporadically sensitive to permeability and rainfall interception fig s4 percent clay and maximum rooting depth were influential only during a few 30 day time windows 3 3 swat sensitivity analysis results swat sensitivity analysis results using the plischke et al method are displayed in fig 6 results showed only a few inputs exerting most of the influence on the outputs which again agreed with the pareto principle water table depth was highly sensitive to field parameters such as lateral length and slope fig 6a soil properties such as clay content hydraulic conductivity bulk density and soil layer thickness also highly influenced water table depth water table depth was slightly sensitive to slope length and soil layer thickness among others nitrate export from the watershed and total denitrification were only highly sensitive to the denitrification saturation threshold fig 6b and c we considered 500 simulations to be adequate by plotting and visually inspecting that the change in cumulative output sensitivity stabilized near zero as the number of simulations increased in increments of 50 fig s5 like our remm analysis we also used cvd sensitivity analysis methods for the full swat simulation fig 7 largely similar parameters were identified as important as from the plischke et al method with more sensitivity of water table depth to slope length riverine nitrate load fig 7b and denitrification fig 7c had parameters with high interaction effects which again showed the interconnectedness of these parameters that were not individually influential denitrification saturation threshold had high interaction and total effects for those outputs showing its overwhelming importance to those processes despite having interactions with other factors results for the swat time varying water table depth sensitivity analyses are shown in fig 8 water table depth was sensitive to hydraulic conductivity clay lateral length bulk density and slope at all time scales including the full simulation soil layer thickness was not influential for the overall simulation but was for each of the finer time scales with particular importance during the final year of the simulation similarly slope and slope length were influential at only the finer time scales especially during the first and third years denitrification was only sensitive to the denitrification saturation threshold across all window sizes but not during all time windows fig s6 no figure was necessary for riverine nitrate load because the only influential parameter was denitrification saturation threshold which was influential during every time window 4 discussion 4 1 riparian nitrogen model comparison among the four models selected for evaluation of process inclusion and complexity none simultaneously balanced complexity broad utility and presence of the most important processes for riparian denitrification we recognize that these models were not developed specifically for riparian denitrification so this finding is not a criticism of each model s general utility but an evaluation of its representation of this process all of the models contained specific processes that required extensive input data that may not be feasible for users to provide remm provides detailed soils and vegetation parameterization but lacks in both groundwater and stream connections rnm simplifies representations of nutrients vegetation and some aspects of hydrology swat also simplifies nutrient cycling and groundwater flow but its algorithms for connecting the stream to the riparian zone are the most robust of the four models analyzed finally swat modflow rt3d includes highly complex hydrology algorithms but also omits the necessary fluvial connections that influence water table dynamics while these models are valuable tools for simulating riparian processes they all lack robust representation of the influence of channel morphology on riparian nitrogen removal these results suggest the need for an intermediate complexity riparian denitrification model to integrate hydrology and riparian nitrogen cycling with stream channel processes 4 2 remm expectations and findings many of the highly sensitive parameters in remm were unsurprising however there were several parameters that were not influential but were expected to be based on model structure past sensitivity analyses and physical understanding many past remm sensitivity analyses used local methods which are not directly comparable to our results but can be used to explore if certain outputs show sensitivity only at specific input values or across the entire range furthermore those results are broadly comparable because several past studies used data from the same location gibbs farm in tifton georgia usa graff et al 2005 kim et al 2007 lowrance et al 2000 or physiographic region coastal plain dukes and evans 2003 tilak 2012 as our analyses it makes physical sense that water table depth was controlled by soil layer thickness field capacity and topographic parameters that influence water delivery drainage area and surface slope and past sensitivity analyses mostly corroborate these findings dukes and evans 2003 graff et al 2005 tamanna et al 2021 tilak 2012 both physical understanding and past analyses suggested that depth to bedrock and stream depth influence water table depth altier et al 2002 dukes and evans 2003 tilak 2012 however neither of these parameters were identified as highly important in our results this discrepancy between our results and past local sensitivity analyses could be because we tested across the entire parameter space instead of only varying a single parameter by 10 100 since our results also do not align with our physical understanding another reason for this disagreement could be due to how remm represents these physical processes for example stream depth is based on thalweg elevation and is used to set the zone 1 hydraulic gradient limiting its effect to the near stream zone for subsurface dissolved nitrate load the sensitivity to permeability and slope coincided with previous analyses graff et al 2005 kim et al 2007 but we expected higher sensitivity to parameters such as root depth and nitrate concentration tamanna et al 2021 found that both water table depth and groundwater nitrate concentration were globally sensitive to soil porosity yet we found porosity to be unimportant to those outputs the sensitivity of dissolved nitrate to other influential parameters including percent clay and drainage area had not been studied in past sensitivity analyses the importance of the rate coefficient k and soil layer thickness to denitrification made physical sense and aligned with past model studies lowrance et al 2000 tilak 2012 however more sensitivity was expected from other parameters such as rooting depth carbon pools ph nitrate concentration and soil temperature which are used to calculate denitrification in the model altier et al 2002 and have been shown to control denitrification in field studies hefting et al 2006 hill et al 2000 ≈°imek and cooper 2002 waters et al 2014 soil hydraulic conductivity and clay content which influence anaerobic conditions by controlling soil saturation balestrini et al 2016 vidon and hill 2004 2006 were also expected to be more influential while denitrification showed slight sensitivity to some of these parameters nitrate permeability soil temperature clay percentage the reduced importance of these indicates that the rate coefficient is the most substantial driver of the way remm specifies denitrification this diminished sensitivity to ph rooting depth and carbon pools could also suggest that our parameter modifications did not substantially limit the conditions for denitrification finally for total nitrogen drainage area and slope may have been most influential because they control water and nitrogen import and export but previous local sensitivity analyses of total nitrogen either did not test these parameters or did not find them influential when varying them by 50 kim et al 2007 lowrance et al 2000 4 3 swat expectations and findings given the novelty of swat we are not aware of any global sensitivity analyses that are comparable with these results although many major algorithms remained unchanged between swat and swat previous swat results were not used for comparison with these swat results due to the differences in hydrologic routing bieger et al 2017 most of the swat studies also analyzed different hydrologic and nutrient outputs such as streamflow and total nitrogen water table depth was most sensitive to topographic and soil parameters which are both used directly to simulate water tables nitrate export and denitrification were only influenced by denitrification saturation threshold different from literature regarding biogeochemical mechanisms in riparian zones both nitrate and denitrification should have been sensitive to changes in parameters that explicitly control nitrogen amounts such as nitrate percolation and denitrification rate neitsch et al 2011 we expected typical controls of denitrification such as soil carbon ph and stream depth to be influential mosier et al 2002 qiong et al 2020 but they were not our physical understanding also suggests that aquifer properties should have showed greater control of nitrate transport to streams by affecting groundwater movement throughout the watershed however a review of field nitrate studies found that denitrification was primarily controlled by factors indicative of redox conditions such as saturation and that other environmental variables including nutrient availability and ph were much less influential rivett et al 2008 findings that agree with our swat results the overwhelming importance of the denitrification saturation threshold indicates that swat emphasizes when denitrification can occur more than how much denitrification can occur e g denitrification rate which aligns with the concept of biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 4 4 time varying sensitivity analyses the time varying results for both remm and swat corresponded well with trends in outputs and hydroclimatic conditions which aligned with previous time varying sensitivity analyses herman et al 2013b wu et al 2022 xie et al 2017 for remm water table depth was most sensitive to drainage area and surface slope in wetter years while most of the influence of field capacity was during drier years when the water table was suppressed these relationships make physical sense because drainage area and slope control the volume of water reaching the subsurface when groundwater tables are rising while field capacity controls water draining from soil pores when the water table is falling percent clay and permeability were most frequently influential at fine time scales during winter in swat water table depth was most sensitive to soil layer thickness when water table depth was low which coincided with drier periods conversely the importance of the other soil and topographic parameters generally decreased during these drier times denitrification in remm was sensitive to drainage area and surface slope only at seasonal and 30 day time windows and during summer and fall of the first two years when denitrification peaked soil layer thickness was most important at annual and seasonal time windows also during the peak periods of denitrification this correspondence to peak denitrification suggests the importance of saturation in calculating denitrification in remm especially since these parameters also controlled water table depth at varying scales the sporadic sensitivity of total nitrogen to permeability and rainfall interception during the summers of years 2 and 3 respectively was surprising but these were wet periods indicating the importance of total water export in controlling nitrogen loads the consistent sensitivity of denitrification and riverine nitrate load to denitrification saturation threshold in swat showed the overwhelming importance of that parameter regardless of output magnitude or hydroclimatic condition again this suggests that whether the soil is wet enough for denitrification is more important than the rate of denitrification in swat periods when denitrification was not sensitive to anything did not correspond to specific climatic conditions these time varying analyses also allowed us to identify parameters that are influential regardless of time scale output magnitude or hydroclimatic condition e g denitrification rate coefficient for denitrification in remm denitrification saturation threshold for riverine nitrate load in swat furthermore we identified parameters with increased prevalence of sensitivity as window size decreased a relationship that has previously been show to depend on output process time scale pianosi and wagener 2016 xie et al 2017 for example in remm water table depth may have been more sensitive to percent clay at finer time windows because clay affects soil water movement at the daily and sub daily time scale an effect that can appear less influential when aggregated to larger time periods topographic parameters such as drainage area and slope showed more influence at coarser time scales indicating a greater influence in the long term than the day to day hydrologic and nitrogen cycles 4 5 comparing remm and swat global sensitivity analyses on riparian nitrogen models are rare in literature making these detailed evaluations of remm and swat a novel contribution results from both global sensitivity analyses somewhat agreed with each other and with previous findings both sensitivity analyses showed water table depth was influenced by topographic parameters such as slope and slope length which corroborated past research burt et al 1999 2002 vidon and hill 2004 water table depth was also controlled by soil properties including hydraulic conductivity soil texture and soil thickness consistent with previous studies amatya et al 1997 burt et al 1999 hinton et al 1993 van meerveld et al 2015 however the two models did not have similar findings for the nitrogen cycling outputs swat nitrate and denitrification outputs did not show sensitivity to soil and topographic parameters particularly those that were influential in remm swat was highly sensitive to changes in denitrification saturation threshold a value hardwired in remm altier et al 2002 one possible factor contributing to differences between the model results is spatial scale remm operates at the field scale and swat at the watershed scale similar topographic and soil parameters influenced water table depth between the models indicating that this process has similar controls at both the field and watershed scale the slight or high sensitivity of nitrogen cycling in remm to soil parameters suggests that soil characteristics are more important for estimating nitrogen cycling at a riparian scale than at larger watershed scales where soil characteristics may be more variable and the effect of a unique characteristic could be diminished denitrification may also have been more sensitive to the rate coefficient in remm than in swat because the riparian zone is consistently wetter relative to the saturation threshold than across an entire watershed this suggests that denitrification at the watershed scale may be more controlled by the timing of when denitrification can occur but that the rate of denitrification is more important at the field scale where denitrification can occur more regularly these results align with recent findings that spatial sensitivity patterns in nitrogen modeling depend on nitrogen inputs and hydrological transport capacity wu et al 2022 whatever difference in model results that can be attributed to spatial scale has implications for model users who can focus parameterization efforts on the processes and parameters that dominate at the scale of interest the discrepancies between these results and expectations based on past findings could also be due to model purpose and structure model developers come from various disciplines often including and emphasizing the processes that best achieve the purpose of the model riparian denitrification was not a main focus of the selected models possibly causing results to differ from expectations remm was developed to estimate the water quality benefits of riparian buffers for pesticides and nutrients while swat was developed to improve water and pollutant routing for watershed scale water resources modeling and management furthermore the complexity required for a calculation or simplifying assumptions made can influence the sensitivity analysis results in remm denitrification relies on seven factors including four multipliers that each vary with their own unique factors having so many factors that affect a single output can diminish the sensitivity of that output to expected inputs particularly if one is inherently more heavily weighted than the others or is hard coded in the model and cannot be changed one reason that stream depth may not have been influential in remm is that the model only uses stream depth for setting the hydraulic gradient in the near stream zone altier et al 2002 underrepresenting its importance in hydrologic and nutrient cycling calculations in swat stream depth is classified as a routing parameter and may be more intended for in channel processes than those in the floodplain nutrient calculations in this version of swat have not been extensively tested r srinivasan pers comm so further testing and refinement could yield more expected results several input variables that are often important for nitrate and denitrification calculations hydraulic conductivity and soil texture for example are not directly involved in model code for those processes neitsch et al 2011 although they can still indirectly influence denitrification by controlling soil water movement other denitrification controls including nitrate concentration initial water table depth and soil temperature have been influential in past studies batlle aguilar et al 2012 bouwman et al 2013 but swat structure currently precludes monte carlo analysis of these parameters regardless both denitrification rate and soil organic carbon are explicitly used in swat denitrification calculations neitsch et al 2011 and therefore should have shown more influence in our results 4 6 comparing sensitivity analysis methods another possible explanation for disagreement between the results and expectations could be due to the global sensitivity analysis methods swat does not have a published global sensitivity analysis and the only one published for remm used integrated local global methods with limited parameters tamanna et al 2021 testing remm across the entire parameter space simultaneously instead of with a local sensitivity analysis may have been responsible for different results blasone et al 2007 different global sensitivity methods can yield different results while we found slight differences in parameter importance using the plischke et al and cvd methods the fact that the two approaches largely agreed increases confidence in our findings another benefit of including the cvd method for the full simulation was the calculation of main and total main plus interaction effects to assess parameter importance and identifiability we define identifiability as the ability to constrain a vector of parameter values to reduce model uncertainty ghasemizade et al 2017 guillaume et al 2019 parameters with high main effect and low interaction effect are important and identifiable while those with high interaction effects are not identifiable baroni and francke 2020 ghasemizade et al 2017 important and identifiable parameters in remm were drainage area and slope for total nitrogen fig 4d and denitrification k for denitrification fig 4c layer thickness was the most important and identifiable parameter for water table depth although there was less disparity in main effect size than for other outputs fig 4a hydraulic conductivity was the most important parameter for determining water table depth in swat but had the highest interaction effect size in general the cvd method estimated higher interaction effects and thus fewer identifiable parameters for subsurface dissolved nitrate in remm fig 4b and riverine nitrate load and denitrification in swat fig 7b and c respectively which indicate model complexities that could explain why these outputs were highly sensitive to only one or two inputs and insensitive to others we expected 4 7 future research the initial evaluation of riparian nitrogen models determined that while they are valuable tools under many landscape settings they include overly complex methods for some processes while omitting or incompletely modeling others this finding was substantiated with sensitivity analyses that showed both water table depth and several nitrogen outputs were not sensitive to a majority of model inputs a critical parameter with minimal influence in the models was stream depth which represents the connection between channel and riparian processes due to the prevalence of stream erosion and incision as a result of land use change booth 1990 rheinhardt et al 2009 schilling et al 2009 shields et al 2010 simon and robbins 1987 and its known effect on both riparian hydrology groffman et al 2002 2003 hardison et al 2009 jung et al 2004 omar et al 2014 schilling et al 2004 and nitrogen cycling b√∂hlke et al 2007 gift et al 2010 groffman et al 2002 korol et al 2019 schilling et al 2006 schilling and jacobson 2008 this relationship requires improved model specification this research gap can be addressed by developing a parsimonious riparian nitrogen cycling model that includes the most sensitive parameters from remm and swat plus necessary parameters and algorithms for estimating the interplay between riparian nitrogen cycling hydrology and stream processes as identified in our sensitivity analysis major inputs should include topographic parameters slope slope length drainage area soil parameters soil texture layer thickness hydraulic conductivity and nutrient parameters carbon pool sizes denitrification rate coefficient and saturation threshold this model should incorporate many of the features in table 3 at sufficient complexity to represent the necessary processes across various physiographic settings but not so complex that it cannot be used and understood by watershed managers and modelers incorporating stream connections into model specification will be a challenging yet necessary step for improving the state of riparian nitrogen modeling notably this connection was made when remm was coupled with conservational channel evolution and pollutant transport system concepts to investigate the role of riparian water and vegetation on streambank erosion langendoen et al 2009 while the coupled model did not include nitrogen cycling it was an important initial step in modeling the riparian stream morphodynamic interaction including this interaction in future modeling efforts will require accounting for dynamic stream processes in response to changes throughout the watershed and stream network geometry and geomorphology of streams evolve along various trajectories and a subsequent model must be capable of simulating stream conditions in different stages of channel evolution booth and fischenich 2015 cluer and thorne 2014 hawley et al 2012 schumm et al 1984 stream depth can be modeled by accounting for in channel erosion and deposition which can then be applied to riparian calculations for estimating water table depth and denitrification hydrodynamic connections at the surface water groundwater interface should also be incorporated since nitrogen cycling can vary in response to losing and gaining stream conditions shuai et al 2017 trauth et al 2018 a model should be capable of simulating the bidirectional transfer of water and nitrogen between streams and riparian zones determination of the hydraulic gradient based on stream depth and stage as well as riparian hydrology will be necessary for accurately estimating two way fluxes of water and nutrients incorporating these stream riparian connections is essential and should be done in the simplest way possible while still including sufficient mechanistic rigor to reduce the number of required model inputs in this way a robust yet intermediately complex model can be developed for studying the role of riparian zones for mitigating nitrogen loading this improved riparian nitrogen modeling tool will be valuable for more comprehensively addressing nitrogen loading in incised stream networks riparian zones are an effective strategy for retaining and removing nitrogen but these capabilities can be compromised by stream incision thus management strategies to mitigate nitrogen loading should prioritize both riparian and stream condition emphasizing the hydrologic connection between the two global sensitivity analyses like those in this study improve understanding of model performance and limitations across a more encompassing range of parameter values and time scales which can be supplemented with knowledge of various real world systems to ultimately provide beneficial insights that inform action the coupled riparian stream approach is currently overlooked in management practices but the development of a parsimonious riparian nitrogen and channel morphodynamic model will be a significant enhancement to the toolbox for watershed managers looking to identify locations for and benefits of stream and riparian restoration 5 conclusions four standard riparian nitrogen models remm rnm swat and swat modflow rt3d were evaluated for their completeness and complexity of algorithms related to hydrologic processes vegetation soils nutrients and channel morphodynamic influences this was coupled with a global sensitivity analysis of remm and swat to identify the most influential parameters for determining water table depth and nitrogen cycling outputs the four models exhibited varying degrees of complexity for different components but a common finding was that the connection between riparian zones and stream morphodynamics was missing or minimal drainage area slope and soil layer thickness were the most commonly sensitive parameters across the chosen outputs in remm other nutrient and soil parameters including denitrification rate coefficient permeability and soil moisture controls like field capacity were also influential for certain outputs in swat water table depth was most sensitive to soil parameters such as hydraulic conductivity clay content and bulk density and the topographic parameters of lateral length slope and slope length nitrate export and denitrification were only sensitive to denitrification saturation threshold which might suggest the importance of defining when nitrogen removal can occur and not just the rate of removal time varying analyses of both models found a relationship between output sensitivity and hydroclimatic conditions that affected output magnitude greater sensitivity of nitrate and denitrification to soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity carbon and ph was expected based on past research our sensitivity results also confirm the need for an increased influence of stream depth on water table depth and riparian nitrogen cycling these analyses illustrate the need for improving riparian nitrogen modeling by striving for parsimony in the processes that are included and how extensively each is parameterized improved models that combine the best features of existing tools make appropriate simplifying assumptions and expand processes that are predominantly omitted are needed to improve model fidelity to physical understanding and support management applications across dynamic channel networks ultimately the finding that all models underrepresented stream connections and that none of the select model outputs were sensitive to stream channel depth which could result from incision and other factors verified the need for further study and specifically modeling of riparian nitrogen channel morphology interactions field studies have shown the influence of channel dynamics on riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling making this modeling gap an important one to address development of intermediate complexity riparian nitrogen models using both the most influential parameters and important missing parameters shown in this analysis will provide water resources managers and researchers with improved tools for estimating the role of riparian zones in mitigating nitrate loading to streams and how these benefits are impacted by channel morphodynamics software availability

25495,riparian zones can effectively reduce excess nitrogen loading to streams modeling nitrogen retention in riparian zones is useful especially at larger scales we evaluated select riparian nitrogen models for their robustness in representing hydrology vegetation soils nutrients and channel morphodynamics we used global time varying sensitivity analyses of remm riparian ecosystem management model and swat soil and water assessment tool to identify the most influential parameters for calculating water table depth and nitrogen processes both remm and swat were sensitive to topographic and soil parameters such as slope and soil layer thickness although spatial and temporal scale and hydroclimatic conditions affected parameter sensitivity neither model was sensitive to stream channel depth which is known to affect riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling it is necessary to incorporate stream morphodynamics like channel change into both riparian scale and watershed scale nitrogen models to provide useful management tools for addressing excessive nitrogen loading in stream networks keywords riparian zone nitrogen cycling remm swat sensitivity analysis numerical modeling 1 introduction eutrophication resulting from anthropogenic nutrient pollution is among the most substantial issues facing water resources professionals and society today more than 40 of stream length in the u s is impaired by nutrient pollution u s epa 2016 dissolved nitrate is an especially insidious pollutant because it is rapidly transported through groundwater and surface water and causes a variety of environmental problems from contaminating drinking water to eutrophication and associated algal blooms howarth et al 2011 nitrogen pollution is a primary driver of water quality degradation in coastal zones globally howarth 2008 including the dead zone in the gulf of mexico gro√üe et al 2019 nitrogen runoff from agricultural and urban areas is transported through river networks to the coast however less nitrogen reaches the coasts than is applied to land surfaces indicating that streams and riparian zones act as significant nutrient sinks peterson et al 2001 the protection and restoration of riparian zones is a cornerstone of effective nutrient management that complements source reductions nitrogen removal in riparian zones has long been an area of research often with the goal of restoring riparian functions to treat agricultural runoff hill 1979 1996 lowrance 1992 riparian zones effectively remove dissolved nitrate in runoff and groundwater e g hill 2019 mulholland et al 2008 newbold et al 2010 and these areas may contribute more to nitrogen removal than in stream processes craig et al 2008 lammers and bledsoe 2017 nitrogen is permanently removed in riparian zones through

source usually from riparian vegetation mosier et al 2002 channel incision bed erosion can lower riparian groundwater tables hardison et al 2009 disconnecting nitrate laden groundwater with soil organic carbon and microbial communities reducing denitrification potential and increasing nitrate loading to streams gift et al 2010 groffman et al 2002 this paper compares the mechanisms relevant to riparian denitrification in existing models via global sensitivity analysis to improve future simulation of nitrogen loading to streams 1 1 riparian nitrogen modeling despite the importance of denitrification the process is notoriously difficult to measure groffman et al 2006 and can occur sporadically in space and time when conditions are favorable mcclain et al 2003 riparian nitrogen models are therefore valuable for providing quantitative estimates of riparian denitrification and nutrient sequestration and guiding management activities in cases where direct measurement of these processes is not feasible several models exist for evaluating the influence of riparian zones on nitrogen loading to streams ranging from field scale models specifically for riparian zones to watershed scale models that include riparian processes arnold et al 1998 bieger et al 2017 lowrance et al 2000 sun et al 2018 typical processes included in a riparian nitrogen model are shown in fig 1 the riparian ecosystem management model remm is a field scale model for estimating the influence of riparian ecosystems on nonpoint source pollution altier et al 2002 lowrance et al 2000 daily denitrification is calculated through the interaction of temperature nitrate soil aeration and soil organic carbon the riparian nitrogen model rnm is a watershed scale model for estimating nitrogen removal via denitrification in riparian buffers along low and middle order streams rassam et al 2005 denitrification is estimated using a depth integrated exponential decay function with a rate coefficient based on a maximum denitrification rate and rooting depth the soil and water assessment tool swat is a watershed scale model capable of estimating nitrogen loading and routing throughout the watershed arnold et al 1998 several variations of swat have been developed to differentiate riparian zones from the uplands for better hydrologic and water quality calculations bieger et al 2017 hoang et al 2017 sun et al 2016 including an integrated swat remm to study the influences of riparian buffers on hydrology and nutrient cycling at a watershed scale ryu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a 2017b swat is one of the newest and more commonly used variations but denitrification is modeled the same as previous swat versions with an exponential decay equation of denitrification rate temperature saturation and organic carbon bieger et al 2017 neitsch et al 2011 swat modflow rt3d is the result of recent work to couple swat with groundwater and reactive transport models for improved simulation of three dimensional solute movement throughout watersheds wei et al 2019 rt3d is the nitrate transport engine of this model and it uses an advection dispersion equation to simulate the fate and transport of nitrate modflow groundwater algorithms have also been integrated separately into the new swat bailey et al 2020 the trend toward increasing model complexity may allow for more realistic simulation of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes but also at a cost of increased data requirements computational power and uncertainty potentially making these models less useful for managers quantification of model sensitivity and uncertainty can help users interpret results and strike the balance between model complexity and utility 1 2 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses uncertainty is an unavoidable side effect of environmental modeling and quantifying this uncertainty is essential for assessing the accuracy and reliability of model outputs and better understanding model structure byrd and melching 2005 melching and bauwens 2001 pappenberger and beven 2006 an effective approach to uncertainty analysis is monte carlo simulations essentially a model is run hundreds or thousands of times with each model run using a slightly different set of model inputs this provides a distribution of model outputs directly accounting for the uncertainty in model inputs sensitivity analyses apportion the uncertainty in this distribution of model output to different input variables identifying which inputs most influence model results saltelli et al 2004 sensitivity analyses can be local or global saltelli et al 2004 local or one at a time sensitivity analyses focus on quantifying parameter influence while changing a single parameter from the base case and fixing the remaining parameters whereas global sensitivity analyses select across the entire parameter space for all inputs of interest tian 2013 in general global sensitivity analyses are preferable to local due to their ability to account for parameter influences across the entire range of reasonable values and compatibility with non linear models making results more generalizable and less influenced by modeler bias song et al 2015 nearly half of published sensitivity analyses in science related fields use global methods saltelli et al 2019 with a positive trend in prevalence of global sensitivity analyses in recent years ferretti et al 2016 global sensitivity analyses can belong to one of several sub classes regression based variance based and density based among others regression based global sensitivity analyses are one of the most common due to the moderate computing power required and easily understandable outputs i e regression coefficients and r2 but generally require a linear relationship between parameter and model output ferretti et al 2016 song et al 2015 variance based approaches use a variance ratio to determine both first order and total effects which can be advantageous because it works with models of varying type and complexity including those with significant parameter interactions however variance based methods can be computationally intensive or require strict sampling design saltelli et al 1999 2010 song et al 2015 density based methods provide a suite of probability density curves for each parameter across its selected range but sensitivity values are only informative for relative comparisons plischke et al 2013 the density based methods of plischke et al 2013 can be advantageous over other methods because they are less computationally intensive can be used with log transformed outputs and have been applied to various water resources related studies borgonovo et al 2017 herman et al 2015 lammers et al 2017 most sensitivity analyses determine parameter sensitivity aggregated across the entire time series which leads to incomplete information recent studies have investigated time varying sensitivity at preset intervals to determine how input importance changes under variable conditions ghoreishi et al 2021 herman et al 2013a 2013b pianosi and wagener 2016 reusser et al 2011 reusser and zehe 2011 wagener et al 2003 wu et al 2022 these studies have found that parameter sensitivities change in response to dominant real world processes that control hydrologic transport during wet and dry conditions such as interflow and snowmelt reusser et al 2011 reusser and zehe 2011 wu et al 2022 time varying sensitivity analyses improve understanding of how these different processes control model outputs and how well a model incorporates these processes sensitivity and uncertainty analyses on terrestrial nitrogen models have shown that soil and hydrologic parameters and processes are most important for simulating nitrogen transport mcintyre et al 2005 rankinen et al 2013 however modeled denitrification rates were perhaps unsurprisingly influenced by factors that are known to directly control denitrification such as temperature and nitrate concentration bouwman et al 2013 denitrification estimates are also sensitive to parameters influencing soil moisture including groundwater table depth heinen 2006 stream channel characteristics such as streamflow and depth can also influence simulated denitrification via their connection to the riparian groundwater table dukes and evans 2003 tilak 2012 using streamflow data to calibrate a denitrification model can constrain and reduce the uncertainty in values for soil parameters and thus the denitrification estimates emphasizing the inherent interplay between the two tague 2009 despite these results to our knowledge there are no comparative analyses of global sensitivity results for riparian nitrogen models many aspects of the models are complex and prohibitively data intensive to parameterize therefore there is a need for a comprehensive summary and comparison of riparian nitrogen models and investigation of uncertainty and sensitivity of model outputs a rigorous comparison of processes incorporated into these models can identify what is lacking and how that affects model utility furthermore this can help inform future research and model development as well as provide guidance for model users on which parameters should be most carefully quantified to reduce model uncertainty 1 3 objectives the objectives of this research are to 1 compare the mechanisms incorporated in existing riparian denitrification models and 2 conduct a global time varying sensitivity analysis of two of these models remm and swat comparing current tools for modeling riparian nitrogen processes including the specific model algorithms that are present inadequate or omitted provides insight into the state of riparian nitrogen modeling and pinpoint research directions that are most needed for improvement the global sensitivity analyses will allow for a critical evaluation of existing models to determine which parameters are most influential for hydrologic and nitrogen processes in those models time varying sensitivity analysis methods will show how these influential parameters change with variable hydroclimatic conditions while remm and swat operate at different spatial scales we can use our findings to draw general conclusions about processes that are either ubiquitously underrepresented in riparian nitrogen models or lacking at different scales the results from this study can be used to improve existing models and provide a basis for building a parsimonious riparian nitrogen model with the most relevant parameters and processes 2 methods we identified four riparian nitrogen models remm rnm swat and swat modflow rt3d to analyze for their mechanistic complexity number of parameters spatial and temporal resolution data requirements and fidelity to scientific processes we assigned a qualitative score from zero to three to model algorithms related to hydrology nutrients soils vegetation and stream connectivity see table 3 in section 3 1 scores were representative of the data requirements and physical robustness of the equation with zero meaning the process was completely omitted one indicating low complexity and three indicating high complexity complexity was scored based on the required parameterization to calculate that process relative to other known calculation methods hydrologic processes that were evaluated were surface runoff and infiltration evapotranspiration and subsurface flow the only nutrient process that we considered in this analysis was denitrification for soils we evaluated the number of soil layers and relationship between organic matter and depth along with the types and general parameterization of vegetation finally we assessed geomorphic bank storage and overbank flow algorithms to determine the ability of the models to connect the stream with the riparian zone although other riparian nitrogen models exist these four models were selected because they are prevalent in literature and representative of the spectrum of spatial scales regional applications complexity and the advances in riparian process modeling in the last few decades remm is a field scale model that was developed by the usda ars in georgia usa altier et al 2002 and has been applied in a variety of landscapes across the united states tamanna 2021 and internationally when coupled as swat remm ryu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017a rnm is a catchment scale model developed for low and middle order streams in australia with capabilities of estimating denitrification for ephemeral and perennial channels rassam et al 2005 swat is a recent adaptation of the watershed scale swat to better represent watershed spatial connections including floodplain and upland flow and pollutant routing bieger et al 2017 similar to remm swat was initially tested at the little river experimental watershed in georgia swat modflow rt3d couples swat with modflow for improved groundwater process representation and rt3d for solute transport at the catchment scale wei et al 2019 this model was initially tested in a large watershed 4100 km2 in oregon usa comparing the mechanistic complexity of these models is useful because they are representative of the diversity in scale and landscape application of riparian nitrogen models we performed a global sensitivity analysis of remm and swat to identify model parameters that most affected model output and to identify processes that may not be adequately represented these two models were chosen due to their ease to implement and their intermediate complexity as determined in the prior assessment remm was selected due to its specificity to field scale riparian systems and detailed hydrology and vegetation models many past applications of remm have included a local sensitivity analysis dukes and evans 2003 graff et al 2005 kim et al 2007 lowrance et al 2000 tilak 2012 but only one attempted to use a global sensitivity analysis tamanna et al 2021 we analyzed swat because it is a recent improvement of the widely applied watershed scale swat model that explicitly differentiates riparian zones from uplands furthermore we chose to analyze these models that simulate at various spatial scales to investigate generalizable strengths and shortcomings in riparian nitrogen modeling the monte carlo and sensitivity analysis procedures for each of these models followed an identical structure 1 selection of parameters to test 2 identification of valid ranges for each parameter based on literature model documentation and expert judgement 3 random sampling of parameter values from a representative statistical distribution 4 simulations of the model using unique parameter sets 500 for swat 1000 for remm and 5 global density based sensitivity analysis using methods of plischke et al 2013 sensitivity analyses were performed for the entire simulation and repeated with annual seasonal and 30 day non moving time windows to investigate how parameter sensitivity varied across temporal scales seasonal time windows were initiated at the associated solstice or equinox while 30 day time windows were initiated on the first day of the simulation and segmented every 30 days only time windows with an end date that was completely encompassed in the simulation timeframe were used results using the plischke et al method for the full simulation were compared to a more recent approach baroni and francke 2020 that combines variance and distribution based cvd methods and estimates main effect and interactions separately since results using these two methods were similar only the plischke et al method was used for the time varying analysis for shorter time scales the cvd method failed because some outputs did not change sufficiently over a month or season 2 1 remm sensitivity analysis the riparian ecosystem management model is a continuous field scale model that performs daily balances on water sediment and nutrients in riparian buffers altier et al 2002 the model code was edited to accommodate this sensitivity analysis parameter modifications were made relative to an example dataset from the gibbs farm in the little river watershed near tifton georgia usa we selected 47 of the more than 150 remm parameters for this sensitivity analysis table 1 focusing on those that we hypothesized would influence riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling parameters describing the buffer soil vegetation and rate coefficients were varied while time series data i e weather and field inputs were not adjusted because we assumed that they were inherently influential on the studied outputs and must be specified in future modeling regardless we chose distributions and ranges for each parameter based on literature if data were not found in literature then we based distributions and ranges on remm documentation or 50 100 variations of remm example data many soil parameters were treated as uniform distributions across their common ranges so that all soil types could be reasonably tested log normal distributions used the natural logarithm we defined means and standard deviations for selection of random values from each distribution mean values were assumed to be either middle of the chosen range a literature value assumed based on expert judgement or the value used in the default gibbs farm remm model standard deviations when not found were specified as one fourth the range hozo et al 2005 complete tables of distributions and statistics for these parameters can be found in the supplemental materials tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 we accounted for several simple correlations among parameters to ensure that the parameter sets represented realistic conditions e g soil bulk density was based off of clay content additionally we checked logical relationships between parameters and adjusted them accordingly e g field capacity could not exceed porosity see the supplemental materials for more details parameter values in each of the three riparian zones fig 2 were changed identically meaning that the only differences among the zones were in the parameters that remained as defaults of the gibbs farm model excluding the correlation for clay content we changed each of the three soil layers homogeneously we performed more than 1000 remm simulations each driven by the four years of daily time series data collected at gibbs farm representing wet dry and average amounts of precipitation precipitation was above average for the first and third years approximately average in the second year and drier than average in the final year only the first 1000 model results with outputs that were greater than zero and did not include any n a values were included in the sensitivity analysis we analyzed the following model outputs near stream water table depth subsurface dissolved nitrogen load to stream total denitrification and total nitrogen balanced in the near stream zone zone 1 in fig 2 for each model run we used the standard deviation of the four years or whichever time window was used of daily values for water table depth and the sum of the four years of daily values for nitrogen outputs in the density based sensitivity analysis plischke et al 2013 in this method probability distributions of model output were conditioned on different modeled inputs we then compared these distributions to the total unconditioned probability distribution of all modeled output larger differences between conditioned and unconditioned probability distributions indicated that input variable had a larger effect on model output we performed 500 bootstrapping iterations to minimize bias and calculate confidence intervals and used natural logarithm transformations when output distributions were skewed a dummy variable a purely random set of numbers not used in remm was included as a baseline to account for noise in the sensitivity method highly sensitive input parameters are those with a minimum sensitivity index value larger than the maximum sensitivity of the dummy variable all monte carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses were conducted in r r core team 2021

of swat is a semi distributed continuous watershed scale model which differentiates riparian zone processes from both channel and upland processes of the hundreds of available parameters in swat we selected 19 for this analysis table 2 including those hypothesized to influence riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling and focusing on ones that can be reasonably quantified by a user the default model like remm was a simulation in the little river experimental watershed in southern georgia a model that was used to test swat during its development bieger et al 2017 we ran the model at a daily time step for four years representing wet dry and average amounts of precipitation with three years of model warmup the first two simulation years had above average precipitation followed by a drier than average third year and an average fourth year of precipitation we defined distributions ranges means and standard deviations using the same procedures as outlined for remm maintaining similarities for parameters that were identical between the two models swat recommended minima and maxima were set as parameter range boundaries when reasonable the most notable difference for swat was that most parameters were spatially distributed in hydrologic response units hrus rather than given as a single value we modified these spatial parameters based on percent changes to the base value this ensured that all parameters were changed directionally and proportionally while maintaining the spatial relations values for spatially invariable defaults were changed using the same selection procedure as for remm a complete table of parameters distributions and statistics can be found in the supplemental materials table s5 we also used correlations similar to those in remm which are discussed in the supplemental materials swatplusr an r package for automating swat simulations sch√ºrz 2019 was used to perform monte carlo simulations along with the same r packages from the remm analysis we conducted 500 error free simulations due to high computational time the same density based sensitivity analysis methods were performed using standard deviations of daily water table depth and sums of daily nitrogen outputs outputs selected for analysis were basin averaged water table depth and denitrification plus basin output riverine nitrate load 3 results 3 1 model comparison we analyzed four innovative and representative riparian nitrogen models remm rnm swat and swat modflow rt3d for their completeness and complexity of algorithms for hydrology nutrients soils vegetation and stream connections table 3 all four models had similar methods for performing hydrologic calculations using either or both of the curve number hawkins 1980 and green ampt green and ampt 1911 equations for infiltration evapotranspiration in all four models was highly complex since each was capable of applying the data intensive penman monteith equation groundwater was represented at low complexity in all models except swat modflow rt3d which used the complex groundwater algorithms from modflow remm utilized the most detailed approach for estimating denitrification with a first order decay equation that incorporated multiplicative factors based on ph saturation carbon available nitrate and temperature this was much more complex than the simple first order decay equations in rnm and swat or the advection dispersion equation used in swat modflow rt3d the designation of soil layers was most complex in swat and swat modflow rt3d which allowed up to 25 layers estimation of organic matter with depth was most complex in remm which performed a carbon balance in every soil layer vegetation algorithms were also most intricate in remm with specification of one of a dozen types of vegetation for each zone of the riparian buffer and detailed calculations of vegetative growth the only model that included a geomorphic connection between the stream and riparian water table was remm which used the thalweg elevation of the stream to set the hydraulic gradient for the water table depth in the near stream riparian zone however there was no bank storage calculation in remm despite all other models including it swat was the only model of those selected that accounted for overbank flows which was done by defining a floodplain landscape unit and routing water onto it when a known or calculated bankfull discharge was exceeded bieger et al 2017 detailed information on each of these models can be found in their respective documentation altier et al 2002 rassam et al 2005 texas a m university 2022 wei et al 2019 3 2 remm sensitivity analysis results select results of the remm sensitivity analysis using the methods of plischke et al 2013 for the full simulation are displayed in fig 3 showing only sensitive parameters and those of most interest complete results can be found in supplemental materials fig s1 we determined 1000 simulations to be adequate by visually verifying parameter sensitivity values stabilized for each output as simulations increased in increments of 50 fig s2 parameters were considered highly sensitive if there was no overlap with the dummy variable parameters were considered slightly sensitive if there was only slight overlap but no overlap in interquartile range water table depth was highly sensitive to soil layer thickness and slightly sensitive to drainage area surface slope and field capacity for the plischke et al method fig 3a subsurface dissolved nitrate loading to the stream was highly sensitive to permeability and percent clay fig 3b slope and bulk density showed slight sensitivity despite the overlap of the error bars and mean dummy sensitivity in the plot denitrification was highly sensitive to the denitrification rate coefficient k and soil layer thickness fig 3c slope drainage area permeability stream depth and various carbon and nitrogen concentrations slightly influenced denitrification total nitrogen was highly sensitive to drainage area and surface slope and slightly sensitive to permeability field capacity and soil layer thickness fig 3d each output was overall sensitive to only a few parameters aligning with the pareto principle that the majority of the consequences in this case sensitivity result from the vital few causes results for the full simulation using the baroni and francke 2020 combined variance and distribution based cvd method are shown in fig 4 the most influential parameters were similar between the two methods with total nitrogen showing additional sensitivity to riparian zone width for the cvd method fig 4d high interaction effects for subsurface dissolved nitrate fig 4b signified that although most parameters were not individually sensitive they had substantial interactions with other parameters interaction effects were relatively low for the other outputs results for the remm time varying water table depth sensitivity analyses are shown in fig 5 only parameters that were influential at multiple window sizes are shown drainage area surface slope field capacity permeability and percent clay drainage area and surface slope had the most consistent sensitivity across time periods with the highest sensitivity occurring during spring of years 2 and 4 the importance of other variables was sporadic but most substantial during year 4 water table depth was not sensitive to layer thickness at finer time scales despite it being the most influential parameter across the full simulation similar figures for the other outputs are shown in the supplementary materials figs s3 and s4 subsurface dissolved nitrate did not change enough across the shorter time scales to provide reliable sensitivity outputs and was therefore excluded from the time varying analysis denitrification was most sensitive to the denitrification rate coefficient and soil layer thickness for all or most of the simulation but sensitive to surface slope and drainage area only when denitrification was high fig s3 volumetric water content permeability percent clay and rooting depth became influential at several 30 day time windows but not during any longer periods total nitrogen was consistently sensitive to drainage area and slope and sporadically sensitive to permeability and rainfall interception fig s4 percent clay and maximum rooting depth were influential only during a few 30 day time windows 3 3 swat sensitivity analysis results swat sensitivity analysis results using the plischke et al method are displayed in fig 6 results showed only a few inputs exerting most of the influence on the outputs which again agreed with the pareto principle water table depth was highly sensitive to field parameters such as lateral length and slope fig 6a soil properties such as clay content hydraulic conductivity bulk density and soil layer thickness also highly influenced water table depth water table depth was slightly sensitive to slope length and soil layer thickness among others nitrate export from the watershed and total denitrification were only highly sensitive to the denitrification saturation threshold fig 6b and c we considered 500 simulations to be adequate by plotting and visually inspecting that the change in cumulative output sensitivity stabilized near zero as the number of simulations increased in increments of 50 fig s5 like our remm analysis we also used cvd sensitivity analysis methods for the full swat simulation fig 7 largely similar parameters were identified as important as from the plischke et al method with more sensitivity of water table depth to slope length riverine nitrate load fig 7b and denitrification fig 7c had parameters with high interaction effects which again showed the interconnectedness of these parameters that were not individually influential denitrification saturation threshold had high interaction and total effects for those outputs showing its overwhelming importance to those processes despite having interactions with other factors results for the swat time varying water table depth sensitivity analyses are shown in fig 8 water table depth was sensitive to hydraulic conductivity clay lateral length bulk density and slope at all time scales including the full simulation soil layer thickness was not influential for the overall simulation but was for each of the finer time scales with particular importance during the final year of the simulation similarly slope and slope length were influential at only the finer time scales especially during the first and third years denitrification was only sensitive to the denitrification saturation threshold across all window sizes but not during all time windows fig s6 no figure was necessary for riverine nitrate load because the only influential parameter was denitrification saturation threshold which was influential during every time window 4 discussion 4 1 riparian nitrogen model comparison among the four models selected for evaluation of process inclusion and complexity none simultaneously balanced complexity broad utility and presence of the most important processes for riparian denitrification we recognize that these models were not developed specifically for riparian denitrification so this finding is not a criticism of each model s general utility but an evaluation of its representation of this process all of the models contained specific processes that required extensive input data that may not be feasible for users to provide remm provides detailed soils and vegetation parameterization but lacks in both groundwater and stream connections rnm simplifies representations of nutrients vegetation and some aspects of hydrology swat also simplifies nutrient cycling and groundwater flow but its algorithms for connecting the stream to the riparian zone are the most robust of the four models analyzed finally swat modflow rt3d includes highly complex hydrology algorithms but also omits the necessary fluvial connections that influence water table dynamics while these models are valuable tools for simulating riparian processes they all lack robust representation of the influence of channel morphology on riparian nitrogen removal these results suggest the need for an intermediate complexity riparian denitrification model to integrate hydrology and riparian nitrogen cycling with stream channel processes 4 2 remm expectations and findings many of the highly sensitive parameters in remm were unsurprising however there were several parameters that were not influential but were expected to be based on model structure past sensitivity analyses and physical understanding many past remm sensitivity analyses used local methods which are not directly comparable to our results but can be used to explore if certain outputs show sensitivity only at specific input values or across the entire range furthermore those results are broadly comparable because several past studies used data from the same location gibbs farm in tifton georgia usa graff et al 2005 kim et al 2007 lowrance et al 2000 or physiographic region coastal plain dukes and evans 2003 tilak 2012 as our analyses it makes physical sense that water table depth was controlled by soil layer thickness field capacity and topographic parameters that influence water delivery drainage area and surface slope and past sensitivity analyses mostly corroborate these findings dukes and evans 2003 graff et al 2005 tamanna et al 2021 tilak 2012 both physical understanding and past analyses suggested that depth to bedrock and stream depth influence water table depth altier et al 2002 dukes and evans 2003 tilak 2012 however neither of these parameters were identified as highly important in our results this discrepancy between our results and past local sensitivity analyses could be because we tested across the entire parameter space instead of only varying a single parameter by 10 100 since our results also do not align with our physical understanding another reason for this disagreement could be due to how remm represents these physical processes for example stream depth is based on thalweg elevation and is used to set the zone 1 hydraulic gradient limiting its effect to the near stream zone for subsurface dissolved nitrate load the sensitivity to permeability and slope coincided with previous analyses graff et al 2005 kim et al 2007 but we expected higher sensitivity to parameters such as root depth and nitrate concentration tamanna et al 2021 found that both water table depth and groundwater nitrate concentration were globally sensitive to soil porosity yet we found porosity to be unimportant to those outputs the sensitivity of dissolved nitrate to other influential parameters including percent clay and drainage area had not been studied in past sensitivity analyses the importance of the rate coefficient k and soil layer thickness to denitrification made physical sense and aligned with past model studies lowrance et al 2000 tilak 2012 however more sensitivity was expected from other parameters such as rooting depth carbon pools ph nitrate concentration and soil temperature which are used to calculate denitrification in the model altier et al 2002 and have been shown to control denitrification in field studies hefting et al 2006 hill et al 2000 ≈°imek and cooper 2002 waters et al 2014 soil hydraulic conductivity and clay content which influence anaerobic conditions by controlling soil saturation balestrini et al 2016 vidon and hill 2004 2006 were also expected to be more influential while denitrification showed slight sensitivity to some of these parameters nitrate permeability soil temperature clay percentage the reduced importance of these indicates that the rate coefficient is the most substantial driver of the way remm specifies denitrification this diminished sensitivity to ph rooting depth and carbon pools could also suggest that our parameter modifications did not substantially limit the conditions for denitrification finally for total nitrogen drainage area and slope may have been most influential because they control water and nitrogen import and export but previous local sensitivity analyses of total nitrogen either did not test these parameters or did not find them influential when varying them by 50 kim et al 2007 lowrance et al 2000 4 3 swat expectations and findings given the novelty of swat we are not aware of any global sensitivity analyses that are comparable with these results although many major algorithms remained unchanged between swat and swat previous swat results were not used for comparison with these swat results due to the differences in hydrologic routing bieger et al 2017 most of the swat studies also analyzed different hydrologic and nutrient outputs such as streamflow and total nitrogen water table depth was most sensitive to topographic and soil parameters which are both used directly to simulate water tables nitrate export and denitrification were only influenced by denitrification saturation threshold different from literature regarding biogeochemical mechanisms in riparian zones both nitrate and denitrification should have been sensitive to changes in parameters that explicitly control nitrogen amounts such as nitrate percolation and denitrification rate neitsch et al 2011 we expected typical controls of denitrification such as soil carbon ph and stream depth to be influential mosier et al 2002 qiong et al 2020 but they were not our physical understanding also suggests that aquifer properties should have showed greater control of nitrate transport to streams by affecting groundwater movement throughout the watershed however a review of field nitrate studies found that denitrification was primarily controlled by factors indicative of redox conditions such as saturation and that other environmental variables including nutrient availability and ph were much less influential rivett et al 2008 findings that agree with our swat results the overwhelming importance of the denitrification saturation threshold indicates that swat emphasizes when denitrification can occur more than how much denitrification can occur e g denitrification rate which aligns with the concept of biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 4 4 time varying sensitivity analyses the time varying results for both remm and swat corresponded well with trends in outputs and hydroclimatic conditions which aligned with previous time varying sensitivity analyses herman et al 2013b wu et al 2022 xie et al 2017 for remm water table depth was most sensitive to drainage area and surface slope in wetter years while most of the influence of field capacity was during drier years when the water table was suppressed these relationships make physical sense because drainage area and slope control the volume of water reaching the subsurface when groundwater tables are rising while field capacity controls water draining from soil pores when the water table is falling percent clay and permeability were most frequently influential at fine time scales during winter in swat water table depth was most sensitive to soil layer thickness when water table depth was low which coincided with drier periods conversely the importance of the other soil and topographic parameters generally decreased during these drier times denitrification in remm was sensitive to drainage area and surface slope only at seasonal and 30 day time windows and during summer and fall of the first two years when denitrification peaked soil layer thickness was most important at annual and seasonal time windows also during the peak periods of denitrification this correspondence to peak denitrification suggests the importance of saturation in calculating denitrification in remm especially since these parameters also controlled water table depth at varying scales the sporadic sensitivity of total nitrogen to permeability and rainfall interception during the summers of years 2 and 3 respectively was surprising but these were wet periods indicating the importance of total water export in controlling nitrogen loads the consistent sensitivity of denitrification and riverine nitrate load to denitrification saturation threshold in swat showed the overwhelming importance of that parameter regardless of output magnitude or hydroclimatic condition again this suggests that whether the soil is wet enough for denitrification is more important than the rate of denitrification in swat periods when denitrification was not sensitive to anything did not correspond to specific climatic conditions these time varying analyses also allowed us to identify parameters that are influential regardless of time scale output magnitude or hydroclimatic condition e g denitrification rate coefficient for denitrification in remm denitrification saturation threshold for riverine nitrate load in swat furthermore we identified parameters with increased prevalence of sensitivity as window size decreased a relationship that has previously been show to depend on output process time scale pianosi and wagener 2016 xie et al 2017 for example in remm water table depth may have been more sensitive to percent clay at finer time windows because clay affects soil water movement at the daily and sub daily time scale an effect that can appear less influential when aggregated to larger time periods topographic parameters such as drainage area and slope showed more influence at coarser time scales indicating a greater influence in the long term than the day to day hydrologic and nitrogen cycles 4 5 comparing remm and swat global sensitivity analyses on riparian nitrogen models are rare in literature making these detailed evaluations of remm and swat a novel contribution results from both global sensitivity analyses somewhat agreed with each other and with previous findings both sensitivity analyses showed water table depth was influenced by topographic parameters such as slope and slope length which corroborated past research burt et al 1999 2002 vidon and hill 2004 water table depth was also controlled by soil properties including hydraulic conductivity soil texture and soil thickness consistent with previous studies amatya et al 1997 burt et al 1999 hinton et al 1993 van meerveld et al 2015 however the two models did not have similar findings for the nitrogen cycling outputs swat nitrate and denitrification outputs did not show sensitivity to soil and topographic parameters particularly those that were influential in remm swat was highly sensitive to changes in denitrification saturation threshold a value hardwired in remm altier et al 2002 one possible factor contributing to differences between the model results is spatial scale remm operates at the field scale and swat at the watershed scale similar topographic and soil parameters influenced water table depth between the models indicating that this process has similar controls at both the field and watershed scale the slight or high sensitivity of nitrogen cycling in remm to soil parameters suggests that soil characteristics are more important for estimating nitrogen cycling at a riparian scale than at larger watershed scales where soil characteristics may be more variable and the effect of a unique characteristic could be diminished denitrification may also have been more sensitive to the rate coefficient in remm than in swat because the riparian zone is consistently wetter relative to the saturation threshold than across an entire watershed this suggests that denitrification at the watershed scale may be more controlled by the timing of when denitrification can occur but that the rate of denitrification is more important at the field scale where denitrification can occur more regularly these results align with recent findings that spatial sensitivity patterns in nitrogen modeling depend on nitrogen inputs and hydrological transport capacity wu et al 2022 whatever difference in model results that can be attributed to spatial scale has implications for model users who can focus parameterization efforts on the processes and parameters that dominate at the scale of interest the discrepancies between these results and expectations based on past findings could also be due to model purpose and structure model developers come from various disciplines often including and emphasizing the processes that best achieve the purpose of the model riparian denitrification was not a main focus of the selected models possibly causing results to differ from expectations remm was developed to estimate the water quality benefits of riparian buffers for pesticides and nutrients while swat was developed to improve water and pollutant routing for watershed scale water resources modeling and management furthermore the complexity required for a calculation or simplifying assumptions made can influence the sensitivity analysis results in remm denitrification relies on seven factors including four multipliers that each vary with their own unique factors having so many factors that affect a single output can diminish the sensitivity of that output to expected inputs particularly if one is inherently more heavily weighted than the others or is hard coded in the model and cannot be changed one reason that stream depth may not have been influential in remm is that the model only uses stream depth for setting the hydraulic gradient in the near stream zone altier et al 2002 underrepresenting its importance in hydrologic and nutrient cycling calculations in swat stream depth is classified as a routing parameter and may be more intended for in channel processes than those in the floodplain nutrient calculations in this version of swat have not been extensively tested r srinivasan pers comm so further testing and refinement could yield more expected results several input variables that are often important for nitrate and denitrification calculations hydraulic conductivity and soil texture for example are not directly involved in model code for those processes neitsch et al 2011 although they can still indirectly influence denitrification by controlling soil water movement other denitrification controls including nitrate concentration initial water table depth and soil temperature have been influential in past studies batlle aguilar et al 2012 bouwman et al 2013 but swat structure currently precludes monte carlo analysis of these parameters regardless both denitrification rate and soil organic carbon are explicitly used in swat denitrification calculations neitsch et al 2011 and therefore should have shown more influence in our results 4 6 comparing sensitivity analysis methods another possible explanation for disagreement between the results and expectations could be due to the global sensitivity analysis methods swat does not have a published global sensitivity analysis and the only one published for remm used integrated local global methods with limited parameters tamanna et al 2021 testing remm across the entire parameter space simultaneously instead of with a local sensitivity analysis may have been responsible for different results blasone et al 2007 different global sensitivity methods can yield different results while we found slight differences in parameter importance using the plischke et al and cvd methods the fact that the two approaches largely agreed increases confidence in our findings another benefit of including the cvd method for the full simulation was the calculation of main and total main plus interaction effects to assess parameter importance and identifiability we define identifiability as the ability to constrain a vector of parameter values to reduce model uncertainty ghasemizade et al 2017 guillaume et al 2019 parameters with high main effect and low interaction effect are important and identifiable while those with high interaction effects are not identifiable baroni and francke 2020 ghasemizade et al 2017 important and identifiable parameters in remm were drainage area and slope for total nitrogen fig 4d and denitrification k for denitrification fig 4c layer thickness was the most important and identifiable parameter for water table depth although there was less disparity in main effect size than for other outputs fig 4a hydraulic conductivity was the most important parameter for determining water table depth in swat but had the highest interaction effect size in general the cvd method estimated higher interaction effects and thus fewer identifiable parameters for subsurface dissolved nitrate in remm fig 4b and riverine nitrate load and denitrification in swat fig 7b and c respectively which indicate model complexities that could explain why these outputs were highly sensitive to only one or two inputs and insensitive to others we expected 4 7 future research the initial evaluation of riparian nitrogen models determined that while they are valuable tools under many landscape settings they include overly complex methods for some processes while omitting or incompletely modeling others this finding was substantiated with sensitivity analyses that showed both water table depth and several nitrogen outputs were not sensitive to a majority of model inputs a critical parameter with minimal influence in the models was stream depth which represents the connection between channel and riparian processes due to the prevalence of stream erosion and incision as a result of land use change booth 1990 rheinhardt et al 2009 schilling et al 2009 shields et al 2010 simon and robbins 1987 and its known effect on both riparian hydrology groffman et al 2002 2003 hardison et al 2009 jung et al 2004 omar et al 2014 schilling et al 2004 and nitrogen cycling b√∂hlke et al 2007 gift et al 2010 groffman et al 2002 korol et al 2019 schilling et al 2006 schilling and jacobson 2008 this relationship requires improved model specification this research gap can be addressed by developing a parsimonious riparian nitrogen cycling model that includes the most sensitive parameters from remm and swat plus necessary parameters and algorithms for estimating the interplay between riparian nitrogen cycling hydrology and stream processes as identified in our sensitivity analysis major inputs should include topographic parameters slope slope length drainage area soil parameters soil texture layer thickness hydraulic conductivity and nutrient parameters carbon pool sizes denitrification rate coefficient and saturation threshold this model should incorporate many of the features in table 3 at sufficient complexity to represent the necessary processes across various physiographic settings but not so complex that it cannot be used and understood by watershed managers and modelers incorporating stream connections into model specification will be a challenging yet necessary step for improving the state of riparian nitrogen modeling notably this connection was made when remm was coupled with conservational channel evolution and pollutant transport system concepts to investigate the role of riparian water and vegetation on streambank erosion langendoen et al 2009 while the coupled model did not include nitrogen cycling it was an important initial step in modeling the riparian stream morphodynamic interaction including this interaction in future modeling efforts will require accounting for dynamic stream processes in response to changes throughout the watershed and stream network geometry and geomorphology of streams evolve along various trajectories and a subsequent model must be capable of simulating stream conditions in different stages of channel evolution booth and fischenich 2015 cluer and thorne 2014 hawley et al 2012 schumm et al 1984 stream depth can be modeled by accounting for in channel erosion and deposition which can then be applied to riparian calculations for estimating water table depth and denitrification hydrodynamic connections at the surface water groundwater interface should also be incorporated since nitrogen cycling can vary in response to losing and gaining stream conditions shuai et al 2017 trauth et al 2018 a model should be capable of simulating the bidirectional transfer of water and nitrogen between streams and riparian zones determination of the hydraulic gradient based on stream depth and stage as well as riparian hydrology will be necessary for accurately estimating two way fluxes of water and nutrients incorporating these stream riparian connections is essential and should be done in the simplest way possible while still including sufficient mechanistic rigor to reduce the number of required model inputs in this way a robust yet intermediately complex model can be developed for studying the role of riparian zones for mitigating nitrogen loading this improved riparian nitrogen modeling tool will be valuable for more comprehensively addressing nitrogen loading in incised stream networks riparian zones are an effective strategy for retaining and removing nitrogen but these capabilities can be compromised by stream incision thus management strategies to mitigate nitrogen loading should prioritize both riparian and stream condition emphasizing the hydrologic connection between the two global sensitivity analyses like those in this study improve understanding of model performance and limitations across a more encompassing range of parameter values and time scales which can be supplemented with knowledge of various real world systems to ultimately provide beneficial insights that inform action the coupled riparian stream approach is currently overlooked in management practices but the development of a parsimonious riparian nitrogen and channel morphodynamic model will be a significant enhancement to the toolbox for watershed managers looking to identify locations for and benefits of stream and riparian restoration 5 conclusions four standard riparian nitrogen models remm rnm swat and swat modflow rt3d were evaluated for their completeness and complexity of algorithms related to hydrologic processes vegetation soils nutrients and channel morphodynamic influences this was coupled with a global sensitivity analysis of remm and swat to identify the most influential parameters for determining water table depth and nitrogen cycling outputs the four models exhibited varying degrees of complexity for different components but a common finding was that the connection between riparian zones and stream morphodynamics was missing or minimal drainage area slope and soil layer thickness were the most commonly sensitive parameters across the chosen outputs in remm other nutrient and soil parameters including denitrification rate coefficient permeability and soil moisture controls like field capacity were also influential for certain outputs in swat water table depth was most sensitive to soil parameters such as hydraulic conductivity clay content and bulk density and the topographic parameters of lateral length slope and slope length nitrate export and denitrification were only sensitive to denitrification saturation threshold which might suggest the importance of defining when nitrogen removal can occur and not just the rate of removal time varying analyses of both models found a relationship between output sensitivity and hydroclimatic conditions that affected output magnitude greater sensitivity of nitrate and denitrification to soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity carbon and ph was expected based on past research our sensitivity results also confirm the need for an increased influence of stream depth on water table depth and riparian nitrogen cycling these analyses illustrate the need for improving riparian nitrogen modeling by striving for parsimony in the processes that are included and how extensively each is parameterized improved models that combine the best features of existing tools make appropriate simplifying assumptions and expand processes that are predominantly omitted are needed to improve model fidelity to physical understanding and support management applications across dynamic channel networks ultimately the finding that all models underrepresented stream connections and that none of the select model outputs were sensitive to stream channel depth which could result from incision and other factors verified the need for further study and specifically modeling of riparian nitrogen channel morphology interactions field studies have shown the influence of channel dynamics on riparian hydrology and nitrogen cycling making this modeling gap an important one to address development of intermediate complexity riparian nitrogen models using both the most influential parameters and important missing parameters shown in this analysis will provide water resources managers and researchers with improved tools for estimating the role of riparian zones in mitigating nitrate loading to streams and how these benefits are impacted by channel morphodynamics software availability

25496,the data requirements of many socio environmental system ses modelling studies have increased substantially in recent years this has made the already challenging task of data compilation retrieval and sharing progressively more difficult recognising the current lack of best practice for knowledge management in ses modelling studies we propose using ses wikis as a means of addressing these challenges wikis have attributes that make them well suited to complex knowledge management tasks and their hierarchical interconnected algorithmic logic closely fits with the logic needed in ses model design in this article we describe how wikis can be used at each stage of the ses modelling cycle and we discuss our experiences of putting the approach into practice we conclude that while ses wikis can be time consuming to initially develop they have the potential to significantly improve the quality transparency and efficiency of ses modelling projects keywords wiki participatory

researchers often move between projects and other researchers may wish to draw on existing data for their own work storing data in a way that makes it understandable independently of the original researcher can be hugely important as white et al 2013 have previously noted a dearth of knowledge sharing is also an issue in the ses modelling community which is at least partly attributable to the lack of suitable formats for packaging and distributing mixed methods ses knowledge consequently we feel that both researchers and the communities in which they operate would benefit from improved knowledge management practices while many proposals have been made for improving aspects of the documentation process in social and ecological modelling studies they all have their limitations when it comes to addressing these knowledge management challenges the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 and the odd d protocol m√ºller et al 2013 encourage researchers to discuss their model s empirical background and to provide an overview of their input data this is valuable but in practice the background that is set out is often highly summarised so only a fraction of the case study knowledge is conveyed moreover the protocols only come into play during the modelling phase of projects leaving the challenges of the earlier phases unaddressed the more recently proposed odd 2d protocol of laatabi et al 2018 asks researchers to provide additional details of how data has been selected processed and mapped to model agents and their environment addressing some of the gaps in the earlier odd protocols however it is still not intended for use in the pre modelling phase of projects and the focus remains on communicating the information that directly informed a model s design rather than on aiding researchers in the core knowledge acquisition and management process the trace framework of schmolke et al 2010 goes further than most modelling study documentation proposals in that it calls on users to document the whole research cycle and is more explicit in asking researchers to explain the rationale for modelling decisions yet while this encourages greater discussion of empirical context and data matters it is still not the same as a knowledge management system it was also not purposefully designed for projects that involve a significant amount of primary data collection so it is not especially attuned to the needs of such projects this paper aims to help the ses modelling community address knowledge management challenges by describing a systematic approach for gathering cataloguing and sharing knowledge for use in ses research described here as the wiki method it has the potential to significantly improve the quality transparency and efficiency of ses modelling projects particularly those which involve integrating and managing large volumes of quantitative and qualitative data in section 2 we explain the ses wiki concept discuss the attributes of wikis and explain why they are a good match for the needs of ses modellers in section 3 we share our experience of using the wiki method in the development of an abm of a nepalese mountain community roxburgh 2019 roxburgh et al 2021 in section 4 we offer guidance as to how it can be employed at various stages of the research process and in section 5 we critically reflect on its strengths and limitations and discuss how it can be employed most effectively by ses modellers 2 wikis and their relevance to ses research a wiki is a publication format that facilitates collaborative documentation and knowledge management roxburgh et al 2021 a typical wiki consists of a set of webpages that can be edited by a user community through a web based interface baumeister et al 2007 each page addresses a particular topic lange 2007 sauer et al 2005 wagner 2004 pages can be added and edited overtime as users deem fit they can also cross reference one another using hypertext a feature that promotes meaningful topic associations and reveals dependencies among concepts lange 2007 p 120 wikis have attributes that make them well suited to complex knowledge management tasks they are highly dynamic allowing content to be continually added and refined as understanding evolves baumeister et al 2007 lange 2007 mietchen et al 2011 piccoli et al 2000 they are also suited to co creation as little training is required to partake in their development and software typically allows for distributed editing this means they can enable broad based participation and the harnessing of collective wisdom if managed with care dai et al 2013 majchrzak et al 2013 sauer et al 2005 furthermore the hierarchical interconnected nature of wikis closely fits with the logic needed in ses model design it reduces complex systems to neat digestible elements while not divorcing these elements from context the way topics are discussed in a modular fashion is in keeping with how models tend to be structured while the links make it easier to see and follow the threads that link topics together through centralising knowledge wikis additionally make it easier to locate information when it is required and to identify gaps in knowledge that need to be filled by encouraging knowledge to be made explicit they also help in making it researcher independent facilitating collaborative work and knowledge reuse on top of this as wiki software typically records edit histories they are suited for use in academic contexts as such tracking facilitates transparent review mietchen et al 2011 p 55 the attributes of wikis and their alignment with the knowledge management needs of ses modelling projects particularly those that involve primary data collection are summarised in table 1 3 our experience the nepal wiki we originally developed the ses wiki approach in 2015 to aid information collection about a smallholder community in nepal in which we were conducting fieldwork our intention was to create a detailed abm of the village to examine the effects of various future stressor scenarios while we had identified climate change as our chief stressor of interest the aim of fieldwork was to identify intersecting stressors and key social and environmental processes on the ground without prejudice as such the field investigations necessary were by their nature uncertain as it was unclear whether we would be able to return to the field site after the initial data collection phase we decided to take an all encompassing approach to data collection gathering information on a wide variety of potentially pertinent topics to hedge against the uncertainty the ses wiki approach was conceived as a means to manage this multifarious yet interlinked information and to keep tabs on gaps in our knowledge that still needed to be addressed we also recognised the potential for collaborative development that wikis offer meant we could empower villagers to participate directly in the knowledge curation process we began development of our wiki by mapping out a comprehensive set of topics that required exploration to gain a holistic understanding of the study site topics were identified by examining past ethnographic literature on rural nepal adhikari 2000 fricke 1993 miller 1990 whelpton 2005 and by drawing on our prior experiences in the region including a scoping trip to the field site this allowed us to prepare a tentative framework for the wiki before commencing the main phase of data gathering it was fully expected that some topics would fade in importance while others would strengthen or be introduced as investigations deepened two villagers from our field site were recruited to populate the wiki one male and one female both 26 years old a gender balanced team was chosen due to the potential for knowledge and perceptual differences between men and women in the village momsen 2006 as the task required a week of work on the part of the recruits and therefore a significant opportunity cost in respect to paid labouring those who assisted us were provided with financial remuneration the two recruited villagers shared their knowledge of the wiki topics with our nepalese research assistant who transcribed their responses initially in nepalese before subsequently translating them to english each evening the research team reviewed the articles identifying issues that merited further probing the next day much of the work was done in a quiet caf√© near the village to minimise the chance of interruption however data collection also took place in the village as the recruits consulted with other villagers to gather information about topics that they were less sure about sometimes this was done with the research assistant present and sometimes they worked by themselves bringing their notes to the research assistant later in the day to be translated and typed up an example of one of the wiki topic pages is given fig 1 as the recruited villagers populated the wiki articles they were encouraged to suggest other topics to add something to which they responded positively this later proved valuable the 26 year old male recruit for example proactively added details of the construction process to the housing topic as the april 25 2015 earthquake razed the houses within days of the initial fieldwork phase concluding necessitating a complete reconstruction this became extremely pertinent as it providing us with the parameters necessary to begin modelling the recovery process the recruits were also asked to review the transcribed articles as the wiki developed to ensure they accurately reflected their inputs the research team initially saw our role as simply to ensure as broad as possible coverage of topics and to ask probing questions where articles seemed underdeveloped or lacked clarity only occasionally did we decide to remove content for example we deemed anecdotes about individual relationships to fall outside the wikis remit although plenty of the details in the wiki ultimately proved superfluous to our needs they aided in building a holistic picture of the case study site and in creating a document that we recognised as being of potential value beyond the immediate aims of our study we only began adding content to the wiki ourselves after the participants had completed the bulk of it most of what we added was based on insights gleaned through focus groups household surveys and process tracing exercises that we conducted alongside wiki development but later we also added some information derived from the literature which helped deepen understanding and set the village s particularities in the wider context we sought to be sparing in the edits made so as to retain the voice of the participants in the articles though there were some topics which needed substantial amounts of supplementary core content such as quantifying fertility and mortality understanding and modelling such processes well necessitates data gathered at much larger scales than our village offered and over a far longer time period than our fieldwork allowed we therefore drew heavily on third party sources to inform these elements of the wiki with participant contributions taking more of a secondary role the final topic structure used in the nepal field site wiki is shown in fig 2 when we came to do the modelling itself finding the information of interest was made straightforward by what essentially constituted a master document we were able to refer to the relevant pages in the wiki while working on a sub section of the model rather than constantly needing to search through separate notes data files and transcripts for example when parameterising costs we could simply refer to the expenditure section of the wiki and where further details were needed e g the date when marriage expenses are likely to be incurred within a given year we could follow links to the relevant topic directly from the expenditures page we rarely encountered knowledge gaps due to the wiki s comprehensive nature and were able to let the importance of variables and processes emerge from the bank of knowledge we had gathered in something akin to a grounded theory approach potential connections between topics were made apparent by the interconnected nature of the wiki e g how household structure influenced migration decisions which assisted us in thinking through the model logic furthermore as much of the information was written from the perspective of research subjects it provided valuable insights into decision making processes that we could draw on for the model for example it detailed how youngsters go about deciding whether to continue in education and which livelihoods they might pursue confidentiality issues prevented us from openly publishing the wiki but we were able to summarise many of the wiki articles for inclusion in our project outputs e g roxburgh 2019 after having built a detailed model of our mountain community for our original study and fulfilling our original aims roxburgh et al 2021 we realised there was information in the wiki that would allow us to reconfigure the model so we could explore new research questions without needing to return to the study site this led to us undertaking a study on seasonality in food security a topic we had not explicitly set out to study during the original fieldwork the wiki provided us with crucial parameters for this as well as valuable information about household food consumption behaviour and how they manage food and financial stress behaviours we could recreate in a stylised way in the model 4 guide to using the wiki method the ses wiki approach that we envisage interfaces with various stages of the research and modelling process this section offers guidance as to how it could be most effectively employed to add value at each stage fig 3 shows how the wiki approach can fit within the iterative modelling cycle as described by railsback and grimm 2012 and the modelling notebook and trace documentation approaches schmolke et al 2010 fig 4 shows the recommended stages and processes of the wiki approach which are discussed in more detail in the following sections the recommendations assume the use of the wiki approach in a project where primary fieldwork is being conducted as this is one of the situations where the wiki approach can provide the most value therefore some recommendations may not be applicable where this is not the case we aim not to be overly prescriptive as the needs preferences and constraints of research projects are varied m√ºller et al 2014 we welcome creative uses of the ses wiki concept meaning that researchers should not feel bound to this workflow or the subsequent guidance 4 1 preparing the wiki 4 1 1 determine purpose and preliminary structure when using the ses wiki approach it is firstly important to reflect on the purpose of the wiki to ensure that it is constructed and used effectively project research questions hypotheses geographical scope scales of interest and intended outputs will all have a bearing on subsequent decisions about how to structure and populate the wiki so it is sensible to consider these matters early for example if there is a desire to make fieldwork data available to other researchers particular effort should be made to make the wiki presentable and to ensure there is sufficient clarity and detail for it to be of use beyond the initial study this needs forethought as it will be difficult to do retrospectively if researchers wish to embrace a grounded theory style approach to development of the wiki they need not pre define topic pages at the outset of data collection however drafting a provisional skeleton structure can aid data collection planning and streamline the documentation process the project research questions empirical context and modelling approach along with ostrom s 2007 ses analysis framework can provide inspiration for this structure we recommend setting a low threshold for determining which topics merit inclusion as their importance can be difficult to determine in advance for example we assumed that cultural events and animal lactation cycles would only be of minor relevance when we began our fieldwork yet they ultimately proved to be highly significant being relatively comprehensive in the breadth of the wiki topics not only reduces the likelihood of information being missed and additional fieldwork being required but also provides valuable broader context to the case study site and increases the chance that the wiki is of practical use for other research studies it also allows scope for changing study direction or extending models later to address additional questions topics can be graded by perceived criticality and worked through in order of priority to capture maximum useful information within the time allowed 4 1 2 select software before commencing fieldwork it is important to select software in which to create the wiki there are two main options a purpose made wiki software or b creating a quasi wiki with word processor software purpose built wiki software offers valuable data management features such as automated authorship tracking and version control these features allow the evolution of wikis to be recorded transparently and protect against accidental deletion of knowledge when editing majchrzak et al 2013 many also offer syncing to a cloud which provides a simple and reliable back up of field notes and can allow multiple contributors to work simultaneously which makes collaborative development easier most wiki software is compatible with smartphones so equipment availability should rarely be a problem rather than recommending a specific wiki software we would point the reader to the excellent list of options on unsurprisingly wikipedia 2020b many of which are free and extensible downsides of wiki software are that it can be challenging to set up when used for the first time long term data storage can be complicated by reliance on third party software there are data security and privacy issues to consider and in many instances software is not designed for offline use with regard to the later point readers are directed to the distinction between wikis that use local flat file versus sql enabled databases where circumstances do not allow for use of purpose made wiki software an offline quasi wiki can be developed using word processing software an approach we used for our nepal wiki relative to specialist wiki software this can be more labour intensive as word processing software is not designed with enduring change and authorship tracking in mind perkel 2016 each contribution will need to be manually tagged with an author id and other relevant metadata and copies will need to be regularly saved as the wiki evolves although such an approach requires diligence word documents are relatively simple to use can still use hyperlinks to connect topic pages and can be easily saved as pdfs advantageous for sharing and long term archiving note taking software like onenote and notion represent another potentially powerful alternative a run through of typical data in a role play of fieldwork during the software identification process is likely to be helpful in discovering potential usability issues we recommend that wikis be set up ahead of fieldwork so that they are ready to be used at the outset of data collection optionally once the provisional topic pages have been created researchers can populate them with their pre fieldwork knowledge as well as identifying gaps in knowledge this can help provide context to what is subsequently seen at field sites aiding interpretation allowing sanity tests and flagging matters that should be probed this process may also reveal additional topics that could be worth considering 4 2 assembling the wiki 4 2 1 draw on participant knowledge wikis are designed to facilitate knowledge co creation and therefore are ideal for participatory research participants can be recruited to write content and make edits themselves if they are literate or the process can be facilitated by members of the research team asking questions and transcribing the responses we recommend recruiting a diverse set of participants to maximise the perspectives and experiences drawn upon though actively seeking out eloquent participants is pragmatic given the nature of the task participants should be briefed on the purpose of the wiki and the topic areas on which their inputs are sought at the outset majchrzak et al 2013 and appropriate consent should be obtained before they commence work given the time consuming multi day nature of developing wikis we also suggest that researchers consider remunerating participants at a locally appropriate rate some coaching from the research team may be needed at the outset with less guidance being required over time emphasising the desirability of detailed algorithmic explanations of processes and decision making and asking participants to provide numerical values where possible is important from a modelling perspective flagging choices relating to the expenditure of time and resources whenever they arise should be encouraged too they should also be asked to clearly flag uncertainty and variability to ensure researchers are mindful of this during the modelling stages to fully exploit the benefits of the wiki approach we recommend encouraging participants to propose topics that they personally perceive as important in relation to the overall research purpose more generally we suggest that researchers make a concerted effort to create enabling conditions for participants to feel empowered this should help maximise the breadth and depth of information elicited and make the process more fulfilling for participants basic information on each of the participants and the circumstances of their involvement e g age gender time date and location should be recorded separately from the wiki taking account of any local personal data protection requirements and a means of tracking their individual contributions should be determined if this is not being logged automatically by wiki software for example each author can be assigned a unique code that can be appended to each of their contributions we recommend initially compiling the wiki in the local language if participants are literate this allows them to write contributions and interrogate content directly strengthening their sense of ownership over the process the contents can be translated later if necessary where researchers are not fluent in the local language this may temporarily compromise their capacity for oversight so recruiting an able researcher assistant or translator to mediate the process will be vital 4 2 2 integrate researcher understanding and information from other sources researchers can also write content for the wiki drawing on knowledge that they have gleaned from literature other research exercises informal discussions and their own observations even knowledge that would typically be held tacitly can be worth documenting as it helps with recall and enables others to make sense of the information at a later stage that said we recognise that there are practical limits to the amount of knowledge that can be documented that some knowledge will remain tacit is unavoidable but the wiki approach at least offers a way to capture some knowledge that would otherwise only be held tacitly enabling it to be documented in a formal and transparent manner if researchers do engage in the authorship process they should cite the origin of the insights ensure that their contributions can be distinguished from those of other participants and discuss any potentially sensitive topics with appropriate caution we also recommend allowing participants the opportunity to critique these contributions which may require translating them this can help validate researcher interpretations and respects the spirit of co creation that is central to the wiki concept ideally researchers will refrain from personally authoring substantial amounts of content until participants have finished making the bulk of their contributions so that participant voices are prioritised 4 2 3 iteratively edit as knowledge is added to the wiki continuous editing will be required to ensure that the contents are kept clear and coherent the aim should be for each topic page to be written in a relatively parsimonious fashion so regular filtering and pruning is important markus 2001 as the topic articles are reviewed content that is deemed to be below standard e g insufficiently informative contradictory or unclear should be flagged for attention should it not be possible to resolve immediately mietchen et al 2011 we envisage that researchers lead the editing process but participants can also assist empowering them to do so will allow researcher contributions to be validated and help with identifying any misinterpretations when contradictory or contested entries are identified researchers have several options open to them they could consult the original contributors seek the views of additional parties accept that there is legitimate ambiguity or act as an arbiter themselves if they believe they have sufficient evidence to do so where views cannot be reconciled among all parties a note should be added stating this as eitzel 2021 has argued differences in knowledge need not always be viewed as problematic from a research perspective modelling enables the implications of contrasting perspectives to be explored and this can lead to valuable insights about systems that would not have been gleaned if differences in knowledge were erased during data collection it may also be appropriate to restructure the wiki from time to time if this improves flow majchrzak et al 2013 besides determining the topics that merit inclusion it is important to consider which merit a standalone page if a topic requires only a cursory mention it is best to incorporate it into a higher level page that covers the topic and others closely associated with it for example trees and wildlife might be best discussed under the common heading of ecology if they are not going to be individually addressed in detail these decisions can be reviewed as fieldwork progresses and understanding develops all knowledge collection will involve some degree of classification and associated decision making and filtering in ses studies this would ideally be a collaborative process which balances and reflects on the overlaps and differences between scientific based and community based means of understanding the world the latter may not map perfectly onto formal scientific frameworks but it is often in the mismatch between world views that the most crucial insights reside it is therefore important that the structuring is responsive to community input and that power structures do not compel a community to bend its worldview to fit academic paradigms 4 3 developing the model the process of compiling the wiki can often generate insights that were not considered or anticipated during initial research design it can therefore be useful to pause and reflect on what has been learned before commencing model development the modular structure of the wiki can potentially provide inspiration for the design of the model structure and links between topics in the wiki can help in identifying and understanding interconnections that merit consideration in the model design during model development the wiki can act as a single common reference point for those involved in designing the model as information is grouped in an intuitive structured way it should simplify the process of locating details as they are required wikis and ses models have a similar structural logic they partially decompose systems while recognising that important linkages between components remain ostrom 2007 wikipedia 2016 consequently the knowledge contained in ses wikis will often map neatly onto ses models they are in many respects proto models in and of themselves blueprints that can guide design strongly rooted in the empirical reality of field sites wikis can also facilitate researchers who seek to take a pattern oriented modelling pom approach grimm et al 1996 pom involves identifying multiple ses features that can potentially be matched against when calibrating models and testing different configurations grimm et al 2005 something that is not usually possible when data collection is narrow in scope but may be possible with wide ranging data contained from an ses wiki if sufficiently information rich the wiki can furthermore be used by researchers to saturate themselves in the details of a study site and to take something akin to a grounded theory approach to the modelling process 4 4 communicating the model the wiki or extracts from it can be published alongside model code and descriptions to provide background as well as rationale for key modelling decisions however before publishing either the wiki or extracts it is important to consider whether participants could potentially be identified from the detailed information contained unlike many interviews focus groups or ethnographic studies the information contained in a wiki is intentionally wide ranging and comprehensive which increases the likelihood of participants anonymity being compromised if viewed in its entirety even if the wiki is written in a general summary tone if intending to make the entire wiki publicly available alongside the model it is advisable to consider the anonymity of participants when writing articles from the outset rather than trying to retrospectively anonymise the entire wiki as this could require a considerable amount of work for example articles could be written in such a way as to remove references to particulars and enumerate in ranges rather than specific values to obscure the identities of specific settings or individuals one flexible approach to managing anonymity when sharing the wiki is to tag topic pages or even sections within topic pages with different levels of shareability some topic pages may not contain any potentially identifying or sensitive information and can be shared publicly without issues while others may need to be edited first for certain topic pages it may be necessary to restrict their viewing to just within the research team or with other researchers subject to request an alternative to sharing the wiki itself is to include excerpts from or summaries of wiki articles in other research outputs a route that reduces dilemmas around how to handle sensitive information and which will also make the contents more practical for readers to digest ideally wikis or wiki extracts would be converted to a stable document format and stored in a permanent archive so that their availability will be assured in the long run perkel 2016 for example they could be stored along with model code in the comses net computational model library https www comses net codebases rollins et al 2014 aside from anonymisation and desensitisation we suggest that researchers not worry much about finessing the contents of the wiki unless they have the time resources and desire to do so 4 5 extending the model and reusing knowledge the knowledge contained in ses wikis could be of value to studies other than those that originally prompted their creation easterbrook 2014 white et al 2013 wikis could be used to adapt models to address additional research questions or to contribute to wholly different studies for any of this to occur firstly the writing must be unambiguous allowing future selves and other researchers to make sense of it without revisiting field sites secondly the content must be sufficiently broad and comprehensive to allow new questions to be addressed finally wikis need to be made accessible and other researchers need to be aware of their existence van tuyl and whitmire 2016 where wikis or extracts of wikis are suitable for public sharing it is preferable to store them in topically appropriate public archives as discussed in section 4 4 accompanied by detailed descriptions of their contents and generous reuse licenses janssen 2017 white et al 2013 5 discussion we have proposed wikis as an approach for managing case study knowledge for ses modelling projects presented our nepal field site wiki as an example of the approach in action and offered guidance as to how they could be most effectively built and employed in this section we critically evaluate the opportunities and challenges of the wiki approach as they apply across the phases of empirically driven model based research outlined in fig 3 we draw on our own experience of using it to construct an abm of a mountain community to show how the ses wiki approach can be both practical and effective in the appropriate context but also to demonstrate the real world difficulties of implementation we focus on four main issues the time demands required to produce a wiki how participants can be empowered in the process of creating a wiki what software to use and considerations around sharing an ses wiki 5 1 time demands time demands are often cited as a reason why the odd protocol and trace framework are not utilised more frequently grimm et al 2014 m√ºller et al 2013 ses wikis are also time consuming both for participants and researchers however a substantial upside of the wiki approach is that it improves modelling efficiency assuming that conflicts and inconsistencies in the wiki were resolved during the data collection the knowledge contained should already be coherent by the time modelling begins allowing researchers to focus on modelling judgements rather than knowledge reconciliation in contrast where the wiki approach is not used and where conflicting information has not been addressed in the field the modelling process is complicated by the need to select between sources or determine compromise solutions something that can greatly hinder progress wikis also make it less likely that knowledge gaps will be encountered during modelling reducing the potential need for costly additional data collection later furthermore ses wikis can help with issues of institutional memory in the case of projects where there is staff turnover or if the person developing the model is different from the fieldwork researchers indeed wikis are often used in the corporate world for such purposes ashkenas 2013 they offer a ready means for third parties to absorb and make sense of study site knowledge reducing the need for time consuming briefings and exchanges adapting existing models to address new research questions is an efficient way to conduct science laatabi et al 2018 para 1 2 however code is rarely reused at present as there is often insufficient knowledge about a case study site to reconfigure the model in an empirically supported fashion janssen 2017 janssen et al 2020 m√ºller et al 2014 by providing knowledge on a near comprehensive range of topics wikis can facilitate the retrospective adaptation of empirically grounded ses models obviating the need for fresh fieldwork and greatly improving the resource efficiency of the ses modelling field this increases the value derived from the generosity of research participants and accelerates the pace of disciplinary progress cragin et al 2010 janssen 2017 martone 2014 however there are risks in trying to make wikis exhaustive in an effort to maximise potential research openings compiling information without limits can be a substantial time sink and realistically there are limits to the number of research questions that any given case study will productively lend itself to it is also difficult to anticipate the information needs of yet to be fleshed out research ideas however comprehensive researchers try to be there will be topics that are missed that will impose constraints on future research when we extended our model to address questions around food security for example we recognised there were gaps in our knowledge that we would have to fill using information from secondary source 5 2 empowering participants increasing research subject agency is often spoken of as a desirable objective in ses modelling studies e g becu et al 2006 naivinit et al 2010 steger et al 2021 yet the options for doing this remain limited voinov and bousquet 2010 the wiki development process can facilitate direct authorship and scrutiny of ses knowledge by research subjects imbuing participants with substantial agency and fostering a sense of research ownership among study communities this can redress some of the power imbalances inherent in fieldwork increase the likelihood of recommendations being heeded and lessen the likelihood that important aspects of the field site are overlooked by researchers darroch and giles 2014 pain and kindon 2007 schensul et al 2015 voinov and bousquet 2010 for agent based modellers in particular the opportunity to view a ses through the eyes of real world agents is immensely valuable as it offers direct insights into agent decision making and behaviour facilitating their recreation in code while the benefits of co production approaches are substantial we also experienced some challenges which demonstrate the need for careful selection and guidance of participants careful expectation management and strong people skills for example we found it difficult to find participants who had sufficient free time to take part particularly for older generations as they tended to have more work commitments it was also sometimes difficult to elicit information in a suitable format for the wiki as some villagers at the field site in nepal particularly those with very little formal education tended to address topics in narrative form which was difficult to package into thematic pages difficulties were also encountered with acquiring information at the desired level of detail and progressing through themes at a productive rate literacy however was not a barrier as we were able to take dictation where required allowing us to avoid excluding the older less literate generations the differing willingness and capacity of people to engage can be problematic from a representation perspective as literacy levels and communication styles can be closely linked with ethnicity caste sex age and socio economic backgrounds laws et al 2013 one way of dealing with this which our participants proposed is to allow them to engage with other community members when they encounter gaps in their own knowledge sensitive oversight is required to ensure that those recruited to complete the wiki are not advertently or inadvertently providing biased information or failing to include differing viewpoints and opinions as participants will have access to content written by others it is also critical that the sensitivity of information in the wiki be monitored to avoid privacy violations or other potential harms damianakis and woodford 2012 researchers must also be aware of the risk of social biases culturally and politically motivated edits and peer pressure influencing the development of the wiki especially in relation to sensitive topics enforcing some degree of verifiability standards will be particularly critical wherever there is elevated risk of such influences 5 3 wiki software there are a number of practical issues with wiki software that will complicate the development of ses wikis in certain contexts in our case we encountered significant challenges with internet connectivity and power availability during fieldwork roxburgh 2019 roxburgh et al 2021 mobile internet connections were unreliable and we were frequently unable to recharge phones and laptops due to power outages this made conventional web based wiki software impractical to use word processing software proved to be an adequate substitute once we figured out procedures for authorship and edit tracking but it did demand fastidiousness to keep on top of this tracking and we did not always get it right purpose designed wiki software offers automated tracking which relieves this burden and reduces the likelihood of errors this is something we view as a substantial strength in light of our experiences but it is more complicated to initially setup the power outages occasionally prevented us from running electronic devices a hindrance regardless of the approach used we overcame this by compiling notes on paper and then typing them up once power was available again this worked reasonably when the outages were limited to a few hours but we suspect longer periods without power would have proved seriously problematic as we found it was valuable to be able to refer back to existing content as we worked potential users should take these issues into consideration when deciding how to proceed 5 4 sharing wikis the breadth and comprehensiveness of wikis make them powerful research tools but can also in certain situations limit the extent to which they can be published and shared for example our wiki described the lives and livelihoods of a nepalese mountain community in minute detail while extracts of the nepal wiki could be shared without issue to publish it in its entirety could potentially provide enough information to identify the village and its members this is something we could not risk from an ethics standpoint in other cases the risks to anonymity may be less it will depend on the idiosyncrasies of the field site the kinds of data collected and how they are recorded in the wiki this presents something of dilemma on the one hand the detailed nature of ses wikis could make them valuable knowledge resources if shared on the other hand their detailed nature means great caution needs to be taken to ensure they cannot be misused and that the anonymity of participants is respected starting from the principle that we should as a research community aspire to share data to the greatest extent possible mcnutt 2014 schofield et al 2009 we suggest users publish a carefully edited version of their wikis leaving in as much information as possible while addressing possible issues around anonymity and noting the nature of any details that have been removed should other researchers wish to access the redacted data further discussion can be had around how that might be done in an ethically sound way 6 conclusion collaborative ethnography has significant advantages as well as respecting communities welcoming and supporting their agency collaborative work is more likely to build a fuller understanding of community dynamics is likely to bring a richer understanding and commitment to research within the communities with less experience of science and represents an opportunity for two way flow and stimulation of community enhancing ideas nevertheless collaboration brings issues with it of knowledge management with older techniques of complicated scientist and hypothesis driven field logging failing to provide accessible or suitably structured toolsets and therefore to maximise knowledge elicitation in this paper we have suggested wikis provide a more suitable mechanism for data collation structuring and understanding in particular they may aid in the process of structuring and mapping the understanding of systems such as to make the production of disaggregate social environmental and economic models more robust and complete we have additionally reflected on our use of such techniques when engaged in fieldwork and subsequently modelling a rural highland community in nepal wikis are not by any means a full solution to the issues of collaborative data acquisition there are a number of facets of human communication and lived experience they can represent only imperfectly purposeful ambiguity in relationships the strength of connections between concepts spatial links and dynamic changes for example nevertheless they represent a considerable step forward as a knowledge representation system for field studies not only in terms of the collaborative collation of data but also through their opening up of the collaborative structuring of knowledge and the subsequent analysis and use of those structures as such we would hope that this paper goes some way to encouraging field scientists especially those collecting data for disaggregate modelling to utilise wikis in field practice author

25496,the data requirements of many socio environmental system ses modelling studies have increased substantially in recent years this has made the already challenging task of data compilation retrieval and sharing progressively more difficult recognising the current lack of best practice for knowledge management in ses modelling studies we propose using ses wikis as a means of addressing these challenges wikis have attributes that make them well suited to complex knowledge management tasks and their hierarchical interconnected algorithmic logic closely fits with the logic needed in ses model design in this article we describe how wikis can be used at each stage of the ses modelling cycle and we discuss our experiences of putting the approach into practice we conclude that while ses wikis can be time consuming to initially develop they have the potential to significantly improve the quality transparency and efficiency of ses modelling projects keywords wiki participatory research fieldwork data management open data knowledge reuse data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as the sophistication ambition and empirical verisimilitude of socio environmental system ses modelling studies has increased their data requirements have grown ever more onerous janssen and ostrom 2006 laatabi et al 2018 polhill et al 2016 ses models typically encompass a wide variety of processes and entities necessitating the collection and integration of cross disciplinary information janssen and ostrom 2006 linst√§dter et al 2016 ostrom 2007 smajgl et al 2011 steger et al 2021 where modelling is bottom up as is the case with agent based modelling abm polhill et al 2019 this information will usually need to be heavily disaggregated detailed knowledge of temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity may also be needed smajgl et al 2011 researchers who pursue a grounded theory or generative modelling approach where the aim is to derive possible explanatory causal mechanisms endogenously rather than impose them epstein 2006 may additionally need to contend with high uncertainty around what information they will ultimately require forcing them to engage in broad reaching speculative data collection until the form of their final model becomes clear at present no widely accepted best practice has been established for knowledge management in ses modelling studies though science wide initiatives like the turing way have sought to nudge researchers towards better research data management most modellers currently appear to employ ad hoc informal means to manage their data and domain knowledge for example in an abm study findings from individual data gathering exercises e g interviews focus groups household surveys might be analysed and stored separately with synthesis occurring only as the model is developed it is also likely that many modellers draw on tacit knowledge gleaned during fieldwork that is not written down or otherwise recorded in part because there are few tools suited to documenting disparate ses knowledge these practices are problematic most critically they can make ongoing assessment of data adequacy difficult during the data gathering phase they can make retrieving relevant knowledge unnecessarily challenging during the modelling phase they can make projects dependent on researcher recall and fragmentation may increase the chance of there being contradictory data meaning that researchers lack a single source of truth from which to work markus 2001 given that researchers often move between projects and other researchers may wish to draw on existing data for their own work storing data in a way that makes it understandable independently of the original researcher can be hugely important as white et al 2013 have previously noted a dearth of knowledge sharing is also an issue in the ses modelling community which is at least partly attributable to the lack of suitable formats for packaging and distributing mixed methods ses knowledge consequently we feel that both researchers and the communities in which they operate would benefit from improved knowledge management practices while many proposals have been made for improving aspects of the documentation process in social and ecological modelling studies they all have their limitations when it comes to addressing these knowledge management challenges the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 and the odd d protocol m√ºller et al 2013 encourage researchers to discuss their model s empirical background and to provide an overview of their input data this is valuable but in practice the background that is set out is often highly summarised so only a fraction of the case study knowledge is conveyed moreover the protocols only come into play during the modelling phase of projects leaving the challenges of the earlier phases unaddressed the more recently proposed odd 2d protocol of laatabi et al 2018 asks researchers to provide additional details of how data has been selected processed and mapped to model agents and their environment addressing some of the gaps in the earlier odd protocols however it is still not intended for use in the pre modelling phase of projects and the focus remains on communicating the information that directly informed a model s design rather than on aiding researchers in the core knowledge acquisition and management process the trace framework of schmolke et al 2010 goes further than most modelling study documentation proposals in that it calls on users to document the whole research cycle and is more explicit in asking researchers to explain the rationale for modelling decisions yet while this encourages greater discussion of empirical context and data matters it is still not the same as a knowledge management system it was also not purposefully designed for projects that involve a significant amount of primary data collection so it is not especially attuned to the needs of such projects this paper aims to help the ses modelling community address knowledge management challenges by describing a systematic approach for gathering cataloguing and sharing knowledge for use in ses research described here as the wiki method it has the potential to significantly improve the quality transparency and efficiency of ses modelling projects particularly those which involve integrating and managing large volumes of quantitative and qualitative data in section 2 we explain the ses wiki concept discuss the attributes of wikis and explain why they are a good match for the needs of ses modellers in section 3 we share our experience of using the wiki method in the development of an abm of a nepalese mountain community roxburgh 2019 roxburgh et al 2021 in section 4 we offer guidance as to how it can be employed at various stages of the research process and in section 5 we critically reflect on its strengths and limitations and discuss how it can be employed most effectively by ses modellers 2 wikis and their relevance to ses research a wiki is a publication format that facilitates collaborative documentation and knowledge management roxburgh et al 2021 a typical wiki consists of a set of webpages that can be edited by a user community through a web based interface baumeister et al 2007 each page addresses a particular topic lange 2007 sauer et al 2005 wagner 2004 pages can be added and edited overtime as users deem fit they can also cross reference one another using hypertext a feature that promotes meaningful topic associations and reveals dependencies among concepts lange 2007 p 120 wikis have attributes that make them well suited to complex knowledge management tasks they are highly dynamic allowing content to be continually added and refined as understanding evolves baumeister et al 2007 lange 2007 mietchen et al 2011 piccoli et al 2000 they are also suited to co creation as little training is required to partake in their development and software typically allows for distributed editing this means they can enable broad based participation and the harnessing of collective wisdom if managed with care dai et al 2013 majchrzak et al 2013 sauer et al 2005 furthermore the hierarchical interconnected nature of wikis closely fits with the logic needed in ses model design it reduces complex systems to neat digestible elements while not divorcing these elements from context the way topics are discussed in a modular fashion is in keeping with how models tend to be structured while the links make it easier to see and follow the threads that link topics together through centralising knowledge wikis additionally make it easier to locate information when it is required and to identify gaps in knowledge that need to be filled by encouraging knowledge to be made explicit they also help in making it researcher independent facilitating collaborative work and knowledge reuse on top of this as wiki software typically records edit histories they are suited for use in academic contexts as such tracking facilitates transparent review mietchen et al 2011 p 55 the attributes of wikis and their alignment with the knowledge management needs of ses modelling projects particularly those that involve primary data collection are summarised in table 1 3 our experience the nepal wiki we originally developed the ses wiki approach in 2015 to aid information collection about a smallholder community in nepal in which we were conducting fieldwork our intention was to create a detailed abm of the village to examine the effects of various future stressor scenarios while we had identified climate change as our chief stressor of interest the aim of fieldwork was to identify intersecting stressors and key social and environmental processes on the ground without prejudice as such the field investigations necessary were by their nature uncertain as it was unclear whether we would be able to return to the field site after the initial data collection phase we decided to take an all encompassing approach to data collection gathering information on a wide variety of potentially pertinent topics to hedge against the uncertainty the ses wiki approach was conceived as a means to manage this multifarious yet interlinked information and to keep tabs on gaps in our knowledge that still needed to be addressed we also recognised the potential for collaborative development that wikis offer meant we could empower villagers to participate directly in the knowledge curation process we began development of our wiki by mapping out a comprehensive set of topics that required exploration to gain a holistic understanding of the study site topics were identified by examining past ethnographic literature on rural nepal adhikari 2000 fricke 1993 miller 1990 whelpton 2005 and by drawing on our prior experiences in the region including a scoping trip to the field site this allowed us to prepare a tentative framework for the wiki before commencing the main phase of data gathering it was fully expected that some topics would fade in importance while others would strengthen or be introduced as investigations deepened two villagers from our field site were recruited to populate the wiki one male and one female both 26 years old a gender balanced team was chosen due to the potential for knowledge and perceptual differences between men and women in the village momsen 2006 as the task required a week of work on the part of the recruits and therefore a significant opportunity cost in respect to paid labouring those who assisted us were provided with financial remuneration the two recruited villagers shared their knowledge of the wiki topics with our nepalese research assistant who transcribed their responses initially in nepalese before subsequently translating them to english each evening the research team reviewed the articles identifying issues that merited further probing the next day much of the work was done in a quiet caf√© near the village to minimise the chance of interruption however data collection also took place in the village as the recruits consulted with other villagers to gather information about topics that they were less sure about sometimes this was done with the research assistant present and sometimes they worked by themselves bringing their notes to the research assistant later in the day to be translated and typed up an example of one of the wiki topic pages is given fig 1 as the recruited villagers populated the wiki articles they were encouraged to suggest other topics to add something to which they responded positively this later proved valuable the 26 year old male recruit for example proactively added details of the construction process to the housing topic as the april 25 2015 earthquake razed the houses within days of the initial fieldwork phase concluding necessitating a complete reconstruction this became extremely pertinent as it providing us with the parameters necessary to begin modelling the recovery process the recruits were also asked to review the transcribed articles as the wiki developed to ensure they accurately reflected their inputs the research team initially saw our role as simply to ensure as broad as possible coverage of topics and to ask probing questions where articles seemed underdeveloped or lacked clarity only occasionally did we decide to remove content for example we deemed anecdotes about individual relationships to fall outside the wikis remit although plenty of the details in the wiki ultimately proved superfluous to our needs they aided in building a holistic picture of the case study site and in creating a document that we recognised as being of potential value beyond the immediate aims of our study we only began adding content to the wiki ourselves after the participants had completed the bulk of it most of what we added was based on insights gleaned through focus groups household surveys and process tracing exercises that we conducted alongside wiki development but later we also added some information derived from the literature which helped deepen understanding and set the village s particularities in the wider context we sought to be sparing in the edits made so as to retain the voice of the participants in the articles though there were some topics which needed substantial amounts of supplementary core content such as quantifying fertility and mortality understanding and modelling such processes well necessitates data gathered at much larger scales than our village offered and over a far longer time period than our fieldwork allowed we therefore drew heavily on third party sources to inform these elements of the wiki with participant contributions taking more of a secondary role the final topic structure used in the nepal field site wiki is shown in fig 2 when we came to do the modelling itself finding the information of interest was made straightforward by what essentially constituted a master document we were able to refer to the relevant pages in the wiki while working on a sub section of the model rather than constantly needing to search through separate notes data files and transcripts for example when parameterising costs we could simply refer to the expenditure section of the wiki and where further details were needed e g the date when marriage expenses are likely to be incurred within a given year we could follow links to the relevant topic directly from the expenditures page we rarely encountered knowledge gaps due to the wiki s comprehensive nature and were able to let the importance of variables and processes emerge from the bank of knowledge we had gathered in something akin to a grounded theory approach potential connections between topics were made apparent by the interconnected nature of the wiki e g how household structure influenced migration decisions which assisted us in thinking through the model logic furthermore as much of the information was written from the perspective of research subjects it provided valuable insights into decision making processes that we could draw on for the model for example it detailed how youngsters go about deciding whether to continue in education and which livelihoods they might pursue confidentiality issues prevented us from openly publishing the wiki but we were able to summarise many of the wiki articles for inclusion in our project outputs e g roxburgh 2019 after having built a detailed model of our mountain community for our original study and fulfilling our original aims roxburgh et al 2021 we realised there was information in the wiki that would allow us to reconfigure the model so we could explore new research questions without needing to return to the study site this led to us undertaking a study on seasonality in food security a topic we had not explicitly set out to study during the original fieldwork the wiki provided us with crucial parameters for this as well as valuable information about household food consumption behaviour and how they manage food and financial stress behaviours we could recreate in a stylised way in the model 4 guide to using the wiki method the ses wiki approach that we envisage interfaces with various stages of the research and modelling process this section offers guidance as to how it could be most effectively employed to add value at each stage fig 3 shows how the wiki approach can fit within the iterative modelling cycle as described by railsback and grimm 2012 and the modelling notebook and trace documentation approaches schmolke et al 2010 fig 4 shows the recommended stages and processes of the wiki approach which are discussed in more detail in the following sections the recommendations assume the use of the wiki approach in a project where primary fieldwork is being conducted as this is one of the situations where the wiki approach can provide the most value therefore some recommendations may not be applicable where this is not the case we aim not to be overly prescriptive as the needs preferences and constraints of research projects are varied m√ºller et al 2014 we welcome creative uses of the ses wiki concept meaning that researchers should not feel bound to this workflow or the subsequent guidance 4 1 preparing the wiki 4 1 1 determine purpose and preliminary structure when using the ses wiki approach it is firstly important to reflect on the purpose of the wiki to ensure that it is constructed and used effectively project research questions hypotheses geographical scope scales of interest and intended outputs will all have a bearing on subsequent decisions about how to structure and populate the wiki so it is sensible to consider these matters early for example if there is a desire to make fieldwork data available to other researchers particular effort should be made to make the wiki presentable and to ensure there is sufficient clarity and detail for it to be of use beyond the initial study this needs forethought as it will be difficult to do retrospectively if researchers wish to embrace a grounded theory style approach to development of the wiki they need not pre define topic pages at the outset of data collection however drafting a provisional skeleton structure can aid data collection planning and streamline the documentation process the project research questions empirical context and modelling approach along with ostrom s 2007 ses analysis framework can provide inspiration for this structure we recommend setting a low threshold for determining which topics merit inclusion as their importance can be difficult to determine in advance for example we assumed that cultural events and animal lactation cycles would only be of minor relevance when we began our fieldwork yet they ultimately proved to be highly significant being relatively comprehensive in the breadth of the wiki topics not only reduces the likelihood of information being missed and additional fieldwork being required but also provides valuable broader context to the case study site and increases the chance that the wiki is of practical use for other research studies it also allows scope for changing study direction or extending models later to address additional questions topics can be graded by perceived criticality and worked through in order of priority to capture maximum useful information within the time allowed 4 1 2 select software before commencing fieldwork it is important to select software in which to create the wiki there are two main options a purpose made wiki software or b creating a quasi wiki with word processor software purpose built wiki software offers valuable data management features such as automated authorship tracking and version control these features allow the evolution of wikis to be recorded transparently and protect against accidental deletion of knowledge when editing majchrzak et al 2013 many also offer syncing to a cloud which provides a simple and reliable back up of field notes and can allow multiple contributors to work simultaneously which makes collaborative development easier most wiki software is compatible with smartphones so equipment availability should rarely be a problem rather than recommending a specific wiki software we would point the reader to the excellent list of options on unsurprisingly wikipedia 2020b many of which are free and extensible downsides of wiki software are that it can be challenging to set up when used for the first time long term data storage can be complicated by reliance on third party software there are data security and privacy issues to consider and in many instances software is not designed for offline use with regard to the later point readers are directed to the distinction between wikis that use local flat file versus sql enabled databases where circumstances do not allow for use of purpose made wiki software an offline quasi wiki can be developed using word processing software an approach we used for our nepal wiki relative to specialist wiki software this can be more labour intensive as word processing software is not designed with enduring change and authorship tracking in mind perkel 2016 each contribution will need to be manually tagged with an author id and other relevant metadata and copies will need to be regularly saved as the wiki evolves although such an approach requires diligence word documents are relatively simple to use can still use hyperlinks to connect topic pages and can be easily saved as pdfs advantageous for sharing and long term archiving note taking software like onenote and notion represent another potentially powerful alternative a run through of typical data in a role play of fieldwork during the software identification process is likely to be helpful in discovering potential usability issues we recommend that wikis be set up ahead of fieldwork so that they are ready to be used at the outset of data collection optionally once the provisional topic pages have been created researchers can populate them with their pre fieldwork knowledge as well as identifying gaps in knowledge this can help provide context to what is subsequently seen at field sites aiding interpretation allowing sanity tests and flagging matters that should be probed this process may also reveal additional topics that could be worth considering 4 2 assembling the wiki 4 2 1 draw on participant knowledge wikis are designed to facilitate knowledge co creation and therefore are ideal for participatory research participants can be recruited to write content and make edits themselves if they are literate or the process can be facilitated by members of the research team asking questions and transcribing the responses we recommend recruiting a diverse set of participants to maximise the perspectives and experiences drawn upon though actively seeking out eloquent participants is pragmatic given the nature of the task participants should be briefed on the purpose of the wiki and the topic areas on which their inputs are sought at the outset majchrzak et al 2013 and appropriate consent should be obtained before they commence work given the time consuming multi day nature of developing wikis we also suggest that researchers consider remunerating participants at a locally appropriate rate some coaching from the research team may be needed at the outset with less guidance being required over time emphasising the desirability of detailed algorithmic explanations of processes and decision making and asking participants to provide numerical values where possible is important from a modelling perspective flagging choices relating to the expenditure of time and resources whenever they arise should be encouraged too they should also be asked to clearly flag uncertainty and variability to ensure researchers are mindful of this during the modelling stages to fully exploit the benefits of the wiki approach we recommend encouraging participants to propose topics that they personally perceive as important in relation to the overall research purpose more generally we suggest that researchers make a concerted effort to create enabling conditions for participants to feel empowered this should help maximise the breadth and depth of information elicited and make the process more fulfilling for participants basic information on each of the participants and the circumstances of their involvement e g age gender time date and location should be recorded separately from the wiki taking account of any local personal data protection requirements and a means of tracking their individual contributions should be determined if this is not being logged automatically by wiki software for example each author can be assigned a unique code that can be appended to each of their contributions we recommend initially compiling the wiki in the local language if participants are literate this allows them to write contributions and interrogate content directly strengthening their sense of ownership over the process the contents can be translated later if necessary where researchers are not fluent in the local language this may temporarily compromise their capacity for oversight so recruiting an able researcher assistant or translator to mediate the process will be vital 4 2 2 integrate researcher understanding and information from other sources researchers can also write content for the wiki drawing on knowledge that they have gleaned from literature other research exercises informal discussions and their own observations even knowledge that would typically be held tacitly can be worth documenting as it helps with recall and enables others to make sense of the information at a later stage that said we recognise that there are practical limits to the amount of knowledge that can be documented that some knowledge will remain tacit is unavoidable but the wiki approach at least offers a way to capture some knowledge that would otherwise only be held tacitly enabling it to be documented in a formal and transparent manner if researchers do engage in the authorship process they should cite the origin of the insights ensure that their contributions can be distinguished from those of other participants and discuss any potentially sensitive topics with appropriate caution we also recommend allowing participants the opportunity to critique these contributions which may require translating them this can help validate researcher interpretations and respects the spirit of co creation that is central to the wiki concept ideally researchers will refrain from personally authoring substantial amounts of content until participants have finished making the bulk of their contributions so that participant voices are prioritised 4 2 3 iteratively edit as knowledge is added to the wiki continuous editing will be required to ensure that the contents are kept clear and coherent the aim should be for each topic page to be written in a relatively parsimonious fashion so regular filtering and pruning is important markus 2001 as the topic articles are reviewed content that is deemed to be below standard e g insufficiently informative contradictory or unclear should be flagged for attention should it not be possible to resolve immediately mietchen et al 2011 we envisage that researchers lead the editing process but participants can also assist empowering them to do so will allow researcher contributions to be validated and help with identifying any misinterpretations when contradictory or contested entries are identified researchers have several options open to them they could consult the original contributors seek the views of additional parties accept that there is legitimate ambiguity or act as an arbiter themselves if they believe they have sufficient evidence to do so where views cannot be reconciled among all parties a note should be added stating this as eitzel 2021 has argued differences in knowledge need not always be viewed as problematic from a research perspective modelling enables the implications of contrasting perspectives to be explored and this can lead to valuable insights about systems that would not have been gleaned if differences in knowledge were erased during data collection it may also be appropriate to restructure the wiki from time to time if this improves flow majchrzak et al 2013 besides determining the topics that merit inclusion it is important to consider which merit a standalone page if a topic requires only a cursory mention it is best to incorporate it into a higher level page that covers the topic and others closely associated with it for example trees and wildlife might be best discussed under the common heading of ecology if they are not going to be individually addressed in detail these decisions can be reviewed as fieldwork progresses and understanding develops all knowledge collection will involve some degree of classification and associated decision making and filtering in ses studies this would ideally be a collaborative process which balances and reflects on the overlaps and differences between scientific based and community based means of understanding the world the latter may not map perfectly onto formal scientific frameworks but it is often in the mismatch between world views that the most crucial insights reside it is therefore important that the structuring is responsive to community input and that power structures do not compel a community to bend its worldview to fit academic paradigms 4 3 developing the model the process of compiling the wiki can often generate insights that were not considered or anticipated during initial research design it can therefore be useful to pause and reflect on what has been learned before commencing model development the modular structure of the wiki can potentially provide inspiration for the design of the model structure and links between topics in the wiki can help in identifying and understanding interconnections that merit consideration in the model design during model development the wiki can act as a single common reference point for those involved in designing the model as information is grouped in an intuitive structured way it should simplify the process of locating details as they are required wikis and ses models have a similar structural logic they partially decompose systems while recognising that important linkages between components remain ostrom 2007 wikipedia 2016 consequently the knowledge contained in ses wikis will often map neatly onto ses models they are in many respects proto models in and of themselves blueprints that can guide design strongly rooted in the empirical reality of field sites wikis can also facilitate researchers who seek to take a pattern oriented modelling pom approach grimm et al 1996 pom involves identifying multiple ses features that can potentially be matched against when calibrating models and testing different configurations grimm et al 2005 something that is not usually possible when data collection is narrow in scope but may be possible with wide ranging data contained from an ses wiki if sufficiently information rich the wiki can furthermore be used by researchers to saturate themselves in the details of a study site and to take something akin to a grounded theory approach to the modelling process 4 4 communicating the model the wiki or extracts from it can be published alongside model code and descriptions to provide background as well as rationale for key modelling decisions however before publishing either the wiki or extracts it is important to consider whether participants could potentially be identified from the detailed information contained unlike many interviews focus groups or ethnographic studies the information contained in a wiki is intentionally wide ranging and comprehensive which increases the likelihood of participants anonymity being compromised if viewed in its entirety even if the wiki is written in a general summary tone if intending to make the entire wiki publicly available alongside the model it is advisable to consider the anonymity of participants when writing articles from the outset rather than trying to retrospectively anonymise the entire wiki as this could require a considerable amount of work for example articles could be written in such a way as to remove references to particulars and enumerate in ranges rather than specific values to obscure the identities of specific settings or individuals one flexible approach to managing anonymity when sharing the wiki is to tag topic pages or even sections within topic pages with different levels of shareability some topic pages may not contain any potentially identifying or sensitive information and can be shared publicly without issues while others may need to be edited first for certain topic pages it may be necessary to restrict their viewing to just within the research team or with other researchers subject to request an alternative to sharing the wiki itself is to include excerpts from or summaries of wiki articles in other research outputs a route that reduces dilemmas around how to handle sensitive information and which will also make the contents more practical for readers to digest ideally wikis or wiki extracts would be converted to a stable document format and stored in a permanent archive so that their availability will be assured in the long run perkel 2016 for example they could be stored along with model code in the comses net computational model library https www comses net codebases rollins et al 2014 aside from anonymisation and desensitisation we suggest that researchers not worry much about finessing the contents of the wiki unless they have the time resources and desire to do so 4 5 extending the model and reusing knowledge the knowledge contained in ses wikis could be of value to studies other than those that originally prompted their creation easterbrook 2014 white et al 2013 wikis could be used to adapt models to address additional research questions or to contribute to wholly different studies for any of this to occur firstly the writing must be unambiguous allowing future selves and other researchers to make sense of it without revisiting field sites secondly the content must be sufficiently broad and comprehensive to allow new questions to be addressed finally wikis need to be made accessible and other researchers need to be aware of their existence van tuyl and whitmire 2016 where wikis or extracts of wikis are suitable for public sharing it is preferable to store them in topically appropriate public archives as discussed in section 4 4 accompanied by detailed descriptions of their contents and generous reuse licenses janssen 2017 white et al 2013 5 discussion we have proposed wikis as an approach for managing case study knowledge for ses modelling projects presented our nepal field site wiki as an example of the approach in action and offered guidance as to how they could be most effectively built and employed in this section we critically evaluate the opportunities and challenges of the wiki approach as they apply across the phases of empirically driven model based research outlined in fig 3 we draw on our own experience of using it to construct an abm of a mountain community to show how the ses wiki approach can be both practical and effective in the appropriate context but also to demonstrate the real world difficulties of implementation we focus on four main issues the time demands required to produce a wiki how participants can be empowered in the process of creating a wiki what software to use and considerations around sharing an ses wiki 5 1 time demands time demands are often cited as a reason why the odd protocol and trace framework are not utilised more frequently grimm et al 2014 m√ºller et al 2013 ses wikis are also time consuming both for participants and researchers however a substantial upside of the wiki approach is that it improves modelling efficiency assuming that conflicts and inconsistencies in the wiki were resolved during the data collection the knowledge contained should already be coherent by the time modelling begins allowing researchers to focus on modelling judgements rather than knowledge reconciliation in contrast where the wiki approach is not used and where conflicting information has not been addressed in the field the modelling process is complicated by the need to select between sources or determine compromise solutions something that can greatly hinder progress wikis also make it less likely that knowledge gaps will be encountered during modelling reducing the potential need for costly additional data collection later furthermore ses wikis can help with issues of institutional memory in the case of projects where there is staff turnover or if the person developing the model is different from the fieldwork researchers indeed wikis are often used in the corporate world for such purposes ashkenas 2013 they offer a ready means for third parties to absorb and make sense of study site knowledge reducing the need for time consuming briefings and exchanges adapting existing models to address new research questions is an efficient way to conduct science laatabi et al 2018 para 1 2 however code is rarely reused at present as there is often insufficient knowledge about a case study site to reconfigure the model in an empirically supported fashion janssen 2017 janssen et al 2020 m√ºller et al 2014 by providing knowledge on a near comprehensive range of topics wikis can facilitate the retrospective adaptation of empirically grounded ses models obviating the need for fresh fieldwork and greatly improving the resource efficiency of the ses modelling field this increases the value derived from the generosity of research participants and accelerates the pace of disciplinary progress cragin et al 2010 janssen 2017 martone 2014 however there are risks in trying to make wikis exhaustive in an effort to maximise potential research openings compiling information without limits can be a substantial time sink and realistically there are limits to the number of research questions that any given case study will productively lend itself to it is also difficult to anticipate the information needs of yet to be fleshed out research ideas however comprehensive researchers try to be there will be topics that are missed that will impose constraints on future research when we extended our model to address questions around food security for example we recognised there were gaps in our knowledge that we would have to fill using information from secondary source 5 2 empowering participants increasing research subject agency is often spoken of as a desirable objective in ses modelling studies e g becu et al 2006 naivinit et al 2010 steger et al 2021 yet the options for doing this remain limited voinov and bousquet 2010 the wiki development process can facilitate direct authorship and scrutiny of ses knowledge by research subjects imbuing participants with substantial agency and fostering a sense of research ownership among study communities this can redress some of the power imbalances inherent in fieldwork increase the likelihood of recommendations being heeded and lessen the likelihood that important aspects of the field site are overlooked by researchers darroch and giles 2014 pain and kindon 2007 schensul et al 2015 voinov and bousquet 2010 for agent based modellers in particular the opportunity to view a ses through the eyes of real world agents is immensely valuable as it offers direct insights into agent decision making and behaviour facilitating their recreation in code while the benefits of co production approaches are substantial we also experienced some challenges which demonstrate the need for careful selection and guidance of participants careful expectation management and strong people skills for example we found it difficult to find participants who had sufficient free time to take part particularly for older generations as they tended to have more work commitments it was also sometimes difficult to elicit information in a suitable format for the wiki as some villagers at the field site in nepal particularly those with very little formal education tended to address topics in narrative form which was difficult to package into thematic pages difficulties were also encountered with acquiring information at the desired level of detail and progressing through themes at a productive rate literacy however was not a barrier as we were able to take dictation where required allowing us to avoid excluding the older less literate generations the differing willingness and capacity of people to engage can be problematic from a representation perspective as literacy levels and communication styles can be closely linked with ethnicity caste sex age and socio economic backgrounds laws et al 2013 one way of dealing with this which our participants proposed is to allow them to engage with other community members when they encounter gaps in their own knowledge sensitive oversight is required to ensure that those recruited to complete the wiki are not advertently or inadvertently providing biased information or failing to include differing viewpoints and opinions as participants will have access to content written by others it is also critical that the sensitivity of information in the wiki be monitored to avoid privacy violations or other potential harms damianakis and woodford 2012 researchers must also be aware of the risk of social biases culturally and politically motivated edits and peer pressure influencing the development of the wiki especially in relation to sensitive topics enforcing some degree of verifiability standards will be particularly critical wherever there is elevated risk of such influences 5 3 wiki software there are a number of practical issues with wiki software that will complicate the development of ses wikis in certain contexts in our case we encountered significant challenges with internet connectivity and power availability during fieldwork roxburgh 2019 roxburgh et al 2021 mobile internet connections were unreliable and we were frequently unable to recharge phones and laptops due to power outages this made conventional web based wiki software impractical to use word processing software proved to be an adequate substitute once we figured out procedures for authorship and edit tracking but it did demand fastidiousness to keep on top of this tracking and we did not always get it right purpose designed wiki software offers automated tracking which relieves this burden and reduces the likelihood of errors this is something we view as a substantial strength in light of our experiences but it is more complicated to initially setup the power outages occasionally prevented us from running electronic devices a hindrance regardless of the approach used we overcame this by compiling notes on paper and then typing them up once power was available again this worked reasonably when the outages were limited to a few hours but we suspect longer periods without power would have proved seriously problematic as we found it was valuable to be able to refer back to existing content as we worked potential users should take these issues into consideration when deciding how to proceed 5 4 sharing wikis the breadth and comprehensiveness of wikis make them powerful research tools but can also in certain situations limit the extent to which they can be published and shared for example our wiki described the lives and livelihoods of a nepalese mountain community in minute detail while extracts of the nepal wiki could be shared without issue to publish it in its entirety could potentially provide enough information to identify the village and its members this is something we could not risk from an ethics standpoint in other cases the risks to anonymity may be less it will depend on the idiosyncrasies of the field site the kinds of data collected and how they are recorded in the wiki this presents something of dilemma on the one hand the detailed nature of ses wikis could make them valuable knowledge resources if shared on the other hand their detailed nature means great caution needs to be taken to ensure they cannot be misused and that the anonymity of participants is respected starting from the principle that we should as a research community aspire to share data to the greatest extent possible mcnutt 2014 schofield et al 2009 we suggest users publish a carefully edited version of their wikis leaving in as much information as possible while addressing possible issues around anonymity and noting the nature of any details that have been removed should other researchers wish to access the redacted data further discussion can be had around how that might be done in an ethically sound way 6 conclusion collaborative ethnography has significant advantages as well as respecting communities welcoming and supporting their agency collaborative work is more likely to build a fuller understanding of community dynamics is likely to bring a richer understanding and commitment to research within the communities with less experience of science and represents an opportunity for two way flow and stimulation of community enhancing ideas nevertheless collaboration brings issues with it of knowledge management with older techniques of complicated scientist and hypothesis driven field logging failing to provide accessible or suitably structured toolsets and therefore to maximise knowledge elicitation in this paper we have suggested wikis provide a more suitable mechanism for data collation structuring and understanding in particular they may aid in the process of structuring and mapping the understanding of systems such as to make the production of disaggregate social environmental and economic models more robust and complete we have additionally reflected on our use of such techniques when engaged in fieldwork and subsequently modelling a rural highland community in nepal wikis are not by any means a full solution to the issues of collaborative data acquisition there are a number of facets of human communication and lived experience they can represent only imperfectly purposeful ambiguity in relationships the strength of connections between concepts spatial links and dynamic changes for example nevertheless they represent a considerable step forward as a knowledge representation system for field studies not only in terms of the collaborative collation of data but also through their opening up of the collaborative structuring of knowledge and the subsequent analysis and use of those structures as such we would hope that this paper goes some way to encouraging field scientists especially those collecting data for disaggregate modelling to utilise wikis in field practice author

logs with diameter 0 1 m and length 0 1 m keller and swanson 1979 wohl and jaeger 2009 in river channels increases flow heterogeneity and habitat diversity engineered logjams composed of many smaller wood pieces are installed as part of river restoration and natural flood management projects to provide the physical and ecological benefits associated with lw gallisdorfer et al 2014 bennett et al 2015 burgess gamble et al 2018 dadson et al 2017 ismail et al 2021 however knowledge gaps surrounding the effectiveness of natural flood management interventions and the physical processes by which jams affect channel floodplain connectivity and water storage have led to calls for evidence wohl et al 2016 dadson et al 2017 burgess gamble et al 2018 and process based investigation wohl et al 2005 to improve the design and assessment of interventions using lw logjams create an upstream area of slower deepened water increasing habitat diversity and potential for deposition of sediment and fine particles bilby 1981 bouwes et al 2018 schalko et al 2018 the increase in upstream water depth or backwater rise generated by logjams geertsema et al 2020 has recently been described with momentum based models with drag generated by the group of logs in the jam region represented by an adaptation of the law for drag in canopies follett et al 2020 2021 this approach allows representation of logjams as hydraulic structures in a flood model or network analysis ru√≠z villanueva et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2017 persi et al 2019 hankin et al 2020 leakey et al 2020 senior et al 2022 however a research gap remains in predictive approaches for large catchments for which representation of tens to hundreds of jams may be desired at this scale individual jam representation is time intensive and can require mesh refinement and associated timestep reduction to maintain the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition u Œ¥ t Œ¥ x increasing model runtime previous investigators have represented the aggregate effect of multiple logjams with an empirically determined increase in channel hydraulic roughness addy and wilkinson 2019 in addition to lw implementation uncertainty in flow measurement and boundary conditions can complicate prediction of natural flood management nfm schemes these uncertainties can be made more explicit using for example the general likelihood uncertainty estimation glue framework beven and binley 1992a 1992b and the influence of nfm in general can be investigated in a more complex uncertainty framework hankin et al 2017 whereby stratified sampling is undertaken of the uncertainties in both the controlling parameter and the expected perturbation to it due to nfm field observations of engineered and natural lw jams black et al 2020 linstead and gurnell 1999 have observed that the effect of jams is expected to depend on both channel and barrier physical properties calling for additional research investigating the comparative effects across river channel and barrier physical parameters in this paper we explore the effect of a series of jams on a varying inflow hydrograph for varying magnitude of jam longitudinal density jam generated backwater rise lower gap height local overflow to surrounding floodplain and channel physical properties to demonstrate the effect of varying jam properties and guide choice of jam design for varying channels to guide choice of effective channel resistance based on barrier physical properties for large spatial scale modelling approaches we choose an effective bed friction coefficient c f e yielding minimum sum of the squared difference in volume between outflow exiting 1d networks representing reaches of length l r containing multiple logjams and the same model channel with effective resistance represented by c f e instead of individual jams model jams had accumulation factor c a and average inter jam spacing l s the backwater rise upstream of each jam depends on the jam accumulation factor and unit discharge follett et al 2020 2021 the effect of predicted c f e on channel outflow discharge downstream of eight leaky barriers is demonstrated and compared to implementation of individual barriers as hydraulic structures in hec ras 2d representing penny gill west cumbria uk fig 1 a 2 theory 2 1 unobstructed open channel flow the effect of a series of jams on outflow discharge and channel segment water volume was compared to the effect of uniform flow with constant bed resistance in a wide rectangular open channel of reach length l r slope s width b bankfull depth h b f and gravitational

sediment diameter and bankfull channel depth increase with increasing slope for channels where median sediment diameter is not known an estimation of bed resistance based on channel slope was used to reduce amount of input data for channels with s 0 015 bed resistance may be estimated from the relationship found by yochum et al 2014 from field observations of high gradient streams n 1 85 s 0 79 s

uniform flow c f 0 is first found from s using eq 5 enabling solution of h b f from measured b b f and eqs 1 and 3 and prediction of q using eq 1 uk rivers were observed to be relatively deeper and narrower compared to the full dataset used by parker et al 2007 which was attributed to the high density of bank vegetation and lower expected gravel supply relative to other sites used alberta canada and idaho and colorado usa in addition bankfull width varied more strongly with discharge than bankfull depth across the full dataset parker et al 2007 therefore use of both measured h b f and b b f is preferable but if necessary prediction of h b f is preferred over bankfull width as the magnitude of error in the prediction is less severe while local observations of h b f b b f and d s 50 may differ from the predictions of eqs 3 and 4 due to local channel adjustment and sediment input prediction of d s 50 and c f 0 from channel slope and bankfull width is suitable for use in sparse data input methods where h b f and d s 50 are not available 2 2 jam generated upstream backwater rise flow through a jam generated momentum loss proportional to the number size and packing density of the

local floodplain inundation at water depths higher than the elevation of the jam top edge flow has been observed to pass over the top edge of the jam and inundate the local floodplain fig 1 discharge

than or equal to the channel bankfull depth discharge passing over the top edge of the jam was represented by eq 9 and floodplain resistance was represented by eq 10 local floodplain width was assumed to be equal to the channel bankfull width on either side of the channel so that total width of the channel and floodplain was three times the channel bankfull width the simplified floodplain geometry and width were intended to estimate the effect of overtopping and local inundation in future work the choice of width and geometry should be clarified with reference to empirical observations for jams with height of top vertical edge greater than the channel bankfull depth flow was assumed to occupy a total width of three times the channel bankfull width passing through a channel spanning jam eq 7 with equivalent c a to the in channel jam in this method the jam generated momentum loss was assumed to be much greater than the floodplain resistance so that the contribution of floodplain resistance was neglected water depth above the jam top edge was represented by a weir eq 9 2 4 volume of jam generated upstream backwater the network model used in this paper related the unobstructed uniform and jam generated upstream water depths to total volume of water in a channel segment hankin et al 2020 water volume in a channel segment containing a jam at the segment downstream edge was assumed to occupy a combination of uniform flow and a simplified triangular upstream backwater region fig 2 this assumption is a simplification of the true backwater curve which asymptotically approaches uniform flow depth chow 1959 a region of falling water at the downstream face of the jam and contracted flow exiting the jam were observed under some experimental conditions follett et al 2021 the channel was assumed to have s 0 17 so that error introduced by the small angle approximation tan Œ∏ sin Œ∏ Œ∏ was less than 1 the jam generated an upstream water depth h j fig 2 blue solid line with backwater length extending from the jam upstream edge over a distance l b w h j h 0 s until the absolute elevation of the channel water surface at uniform flow was equal to the water surface elevation upstream

jams in the main channel and smaller barriers constructed upstream of the monitored reach 3 2 network model to systematically investigate the effect of longitudinal jam density varying c a gap height local floodplain overflow and correspondence to a best fit effective elevated bed resistance model a rectangular open channel containing a series of jams was represented by a 1d network similar to previous frameworks used to assess assessing jam placement and network structure hankin et al 2020 model files were implemented in the r language the network contained n s nodes representing a series of channel segments each node i represented one channel segment with slope s i length l i average width b i and water volume v i the change in water volume within each segment was equal to the difference between inflow and outflow 13 v t j 1 n s a j i q j q i q i with inflow q j entering segment i from the immediate upstream node j and outflow exiting the segment downstream edge q i lateral inflow to segment i q i is allowed in the scheme although lateral inflow was not explored in this paper links between segments were represented with an adjacency matrix a j i with connection between node i and its immediate downstream neighbor j specified by a j i i j 1 and a j i i j 0 if no connection was present values of discharge segment water volume and segment average cross sectional area a i v i l s i for each segment were interpolated from a precalculated hydraulic table to generate the table a range of possible node upstream water depths h j 0 10 h b f was specified for nodes with no jam present the upstream node depth was equal to the uniform flow depth throughout the segment discharge corresponding to uniform flow depth was found from eq 1 and segment volume and cross sectional area for uniform flow were found by assuming a constant water depth h 0 along the reach v 0 v f p 0 in eqs 10 and 11 discharge corresponding to node upstream depth for segments with a jam present was found from eq 6 for segments in which the upstream backwater did not occupy the full segment length water depth upstream of the backwater was assumed to have uniform flow depth the corresponding total segment water volume from backwater and uniform flow was found from eqs 10 and 11 the nonlinear system of equations describing conservation of mass eq 13 together with calculated q g h 0 s c f 0 h j a

is coupled with equations corresponding to the upstream edge of the network the system is solved numerically using an ordinary differential equation solver in r lsodes code has been published in the github repository although several hydraulic modelling software packages are available to solve similar equation sets implementation of this system in a simplified 1d framework and open source r language allows rapid implementation of many jams along a channel and assessment of a range of channel and barrier physical properties in addition this modelling framework provides a basis for future testing of arbitrary networks hankin et al 2020 4 results 4 1 number of jams per reach length the effect of jam longitudinal density along the reach length which increased l b w l s eq 12 was explored

horizontal gray dash dot line so that the effect of the jam was reduced for higher discharge levels the simplified compound channel representation is not sufficient to reproduce the complex flow paths observed in natural overflow conditions fig 1 b and additional research is needed to understand the effect of jam installations at above bankfull discharge levels and interaction between jams and local floodplain flows 4 5 channels of varying slope placement of the same jam in channels of increasing slope would be expected to result in relatively higher backwater rise and backwater volume

upstream depth reached the channel bankfull depth fig 8 c horizontal dashed dark blue line 4 6 best fit effective resistance coefficient use of an elevated resistance coefficient to represent a series of jams is of interest for larger scale modelling and scenarios for which individual representation of jams is prohibitively time consuming or raises issues with model stability for the same discharge an elevated channel resistance increases water depth uniformly across the full channel segment length in contrast to the triangle like backwater shape generated by a jam fig 2 for this reason a best fit elevated resistance model fit to the outflow hydrograph from a series of jams can approximate the time delay and reduction in peak magnitude found from outflow from a series of jams but does not reproduce the reduction in outflow peak skewness where this is observed fig 4 a in addition channel segment water volume and overflow to the local floodplain would differ between the individual jam and best fit resistance models the degree of elevation in channel resistance increased with decreased inter jam spacing elevated resistance was bounded on the lower end by an unobstructed channel c f 0 and on the upper end by a resistance generating h h j across the full channel length c f e max for a channel spanning jam with no lower gap the maximum resistance was equal to the cube of the relative ratio of the jam generated upstream depth and unobstructed uniform flow depth c f e max c f 0 h 0 h j 3 the best fit effective elevated resistance that minimized difference in outflow from a channel with elevated bed resistance and outflow from a channel with a series of channel spanning jams in an infinitely deep channel was found for the usway burn at shillmoor for n 10 25 50 100 125 150 200 292 jams section 4 1 the ratio between the difference in effective resistance and unobstructed resistance and difference between maximum and unobstructed resistance increased with increasing l b w max l s fig 9 a due to the increasing shallowness of the outflow hydrograph rising limb generated by the triangular backwater the difference between the outflow modelled by a best fit effective resistance coefficient and outflow from a series of jams increased with decreasing inter jam spacing up to l b w max l s 1 fig 9 b after this point truncation of the backwater tip created a trapezoidal backwater decreasing the difference between the best fit resistance and jam series curves the upper bound for effective resistance assuming that h h j everywhere in the channel

relative gap width 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of modelled jam trends with field observations jam presence has been observed to increase reach mean depth and decrease reach mean velocity linstead and gurnell 1999 due to the formation of a jam generated upstream backwater the aggregate effect of a series of jams has been observed to attenuate upstream flood peaks and increase flow travel time contributing to downstream flood attenuation gregory et al 1985 linstead and gurnell 1999 dadson et al 2017 consistent with this expectation a series of jams placed in a modelled 1d channel increased the peak delay and peak outflow discharge magnitude of an inflow discharge wave relative to an unobstructed channel with the same channel length slope width and bed resistance fig 4 the increase in outflow peak delay and reduction in peak magnitude was consistent with previous modelling results for increasing numbers of jams in a channel metcalfe et al 2017 consistent with the modelled increase in effective optimum bed resistance due to a series of jams relative to unobstructed bed resistance fig 9 linstead and gurnell 1999 measured elevated manning s n with increasing discharge linstead and gurnell 1999 fig 2 5 in that paper for two reaches in the forest of dean gloucestershire that contained active jams observed to span the full channel extent and generate an observable change in water surface profile all recorded flows were in channel following jam removal measured manning s n decreased for all discharge values the increased effective measured manning s n ranged from 1 7 to 2 2 times above the unobstructed manning s n value this increase in n e n 0 would correspond to a theoretical maximum channel resistance of c f e c f 0 n e n 0 2 4 consistent with a series of closely spaced jams generating a relative upstream depth 1 6 times the unobstructed uniform flow depth with h 0 h j 0 63 guidance for design of leaky barriers wren et al 2022 ydrt 2021 suggests a spacing of approximately 7 channel widths for a jam with a lower gap vertical width of approximately 0 3 m extending to approximately 1 5 times the channel bankfull depth wren et al 2022 ydrt 2021 the recommended channel spacing was compared to model estimations for a jam accumulation that would have generated h 0 h j 0 5 if arranged with no lower gap for the three channels considered with varying s 0 001935 0 008479 0 021467 table 1 hey and thorne 1986 bankfull depth was relatively consistent across all sites h b f 0 68 0 78 0 72 m table 1 a lower gap vertical width of 0 3 m would result in relative gap width a h b f 0 44 0 38 0 42 similar to the a h b f 0 5 case shown with a solid light blue line in fig 6 the backwater length when jam generated upstream depth was equal to channel bankfull depth was reduced from the case with no lower gap with backwater length relative to channel bankfull width equal to l b w b b f 10 9 2 7 2 1 respectively for channel sites with increasing slope for the two higher slope cases the modelled backwater length was smaller than the recommended spacing of 7 channel widths the rate of increase in the time delay of the outflow discharge peak and reduction in outflow discharge peak magnitude relative to outflow from an unobstructed channel reduced for spacings closer than approximately l b w max l s 1 1 5 fig 4 suggesting that placement of additional jams to generate a spacing closer to the maximum expected backwater length could result in additional time delay of the outflow discharge peak and relative reduction in peak magnitude the simplified 1d scenarios considered in this paper assessed the effect of a series of jams with varying jam and channel physical properties while the model framework allows for provision of lateral inflow along the modelled reach lateral inflows were not considered in the test cases considered to accurately assess the implications of jam installation in larger catchments future work should consider the addition of lateral inflow and catchment scale hydrological effects such as that generated by a catchment scale hydrological model metcalfe et al 2017 lewis et al 2018 in addition the sensitivity of outflow characteristics to temporal change of jams due to seasonal build up and loss of wood and leaf material and floodplain morphology should be considered in future modelling and empirical studies black et al 2020 observed an increase in outflow peak lag time compared to prior baseline measurements of the same channel before installation of a series of leaky barriers in the middle burn 35 leaky barriers and craigburn 44 leaky barriers alongside riparian and wetland tree planting and in the case of craigburn construction of three offline holding ponds lag time was observed to increase with flood magnitude up to approximately qmed or bankfull flow the increase in peak lag time within this range was attributed to the design of structures that allowed increased passage of water at low flows similar to jams with a lower gap considered in this paper for which a relative increase in delay of outflow discharge relative to an unobstructed channel was observed for discharge values above the inundation point of the jam lower edge compared to lower flow values fig 6 for the largest events measured with discharge level above qmed median lag continued to rise at a reduced rate at middle burn but decreased sharply to near pre installation values at craigburn in both cases the relative peak lag for events above qmed was reduced relative to sub qmed events black et al 2020 fig 3 in that paper the change at near bankfull flow is consistent with model output with a simplified channel floodplain configuration fig 8 showing reduced peak lag for increasing peak inflow discharge as water level began to inundate the model floodplain and in some cases overtop the modelled jams prior modelling studies of vegetated channels have shown a similar reduction in sensitivity to vegetation generated roughness for larger floods compared to smaller flood inputs anderson et al 2006 despite an increased number of interventions at craigburn the observed increase in peak lag time was observed to be less than at middle burn which was attributed to likely variation in barrier physical properties and placement channel gradient and differences in geology surface cover and soil composition black et al 2020 5 2 recommendations for jam design in varying channels identical jams placed in channels of increasing slope would be expected to generate a higher relative backwater rise and backwater volume above base flow v b w v s fig 3 but lower backwater length l b w h j h 0 s for the same set of jams placed with equal spacing in low medium and high slope channels of the same modelled length table 1 fig 8 a more pronounced outflow delay associated with jam presence was observed for the lowest slope site due to higher l b w l s compared to the higher slope cases existing guidance recommending placement at approximately 7 10 channel widths linstead and gurnell 1999 ydrt 2021 in part incorporates the effect of increasing slope as bankfull width is expected to decrease with increasing slope parker et al 2007 however the observed empirical scaling of b b f s 0 4 was weaker than the inverse linear dependence of backwater length on slope parker et al 2007 section 2 4 similarly across the 3 example sites the decrease in bankfull depth was less strong than the decrease in backwater length so that a jam with no lower gap generating h 0 h j 0 5 would generate a backwater length relative to bankfull depth l b w b b f 27 5 and 3 channel widths respectively for sites with s 0 001935 0 008479 0 021467 table 1 when the jam generated upstream depth was equal to the channel bankfull depth jams spaced more closely than l b w max l s 1 had reduced increase in time delay of outflow peak and reduction in peak magnitude with l b w l s suggesting that closer jam spacings than l b w max l s 1 may generate reduced attenuation per jam and provide less value per money however magnitude of time delay of outflow peak and magnitude of reduction in outflow peak magnitude continued to increase for more closely spaced jams until the point at which the jam backwater would have reached the adjacent upstream jam even at the minimum inflow discharge in cases with a simplified model floodplain that allowed for jam overtopping the effect of jams was increased when jam generated upstream depth exceeded bankfull depth for unobstructed sub bankfull discharge values but reduced for discharge values that overtopped the jam reducing jam accumulation factor to delay overtopping and implementing jam installations in conjunction with riparian forest planting or other measures to increase local floodplain resistance black et al 2020 may help to attenuate higher flood levels similarly jams with a lower gap had no effect at discharge levels for which the water depth would not have reached the jam lower edge and reduced outflow peak time delay and reduction in peak magnitude compared to jams with no lower gap however the presence of the lower gap increased the discharge value at which the jam became overtopped allowing a wider upper range of jam generated effect on outflow discharge 5 3 leaky barrier advisor as interest in nature based solutions for natural flood management and sustainable farming has increased interest has grown in sparse input data methods suitable for participatory modelling including incorporation of lay knowledge and site observations collected by farmers government regulators and citizen scientists voinov and bousquet 2010 basco carrera et al 2017 voinov et al 2016 hedelin et al 2021 the simplified 1d network model described in this paper section 3 2 can be used to estimate the effect of jam installations on an inflow hydrograph using channel slope bankfull width and site observations of jam relative gap width a h b f relative h 0 h j or related observations such as the amount of times per year that the channel bank became inundated upstream of the jam relative to downstream or unobstructed flow for sites with unknown bankfull depth d s 50 and bed friction coefficient channel slope and bankfull width can be used to estimate h b f d s 50 and c f 0 eqs 3 5 while the model capabilities lack a catchment scale hydrological model and are limited relative to standard hydraulic modelling software packages model set up time and runtime are reduced and a range of jam and channel properties can be trialled with relatively sparse data input after computing outflow discharge from a given inflow and specified channel and barrier properties inflow and outflow hydrographs are plotted in addition to jam

resistance was estimated to equal n 0 0 23 s m 1 3 based on observations of rough channels with scattered wood pieces yochum et al 2014 in separate model runs jams were represented both as individual hydraulic structures and using an effective manning s resistance coefficient using hec ras 2d individual jams were represented as embankments spanning the channel with a custom outlet rating curve assuming the jams acted as channel spanning jams with no lower gap eq 7 a jam accumulation factor of c a 50 was estimated from an available photograph fig 1 a assuming that the structure was approximately 1 m high with five cylindrical logs of equal diameter the estimated c a follett et al 2020 ranged from c a 64 43 depending on chosen inter log gap width of 1 2 cm respectively c a 50 was chosen based on this range yielding a relative ratio of unobstructed flow depth to jam generated upstream depth h 0 h j 0 42 in addition to model runs including individual jams an effective manning s resistance coefficient was chosen n e 0 24 to minimize the difference between outflow modelled with an elevated resistance coefficient and eight individual jams and the limiting maximum resistance n e max 0 68 was computed assuming average channel properties s 0 054 n 0 0 23 s m 1 3 c a 50 with c f 0 related to n 0 assuming a channel bankfull depth of 1 m and average b 5 1 m the hec ras 2d model

adjusted to inflow conservation of mass and momentum were solved over the model domain using the diffusion wave approximation of the shallow water equations solution using the full momentum equations was tested but did not significantly alter model results the effect of jams was limited for the site and event considered due to the low maximum discharge maximum q 0 22 m3 s 1 corresponding to h 0 0 125 m in an unobstructed channel high unobstructed channel resistance and small number of jams modelled outflow curves were higher than measured outflow for the rising limb of the initial smaller peak fig 10 t 14 30 16 30 10 march 2021 and lower than measured outflow for the falling limb of the main peak fig 5 t 22 00 10 march 2021 04 30 11 march 2021 the outflow discharge modelled using individual

30 11 march 2021 which may be due to model uncertainty related to low water depth h 0 0 02 m for uniform flow q 0 005 m3 s 1 and the presence of vertical lower gaps below some jams the discrepancy at low water depths reduced the model nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e 1 t q m q o b s t q o b s q o b s to n s e 0 73 for the model run using eight individually represented jams from n s e 0 78 for the model run using an effective resistance coefficient the analytical maximum resistance n e max 0 68 which was computed assuming h h j everywhere in the channel reduced the outflow peak magnitude q max q max o b s 0 763 and increased time delay t d 0 25 hr to first peak relative to measured outflow showing the maximum possible effect of many jams installed in the channel 6 conclusion logjam representation in hydraulic modelling schemes is used in industry to predict the effects of natural flood management project designs further modelling and empirical studies are needed to assess the performance of engineered logjam installations and interpret field monitoring results while recent results have demonstrated that a jam can be modelled as a porous obstruction generating momentum loss proportional to the number size and packing density of the logs and the jam length providing a physically based stage discharge relationship follett et al 2020 2021 representation of many jams as hydraulic structures increases model set up time and runtime and approximation of jam effects with an increased channel resistance provides a practical alternative addy and wilkinson 2019 field observations suggest that jams increase time delay of the outflow peak and reduce outflow peak magnitude relative to baseline measurements but that a range of effects are present due to dependence on jam and site characteristics including channel slope and bed resistance black et al 2020 to systematically investigate the effect of a series of logjams with varying channel and jam physical properties we represented a rectangular channel containing jams with a 1d network hankin et al 2020 the relative time delay of the outflow peak and relative reduction in peak magnitude increased with number of jams in the channel which increased the relative ratio of backwater length to segment length skewness of the outflow discharge curve initially decreased with increasing relative backwater length to segment length generating an increasingly gradual outflow discharge rising limb as jams became more closely spaced than one backwater length a trapezoidal backwater was generated and the outflow discharge from a series of jams more closely resembled that from a channel with elevated bed resistance the maximum equivalent channel resistance generated by a series of jams would occur when h h j everywhere in the channel generating a relative effective resistance coefficient c f e c f 0 h 0 h j 3 for a series of channel spanning jams with no lower gap the analytical maximum equivalent resistance could be used to quickly estimate the maximum possible effect of a series of jams at a given site although both the best fit equivalent resistance and the deviation of a resistance model from a jam series decline with increased jam spacing the model described in this paper provides a sparse data input option suitable for use with site observations of the relative water depths generated by a jam and estimation of channel slope and bankfull depth which could be used to explore the implications of varying jam spacing and design or estimate the effect of existing jam installations to demonstrate implementation of best fit and maximum elevated channel resistance jams were represented both as individual hydraulic structures and using a best fit elevated resistance in hec ras 2d for penny gill west cumbria uk the theoretical maximum resistance was used to estimate the maximum effect of closely spaced jams on outflow peak delay and attenuation the effect of jams increased with increasing jam generated upstream depth relative to unobstructed water depth h j h 0 which increased with the dimensionless jam accumulation factor c a follett et al 2020 a lower gap reduced outflow peak delay and relative peak reduction with the magnitude of effect increasing with increasing gap height the effect of jams was reduced for cases allowing overflow to the local floodplain represented by a compound channel and jam overtopping for which the effect of jams was most pronounced at discharge levels below bankfull discharge identical jams placed in channels of increasing slope generate a higher relative jam generated upstream depth and backwater volume but lower backwater length so that the effect of an identical jam series was most pronounced for the lowest slope channel considered due to higher relative backwater length jams spaced more closely than l b w max l s 1 had a decreased rate of increase in peak delay and attenuation of outflow discharge peak with increased spacing suggesting that jam spacings much closer than l b w max l s 1 may provide reduced value for money the best fit effective resistance approached the theoretical maximum value when l b w max l s 1 over all inflow discharge values for a jam with constant c a backwater length decreases with increasing slope allowing closer spacing of jams in higher slope channels existing guidance recommending spacing of jams over a multiple of bankfull width likely partially accounts for this effect due to expected decrease in channel width with increasing slope b b f s 0 4 parker et al 2007 the presence of a lower vertical gap below the jam a common engineered logjam design prevented significant delay of flow at levels below the point of inundation of the jam lower edge but increased the discharge value at which the jam would become overtopped causing the jam to influence outflow discharge over a wider range of discharge values software and data

the uncertainties in both the controlling parameter and the expected perturbation to it due to nfm field observations of engineered and natural lw jams black et al 2020 linstead and gurnell 1999 have observed that the effect of jams is expected to depend on both channel and barrier physical properties calling for additional research investigating the comparative effects across river channel and barrier physical parameters in this paper we explore the effect of a series of jams on a varying inflow hydrograph for varying magnitude of jam longitudinal density jam generated backwater rise lower

choice of effective channel resistance based on barrier physical properties for large spatial scale modelling approaches we choose an effective bed friction coefficient c f e yielding minimum sum of the squared difference in volume between outflow exiting 1d networks representing reaches of length l r containing multiple logjams and the same model channel with effective resistance represented by

uniform flow c f 0 is first found from s using eq 5 enabling solution of h b f from measured b b f and eqs 1 and 3 and prediction of q using eq 1 uk rivers were observed to be relatively deeper and narrower compared to the full dataset used by parker et al 2007 which was attributed to the high density of bank vegetation and lower expected gravel supply relative to other sites used alberta canada and idaho and colorado usa in addition bankfull width varied more strongly with discharge than bankfull depth across the full dataset parker et al 2007 therefore use of both measured h b f and b b f is preferable but if necessary prediction of h b f is preferred over bankfull width as the magnitude of error in the prediction is less severe while local observations of h b f b b f and d s 50 may differ from the predictions of eqs 3 and 4 due to local channel adjustment and sediment input prediction of d s 50 and c f 0 from channel slope and bankfull width is suitable for use in sparse data

occupy a combination of uniform flow and a simplified triangular upstream backwater region fig 2 this assumption is a simplification of the true backwater curve which asymptotically approaches uniform flow depth chow 1959 a region of falling water at the downstream face of the jam and contracted flow exiting the jam were observed under some experimental conditions follett et al 2021 the channel was

github repository although several hydraulic modelling software packages are available to solve similar equation sets implementation of this system in a simplified 1d framework and open source r language allows rapid implementation of many jams along a channel and assessment of a range of channel and barrier physical properties in addition this modelling framework provides a basis for future

upstream depth reached the channel bankfull depth fig 8 c horizontal dashed dark blue line 4 6 best fit effective resistance coefficient use of an elevated resistance coefficient to represent a series of jams is of interest for larger scale modelling and scenarios for which individual representation of jams is prohibitively time consuming or raises issues with model stability for the same discharge an elevated channel resistance increases water depth uniformly across the full channel segment length in contrast to the triangle like backwater shape generated by a jam fig 2 for this reason a best fit elevated resistance model fit to the outflow hydrograph from a series of jams can approximate the time delay and reduction in peak magnitude found from outflow from a series of jams but does not reproduce the reduction in outflow peak skewness where this is observed fig 4 a in addition channel segment water volume and overflow to the local floodplain would differ between the individual jam and best fit resistance models the degree of elevation in channel resistance increased with decreased inter jam spacing elevated resistance was bounded on the lower end by an unobstructed channel c f 0 and on the upper end by a resistance generating h h j across the full channel length c f e max for a channel spanning jam with no lower gap the maximum resistance was equal to the cube of the relative ratio of the jam generated upstream depth and unobstructed uniform flow depth c f e max c f 0 h 0 h j 3 the best fit effective elevated resistance that minimized difference in outflow from a channel with elevated bed resistance and outflow from a channel with a series of channel spanning jams in an infinitely deep channel was found for the usway burn at shillmoor for n 10 25 50 100 125 150 200 292 jams section 4 1 the ratio between the difference in effective resistance and unobstructed resistance and difference between maximum and unobstructed resistance increased with increasing l b w max l s fig 9 a due to the increasing shallowness of the outflow hydrograph rising limb generated by the triangular backwater the difference between the outflow modelled by a best fit effective resistance coefficient and outflow from a series of jams increased with decreasing inter jam spacing up to l b w max l s 1 fig 9 b after this point truncation of the backwater tip created a trapezoidal backwater decreasing the difference between the best fit resistance and jam series curves the upper bound for effective resistance assuming that h h j everywhere in the channel

relative gap width 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of modelled jam trends with field observations jam presence has been observed to increase reach mean depth and decrease reach mean velocity linstead and gurnell 1999 due to the formation of a jam generated upstream backwater the aggregate effect of a series of jams has been observed to attenuate upstream flood peaks and increase flow travel time contributing to downstream flood attenuation gregory et al 1985 linstead and gurnell 1999 dadson et al 2017 consistent with this expectation a series of jams placed in a modelled 1d channel increased the peak delay and peak outflow discharge magnitude of an inflow discharge wave relative to an unobstructed channel with the same channel length slope width and bed resistance fig 4 the increase in outflow peak delay and reduction in peak magnitude was consistent with previous modelling results for increasing numbers of jams in a channel metcalfe et al 2017 consistent with the modelled increase in effective optimum bed resistance due to a series of jams relative to unobstructed bed resistance fig 9 linstead and gurnell 1999 measured elevated manning s n with increasing discharge linstead and gurnell 1999 fig 2 5 in that paper for two reaches in the forest of dean gloucestershire that contained active jams observed to span the full channel extent and generate an observable change in water surface profile all recorded flows were in channel following jam removal measured manning s n decreased for all discharge values the increased effective measured manning s n ranged from 1 7 to 2 2 times above the unobstructed manning s n value this increase in n e n 0 would correspond to a theoretical maximum channel resistance of c f e c f 0 n e n 0 2 4 consistent with a series of closely spaced jams generating a relative upstream depth 1 6 times the unobstructed uniform flow depth with h 0 h j 0 63 guidance for design of leaky barriers wren et al 2022 ydrt 2021 suggests a spacing of approximately 7 channel widths for a jam with a lower gap vertical width of approximately 0 3 m extending to approximately 1 5 times the channel bankfull depth wren et al 2022 ydrt 2021 the recommended channel spacing was compared to model estimations for a jam accumulation that would have generated h 0 h j 0 5 if arranged with no lower gap for the three channels considered with varying s 0 001935 0 008479 0 021467 table 1 hey and thorne 1986 bankfull depth was relatively consistent across all sites h b f 0 68 0 78 0 72 m table 1 a lower gap vertical width of 0 3 m would result in relative gap width a h b f 0 44 0 38 0 42 similar to the a h b f 0 5 case shown with a solid light blue line in fig 6 the backwater length when jam generated upstream depth was equal to channel bankfull depth was reduced from the case with no lower gap with backwater length relative to channel bankfull width equal to l b w b b f 10 9 2 7 2 1 respectively for channel sites with increasing slope for the two higher slope cases the modelled backwater length was smaller than the recommended spacing of 7 channel widths the rate of increase in the time delay of the outflow discharge peak and reduction in outflow discharge peak magnitude relative to outflow from an unobstructed channel reduced for spacings closer than approximately l b w max l s 1 1 5 fig 4 suggesting that placement of additional jams to generate a spacing closer to the maximum expected backwater length could result in additional time delay of the outflow discharge peak and relative reduction in peak magnitude the simplified 1d scenarios considered in this paper assessed the effect of a series of jams with varying jam and channel physical properties while the model framework allows for provision of lateral inflow along the modelled reach lateral inflows were not considered in the test cases considered to accurately assess the implications of jam installation in larger catchments future work should consider the addition of lateral inflow and catchment scale hydrological effects such as that generated by a catchment scale hydrological model metcalfe et al 2017 lewis et al 2018 in addition the sensitivity of outflow characteristics to temporal change of jams due to seasonal build up and loss of wood and leaf material and floodplain morphology should be considered in future modelling and empirical studies black et al 2020 observed an increase in outflow peak lag time compared to prior baseline measurements of the same channel before installation of a series of leaky barriers in the middle burn 35 leaky barriers and craigburn 44 leaky barriers alongside riparian and wetland tree planting and in the case of craigburn construction of three offline holding ponds lag time was observed to increase with flood magnitude up to approximately qmed or bankfull flow the increase in peak lag time within this range was attributed to the design of structures that allowed increased passage of water at low flows similar to jams with a lower gap considered in this paper for which a relative increase in delay of outflow discharge relative to an unobstructed channel was observed for discharge values above the inundation point of the jam lower edge compared to lower flow values fig 6 for the largest events measured with discharge level above qmed median lag continued to rise at a reduced rate at middle burn but decreased sharply to near pre installation values at craigburn in both cases the relative peak lag for events above qmed was reduced relative to sub qmed events black et al 2020 fig 3 in that paper the change at near bankfull flow is consistent with model output with a simplified channel floodplain configuration fig 8 showing reduced peak lag for increasing peak inflow discharge as water level began to inundate the model floodplain and in some cases overtop the modelled jams prior modelling studies of vegetated channels have shown a similar reduction in sensitivity to vegetation generated roughness for larger floods compared to smaller flood inputs anderson et al 2006 despite an increased number of interventions at craigburn the observed increase in peak lag time was observed to be less than at middle burn which was attributed to likely variation in barrier physical properties and placement channel gradient and differences in geology surface cover and soil composition black et al 2020 5 2 recommendations for jam design in varying channels identical jams placed in channels of increasing slope would be expected to generate a higher relative backwater rise and backwater volume above base flow v b w v s fig 3 but lower backwater length l b w h j h 0 s for the same set of jams placed with equal spacing in low medium and high slope channels of the same modelled length table 1 fig 8 a more pronounced outflow delay associated with jam presence was observed for the lowest slope site due to higher l b w l s compared to the higher slope cases existing guidance recommending placement at approximately 7 10 channel widths linstead and gurnell 1999 ydrt 2021 in part incorporates the effect of increasing slope as bankfull width is expected to decrease with increasing slope parker et al 2007 however the observed empirical scaling of b b f s 0 4 was weaker than the inverse linear dependence of backwater length on slope parker et al 2007 section 2 4 similarly across the 3 example sites the decrease in bankfull depth was less strong than the decrease in backwater length so that a jam with no lower gap generating h 0 h j 0 5 would generate a backwater length relative to bankfull depth l b w b b f 27 5 and 3 channel widths respectively for sites with s 0 001935 0 008479 0 021467 table 1 when the jam generated upstream depth was equal to the channel bankfull depth jams spaced more closely than l b w max l s 1 had reduced increase in time delay of outflow peak and reduction in peak magnitude with l b w l s suggesting that closer jam spacings than l b w max l s 1 may generate reduced attenuation per jam and provide less value per money however magnitude of time delay of outflow peak and magnitude of reduction in outflow peak magnitude continued to increase for more closely spaced jams until the point at which the jam backwater would have reached the adjacent upstream jam even at the minimum inflow discharge in cases with a simplified model floodplain that allowed for jam overtopping the effect of jams was increased when jam generated upstream depth exceeded bankfull depth for unobstructed sub bankfull discharge values but reduced for discharge values that overtopped the jam reducing jam accumulation factor to delay overtopping and implementing jam installations in conjunction with riparian forest planting or other measures to increase local floodplain resistance black et al 2020 may help to attenuate higher flood levels similarly jams with a lower gap had no effect at discharge levels for which the water depth would not have reached the jam lower edge and reduced outflow peak time delay and reduction in peak magnitude compared to jams with no lower gap however the presence of the lower gap increased the discharge value at which the jam became overtopped allowing a wider upper range of jam generated effect on outflow discharge 5 3 leaky barrier advisor as interest in nature based solutions for natural flood management and sustainable farming has increased interest has grown in sparse input data methods suitable for participatory modelling including incorporation of lay knowledge and site observations collected by farmers government regulators and citizen scientists voinov and bousquet 2010 basco carrera et al 2017 voinov et al 2016 hedelin et al 2021 the simplified 1d network model described in this paper section 3 2 can be used to estimate the effect of jam installations on an inflow hydrograph using channel slope bankfull width and site observations of jam relative gap width a h b f relative h 0 h j or related observations such as the amount of times per year that the channel bank became inundated upstream of the jam relative to downstream or unobstructed flow for sites with unknown bankfull depth d s 50 and bed friction coefficient channel slope and bankfull width can be used to estimate h b f d s 50 and c f 0 eqs 3 5 while the model capabilities lack a catchment scale hydrological model and are limited relative to standard hydraulic modelling software packages model set up time and runtime are reduced and a range of jam and channel properties can be trialled with relatively sparse data input after computing outflow discharge from a given inflow and specified channel and barrier properties inflow and outflow hydrographs are plotted in addition to jam generated upstream water depth as compared to unobstructed uniform flow depth over the range of the inflow hydrograph 5 4 example implementation in hec ras 2d to demonstrate implementation of jams as hydraulic structures and the theoretical maximum effect of jam implementation using the maximum equivalent channel resistance section 4 6 h h j everywhere in the channel modelled and measured outflow

2005 the event is estimated as having an annual exceedance probability of approximately 20 although with such an incised channel in places this does not equate to significant out of bank flow in the

resistance was estimated to equal n 0 0 23 s m 1 3 based on observations of rough channels with scattered wood pieces yochum et al 2014 in separate model runs jams were represented both as individual hydraulic structures and using an effective manning s resistance coefficient using hec ras 2d individual jams were represented as embankments spanning the channel with a custom outlet rating curve assuming the jams acted as channel spanning jams with no lower gap eq 7 a jam accumulation factor of c a 50 was estimated from an available photograph fig 1 a assuming that the structure was approximately 1 m high with five cylindrical logs of equal diameter the estimated c a follett et al 2020 ranged from c a 64 43 depending on chosen inter log gap width of 1 2 cm respectively c a 50 was chosen based on this range yielding a relative ratio of unobstructed flow depth to jam generated upstream depth h 0 h j 0 42 in addition to model runs including individual jams an effective manning s resistance coefficient was chosen n e 0 24 to minimize the difference between outflow modelled with an elevated resistance coefficient and eight individual jams and the limiting maximum resistance n e max 0 68 was computed assuming average channel properties s 0 054 n 0 0 23 s m 1 3 c a 50 with c f 0 related to n 0 assuming a channel bankfull depth of 1 m and average b 5 1 m the hec ras 2d model mesh had an average spacing of 4 m with sub grid topography of 1 m model results are shown for 10 30 march 10 2021 14 45 march 11 2021 following an initial period in which depressions in the 2d domain adjusted to inflow conservation of mass and momentum were solved over the model domain using the diffusion wave approximation of the shallow water equations solution using the full momentum equations was tested but did not significantly alter model results the effect of jams was limited for the site and event considered due to the low maximum discharge maximum q 0 22 m3 s 1 corresponding to h 0 0 125 m in an unobstructed channel high unobstructed channel resistance and small number of jams modelled outflow curves were higher than measured outflow for the rising limb of the initial smaller peak fig 10 t 14 30 16 30 10 march 2021 and lower than measured outflow for the falling limb of the main peak fig 5 t 22 00 10 march 2021 04 30 11 march 2021 the outflow discharge modelled using individual jam hydraulic structures green dash dot line in fig 10 was lower than the measured outflow discharge and curves modelled using a bed resistance fig 5 t 10 30 14 30 17 30 21 00 10 march 2021 01 00 11 30 11 march 2021 which may be due to model uncertainty related to low water depth h 0 0 02 m for uniform flow q 0 005 m3 s 1 and the presence of vertical lower gaps below some jams the discrepancy at low water depths reduced the model nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e 1 t q m q o b s t q o b s q o b s to n s e 0 73 for the model run using eight individually represented jams from n s e 0 78 for the model run using an effective resistance coefficient the analytical maximum resistance n e max 0 68 which was computed assuming h h j everywhere in the channel reduced the outflow peak magnitude q max q max o b s 0 763 and increased time delay t d 0 25 hr to first peak relative to measured outflow showing the maximum possible effect of many jams installed in the channel 6 conclusion logjam representation in hydraulic modelling schemes is used in industry to predict the effects of natural flood management project designs further modelling and empirical studies are needed to assess the performance of engineered logjam installations and interpret field monitoring results while recent results have demonstrated that a jam can be modelled as a porous obstruction generating momentum loss proportional to the number size and packing density of the logs and the jam length providing a physically based stage discharge relationship follett et al 2020 2021 representation of many jams as hydraulic structures increases model set up time and runtime and approximation of jam effects with an increased channel resistance provides a practical alternative addy and wilkinson 2019 field observations suggest that jams increase time delay of the outflow peak and reduce outflow peak magnitude relative to baseline measurements but that a range of effects are present due to dependence on jam and site characteristics including channel slope and bed resistance black et al 2020 to systematically investigate the effect of a series of logjams with varying channel and jam physical properties we represented a rectangular channel containing jams with a 1d network hankin et al 2020 the relative time delay of the outflow peak and relative reduction in peak magnitude increased with number of jams in the channel which increased the relative ratio of backwater length to segment length skewness of the outflow discharge curve initially decreased with increasing relative backwater length to segment length generating an increasingly gradual outflow discharge rising limb as jams became more closely spaced than one backwater length a trapezoidal backwater was generated and the outflow discharge from a series of jams more closely resembled that from a channel with elevated bed resistance the maximum equivalent channel resistance generated by a series of jams would occur when h h j everywhere in the channel generating a relative effective resistance coefficient c f e c f 0 h 0 h j 3 for a series of channel spanning jams with no lower gap the analytical maximum equivalent resistance could be used to quickly estimate the maximum possible effect of a series of jams at a given site although both the best fit equivalent resistance and the deviation of a resistance model from a jam series decline with increased jam spacing the model described in this paper provides a sparse data input option suitable for use with site observations of the relative water depths generated by a jam and estimation of channel slope and bankfull depth which could be used to explore the implications of varying jam spacing and design or estimate the effect of existing jam installations to demonstrate implementation of best fit and maximum elevated channel resistance jams were represented both as individual hydraulic structures and using a best fit elevated resistance in hec ras 2d for penny gill west cumbria uk the theoretical maximum resistance was used to estimate the maximum effect of closely spaced jams on outflow peak delay and attenuation the effect of jams increased with increasing jam generated upstream depth relative to unobstructed water depth h j h 0 which increased with the dimensionless jam accumulation factor c a follett et al 2020 a lower gap reduced outflow peak delay and relative peak reduction with the magnitude of effect increasing with increasing gap height the effect of jams was reduced for cases allowing overflow to the local floodplain represented by a compound channel and jam overtopping for which the effect of jams was most pronounced at discharge levels below bankfull discharge identical jams placed in channels of increasing slope generate a higher relative jam generated upstream depth and backwater volume but lower backwater length so that the effect of an identical jam series was most pronounced for the lowest slope channel considered due to higher relative backwater length jams spaced more closely than l b w max l s 1 had a decreased rate of increase in peak delay and attenuation of outflow discharge peak with increased spacing suggesting that jam spacings much closer than l b w max l s 1 may provide reduced value for money the best fit effective resistance approached the theoretical maximum value when l b w max l s 1 over all inflow discharge values for a jam with constant c a backwater length decreases with increasing slope allowing closer spacing of jams in higher slope channels existing guidance recommending spacing of jams over a multiple of bankfull width likely partially accounts for this effect due to expected decrease in channel width with increasing slope b b f s 0 4 parker et al 2007 the presence of a lower vertical gap below the jam a common engineered logjam design prevented significant delay of flow at levels below the point of inundation of the jam lower edge but increased the discharge value at which the jam would become overtopped causing the jam to influence outflow discharge over a wider range of discharge values software and data

cycles to quantify ghg budgets has gained importance over the last century the increasing rates of co2 ch4 and n2o in the atmosphere represent major drivers of climate change and global warming now and in the future liu and greaver 2009 pasut et al 2021 intensive agricultural practices and the use of n fertilizers have been identified as the main sources of n2o emissions at the global scale current n2o emissions coming from anthropogenic origins are two times larger than natural emissions tian et al 2018 2019 2020 in addition fertilizers are also a major cause of eutrophication of rivers groundwater and oceans smith 2003 modelling of nitrogen transfer from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems boyer et al 2006 is used to quantify nutrient carrying capacity of aquatic ecosystems and resilience asaeda et al 2000 green et al 2004 wetlands play a key role in the global nitrogen cycle adame et al 2019 mart√≠nez espinosa et al 2021 and they have been identified as large scale denitrification hotspots quin et al 2015 thorslund et al 2017 as they carry out complete denitrification pathways reducing no3 to n2 in four stages canfield et al 2010 quantifying where when and how much nitrification and denitrification occurs based only on large scale measurements remains a challenge the relative yield of the intermediates n2o and no is a function of the soil moisture nitrate availability and ph chen et al 2015 therefore models have become essential tools to integrate current knowledge and available data denitrification and nitrification pathways are well understood and a number of different approaches have been used to develop n cycling models adame et al 2019 bakken et al 2012 burgin and groffman 2012 groffman and tiedje 1988 tiedje et al 1989 yet their large scale suitability is still limited wetland soils denitrification model hereafter wsdm was specifically conceived for natural wetlands it is established as a model with rate controlling properties that allows denitrification quantification at a large scale using satellite data despite all the uncertainties represented by satellite data it provides information to produce temporal diurnal resolution multiyear time series and allows access to remote locations all over the globe modelling the mechanisms responsible for terrestrial n2 emissions from natural sources is still limited assessment of global terrestrial n2o emissions from natural sources vary up to a factor 3 and range between 3 3 and 9 0 tgn yr 1 ciais et al 2014 wetlands were estimated to contribute 0 97 0 7 tgn yr 1 of n2o annually from 1981 to 2010 tian et al 2015 later studies reported that natural soils contributed with 5 6 tgn yr 1 in a range of 4 9 6 5 tgn yr 1 and inland waters estuaries and coastal zones contribute with 0 3 tgn yr 1 0 3 0 4 tgn yr 1 tian et al 2020 these annual estimates are insightful when comparing biomes and useful to identify different wetlands entities and their contribution to the global nitrogen cycle yet this assessment does not explain the role of different inland and coastal natural wetlands i e freshwater marshes flooded forest peatlands mangroves and saltmarshes in addition the annual assessment does not show evidence related to the hot moments seasonality investigating inter annual dynamics of denitrification and their relationship with flooding or drought events is relevant for future climate scenarios wsdm aims to contribute to filling this gap investigating denitrification exclusively in natural wetlands and emphasizing the diversity of these ecosystems with spatialized information 3 materials and methods 3 1 wetland soils denitrification model the wsdm was developed specifically for natural wetland ecosystems where complete denitrification occurs adame et al 2019 guilhen et al 2020 mart√≠nez espinosa et al 2021 the wsdm aims to model denitrification processes in wetland soils influenced by three main physical parameters soil moisture temperature and nitrate availability the wsdm model simplifies the denitrification process by forcing available daily spatialized data to enable large scale application a software was developed to harmonize the different databases and to carry out the simulations the model is developed in python programming language using standard scientific computation and visualisation libraries with an open source license the software is developed in a functional approach with separate modules for pre processing simulation and post processing the wsdm model with a brief description is

soil characteristics i e texture bulk density organic carbon content on the other hand dynamic datasets soil moisture and soil temperature will lead the nitrification and denitrification processes before running the physical model a pre processing phase is carried out the user then has to define the region of interest roi giving two latitude and two longitude points indicating roi limits

data on a regular grid soil characteristics database wise30sec batjes 2015 was the reference grid with a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec 1 km2 as well as global lakes and wetlands database glwd 1 km2 lehner and doll 2004 brightness soil temperature and root zone soil moisture data al bitar et mahmoodi 2020 al bitar et al 2017 have an original grid of 25 km2 therefore a linear interpolation using https scipy org scientific python library is computed in every simulation before running the physical model the workflow summary wsdm processes can be seen in fig 1 the physical model has different functions that are explained in the next subsections the limitation of the approach is detailed in the discussion section 3 1 2 nitrification in wsdm nitrification is the first process as it calculates nitrate production the first year of the model run is used for stabilization as the nitrate budget is created at the beginning of the run therefore a minimum of two years of input data is needed nitrification is linked to the stock and evolution of organic matter in the soil together they define soil fertility transported nitrates i e agricultural sources are not considered in this first version nitrate production eq 1 is modelled as follows 1 n o 3 n i t n o r g k 2 f s m where n o 3 n i t corresponds to the nitrates produced by nitrification in the local soil mgn kg 1 day 1 given by n o r g organic nitrogen in soil mgn kg 1 eq 2 2 n o r g c o r g c n where o r g c is the organic carbon in soil gc kg 1 and c n is the ratio of carbon and nitrogen the destruction of humus by mineralization varies depending on the soil typology texture and bacteria activity expressed by the k 2 coefficient calculated from the quantity of stable humus in the soil the rate of mineralization is always higher in warm humid climates and varies from 0 5 to 3 to adjust the k 2 coefficient according to soil texture and temperature eq 3 we used the model proposed for clay soils by girard et al 2011 3 k 2 1200 c 200 0 3 c a c o 3 200 œÅ b 0 2 m a t 10 where c and caco3 correspond to the clay and carbonate content gc kg 1 respectively œÅ b is the bulk density kg dm 3 and mat mean annual temperature c the coefficients are conversion unit factors the third term f s m represents soil saturation factor eq 4 defined as follows f s m s m i s m r e s s m s a t s m r e s 4 i f f

that saturates each particular soil a threshold indicating nitrification can only happen when aerobic conditions are guaranteed this function f s m will be used for denitrification eq 5 but conditioned inversely 3 1 3 denitrification denitrification function on wsdm was structured as the nemis model eq 5 h√©nault and germon 2000 adapting the multi component method berner 1980 where diurnal denitrification eq 6 is given by the potential denitrification weighted by three main parameters i e nitrate availability soil moisture and temperature adapted as follows 5 d i v d p f n f s m

first adapted for the hyporheic zone by peyrard et al 2011 it was then modified and tested at larger scale to calculate the dynamic potential denitrification of flooded areas using satellite data guilhen et al 2020 and subsequently for daily denitrification quantification on floodplain areas in different watersheds under tropical temperate and arctic conditions fabre et al 2020 these advances were key evidence to adopt this denitrification model into the wsdm as follows 6 d p 0 8 x œÅ b 1 œÜ œÜ k o c o r g c where d p is the potential denitrification rate in mole n dm 3 d 1 0 8 x

for wetland ecosystems in the present study 3 1 4 half saturation constant k n o 3 the half saturation constant is integrated in the denitrification model in a michaelis menten type function that limits the denitrification capacity and is related to nitrate quantity peyrard et al 2011 to adjust this value to wetland ecosystems eq 9 the k n o 3 constant was calibrated experimentally in the present study appendix experimental methodology using the emission results appendix table a3 as follows 9 a d i d p where a is a relation factor between d p mgn kg 1 potential denitrification and d i mgn kg 1 is the control denitrification of the same soil with no addition of nutritive solution this factor then is substituted as f n eq 7 which allows the k n o 3 to be calculated as follows 10 k n o 3 n o 3 i a n o 3 i where k n o 3 mgn kg 1 is the half saturation denitrification constant cleared out from the saturation equation 7 using a the unitless relation factor calculated above as the known f n then the mean k n o 3 value for all the samples was established as the wetland ecosystems constant table 2 the second term f s m represents the soil saturation factor explained above eq 3 conditioned as follows i f f s m 0 7 n o 3 d e n i t 0 where a threshold indicating denitrification trigger was set at f s m 0 7 as denitrification can only happen when there is 70 of water in the soil pores bateman and baggs 2005 the third term defines temperature impact on denitrification eq 11 11 f t e t i t o p t 2 t i t o p t where t i is the temperature of the given day and t o p t is the optimal temperature for denitrification established as 25 c in natural ecosystems billen et al 2018 denitrification d i v obtained from these equations is volume based mole n dm 3 d 1 in order to integrate the result to the wsdm a conversion from volume to mass eq 12 was applied as follows 12 d i m d i v m m n 1000 œÅ b 1 œÜ œÜ where d i m is expressed in mgn kg 1 day 1 m m n is the nitrogen molar mass g 1000 is the conversion factor g to mg œÅ b is the bulk density kg dm 3 œÜ is the porosity unitless nitrate budget in the soil eq 13 is calculated by integrating nitrification and denitrification processes defined as follows 13 n o 3 i 1 n o 3 i 1 n o 3 i n i t Œ¥ t n o 3 i d e n i t Œ¥ t where n o 3 i 1 mgn kg 1 is the nitrates available in the day i 1 given by n o 3 i 1 mgn

here 30 cm was used as a constant depth of the active layer 3 1 5 n2o n2 ratio outgassing n2o emissions are highly variable in space and time and there has not been a consensus on a methodology that responds to bottom up or top down scales however as scale increases so does the agreement between estimates based on soil surface measurements bottom up approach and estimates derived from changes in atmospheric concentration of n2o top down approach grosso et al 2008 the ipcc provides guidelines for estimating regional and global n2o emissions which are calculated by multiplying n loading with the indirect emission factors ef ipcc 1996 the indirect n2o emission factor associated with n leaching and runoff ef5 kg n2o n per kg of n o 3 n incorporates three components i groundwater and surface drainage ef5g ii rivers ef5r iii and estuaries ef5e in the last ippc report 2019 the ef5r and ef5e were adapted to 0 26 according to 91 data observations compiled by tian et al 2019 and a mean value of the ef5g for ground and surface drainage was 0 60 n2o emissions can be influenced by several factors yet to avoid adding up uncertainties we applied the constant ratios table 2 proposed for freshwater wetlands for flooded soils and by the ipcc applied by guilhen et al 2020 on the amazon basin the previously explained functions are the structure of the wsdm the variables acronyms units and description are summarised in table 1 likewise for constants presented in table 2 3 2 wetland soils denitrification model validation the amazon basin was selected as it is considered to have the optimal denitrification conditions with a mean annual temperature of 26 6 c with little variations average rainfall is 2100 mm per year ribeiro and adis 1984 amazonian floodplains are directly linked to the lateral flood pulses junk et al 1989 keizer et al 2014 it has a very regular annual bimodal flood pulse that defines a zonation along the flooding gradient of the central amazon floodplains kubitzki 1989 the amazon river discharges roughly fifteen to twenty percent of the world s annual continental freshwater into the ocean pek√°rov√° et al 2003 and amazonian floodplain forests cover an area of more than 97 000 km2 hamilton et al 2002 dimensions of this basin reflect the meaning of water movement and abundance in life shaping global biogeochemical cycles v√∂r√∂smarty et al 1989 to calibrate k n o 3 and validate the wsdm a field campaign in the central amazonian floodplain from 14th to 24th february 2020 was carried out to collect soil samples at eight sampling sites the sampling points were distributed on the three main tributaries negro river solim√µes river and madeira river with different water qualities in each river the two main wetland typologies i e freshwater marshes and flooded forests were sampled as shown in fig 2 the model validation was carried out in three steps a static denitrification validation comparing modelled potential denitrification and experimental denitrifier enzyme activity hereafter dea results dea was measured using acetylene inhibition technique ait as described and applied in several studies balderston et al 1976 koschorreck and darwich 2003 tiedje et al 1984 1989 detailed methodology applied in this study is presented in appendix experimental methodology b dynamic denitrification validation nitrates soil budget and denitrification events were modelled using soil moisture and temperature diurnal satellite input data from 2011 2019 extracted at the eight sampling points annual denitrification rates are presented in the appendix table a4 c n 2 o n 2 ratio validation rn2o 0 02 proposed for freshwater wetlands by scheer et al 2020 was applied to yearly denitrification wsdm values for each soil sample appendix table a5 n2o range emissions were calculated for freshwater wetlands and compared with other studies in order to validate the wsdm total denitrification assessment appendix table a2 4 results 4 1 static denitrification validation to illustrate the performance of the wsdm and the behaviour regarding the three main physical parameters three soil sample results each from three different effluents negro river n1 solim√µes river s2 madeira river m2 are presented in the following figures fig 3 a shows the soil saturation gradient fig 3b the temperature gradient with 25 c as the optimal temperature and 4 c as the activation temperature and fig 3c shows the soil nitrate pool complete modelled results for each sampling soil are compared to observed denitrification rates in laboratory controlled conditions appendix table a2 the observations and model outputs have a good fit p value 0 001 pbias 4 15 where pbias is the percent bias between model and observation yapo et al 1996 dea and modelled maximal denitrification have a pearson coefficient of 0 68 with a p value 0 05 4 2 dynamic denitrification validation three sampling points negro river n1 solim√µes river s2 madeira river m2 are shown as an example fig 4 a c these time series show that each sampling point has different soil moisture dynamics for instance m2 the sampling point influenced by madeira river fig 4b has an annual bimodal inundation dynamic with one important denitrification event per year when soil moisture is very low nitrification becomes inactive and the nitrates soil budget of the soil stays constant low soil moisture events are present in 2012 2015 and 2016 in the three wetland areas influenced by the three rivers when the flooding of the plains begins the nitrate budget is rapidly consumed in the case of the negro river n1 and solim√µes river s2 soil saturation events are more frequent so the nitrate budget is consumed faster and there are more denitrification events per year 4 3 n2o n2 ratio validation the modelled annual denitrifications from 2012 to 2019 calculated in each sample site are grouped by wetland typology the resulted emissions after applying the three different rn2o from literature are compared with other studies in order to validate the wsdm total denitrification assessment table 3 yearly wsdm denitrification results for each soil sample are presented in appendix table a5 5 discussion 5 1 model performance with respect to field data the eight soil samples analysed are heterogeneous with soil properties ranging from low organic carbon content mineral soils to rich organic soils even though the study area is small compared with the amazon watershed dimension the freshwater marshes and flooded forests the main freshwater wetland typologies of this basin were sampled in each of the three main tributaries i e negro solim√µes and madeira rivers this study is not intended to better understand denitrification in the amazon but to use amazon soils as examples of freshwater wetlands flooded forests and freshwater marshes under conditions of low anthropogenic impact with a bimodal hydrological cycle these samples were key to calibrate the wsdm and were intended to model complete denitrification rates on a large scale considering wetland heterogeneity i e soil characteristics and wetland typology as well as physical dynamics i e temperature and soil moisture wsdm is built up in a binary assumption which does not allow nitrification to happen at the same time as denitrification in the same point fixing a soil moisture threshold this may not be true when looking at the microscale as the soil structure and the root zone has some oxygen available most of the time during wet periods the anoxic conditions trigger three different processes denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnra and anammox the wsdm in its current configuration does not simulate these two processes and considers denitrification as the main path in wetlands this assumption is endorsed by previous studies adame et al 2019 due to the lack of in situ data of n2o emissions in the selected area of interest experiments were carried out in controlled conditions optimal temperature and saturation allowing bacterial activity to be isolated and quantify nitrate consumption exclusively this experimentation was key for the calibration and validation of the wsdm simulated denitrification has a good fit pbias 4 15 compared with denitrification values observed in controlled laboratory conditions i e optimal temperature saturated soil and limited nitrates appendix table a2 flooded forest samples influenced by negro river n1 n3 have high organic carbon content yet the recorded emissions are not similar the difference lies in the concentration of nitrates in the soil when there is a nitrate surplus in soils the enzyme nosz in charge of converting the n2o to n2 the last step of denitrification is withdrawn glass and silverstein 1999 this withdrawal is frequently observed in agricultural fields where fertilizers are added and the type of irrigation used is flooding burgin and groffman 2012 liu and greaver 2009 flooded forest soil sample n1 influenced by the negro river located downstream of the city of manaus recorded a n2o emission rate of 0 32 0 1 gn kg 1 h 1 which is two times higher than four of the other soil samples n3 s1 m1 and m2 these four sites register a ratio that favours n2 on the other hand flooded forest n3 registered the highest n2 emission rate 0 23 0 02 g n kg 1 h 1 n1 and n3 samples are examples of high potential denitrification rates of amazonian wetland soils extensive fertilizer use in this watershed will have a negative effect in wetland denitrification as the concentration of nitrates from exogenous sources will increase the budget of nitrates produced by nitrification that in turn will increase denitrification event intensity fold 4 and n2o emissions weier et al 1993 blackmer and bremner 1978 p√§rn et al 2021 a surplus of nitrates also affects ecosystem functionality promotes eutrophication and biodiversity may be threatened huang et al 2017 smith 2003 despite the importance of quantifying anthropogenic influence in natural wetlands this version of the wsdm does not aim to calculate denitrification rates of anthropogenic input effects but to identify physical parameters that shape the denitrification capacity of each wetland ecosystem and assess these dynamics the major contribution of wsdm is that simulated denitrification is influenced by wetland vegetation typology the influence of the vegetation in wetlands has been reported previously by alldred and baines 2016 they calculated that the presence of plants increased denitrification rates by 55 on average but they also acknowledged the need to differentiate plant communities the wsdm modelled these two factors including a wetland typology that assumes a classification of wetland ecosystems based on their vegetation structure i e trees or herbs the link between vegetation and bacterial processes such as denitrification can be delicate the interaction occurs in the root areas on a very local scale and depends on many physical and chemical aspects denitrification emission ratio depends on many local variables and it can exhibit drastic changes i e ph nitrate concentration acetylene inhibition technique ait has limitations regarding the n2o n2 emission ratio and it has been shown to be inaccurate when recording low denitrification rates such as in groundwater nevertheless ait allows an estimation of total denitrification at high temporal resolution and on small spatial scales with limited workload and costs involved felber et al 2012 a stable isotope approach might have been a preferable method to identify n2 emissions however we had uncertainty concerning detection limits and how well the enriched solution would be distributed through the soil column therefore in the case of the wsdm the optimal compromise between accuracy and the available information was to link wetland typology to carbon decomposition rate koc this immediately implies the presence of bacterial community activity and integrates the different kinds of organic matter available this correlation was validated with the denitrification rates observed in laboratory analysis confirming that flooded forest samples had higher denitrification rates than freshwater marshes both in optimal conditions 5 2 comparison with earlier modelling approaches the precedent denitrification model estimates a total denitrification n2 n n2o n rate in the amazon floodplains from 38 8 to 142 5 kgn ha 1 yr 1 with a spatial grid of 25 km2 guilhen et al 2020 the wsdm has a wider range 20 36 315 90 kgn ha 1 yr 1 this difference is a consequence of model set up the current version is sensitive to different organic carbon decomposition rates soil moisture gradient as well as nitrate limitation calculated in 1 km2 grid constraints that were missing in the previous version the wsdm assumed that annual input flux of carbon is greater than losses respiration harvesting export burial consequently carbon budget is set constant but not unlimited other studies modelled variable carbon input fabre et al 2020 guilhen et al 2020 peyrard et al 2011 showing that carbon is not a limiting factor but it can enhance the denitrification signal this assumption is compensated by the mineralization rate of organic carbon koc which is specific for each kind of simplified wetland ecosystem typology the current wsdm version does not calculate n2o n2 ratio yet the different n2o rate productions table 3 suggest that ratio 0 02 for freshwater wetlands proposed by scheer et al 2020 applied to the wsdm denitrification results gives a n2o n total contribution within the range of what has been reported in low impacted amazonian soils by other studies this estimation should be taken as an indicator and could be improved by field measurements with other methodologies as 15n isotopic tracers bergsma et al 2001 additionally p√§rn et al 2021 reported by in situ measurements that the peruvian palm peat swamp is a hot spot and that the emission ratios change depending on the season they reported that march the main peak has low n2o emissions and very high n2 potential on the other hand in september the emission rate has a higher n2o production ratio the same pattern was observed in the modelled time series regarding the activation of denitrification however the wsdm in the current version does not calculate seasonal n2o n2 ratios but this evidence could serve for developing a n2o n2 ratio function relevant research has been done on this topic the global n2o model intercomparison project tian et al 2018 presented on a large scale spatialized global scale n2o estimate by making a comparative study of a dozen hydrodynamic models that model the global nitrogen and carbon cycles the resulting model the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem assesses the pre industrial emissions co2 ch4 and n2o and the current trends on a yearly monthly and daily basis from 1901 to 2010 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 this model exposes the anthropogenic impact main pollution sources and the consequences on the biosphere this model also takes into account different ecosystems and divides wetlands into four categories seasonal grass wetlands seasonal forest wetlands permanent grass wetlands and permanent forest wetlands likewise dndc denitrification decomposition model is a powerful tool to evaluate n2o production consumption and transport in agricultural soils it was later modified and adapted to other ecosystems wetland dndc gilhespy et al 2014 was adapted to calculate carbon emissions co2 and ch4 these two models have been improved by the scientific community for several years and they are currently a very robust approach to local ghg emissions and water dynamics both models have an empirical base that operate at watershed scale and demand copious input datasets that may not be available for all tropical wetlands wsdm is complementary to both models taking into account different wetland ecosystems based on the vegetation structure but with a simplified approach that is useful on a large scale the results are given in terms of total denitrification aiming to contribute with a particular vision of natural wetlands and their positive role in the global nitrogen cycle this natural wetland function via complete denitrification is often overlooked the total denitrification accounts for non harmful emissions n2 which implies the subtraction of nitrate flux into aquatic ecosystems i e rivers lakes coastal areas 6 conclusion the main contribution of wsdm is that it considers wetland diversity and calculates denitrification in a diurnal basis while remaining parsimonious giving a dynamic spatialized assessment that identifies hot moments and hot spots wsdm total denitrification can be used as an indicator tool for prioritizing conservation areas or wetland ecosystems that must be studied in depth the wsdm was developed with a large scale approach as it does not require a watershed based model the main drivers of the model are soil moisture and temperature input data which have been identified as key for modelling the nitrate budget and denitrification activation deactivation dynamics on a diurnal basis modelling these dynamics is essential in wetland areas where field data is not yet available these results may be indicators of possible scenarios when the anomalies will repeat and or intensify in the future this model can be applied at different scales continents or regions as well as in different

each soil type were divided into three 125 ml glass flasks having 20 g per flask n 3 each soil type biological activity was re established in stored soils by incubating them for 48 h at 25 c and 20 ml of deoxygenated water was added having a saturated water filled pore space each container was sealed with a screw up lid in which a septum had been fitted for gas sampling weight of the glass flasks before and after adding the soil sample and water were taken the gas chromatograph was used in parallel with the g200 n2o device for quantifying n2o emission from soil activity in the control records as emissions were low for the potential denitrification concentrations recorded were within the recording range of the real time device g200 1 ppm therefore it was used as the only reading device for the rest of the experiments to achieve potential denitrification rates soil cores were incubated during 3 h at 25 c under anaerobic conditions replacing the headspace with helium he 20 ml of acetylene c2h2 was added to each flask at the beginning of incubation to identify the nitrate soil saturation linked to potential denitrification five different treatments with progression of nutrient solutions

were left for 24 h in aerated conditions before applying the next treatment once all the treatments were completed the flasks were dried out in an oven at 100 c for 24h after that the weight of each flask was measured the dry samples were sieved and 2 g of these homogenized samples were ignited at 500 c for 24h to obtain the organic matter content by weight difference pore space and bulk density were determined gravimetrically on volume samples assuming a measured particle density of 2 613 g cm 3 potential denitrification rates were calculated from the linear increase of the n2o content in the flask and expressed as Œºg n2o g 1 h 1 all data is expressed per gram of sediment on a dry basis the total n2o production eq 1 was calculated by the n2o gas g fraction and n2o liquid l fraction

with acetylene and d s is the dry soil weight g when acetylene is applied then the n2o ratio recorded is k n n 2 o n 2 which is the sum of n2 and n2o and is also expressed in Œºg n g 1 h 1 then k n n

25498,the wetland soils denitrification model wsdm developed here for natural wetlands is a physical based model that proposes i the inclusion of soil moisture and temperature from satellite based earth observations at diurnal temporal resolution and ii the distinction of soils under different wetland typologies i e flooded forests freshwater marshes brackish wetlands peatlands and complex wetlands despite uncertainties involved these two features are key to upscale nitrification denitrification dynamics in natural wetlands at landscape regional and global scales in this study the performance of wsdm was validated with soils in flooded forests and freshwater marshes in the central amazonian floodplain wsdm multiannual time series 2012 2019 show that climate anomalies intensify

cycles to quantify ghg budgets has gained importance over the last century the increasing rates of co2 ch4 and n2o in the atmosphere represent major drivers of climate change and global warming now and in the future liu and greaver 2009 pasut et al 2021 intensive agricultural practices and the use of n fertilizers have been identified as the main sources of n2o emissions at the global scale current n2o emissions coming from anthropogenic origins are two times larger than natural emissions tian et al 2018 2019 2020 in addition fertilizers are also a major cause of eutrophication of rivers groundwater and oceans smith 2003 modelling of nitrogen transfer from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems boyer et al 2006 is used to quantify nutrient carrying capacity of aquatic ecosystems and resilience asaeda et al 2000 green et al 2004 wetlands play a key role in the global nitrogen cycle adame et al 2019 mart√≠nez espinosa et al 2021 and they have been identified as large scale denitrification hotspots quin et al 2015 thorslund et al 2017 as they carry out complete denitrification pathways reducing no3 to n2 in four stages canfield et al 2010 quantifying where when and how much nitrification and denitrification occurs based only on large scale measurements remains a challenge the relative yield of the intermediates n2o and no is a function of the soil moisture nitrate availability and ph chen et al 2015 therefore models have become essential tools to integrate current knowledge and available data denitrification and nitrification pathways are well understood and a number of different approaches have been used to develop n cycling models adame et al 2019 bakken et al 2012 burgin and groffman 2012 groffman and tiedje 1988 tiedje et al 1989 yet their large scale suitability is still limited wetland soils denitrification model hereafter wsdm was specifically conceived for natural wetlands it is established as a model with rate controlling properties that allows denitrification quantification at a large scale using satellite data despite all the uncertainties represented by satellite data it provides information to produce temporal diurnal resolution multiyear time series and allows access to remote locations all over the globe modelling the mechanisms responsible for terrestrial n2 emissions from natural sources is still limited assessment of global terrestrial n2o emissions from natural sources vary up to a factor 3 and range between 3 3 and 9 0 tgn yr 1 ciais et al 2014 wetlands were estimated to contribute 0 97 0 7 tgn yr 1 of n2o annually from 1981 to 2010 tian et al 2015 later studies reported that natural soils contributed with 5 6 tgn yr 1 in a range of 4 9 6 5 tgn yr 1 and inland waters estuaries and coastal zones contribute with 0 3 tgn yr 1 0 3 0 4 tgn yr 1 tian et al 2020 these annual estimates are insightful when comparing biomes and useful to identify different wetlands entities and their contribution to the global nitrogen cycle yet this assessment does not explain the role of different inland and coastal natural wetlands i e freshwater marshes flooded forest peatlands mangroves and saltmarshes in addition the annual assessment does not show evidence related to the hot moments seasonality investigating inter annual dynamics of denitrification and their relationship with flooding or drought events is relevant for future climate scenarios wsdm aims to contribute to filling this gap investigating denitrification exclusively in natural wetlands and emphasizing the diversity of these ecosystems with spatialized information 3 materials and methods 3 1 wetland soils denitrification model the wsdm was developed specifically for natural wetland ecosystems where complete denitrification occurs adame et al 2019 guilhen et al 2020 mart√≠nez espinosa et al 2021 the wsdm aims to model denitrification processes in wetland soils influenced by three main physical parameters soil moisture temperature and nitrate availability the wsdm model simplifies the denitrification process by forcing available daily spatialized data to enable large scale application a software was developed to harmonize the different databases and to carry out the simulations the model is developed in python programming language using standard scientific computation and visualisation libraries with an open source license the software is developed in a functional approach with separate modules for pre processing simulation and post processing the wsdm model with a brief description is available at https framagit org ahmad albitar wsdm 3 1 1 model implementation wsdm needs two kinds of spatialized data on one hand static datasets define the wetland typology and extension and the soil characteristics i e texture bulk density organic carbon content on the other hand dynamic datasets soil moisture and soil temperature will lead the nitrification and denitrification processes before running the physical model a pre processing phase is carried out the user then has to define the region of interest roi giving two latitude and two longitude points indicating roi limits followed by the starting and end date of the simulation period once these criteria are established simulation is launched spatial harmonization of databases is the first step to have n dimensional data on a regular grid soil characteristics database wise30sec batjes 2015 was the reference grid with a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec 1 km2 as well as global lakes and wetlands database glwd 1 km2 lehner and doll 2004 brightness soil temperature and root zone soil moisture data al bitar et mahmoodi 2020 al bitar et al 2017 have an original grid of 25 km2 therefore a linear interpolation using https scipy org scientific python library is computed in every simulation before running the physical model the workflow summary wsdm processes can be seen in fig 1 the physical model has different functions that are explained in the next subsections the limitation of the approach is detailed in the discussion section 3 1 2 nitrification in wsdm nitrification is the first process as it calculates nitrate production the first year of the model run is used for stabilization as the nitrate budget is created at the beginning of the run therefore a minimum of two years of input data is needed nitrification is linked to the stock and evolution of organic matter in the soil together they define soil fertility transported nitrates i e agricultural sources are not considered in this first version nitrate production eq 1 is modelled as follows 1 n o 3 n i t n o r g k 2 f s m where n o 3 n i t corresponds to the nitrates produced by nitrification in the local soil mgn kg 1 day 1 given by n o r g organic nitrogen in soil mgn kg 1 eq 2 2 n o r g c o r g c n where o r g c is the organic carbon in soil gc kg 1 and c n is the ratio of carbon and nitrogen the destruction of humus by mineralization varies depending on the soil typology texture and bacteria activity expressed by the k 2 coefficient calculated from the quantity of stable humus in the soil the rate of mineralization is always higher in warm humid climates and varies from 0 5 to 3 to adjust the k 2 coefficient according to soil texture and temperature eq 3 we used the model proposed for clay soils by girard et al 2011 3 k 2 1200 c 200 0 3 c a c o 3 200 œÅ b 0 2 m a t 10 where c and caco3 correspond to the clay and carbonate content gc kg 1 respectively œÅ b is the bulk density kg dm 3 and mat mean annual temperature c the coefficients are conversion unit factors the third term f s m represents soil saturation factor eq 4 defined as follows f s m s m i s m r e s s m s a t s m r e s 4 i f f s m 0 7 n o 3 n i t 0 where s m i is the soil moisture of day i m3 m 3 s m r e s is the lowest soil moisture that allows the reaction to happen and s m s a t m3 m 3 is the highest soil moisture value that saturates each particular soil a threshold indicating nitrification can only happen when aerobic conditions are guaranteed this function f s m will be used for denitrification eq 5 but conditioned inversely 3 1 3 denitrification denitrification function on wsdm was structured as the nemis model eq 5 h√©nault and germon 2000 adapting the multi component method berner 1980 where diurnal denitrification eq 6 is given by the potential denitrification weighted by three main parameters i e nitrate availability soil moisture and temperature adapted as follows 5 d i v d p f n f s m f t where d i v is the denitrification rate in a day i d p is the potential denitrification rate in mole n dm 3 d 1 calculated from the first order kinetic model hunter et al 1998 this model eq 5 was first adapted for the hyporheic zone by peyrard et al 2011 it was then modified and tested at larger scale to calculate the dynamic potential denitrification of flooded areas using satellite data guilhen et al 2020 and subsequently for daily denitrification quantification on floodplain areas in different watersheds under tropical temperate and arctic conditions fabre et al 2020 these advances were key evidence to adopt this denitrification model into the wsdm as follows 6 d p 0 8 x œÅ b 1 œÜ œÜ k o c o r g c where d p is the potential denitrification rate in mole n dm 3 d 1 0 8 x represents the stoichiometric proportion of nitrates consumed in denitrification compared to the organic matter used with x 5 œÅ b is the bulk density kg dm 3 œÜ is the porosity unitless k o c d 1 is organic carbon mineralization constant define for each wetland typology table 2 o r g c mole kg 1 is the organic carbon available in the soil d p is different for each wetland typology and regulated in function of three main parameters these three unitless functions range from zero to optimal conditions one first f n represents nitrate soil availability eq 7 7 f n n o 3 i n o 3 i k n o 3 where f n depends on the nitrate soil concentration n o 3 i mgn kg 1 and bacteria denitrification capacity defined on the k n o 3 a half saturation constant for denitrification this constant was calibrated for wetland ecosystems in the present study 3 1 4 half saturation constant k n o 3 the half saturation constant is integrated in the denitrification model in a michaelis menten type function that limits the denitrification capacity and is related to nitrate quantity peyrard et al 2011 to adjust this value to wetland ecosystems eq 9 the k n o 3 constant was calibrated experimentally in the present study appendix experimental methodology using the emission results appendix table a3 as follows 9 a d i d p where a is a relation factor between d p mgn kg 1 potential denitrification and d i mgn kg 1 is the control denitrification of the same soil with no addition of nutritive solution this factor then is substituted as f n eq 7 which allows the k n o 3 to be calculated as follows 10 k n o 3 n o 3 i a n o 3 i where k n o 3 mgn kg 1 is the half saturation denitrification constant cleared out from the saturation equation 7 using a the unitless relation factor calculated above as the known f n then the mean k n o 3 value for all the samples was established as the wetland ecosystems constant table 2 the second term f s m represents the soil saturation factor explained above eq 3 conditioned as follows i f f s m 0 7 n o 3 d e n i t 0 where a threshold indicating denitrification trigger was set at f s m 0 7 as denitrification can only happen when there is 70 of water in the soil pores bateman and baggs 2005 the third term defines temperature impact on denitrification eq 11 11 f t e t i t o p t 2 t i t o p t where t i is the temperature of the given day and t o p t is the optimal temperature for denitrification established as 25 c in natural ecosystems billen et al 2018 denitrification d i v obtained from these equations is volume based mole n dm 3 d 1 in order to integrate the result to the wsdm a conversion from volume to mass eq 12 was applied as follows 12 d i m d i v m m n 1000 œÅ b 1 œÜ œÜ where d i m is expressed in mgn kg 1 day 1 m m n is the nitrogen molar mass g 1000 is the conversion factor g to mg œÅ b is the bulk density kg dm 3 œÜ is the porosity unitless nitrate budget in the soil eq 13 is calculated by integrating nitrification and denitrification processes defined as follows 13 n o 3 i 1 n o 3 i 1 n o 3 i n i t Œ¥ t n o 3 i d e n i t Œ¥ t where n o 3 i 1 mgn kg 1 is the nitrates available in the day i 1 given by n o 3 i 1 mgn

consumed by denitrification on the same day i and Œ¥ t day to denote the time span this function is activated at the end of each day before starting the loop wsdm continues the simulation until the end of the defined period transformation of denitrification rates from mass to area eq 14 was calculated as follows 14 d e n i t k g h a n o 3 i d e n i t œÅ b s o i l a c t where d e n i t k g h a is the total denitrification n2o n n2 n estimation in kgn ha 1 day 1 given by n o 3 i d e n i t mgn kg 1 nitrates consumed œÅ b is the bulk density kg dm 3 s o i l a c t refers to the active soil layer here 30 cm was used as a constant depth of the active layer 3 1 5 n2o n2 ratio outgassing n2o emissions are highly variable in space and time and there has not been a consensus on a methodology that responds to bottom up or top down scales however as scale increases so does the agreement between estimates based on soil surface measurements bottom up approach and estimates derived from changes in atmospheric concentration of n2o top down approach grosso et al 2008 the ipcc provides guidelines for estimating regional and global n2o emissions which are calculated by multiplying n loading with the indirect emission factors ef ipcc 1996 the indirect n2o emission factor associated with n leaching and runoff ef5 kg n2o n per kg of n o 3 n incorporates three components i groundwater and surface drainage ef5g ii rivers ef5r iii and estuaries ef5e in the last ippc report 2019 the ef5r and ef5e were adapted to 0 26 according to 91 data observations compiled by tian et al 2019 and a mean value of the ef5g for ground and surface drainage was 0 60 n2o emissions can be influenced by several factors yet to avoid adding up uncertainties we applied the constant ratios table 2 proposed for freshwater wetlands for flooded soils and by the ipcc applied by guilhen et al 2020 on the amazon basin the previously explained functions are the structure of the wsdm the variables acronyms units and description are summarised in table 1 likewise for constants presented in table 2 3 2 wetland soils denitrification model validation the amazon basin was selected as it is considered to have the optimal denitrification conditions with a mean annual temperature of 26 6 c with little variations average rainfall is 2100 mm per year ribeiro and adis 1984 amazonian floodplains are directly linked to the lateral flood pulses junk et al 1989 keizer et al 2014 it has a very regular annual bimodal flood pulse that defines a zonation along the flooding gradient of the central amazon floodplains kubitzki 1989 the amazon river discharges roughly fifteen to twenty percent of the world s annual continental freshwater into the ocean pek√°rov√° et al 2003 and amazonian floodplain forests cover an area of more than 97 000 km2 hamilton et al 2002 dimensions of this basin reflect the meaning of water movement and abundance in life shaping global biogeochemical cycles v√∂r√∂smarty et al 1989 to calibrate k n o 3 and validate the wsdm a field campaign in the central amazonian floodplain from 14th to 24th february 2020 was carried out to collect soil samples at eight sampling sites the sampling points were distributed on the three main tributaries negro river solim√µes river and madeira river with different water qualities in each river the two main wetland typologies i e freshwater marshes and flooded forests were sampled as shown in fig 2 the model validation was carried out in three steps a static denitrification validation comparing modelled potential denitrification and experimental denitrifier enzyme activity hereafter dea results dea was measured using acetylene inhibition technique ait as described and applied in several studies balderston et al 1976 koschorreck

static denitrification validation to illustrate the performance of the wsdm and the behaviour regarding the three main physical parameters three soil sample results each from three different effluents negro river n1 solim√µes river s2 madeira river m2 are presented in the following figures fig 3 a shows the soil saturation gradient fig 3b the temperature gradient with 25 c as the optimal temperature and 4 c as the activation temperature and fig 3c shows the soil nitrate pool complete modelled results for each sampling soil are compared to observed denitrification rates in laboratory controlled conditions appendix table a2 the observations and model outputs have a good fit p value 0 001 pbias 4 15 where pbias is the percent bias between model and observation yapo et al 1996 dea and modelled maximal denitrification have a pearson coefficient of 0 68 with a p value 0 05 4 2 dynamic denitrification validation three sampling points negro river n1 solim√µes river s2 madeira river m2 are shown as an example fig 4 a c these time series show that each sampling point has different soil moisture dynamics for instance m2 the sampling point influenced by madeira river fig 4b has an annual bimodal inundation dynamic with one important denitrification event per year when soil moisture is very low nitrification becomes inactive and the nitrates soil budget of the soil stays constant low soil moisture events are present in 2012 2015 and 2016 in the three wetland areas influenced by the three rivers when the flooding of the plains begins the nitrate budget is rapidly consumed in the case of the negro river n1 and solim√µes river s2 soil saturation events are more frequent so the nitrate budget is consumed faster and there are more denitrification events per year 4 3 n2o n2 ratio validation the modelled annual denitrifications from 2012 to 2019 calculated in each sample site are grouped by wetland typology the resulted emissions after applying the three different rn2o from literature are compared with other studies in order to validate the wsdm total denitrification assessment table 3 yearly wsdm denitrification results for each soil sample are presented in appendix table a5 5 discussion 5 1 model performance with respect to field data the eight soil samples analysed are heterogeneous with soil properties ranging from low organic carbon content mineral soils to rich organic soils even though the study area is small compared with the amazon watershed dimension the freshwater marshes and flooded forests the main freshwater wetland typologies of this basin were sampled in each of the three main tributaries i e negro solim√µes and madeira rivers this study is not intended to better understand denitrification in the amazon but to use amazon soils as examples of freshwater wetlands flooded forests and freshwater marshes under conditions of low anthropogenic impact with a bimodal hydrological cycle these samples were key to calibrate the wsdm and were intended to model complete denitrification rates on a large scale considering wetland heterogeneity i e soil characteristics and wetland typology as well as physical dynamics i e temperature and soil moisture wsdm is built up in a binary assumption which does not allow nitrification to happen at the same time as denitrification in the same point fixing a soil moisture threshold this may not be true when looking at the microscale as the soil structure and the root zone has some oxygen available most of the time during wet periods the anoxic conditions trigger three different processes denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnra and anammox the wsdm in its current configuration does not simulate these two processes and considers denitrification as the main path in wetlands this assumption is endorsed by previous studies adame et al 2019 due to the lack of in situ data of n2o emissions in the selected area of interest experiments were carried out in controlled conditions optimal temperature and saturation allowing bacterial activity to be isolated and quantify nitrate consumption exclusively this experimentation was key for the calibration and validation of the wsdm simulated denitrification has a good fit pbias 4 15 compared with denitrification values observed in controlled laboratory conditions i e optimal temperature saturated soil and limited nitrates appendix table a2 flooded forest samples influenced by negro river n1 n3 have high organic carbon content yet the recorded emissions are not similar the difference lies in the concentration of nitrates in the soil when there is a nitrate surplus in soils the enzyme nosz in charge of converting the n2o to n2 the last step of denitrification is withdrawn glass and silverstein 1999 this withdrawal is frequently observed in agricultural fields where fertilizers are added and the type of irrigation used is flooding burgin and groffman 2012 liu and greaver 2009 flooded forest soil sample n1 influenced by the negro river located downstream of the city of manaus recorded a n2o emission rate of 0 32 0 1 gn kg 1 h 1 which is two times higher than four of the other soil samples n3 s1 m1 and m2 these four sites register a ratio that favours n2 on the other hand flooded forest n3 registered the highest n2 emission rate 0 23 0 02 g n kg 1 h 1 n1 and n3 samples are examples of high potential denitrification rates of amazonian wetland soils extensive fertilizer use in this watershed will have a negative effect in wetland denitrification as the concentration of nitrates from exogenous sources will increase the budget of nitrates produced by nitrification that in turn will increase denitrification event intensity fold 4 and n2o emissions weier et al 1993 blackmer and bremner 1978 p√§rn et al 2021 a surplus of nitrates also affects ecosystem functionality promotes eutrophication and biodiversity may be threatened huang et al 2017 smith 2003 despite the importance of quantifying anthropogenic influence in natural wetlands this version of the wsdm does not aim to calculate denitrification rates of anthropogenic input effects but to identify physical parameters that shape the denitrification capacity of each wetland ecosystem and assess these dynamics the major contribution of wsdm is that simulated denitrification is influenced by wetland vegetation typology the influence of the vegetation in wetlands has been reported previously by alldred and baines 2016 they calculated that the presence of plants increased denitrification rates by 55 on average but they also acknowledged the need to differentiate plant communities the wsdm modelled these two factors including a wetland typology that assumes a classification of wetland ecosystems based on their vegetation structure i e trees or herbs the link between vegetation and bacterial processes such as denitrification can be delicate the interaction occurs in the root areas on a very local scale and depends on many physical and chemical aspects denitrification emission ratio depends on many local variables and it can exhibit drastic changes i e ph nitrate concentration acetylene inhibition technique ait has limitations regarding the n2o n2 emission ratio and it has been shown to be inaccurate when recording low denitrification rates such as in groundwater nevertheless ait allows an estimation of total denitrification at high temporal resolution and on small spatial scales with limited workload and costs involved felber et al 2012 a stable isotope approach might have been a preferable method to identify n2 emissions however we had uncertainty concerning detection limits and how well the enriched solution would be distributed through the soil column therefore in the case of the wsdm the optimal compromise between accuracy and the available information was to link wetland typology to carbon decomposition rate koc this immediately implies the presence of bacterial community activity and integrates the different kinds of organic matter available this correlation was validated with the denitrification rates observed in laboratory analysis confirming that flooded forest samples had higher denitrification rates than freshwater marshes both in optimal conditions 5 2 comparison with earlier modelling approaches the precedent denitrification model estimates a total denitrification n2 n n2o n rate in the amazon floodplains from 38 8 to 142 5 kgn ha 1 yr 1 with a spatial grid of 25 km2 guilhen et al 2020 the wsdm has a wider range 20 36 315 90 kgn ha 1 yr 1 this difference is a consequence of model set up the current version is sensitive to different organic carbon decomposition rates soil moisture gradient as well as nitrate limitation calculated in 1 km2 grid constraints that were missing in the previous version the wsdm assumed that annual input flux of carbon is greater than losses respiration harvesting export burial consequently carbon budget is set constant but not unlimited other studies modelled variable carbon input fabre et al 2020 guilhen et al 2020 peyrard et al 2011 showing that carbon is not a limiting factor but it can enhance the denitrification signal this assumption is compensated by the mineralization rate of organic carbon koc which is specific for each kind of simplified wetland ecosystem typology the current wsdm version does not calculate n2o n2 ratio yet the different n2o rate productions table 3 suggest that ratio 0 02 for freshwater wetlands proposed by scheer et al 2020 applied to the wsdm denitrification results gives a n2o n total contribution within the range of what has been reported in low impacted amazonian soils by other studies this estimation should be taken as an indicator and could be improved by field measurements with other methodologies as 15n isotopic tracers bergsma et al 2001 additionally p√§rn et al 2021 reported by in situ measurements that the peruvian palm peat swamp is a hot spot and that the emission ratios change depending on the season they reported that march the main peak has low n2o emissions and very high n2 potential on the other hand in september the emission rate has a higher n2o production ratio the same pattern was observed in the modelled time series regarding the activation of denitrification however the wsdm in the current version does not calculate seasonal n2o n2 ratios but this evidence could serve for developing a n2o n2 ratio function relevant research has been done on this topic the global n2o model intercomparison project tian et al 2018 presented on a large scale spatialized global scale n2o estimate by making a comparative study of a dozen hydrodynamic models that model the global nitrogen and carbon cycles the resulting model the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem assesses the pre industrial emissions co2 ch4 and n2o and the current trends on a yearly monthly and daily basis from 1901 to 2010 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 this model exposes the anthropogenic impact main pollution sources and the consequences on the biosphere this model also takes into account different ecosystems and divides wetlands into four categories seasonal grass wetlands seasonal forest wetlands permanent grass wetlands and permanent forest wetlands likewise dndc denitrification decomposition model is a powerful tool to evaluate n2o production consumption and transport in agricultural soils it was later modified and adapted to other ecosystems wetland dndc gilhespy et al 2014 was adapted to calculate carbon emissions co2 and ch4 these two models have been improved by the scientific community for several years and they are currently a very robust approach to local ghg emissions and water dynamics both models have an empirical base that operate at watershed scale and demand copious input datasets that may not be available for all tropical wetlands wsdm is complementary to both models taking into account different wetland ecosystems based on the vegetation structure but with a simplified approach that is useful on a large scale the results are given in terms of total denitrification aiming to contribute with a particular vision of natural wetlands and their positive role in the global nitrogen cycle this natural wetland function via complete denitrification is often overlooked the total denitrification accounts for non harmful emissions n2 which implies the subtraction of nitrate flux into aquatic ecosystems i e rivers lakes coastal areas 6 conclusion the main contribution of wsdm is that it considers wetland diversity and calculates denitrification in a diurnal basis while remaining parsimonious giving a dynamic spatialized assessment that identifies hot moments and hot spots wsdm total denitrification can be used as an indicator tool for prioritizing conservation areas or wetland ecosystems that must be studied in depth the wsdm was developed with a large scale approach as it does not require a watershed based model the main drivers of the model are soil moisture and temperature input data which have been identified as key for modelling the nitrate budget and denitrification activation deactivation dynamics on a diurnal basis modelling these dynamics is essential in wetland areas where field data is not yet available these results may be indicators of possible scenarios when the anomalies will repeat and or intensify in the future this model can be applied at different scales continents or regions as well as in different

each soil type were divided into three 125 ml glass flasks having 20 g per flask n 3 each soil type biological activity was re established in stored soils by incubating them for 48 h at 25 c and 20 ml of deoxygenated water was added having a saturated water filled pore space each container was sealed with a screw up lid in which a septum had been fitted for gas sampling weight of the glass flasks before and after adding the soil sample and water were taken the gas chromatograph was used in parallel with the g200 n2o device for quantifying n2o emission from soil activity in the control records as emissions were low for the potential denitrification concentrations recorded were within the recording range of the real time device g200 1 ppm therefore it was used as the only reading device for the rest of the experiments to achieve potential denitrification rates soil cores were incubated during 3 h at 25 c under anaerobic conditions replacing the headspace with helium he 20 ml of acetylene c2h2 was added to each flask at the beginning of incubation to identify the nitrate soil saturation linked to potential denitrification five different treatments with progression of nutrient solutions ch3 cooh and kno3 were applied concentrations are shown in table a1 and were applied from 1 to 5 the measurement principle of total denitrification the sum of n2o n2 fluxes in ait treated soil samples assumes that every n2 molecule produced from completed denitrification which would normally be emitted from the soil system remains in the form of n2o which is detected in our laboratory set up by gas

were left for 24 h in aerated conditions before applying the next treatment once all the treatments were completed the flasks were dried out in an oven at 100 c for 24h after that the weight of each flask was measured the dry samples were sieved and 2 g of these homogenized samples were ignited at 500 c for 24h to obtain the organic matter content by weight difference pore space and bulk density were determined gravimetrically on volume samples assuming a measured particle density of 2 613 g cm 3 potential denitrification rates were calculated from the linear increase of the n2o content in the flask and expressed as Œºg n2o g 1 h 1 all data is expressed per gram of sediment on a dry basis the total n2o production eq 1 was calculated by the n2o gas g fraction and n2o liquid l fraction

25499,accurate quantification of soil organic carbon soc change is essential for designing effective agricultural practices to maximize agronomic climatic and environmental benefits here we modified the soc algorithms within the soil and water assessment tool carbon swat c model and applied it to simulate soc dynamics across seven sites in the u s corn belt we examined multiple methods for estimating the effects of soil temperature 3 options soil water 2 options and tillage 4 options on soc decomposition we found that model simulation results are sensitive to the choice of methods and identified the best performing combination of methods further analyses show that the model captured well soc dynamics at different sites and soil depths and under different tillage intensities swat c as an open source model is shared to contribute to future carbon assessment and management in agroecosystems and support robust decision making to promote climate smart agriculture graphical abstract image 1 keywords agroecosystem soil organic carbon carbon dynamics physical based modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soils are the largest terrestrial pool of carbon nearly twice as much as the amount of carbon stored in vegetation and the atmosphere combined approximately 1500 pg 1015 g of soil organic carbon soc is stored in the top 1 m of soils with the top 0 3 m disproportionately hosting 55 of that reservoir lal 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc estimated that agriculture forestry and other land use sectors mainly from agriculture contributed 24 of global ghg emissions in 2010 pachauri et al 2014 thus extenuation of ghg emission from agricultural soils is of crucial importance to mitigate the drastic impacts of global warming agricultural technologies and practices such as soil c sequestration and bioenergy expansion can potentially mitigate 0 3 4 6 pg co2 eq yr 1 emissions at the global scale smith et al 2014 as such management of soc in agricultural soils franzluebbers 2005 mazzoncini et al 2011 is imperative for conserving existing carbon storage and removing carbon from the atmosphere across the globe in the context of changing climate deng et al 2016 lal 2004 lozano garcia et al 2017 mandal et al 2020 in addition to removal of c from the atmosphere the benefits of c sequestration in agricultural soils include improved soil quality increased soil productivity reduced risk of soil erosion and sedimentation and decreased eutrophication and water contamination lal 2007 ledo et al 2020 nyiraneza et al 2017 oldfield et al 2019 reeves 1997 wiesmeier et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 increases in soc not only alter water infiltration water holding capacity aeration and bulk density but also modulate soil ph nutrient availability and cycling cation exchange capacity and butter capacity franzluebbers 2002 2005 soc loss to water bodies through soil erosion or as dissolved organic carbon doc through lateral flow can cause water quality issues for example the global erosion induced loss of soc is estimated to range from 0 5 to 6 0 pg c yr 1 zhang 2018 excessive doc in source waters could lead to the degradation of water quality as it facilitates the transportation of various contaminants and form poisonous compounds through complexation du et al 2019 collectively designing sustainable agricultural soc management practices require simultaneous consideration of multi dimensional impacts including ghg emissions soil quality crop productivity and water quality quantifying the magnitude of soc sequestration especially after land management practices remains to be difficult due to the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soc change in agroecosystems grace and robertson 2021 mckinley et al 2011 singh et al 2020 wang et al 2022 furthermore the mechanisms of soc cycling following land management practices are much more complex than those for c sequestered in biomass laganiere et al 2010 singh et al 2020 evaluation of regional capacities for additional soc storage requires knowledge of potential sequestration by land management practices within different soil climate locations due to the difficulty of systematically measuring c cycling processes and associated environmental impacts process based models are often used to assess the consequences of diverse soc management strategies and support policy and decision making clivot et al 2019 grace and robertson 2021 hagen et al 2020 harden et al 2018 post et al 2008 west et al 2010 wu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 for example grace and robertson 2021 applied the socrates model to assess the impacts of conservation farming practices and land use change pasture and forestation on soc sequestration potential in the eastern u s corn belt the dndc model was used to estimate the impacts of conservation management practices on soc dynamics and n2o

across the conterminous united states the evolution of carbon algorithms within the swat model dates back to the incorporation of a multi layer one pool soc model kemanian et al 2011 later a revised version of the century soc model parton et al 1994 was linked with swat to form the new swat carbon swat c model zhang 2018 zhang et al 2013b which was further expanded to include riverine c cycling du et al 2019 qi et al 2020a 2020b to represent watershed scale carbon stocks and fluxes despite previous evaluations of swat c for simulating eddy covariance observed co2 fluxes eroded soc loss and riverine c fluxes the model has not been extensively tested for replicating long term soc dynamics the u s corn belt which largely overlaps with the u s midwest is a globally important breadbasket and is home to 85 80 and 50 of total maize soybean and wheat production respectively in the united states national agricultural statistics service 2021 the highly productive agricultural soils in the u s corn belt provide numerous opportunities to reduce ghg emissions through agricultural management such as cropland soc sequestration west et al 2010 and biofuel production aimed to enhance energy security and ghg mitigation national research council 2012 as the u s is moving toward meeting goals of reducing ghg emission by 50 52 from 2005 levels in 2030 and achieve c neutral by 2050 rogelj et al 2021 c sequestration in the soils of the u s corn belt could be critical for ghg mitigation simulations models are valuable tools for rapidly assessing the spatial and temporal impacts of land use management practices and climate change scenarios and associated interactions identifying site specific strategic policies to minimize the risk of land degradation and to maintain environmental sustainability as well as means for identifying critical gaps in knowledge grace and robertson 2021 mandal et al 2020 therefore in this study we intend to enhance the swat c model by modifying and testing multiple methods representing soil temperature soil moisture and tillage effects on soc decomposition and transformation in the model to improve its capacity in simulating soc dynamics specifically we aim to 1 compile an extensive soc measurements database based on publicly available data in the u s corn belt 2 examine sensitivity of soc simulations to variations in methods representing environmental controls i e soil temperature soil water content and tillage activity 3 evaluate the performance of the swat c model for replicating long term soc dynamics under diverse cropping systems the source code of the swat c model will be shared via the swat official website swat tamu edu and a documentation explaining the algorithms will also be provided we anticipate the results from this study will provide scientists and practitioners a robust tool for assessing soc impacts of agricultural management and a flexible framework for representing soc dynamics in a watershed context 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the swat c model the swat model is a distributed hydrologic model designed to simulate the dynamics of water sediment and agricultural chemicals in large complex watersheds arnold et al 1998 swat is widely applied around the world for quantifying non point source pollution and assess land use management scenarios and climate change impacts on water resources and water quality fu et al 2019 jeong et al 2013 laurent and ruelland 2011 liang et al 2020 risal and parajuli 2019 santhi et al 2001 ullrich and volk 2009 wang et al 2021 swat divides the hydrologic cycle in a watershed into land and routing phases for the land phase swat simulates canopy storage soil storage evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration lateral subsurface flow and return flow these hydrologic processes influence the transport and or transformation of sediment and agricultural chemicals in land and water once swat determines land loadings of water sediment and chemicals reaching the main channel the constituents are routed through the channel networks considering transport and transformation in stream and stream bed the swat c model is a revised version of the swat model with an addition of carbon module that simulates the cycling of soil organic matter som izaurralde et al 2006 zhang 2018 zhang et al 2013b traditional first order decay equations with empirical parameters controlled by environmental modifiers are often used in process based models to simulate soc decomposition liang et al 2021 in the swat c model soc turnover rates depend on nonlinear processes that are controlled by environmental and management factors soc in the soil is partitioned into five major pools slow humus passive humus metabolic litter structural litter and microbial biomass and c and n flows among these pools through various pathways as influenced by biotic and abiotic factors fig 1 the turnover time of different pools could range from days for metabolic litter to thousands of years for passive humus the rate of decomposition and transformation of c and n among slow humus passive humus metabolic litter structural litter and microbial biomass pools are affected by soil temperature soil water content soil texture land management soil aeration as well as soil conditions such as soil c n ratio carbon flow in soil profile is also associated with hydrologic processes such as percolation lateral flow and soil erosion tillage and percolation can vertically redistribute soc while lateral flow and erosion redistribute soc

determined based on previous literature e g parton et al 1994 izaurralde et al 2006 zhang et al 2013b zhang 2018 2 2 modification of swat c to represent environmental controls of soc decomposition proper management of soc requires a good understanding of the factors and the biophysical and hydroclimatic processes influencing the cycling and balance of c in agroecosystems weil and brady 2017 in cultivated soils soc increases primarily through the addition of plant residues and exudates grown in place and from applied organic fertilizers such as animal manure losses of soc are mainly due to microbial respiration erosion leaching of dissolved c and plant removals among various environmental factors soil temperature soil moisture oxygen content and tillage are considered as important controlling factors of the decomposition rate of soc davidson et al 2014 izaurralde et al 2006 liang et al 2021 monard et al 2012 moyano et al 2013 sierra et al 2017 a combined factor cmf which is modified based on izaurralde et al 2006 is calculated to represent the integrated effect of all factors in the swat c model cmf is calculated as 1 c m f t m p f w a t f o x g f t i l l f c m f 10 10 c m f 10 where tmpf watf oxgf and tillf represent soil temperature factor soil water factor oxygen factor and tillage factor respectively after a thorough literature review we identified multiple options for tmpf watf and tillf calculation except for oxgf a non linear oxygen factor calculation method that associates oxygen availability with soil depth was applied izaurralde et al 2006 for other factors swat c provides users with three methods for estimating soil temperature factor tmpf two methods for estimating soil water factor watf and four methods for estimating tillage factor tillf a summary of those equations and their sources is provided in table 1 the three tmpf methods are expressed as eq 2a eq 2b and eq 2c following izaurralde et al 2006 kemanian et al 2011 and sharpley and williams 1990 respectively in eq 2a and eq 2b when soil temperature is equal or below 35 c tmpf is positively correlated with soil temperature which means soc decomposition rate increases with temperature however soil temperature will become a limiting factor for soc decomposition when temperature is above 35 c for the third approach of calculating tmpf tmpf is positively correlated with soil temperature while the impact of soil temperature on soc decomposition becomes steady when soil temperature is over 35 c eq 2c 2a t m p f 1 s o l t m p s o l t m p exp 5 058 0 2504 s o l t m

also applies different approaches to calculate soil water factor the first approach estimates watf1 by considering soil water content field capacity and permanent wilting point eq 3a when soil moisture is above permanent wilting point and blow field capacity watf1 is a function of soil moisture and field capacity watf1 will be set as 1 when soil moisture is above field capacity when soil moisture is below permanent wilting point watf1 is a function of soil moisture and permanent wilting point and will be set as 0 05 when soil moisture is below a certain point 3a w a t f 1 0 1 0 9 s o

carbon storage and reduce ghg emissions by quantifying ghg flux and soil carbon in agroecosystems and assessing the impacts of different management scenarios del grosso et al 2013 jawson et al 2005 for example u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars initiated the gracenet greenhouse gas reduction through agricultural carbon enhancement network and reap renewable energy assessment project projects to support better data management practices del grosso et al 2013 jawson et al 2005 the great lakes bioenergy research center glbrc also established an online database for sharing long term observations of soc dynamics in agricultural soils robertson et al 2011 gelfand et al 2013 we compiled experimental data at seven sites across the u s corn belt from the above three projects the database includes soc measurements under continuous corn systems between 1980 and 2013 to evaluate the performance of the swat c model fig 2 and table 2 these sites are distributed across seven states in the u s midwest and represent a range of precipitation and temperature conditions as most of the sites are in highly productive agricultural areas the soil types are mainly loamy soils including silt load clay loam loam fig 3 field experiments at those seven sites involve various treatments a total of 47 treatments across sites such as corn residue removal tillage intensity fertilization and irrigation note that treatments with at least one initial and one final soc measurements were included in our analysis a total of 1219 soc content measurements in at various depths varying from 5 cm up to 120 cm were used in our model evaluation total soc mass mg c ha 1 in different soil layers was calculated from measured soc content and bulk density daily weather records of all sites used to drive the swat c model for the period of 1975 2015 were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa based on the location of each site soil data fig 3 was retrieved from the soil survey geographic surggo database prepared for swat model input which is available at the swat official website swat tamu edu topography data digital

evaluation and results analysis we evaluated the goodness of fit of the swat c simulations on soc by using the widely adopted evaluation metrics moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe jr 1999 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the r2 provides a measure of how well the observed data is explained by the model with r2 value ranges from 0 to 1 higher r2 value indicates better model performance the nse value ranges from to 1 with nse value of 1 indicates a perfect match between simulation and observation the pbias provides a measure of the average tendency of the simulations to be larger or smaller than observations positive pbias values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate model overestimation with 0 as the optimal value gupta et al 1999 as we have evaluated performance of 24 combinations of environmental control methods the analysis of variance anova scheffe 1999 was performed to examine if there is significant difference between the best performing combinations and each of the other 23 combinations since the swat c model offers multiple methods to estimate each controlling factor avnoa test was also performed to determine if the predicted mean soc by different estimation methods of the three environmental control factors were different the significance level is set to 0 05 note that the anova test was implemented to test the significant difference between methods that used to calculate the same controlling factor since there are three tmpf methods and four tillf methods the tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test abdi and williams 2010 was performed to test the significant difference between any of the two methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 soc data summary as shown in fig 4 most sites four out of seven measured soc for the top 15 cm three reported observations for the 15 30 cm depth and only one site ithaca ny includes soc at deeper layers ranging from 30 to 120 cm soc varied greatly across sites for example soc at the 0 15 cm depth ranged from 27 2 0 3 7 mg c ha 1 at lafayette in to 54 0 3 7 mg c ha 1 at rosemount mn it is also worth noting that soc in general decreased with soil depth for example in the ithaca ny site soc decreased by 80 from 77 9 mg c ha 1 at 0 30 cm to 15 6 mg c ha 1 at 90 120 cm that trend is consistent with the disproportionately high storage of c in top soil layers as compared to deep soil layers lal 2018 3 2 sensitivity of soc simulation to methods used to represent environmental controls with the modifications described in section 2 2 the updated swat c offers the flexibility to choose among different equations to calculate soil water soil temperature and tillage factors thereby allowing users to examine the sensitivity of soc simulation to methods used to represent environmental controls and identify the optimal combinations for different application purposes and settings the available options of different methods 3 for tmpf 2 for watf and 4 for tillf resulted in a total of 24 combinations of different methods for each combination we simulated soc dynamics across the seven sites 47 treatments and 1219 soc measurements and evaluated their performance table 3 using all available observed soc the comparison of simulated results table 3 shows that in the u s corn belt the average performance of simulations that employ tmp2 or tmpf3 generally outperformed that of combinations using tmp1 the average performance of combinations with watf2 performed slightly better than that of combinations with watf1 the average performance of combinations that employ tillf1 tillf3 or tillf4 was comparable to each other and was noticeably better than that of combinations using tillf2 among the 24 combinations tillf3 watf2 tmp3 tillf4 watf1 tmp3 and tillf4 watf2 tmp2 outperformed other combinations all three combinations achieved high r2 0 96 and nse 0 96 0 95 and 0 95 respectively values and low absolute pbias values less than 0 5 the combination of the original methods i e tmpf1 izaurralde et al 2006 watf1 neitsch et al 2011 and tillf2 izaurralde et al 2006 included in the swat c model by zhang et al 2013b performed the least among all 24 available combinations with r2 nse and pbias values are 0 76 0 56 and 16 31 notably the simulation results shown in table 3 show a wide range of performance for example r2 of the 24 combinations ranged from 0 76 to 0 96 nse ranged from 0 56 to 0 96 and pbias ranged from 0 12 to 16 31 results of one way anova test between the best performing combination tillf3 watf2 tmp3 and each of the rest 23 combinations show that 12 combinations achieved simulation results that are not significantly different with the best performing combination p 0 05 the simulations results of the remaining 11 combinations are significantly different or less than the top performing combination table 3 these results suggest that the combination of different environmental control methods would have substantial impacts on simulation results and the swat c provides a wide range of options of these combinations that can achieve credible results to understand the sensitivity of soc simulations to different environmental control calculation methods we compared the boxplots of simulated soc grouped by different methods fig 5 and evaluated the average performance of different combinations grouped by environmental control calculation methods table 4 in general simulations with tillf1 tillf2 tillf4 watf2 tmpf2 and tmpf3 match well with measured soc while both tillf2 and tmpf1 tend to exhibit large biases in simulated soc table 4 we further conducted anova test to examine if changes in calculation equations of environmental factors can significantly impact simulation results results of anova test suggest that soc predicted by the four tillf methods were significantly different from each other p 0 001 we also found a significant difference between soc simulations by the two watf methods p 0 01 and the three tmpf methods p 0 001 results of tukey s hsd test suggest that soc predicted by tillf2 was significantly lower than other tillf methods p 0 001 while results by tillf1 tillf3 and tillf4 were not significantly different from each other p 0 05 soc simulated by tmpf1 method was significantly lower than simulations by tmpf2 and tmpf3 methods p 0 001 and there was no significant difference between tmpf2 and tmpf3 p 0 05 these results clearly show the significant impacts of different environmental control algorithms on the simulation of soc dynamics 3 3 overall performance of swat c against all available soc data based on the evaluation results demonstrated above we identified the optimal combination of methods that calculate environmental control factors for this study is tillf3 watf2 tmpf3 further analysis was performed to evaluate the overall performance of swat c by using this combination results show that swat c could capture well the temporal spatial and vertical distribution of soc fig 6 overall the swat c slightly overestimated soc with a small positive pbias value 0 12 the overall r2 pbias and nse of swat c simulated soc compared with measured soc across all sites are 0 96 0 12 and 0 96 respectively fig 6a observed and simulated soc at different sites and different soil layers are demonstrated in fig 6b and c swat c can generally predict both the timing and magnitude of soc well across different sites and soil layers visual comparison of observed soc and simulated soc in fig 6b indicated that simulated soc matched well with observed soc results in fig 6c show that swat c can represent soc cycling from shallow soil layers with high soc level to deep soil layers 90 120 cm with low soc level indicating the new c module of swat c can appropriately represent c inputs and turnover in the soil profile under contrasting conditions the swat c model allows users to quantify c and n dynamics in multiple soil layers at varying depths similar approaches have been applied in comprehensive models such as dssat the agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 and cropsyst st√∂ckle et al 2003 to simulate soil c dynamics with a multiple compartment design note that the model simulation was not subject to a calibration process it is expected that the results could be further improved if a standard calibration process is performed here we chose not to calibrate parameters because recent publications show that parameter calibration may introduce additional uncertainty and cannot guarantee correct representation of physical processes arnold et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a despite that the results were obtained without calibration the performance of swat c is comparable to other agroecosystem models reported in previous studies basso et al 2011 jang et al 2021 jones et al 2017 miehle et al 2006 wang et al 2005 for example the epic model was applied to simulate top 0 2 m soc in the corn production systems at the arlington agricultural research station in south central wisconsin from 1958 to 1990 and achieved r2 of 0 89 wang et al 2005 le et al 2018 reported that the average annual simulated soc 15 56 6 19 mg c ha 1 yr 1 by epic model was comparable to reported soc values 17 08 13 45 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the top 0 2 m depth for the whole u s maize agricultural region mohanty et al 2020 reported robust performance of apsim r2 0 92 root mean square error 3 33 mg ha 1 mean bias error 1 08 mg ha 1 in predicting the long term soc dynamics in a soybean wheat cropping system in central india these results further suggest that the swat c model is an efficient and robust tool in predicting the soc dynamics within agricultural landscapes 3 4 swat c performance at individual sites since the soc data used for swat c evaluation was collected from different sites with specific conditions i e soil and climate and management practices i e tillage irrigation or residue removal we examined performance of swat c at individual sites fig 7 the simulated soc for ames r2 0 96 nse 0 96 pbias 3 3 aurora r2 0 96 nse 0 96 pbias 1 0 champaign r2 0 74 nse 0 22 pbias 5 8 ithaca r2 0 98 nse 0 98 pbias 0 1 and rosemount r2 0 83 nse 0 79 pbias 2 0 agreed well with measured soc from these sites at arlington r2 0 008 nse 246 4 pbias 9 5 and lafayette r2 0 37 nse 0 59 pbias 0 1 swat c performed much less than at the aforementioned five sites or the average performance across all seven sites although the low pbias indicates that swat c simulated well the overall magnitude of soc at arlington and lafayette it explained less than 50 of the temporal variations of observed soc dynamics note that the tillage treatment at arlington and lafayette are continuous no till zhang 2018 pointed out that the unaddressed growth of weeds or cover crops during the non growing season could sequester co2 from the atmosphere and eventually contribute to soc stock which could contribute to the biased soc estimation by swat c especially in no till sites in addition the accuracy of climate forcing data the lack of detailed management information during the experimental period or in the previous season before the experiments could have contributed to the uncertainties in soc simulation the analysis of swat c performance at individual sites indicates that despite the overall satisfactory performance across sites we should not assume swat c captures well the magnitude and temporal variability of soc at every study site particularly for those with no till practices future efforts that improve swat c for simulating weeds or other post harvest vegetation growth could be of help to better represent no till cropping systems 3 5 swat c performance at different soil depths the vertical distribution of soc generally shows a decrease in soc with soil depth jobb√°gy and jackson 2000 lal 2018 as management practices can exert varied influence on soc at different depths accurate quantification of soc in shallow soil layers and deeper layers is a desired capability of agroecosystem models we analyzed swat c performance by grouping soc measurements into two categories top 30 cm and below 30 cm of soil as shown in fig 8 swat c captured well the variation of soc in both the top 30 cm and below 30 cm soil layers with r2 and nse above 0 95 and pbias less than 0 5 the overall performance of swat c in layers below 30 cm is slightly better than the top 30 cm layer this could be attributed to the fact that surface soil layers are subject to more environmental disturbance than deeper layers such as c inputs the rapid change of temperature and tillage disturbance soc decomposition and transformation between different soc pools within the surface soil layers are expected to be faster than that below 30 cm due to such disturbance the complexity of representing controls of soc in surface layers makes it more difficult to predict soc dynamics than deeper layers note that the majority of soc measurements were conducted in the top 30 cm layer 931 measurements soc measurements collected in soil layers below 30 cm 288 measurements were only available in ithaca in therefore it is intuitive to assume that the assessment of swat c performance for surface layers is more robust and more soc measurements are needed to reliably assess swat c for deep soil layers 3 6 swat c performance by tillage intensity in our compiled soc database there were four tillage treatments chisel plow moldboard plow disk plow and no till applied across the seven study sites among the 47 treatments there were 14 chisel plow cp 7 moldboard plow mp 3 disk plow dk and 23 no till nt treatments respectively the change in tillage intensity would result in the change of bulk density soil porosity and the efficiency of the redistribution of soc within the tillage zone jat et al 2019 kay and vandenbygaart 2002 in addition it has been reported that conventional tillage practices could stimulate soc loss by disrupting soil aggregates and expose c to microbial decomposition compared to nt duiker and beegle 2006 singh et al 2020 wright and hons 2004 singh et al 2020 reported that soc under three nt treatments nt with winter wheat cover crop and nt with wheat soybean double crop were 39 69 and 51 greater than mp similarly soc in the top 15 cm of soil in nt system was found to be significantly higher than that of mp system duiker and beegle 2006 therefore we examined the swat c performance in response to the change of tillage practices the performance of swat c for simulating soc dynamics under different tillage practices is shown in fig 9 in general swat c performed well for all four tillage practices for example swat c achieved r2 and nse values above 0 95 for cp dk and nt even though the performance of swat c for mp is slightly less than other tillage practices it explained over 75 of variation of measured soc and achieved high nse of 0 78 and low pbias of 0 9 changes in management practices are generally reflected faster in active soc pools than passive pools kaiser et al 2014 pandey et al 2014 mainly due to the shorter turnover time of active soc than passive soc the design of multiple compartment soc in swat c allows the model to capture the changes of environmental factors in a timely manner which likely contributes to the improved performance of swat c in simulating soc under different tillage practices overall the results indicate that swat c can reflect the impacts of tillage practices on soc dynamics notably changes in tillage practices could also influence environmental variables such as soil temperature and soil moisture it is shown that the relationships between soil temperature and soil moisture could vary under different tillage practices fig s2 however the relationships between soil temperature and soil moisture do not monotonicaly increase or decrease with tillage intensity therefore more in depth research to fully understand how tillage practices influence environmental factors that control the dynamics of soc awaits further research in the future 3 7 limitations and uncertainties the analyses in the previous sessions clearly show that the enhanced swat c can credibly replicate soc dynamics in agricultural soils however there are limitations and uncertainties associated with the observed data used in this study and the model itself although existing frameworks exist for analyzing errors associated with observed data sexton et al 2010 yen et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and model structure yen et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 2011 they often require accurate prior knowledge about the errors associated with the different uncertainty sources and how they are interacting with each other the lack of that information could lead to incomplete and misleading assessment of uncertainties zhang and zhao 2012 therefore here we did not intend to conduct a complete uncertainty assessment but focused on evaluating different options of improving environmental factor representation to better simulate soc dynamics based on our modeling experience we identified the following limitations of the study and suggest future efforts are required to further elucidate those uncertainty sources for example the lack of detailed management data as model input is certainly a limiting factor for accurate model simulation zhang et al 2013b showed that accurate dates of management practices e g planting harvesting tillage and fertilization could pronouncedly improve model simulations of carbon balance of agroecosystems there are also limitations associated with the model structure although we analyzed the impact of methods used to calculate temperature moisture and tillage factors we did not conduct comprehensive analysis of the impacts of soil aeration on carbon dynamics soil aeration could be affected by several factors such as soil moisture and tillage generally high soil moisture content would reduce pore space and lead to low soil aeration while pore space would increase at low soil moisture content and lead to increased soil aeration tillage practices could improve soil aeration in surface soil layers in the current swat c the estimation of the oxygen factor has been simplified without considering the connection between soil aeration and soil moisture and tillage in addition we assumed that the soil moisture factor in swat c is positively correlated with soil moisture without considering the impact of extreme soil moisture conditions e g drought or flooding on soc decomposition it was reported that soc decomposition would reach the optimal rate at intermediate soil moisture level and both dry and wet soil conditions could inhibit soc decomposition liang et al 2021 monard et al 2012 sierra et al 2017 we noted these limitations might introduce bias in the soc estimation and further improvement of the swat c is expected to better represent these factors in the future 4 conclusions we modified and tested multiple methods representing soil temperature soil moisture and tillage effects on soc decomposition and transformation in the swat c model to improve its capacity in simulating soc dynamics we examined the performance of swat c at seven corn production sites which include 47 treatments and 1219 soc measurements between 1980 and 2013 in the u s corn belt the new algorithms in swat c offer users the flexibility to identify the best performing methods to estimate environmental control factors from a total of 24 combinations of different soil temperature 3 options soil moisture 2 options and tillage 4 options methods using anova and tukey s hsd tests we found that swat c simulations of soc dynamics are sensitive to the methods used to represent the three environmental factors indicating that the availability of different options is desired for achieving optimal performance for different application purposes and locations comparison of the simulation resulting from the 24 combinations shows that the combination of the original methods i e tmpf1 izaurralde et al 2006 watf1 neitsch et al 2011 and tillf2 izaurralde et al 2006 included in the swat c model by zhang et al 2013b performed the least among all 24 available combinations with r2 of 0 76 nse of 0 56 and pbias of 16 31 in contrast the best performing combination tillf3 watf2 tmpf3 of newly added options table 1 achieved r2 nse and pbias of 0 96 0 96 and 0 12 respectively we also analyzed the performance of swat c at individual sites different soil depths and under different tillage intensities and the results indicate that swat c performed well for 5 out of 7 test sites both top 30 and 30 120 cm depths and for various tillage types these results indicate the strengths of swat c to capture well the general patterns of soc dynamics under different site conditions e g climatic edaphic and agronomic but specific attention should be paid if application is intended to capture well soc dynamics for a specific site or application purpose potential sources of uncertainties in swat c simulations include the errors associated with climatic and soil data lack of detailed management information as inputs and the incomplete understanding and representation of environmental controls of soc dynamics such as the effects of soil aeration and the interaction between different factors overall our results demonstrated satisfactory performance of the swat c model to replicate soc dynamics across a wide range of climatic terrain and management conditions the changes made to enable swat c to choose among different options representing environmental controls are key to improve its performance however further enhancement such as the better representation of no till treatment will also be needed to further improve the performance of the model we anticipate the swat c as an open source model will contribute to future carbon assessment and management in agroecosystems and support robust decision making to promote climate smart agriculture software soil and water assessment tool carbon swat c operating systems windows linux programming language

25499,accurate quantification of soil organic carbon soc change is essential for designing effective agricultural practices to maximize agronomic climatic and environmental benefits here we modified the soc algorithms within the soil and water assessment tool carbon swat c model and applied it to simulate soc dynamics across seven sites in the u s corn belt we examined multiple methods for estimating the effects of soil temperature 3 options soil water 2 options and tillage 4 options on soc decomposition we found that model simulation results are sensitive to the choice of methods and identified the best performing combination of methods further analyses show that the model captured well soc dynamics at different sites and soil depths and under different tillage intensities swat c as an open source model is shared to contribute to future carbon assessment and management in agroecosystems and support robust decision making to promote climate smart agriculture graphical abstract image 1 keywords agroecosystem soil organic carbon carbon dynamics physical based modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soils are the largest terrestrial pool of carbon nearly twice as much as the amount of carbon stored in vegetation and the atmosphere combined approximately 1500 pg 1015 g of soil organic carbon soc is stored in the top 1 m of soils with the top 0 3 m disproportionately hosting 55 of that reservoir lal 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc estimated that agriculture forestry and other land use sectors mainly from agriculture contributed 24 of global ghg emissions in 2010 pachauri et al 2014 thus extenuation of ghg emission from agricultural soils is of crucial importance to mitigate the drastic impacts of global warming agricultural technologies and practices such as soil c sequestration and bioenergy expansion can potentially mitigate 0 3 4 6 pg co2 eq yr 1 emissions at the global scale smith et al 2014 as such management of soc in agricultural soils franzluebbers 2005 mazzoncini et al 2011 is imperative for conserving existing carbon storage and removing carbon from the atmosphere across the globe in the context of changing climate deng et al 2016 lal 2004 lozano garcia et al 2017 mandal et al 2020 in addition to removal of c from the atmosphere the benefits of c sequestration in agricultural soils include improved soil quality increased soil productivity reduced risk of soil erosion and sedimentation and decreased eutrophication and water contamination lal 2007 ledo et al 2020 nyiraneza et al 2017 oldfield et al 2019 reeves 1997 wiesmeier et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 increases in soc not only alter water infiltration water holding capacity aeration and bulk density but also modulate soil ph nutrient availability and cycling cation exchange capacity and butter capacity franzluebbers 2002 2005 soc loss to water bodies through soil erosion or as dissolved organic carbon doc through lateral flow can cause water quality issues for example the global erosion induced loss of soc is estimated to range from 0 5 to 6 0 pg c yr 1 zhang 2018 excessive doc in source waters could lead to the degradation of water quality as it facilitates the transportation of various contaminants and form poisonous compounds through complexation du et al 2019 collectively designing sustainable agricultural soc management practices require simultaneous consideration of multi dimensional impacts including ghg emissions soil quality crop productivity and water quality quantifying the magnitude of soc sequestration especially after land management practices remains to be difficult due to the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soc change in agroecosystems grace and robertson 2021 mckinley et al 2011 singh et al 2020 wang et al 2022 furthermore the mechanisms of soc cycling following land management practices are much more complex than those for c sequestered in biomass laganiere et al 2010 singh et al 2020 evaluation of regional capacities for additional soc storage requires knowledge of potential sequestration by land management practices within different soil climate locations due to the difficulty of systematically measuring c cycling processes and associated environmental impacts process based models are often used to assess the consequences of diverse soc management strategies and support policy and decision making clivot et al 2019 grace and robertson 2021 hagen et al 2020 harden et al 2018 post et al 2008 west et al 2010 wu et al 2016 wu et al 2015 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 for example grace and robertson 2021 applied the socrates model to assess the impacts of conservation farming practices and land use change pasture and forestation on soc sequestration potential in the eastern u s corn belt the dndc model was used to estimate the impacts of conservation management practices on soc dynamics and n2o emissions across 645 counties in the corn belt from 2005 to 2018 hagen et al 2020 using the epic environmental policy integrated climate model jones et al 2017 assessed the impact of residue removal rate location and estimation methodology for determining soc change on co2 emissions the watershed scale soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 has been widely used to study water quantity and quality impacts of land management and climate change across the globe awotwi et al 2019 fu et al 2019 gassman et al 2007 2014 jeong et al 2013 kalcic et al 2019 koo et al 2020 singh and saraswat 2016 tan et al 2020 for example it is part of the u s environmental protection agency s better assessment science integrating point nonpoint sources basins http water epa gov scitech datait models basins index cfm software package and is being applied to support the united states department of agriculture usda for the conservation effects assessment project ceap richardson et al 2008 across the conterminous united states the evolution of carbon algorithms within the swat model dates back to the incorporation of a multi layer one pool soc model kemanian et al 2011 later a revised version of the century soc model parton et al 1994 was linked with swat to form the new swat carbon swat c model zhang 2018 zhang et al 2013b which was further expanded to include riverine c cycling du et al 2019 qi et al 2020a 2020b to represent watershed scale carbon stocks and fluxes despite previous evaluations of swat c for simulating eddy covariance observed co2 fluxes eroded soc loss and riverine c fluxes the model has not been extensively tested for replicating long term soc dynamics the u s corn belt which largely overlaps with the u s midwest is a globally important breadbasket and is home to 85 80 and 50 of total maize soybean and wheat production respectively in the united states national agricultural statistics service 2021 the highly productive agricultural soils in the u s corn belt provide numerous opportunities to reduce ghg emissions through agricultural management such as cropland soc sequestration west et al 2010 and biofuel production aimed to enhance energy security and ghg mitigation national research council 2012 as the u s is moving toward meeting goals of reducing ghg emission by 50 52 from 2005 levels in 2030 and achieve c neutral by 2050 rogelj et al 2021 c sequestration in the soils of the u s corn belt could be critical for ghg mitigation simulations models are valuable tools for rapidly assessing the spatial and temporal impacts of land use management practices and climate change scenarios and associated interactions identifying site specific strategic policies to minimize the risk of land degradation and to maintain environmental sustainability as well as means for identifying critical gaps in knowledge grace and robertson 2021 mandal et al 2020 therefore in this study we intend to enhance the swat c model by modifying and testing multiple methods representing soil temperature soil moisture and tillage effects on soc decomposition and transformation in the model to improve its capacity in simulating soc dynamics specifically we aim to 1 compile an extensive soc measurements database based on publicly available data in the u s corn belt 2 examine sensitivity of soc simulations to variations in methods representing environmental controls i e soil temperature soil water content and tillage activity 3 evaluate the performance of the swat c model for replicating long term soc dynamics under diverse cropping systems the source code of the swat c model will be shared via the swat official website swat tamu edu and a documentation explaining the algorithms will also be provided we anticipate the results from this study will provide scientists and practitioners a robust tool for assessing soc impacts of agricultural management and a flexible framework for representing soc dynamics in a watershed context 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the swat c model the swat model is a distributed hydrologic model designed to simulate the dynamics of water sediment and agricultural chemicals in large complex watersheds arnold et al 1998 swat is widely applied around the world for quantifying non point source pollution and assess land use management scenarios and climate change impacts on water resources and water quality fu et al 2019 jeong et al 2013 laurent and ruelland 2011 liang et al 2020 risal and parajuli 2019 santhi et al 2001 ullrich and volk 2009 wang et al 2021 swat divides the hydrologic cycle in a watershed into land and routing phases for the land phase swat simulates canopy storage soil storage evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration lateral subsurface flow and return flow these hydrologic processes influence the transport and or transformation of sediment and agricultural chemicals in land and water once swat determines land loadings of water sediment and chemicals reaching the main channel the constituents are routed through the channel networks considering transport and transformation in stream and stream bed the swat c model is a revised version of the swat model with an addition of carbon module that simulates the cycling of soil organic matter som izaurralde et al 2006 zhang 2018 zhang et al 2013b traditional first order decay equations with empirical parameters controlled by environmental modifiers are often used in process based models to simulate soc decomposition liang et al 2021 in the swat c model soc turnover rates depend on nonlinear processes that are controlled by environmental and management factors soc in the soil is partitioned into five major pools slow humus passive humus metabolic litter structural litter and microbial biomass and c and n flows among these pools through various pathways as influenced by biotic and abiotic factors fig 1 the turnover time of different pools could range from days for metabolic litter to thousands of years for passive humus the rate of decomposition and transformation of c and n among slow humus passive humus metabolic litter structural litter and microbial biomass pools are affected by soil temperature soil water content soil texture land management soil aeration as well as soil conditions such as soil c n ratio carbon flow in soil profile is also associated with hydrologic processes such as percolation lateral flow and soil erosion tillage and percolation can vertically redistribute soc while lateral flow and erosion redistribute soc laterally fig 1 illustrates the addition decomposition and transformation of soc among different pools and flow of soc in different soil layers represented in swat c the number of soil layers and the depths can be adjusted as needed through model setup swat delineate the first soil layer with a 10 mm thickness to better represent the rapid change of moisture temperature structure and nutrient at soil surface as influenced by weather conditions e g precipitation freeze and thaw and human activities e g tillage irrigation and fertilization the equations used to represent the biogeochemical transformation of soc and movement of soc driven by water flow and soil erosion are summarized in the supplementary material the parameters governing those physical and biogeochemical processes are determined based on previous literature e g parton et al 1994 izaurralde et al 2006 zhang et al 2013b zhang 2018 2 2 modification of swat c to represent environmental controls of soc decomposition proper management of soc requires a good understanding of the factors and the biophysical and hydroclimatic processes influencing the cycling and balance of c in agroecosystems weil and brady 2017 in cultivated soils soc increases primarily through the addition of plant residues and exudates grown in place and from applied organic fertilizers such as animal manure losses of soc are mainly due to microbial respiration erosion leaching of dissolved c and plant removals among various environmental factors soil temperature soil moisture oxygen content and tillage are considered as important controlling factors of the decomposition rate of soc davidson et al 2014 izaurralde et al 2006 liang et al 2021 monard et al 2012 moyano et al 2013 sierra et al 2017 a combined factor cmf which is modified based on izaurralde et al 2006 is calculated to represent the integrated effect of all factors in the swat c model cmf is calculated as 1 c m f t m p f w a t f o x g f t i l l f c m f 10 10 c m f 10 where tmpf watf oxgf and tillf represent soil temperature factor soil water factor oxygen factor and tillage factor respectively after a thorough literature review we identified multiple options for tmpf watf and tillf calculation except for oxgf a non linear oxygen factor calculation method that associates oxygen availability with soil depth was applied izaurralde et al 2006 for other factors swat c provides users with three methods for estimating soil temperature factor tmpf two methods for estimating soil water factor watf and four methods for estimating tillage factor tillf a summary of those equations and their sources is provided in table 1 the three tmpf methods are expressed as eq 2a eq 2b and eq 2c following izaurralde et al 2006 kemanian et al 2011 and sharpley and williams 1990 respectively in eq 2a and eq 2b when soil temperature is equal or below 35 c tmpf is positively correlated with soil temperature which means soc decomposition rate increases with temperature however soil temperature will become a limiting factor for soc decomposition when temperature is above 35 c for the third approach of calculating tmpf tmpf is positively correlated with soil temperature while the impact of soil temperature on soc decomposition becomes steady when soil temperature is over 35 c eq 2c 2a t m p f 1 s o l t m p s o l t m p exp 5 058 0 2504 s o l t m

also applies different approaches to calculate soil water factor the first approach estimates watf1 by considering soil water content field capacity and permanent wilting point eq 3a when soil moisture is above permanent wilting point and blow field capacity watf1 is a function of soil moisture and field capacity watf1 will be set as 1 when soil moisture is above field capacity when soil moisture is below permanent wilting point watf1 is a function of soil moisture and permanent wilting point and will be set as 0 05 when soil moisture is below a certain point 3a w a t f 1 0 1 0 9 s o

activity can significantly influence the decomposition rates of soc kaiser et al 2014 singh et al 2020 here four methods from simplified to complex are made available in the swat c to estimate tillage

carbon storage and reduce ghg emissions by quantifying ghg flux and soil carbon in agroecosystems and assessing the impacts of different management scenarios del grosso et al 2013 jawson et al 2005 for example u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars initiated the gracenet greenhouse gas reduction through agricultural carbon enhancement network and reap renewable energy assessment project projects to support better data management practices del grosso et al 2013 jawson et al 2005 the great lakes bioenergy research center glbrc also established an online database for sharing long term observations of soc dynamics in agricultural soils robertson et al 2011 gelfand et al 2013 we compiled experimental data at seven sites across the u s corn belt from the above three projects the database includes soc measurements under continuous corn systems between 1980 and 2013 to evaluate the performance of the swat c model fig 2 and table 2 these sites are distributed across seven states in the u s midwest and represent a range of precipitation and temperature conditions as most of the sites are in highly productive agricultural areas the soil types are mainly loamy soils including silt load clay loam loam fig 3 field experiments at those seven sites involve various treatments a total of 47 treatments across sites such as corn residue removal tillage intensity fertilization and irrigation note that treatments with at least one initial and one final soc measurements were included in our analysis a total of 1219 soc content measurements in at various depths varying from 5 cm up to 120 cm were used in our model evaluation total soc mass mg c ha 1 in different soil layers was calculated from measured soc content and bulk density daily weather records of all sites used to drive the swat c model for the period of 1975 2015 were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa based on the location of each site soil data fig 3 was retrieved from the soil survey geographic surggo database prepared for swat model input which is available at the swat official website swat tamu edu topography data digital elevation model dem was derived from the nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm database which is available through the u s geological survey earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov further description of the experimental sites and treatments is available in the following references clay et al 2015 for aurora sd del grosso et al 2013 for ames iowa glbrc 2015 for arlington wi nafziger and

evaluation and results analysis we evaluated the goodness of fit of the swat c simulations on soc by using the widely adopted evaluation metrics moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe jr 1999 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the r2 provides a measure of how well the observed data is explained by the model with r2 value ranges from 0 to 1 higher r2 value indicates better model performance the nse value ranges from to 1 with nse value of 1 indicates a perfect match between simulation and observation the pbias provides a measure of the average tendency of the simulations to be larger or smaller than observations positive pbias values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate model overestimation with 0 as the optimal value gupta et al 1999 as we have evaluated performance of 24 combinations of environmental control methods the analysis of variance anova scheffe 1999 was performed to examine if there is significant difference between the best performing combinations and each of the other 23 combinations since the swat c model offers multiple methods to estimate each controlling factor avnoa test was also performed to determine if the predicted mean soc by different estimation methods of the three environmental control factors were different the significance level is set to 0 05 note that the anova test was implemented to test the significant difference between methods that used to calculate the same controlling factor since there are three tmpf methods and four tillf methods the tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test abdi and williams 2010 was performed to test the significant difference between any of the two methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 soc data summary as shown in fig 4 most sites four out of seven measured soc for the top 15 cm three reported observations for the 15 30 cm depth and only one site ithaca ny includes soc at deeper layers ranging from 30 to 120 cm soc varied greatly across sites for example soc at the 0 15 cm depth ranged from 27 2 0 3 7 mg c ha 1 at lafayette in to 54 0 3 7 mg c ha 1 at rosemount mn it is also worth noting that soc in general decreased with soil depth for example in the ithaca ny site soc decreased by 80 from 77 9 mg c ha 1 at 0 30 cm to 15 6 mg c ha 1 at 90 120 cm that trend is consistent with the disproportionately high storage of c in top soil layers as compared to deep soil layers lal 2018 3 2 sensitivity of soc simulation to methods used to represent environmental controls with the modifications described in section 2 2 the updated swat c offers the flexibility to choose among different equations to calculate soil water soil temperature and tillage factors thereby allowing users to examine the sensitivity of soc simulation to methods used to represent environmental controls and identify the optimal combinations for different application purposes and settings the available options of different methods 3 for tmpf 2 for watf and 4 for tillf resulted in a total of 24 combinations of different methods for each combination we simulated soc dynamics across the seven sites 47 treatments and 1219 soc measurements and evaluated their performance table 3 using all available observed soc the comparison of simulated results table 3 shows that in the u s corn belt the average performance of simulations that employ tmp2 or tmpf3 generally outperformed that of combinations using tmp1 the average performance of combinations with watf2 performed slightly better than that of combinations with watf1 the average performance of combinations that employ tillf1 tillf3 or tillf4 was comparable to each other and was noticeably better than that of combinations using tillf2 among the 24 combinations tillf3 watf2 tmp3 tillf4 watf1 tmp3 and tillf4 watf2 tmp2 outperformed other combinations all three combinations achieved high r2 0 96 and nse 0 96 0 95 and 0 95 respectively values and low absolute pbias values less than 0 5 the combination of the original methods i e tmpf1 izaurralde et al 2006 watf1 neitsch et al 2011 and tillf2 izaurralde et al 2006 included in the swat c model by zhang et al 2013b performed the least among all 24 available combinations with r2 nse and pbias values are 0 76 0 56 and 16 31 notably the simulation results shown in table 3 show a wide range of performance for example r2 of the 24 combinations ranged from 0 76 to 0 96 nse ranged from 0 56 to 0 96 and pbias ranged from 0 12 to 16 31 results of one way anova test between the best performing combination tillf3 watf2 tmp3 and each of the rest 23 combinations show that 12 combinations achieved simulation results that are not significantly different with the best performing combination p 0 05 the simulations results of the remaining 11 combinations are significantly different or less than the top performing combination table 3 these results suggest that the combination of different environmental control methods would have substantial impacts on simulation results and the swat c provides a wide range of options of these combinations that can achieve credible results to understand the sensitivity of soc simulations to different environmental control calculation methods we compared the boxplots of simulated soc grouped by different methods fig 5 and evaluated the average performance of different combinations grouped by environmental control calculation methods table 4 in general simulations with tillf1 tillf2 tillf4 watf2 tmpf2 and tmpf3 match well with measured soc while both tillf2 and tmpf1 tend to exhibit large biases in simulated soc table 4 we further conducted anova test to examine if changes in calculation equations of environmental factors can significantly impact simulation results results of anova test suggest that soc predicted by the four tillf methods were significantly different from each other p 0 001 we also found a significant difference between soc simulations by the two watf methods p 0 01 and the three tmpf methods p 0 001 results of tukey s hsd test suggest that soc predicted by tillf2 was significantly lower than other tillf methods p 0 001 while results by tillf1 tillf3 and tillf4 were not significantly different from each other p 0 05 soc simulated by tmpf1 method was significantly lower than simulations by tmpf2 and tmpf3 methods p 0 001 and there was no significant difference between tmpf2 and tmpf3 p 0 05 these results clearly show the significant impacts of different environmental control algorithms on the simulation of soc dynamics 3 3 overall performance of swat c against all available soc data based on the evaluation results demonstrated above we identified the optimal combination of methods that calculate environmental control factors for this study is tillf3 watf2 tmpf3 further analysis was performed to evaluate the overall performance of swat c by using this combination results show that swat c could capture well the temporal spatial and vertical distribution of soc fig 6 overall the swat c slightly overestimated soc with a small positive pbias value 0 12 the overall r2 pbias and nse of swat c simulated soc compared with measured soc across all sites are 0 96 0 12 and 0 96 respectively fig 6a observed and simulated soc at different sites and different soil layers are demonstrated in fig 6b and c swat c can generally predict both the timing and magnitude of soc well across different sites and soil layers visual comparison of observed soc and simulated soc in fig 6b indicated that simulated soc matched well with observed soc results in fig 6c show that swat c can represent soc cycling from shallow soil layers with high soc level to deep soil layers 90 120 cm with low soc level indicating the new c module of swat c can appropriately represent c inputs and turnover in the soil profile under contrasting conditions the swat c model allows users to quantify c and n dynamics in multiple soil layers at varying depths similar approaches have been applied in comprehensive models such as dssat the agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 and cropsyst st√∂ckle et al 2003 to simulate soil c dynamics with a multiple compartment design note that the model simulation was not subject to a calibration process it is expected that the results could be further improved if a standard calibration process is performed here we chose not to calibrate parameters because recent publications show that parameter calibration may introduce additional uncertainty and cannot guarantee correct representation of physical processes arnold et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a despite that the results were obtained without calibration the performance of swat c is comparable to other agroecosystem models reported in previous studies basso et al 2011 jang et al 2021 jones et al 2017 miehle et al 2006 wang et al 2005 for example the epic model was applied to simulate top 0 2 m soc in the corn production systems at the arlington agricultural research station in south central wisconsin from 1958 to 1990 and achieved r2 of 0 89 wang et al 2005 le et al 2018 reported that the average annual simulated soc 15 56 6 19 mg c ha 1 yr 1 by epic model was comparable to reported soc values 17 08 13 45 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the top 0 2 m depth for the whole u s maize agricultural region mohanty et al 2020 reported robust performance of apsim r2 0 92 root mean square error 3 33 mg ha 1 mean bias error 1 08 mg ha 1 in predicting the long term soc dynamics in a soybean wheat cropping system in central india these results further suggest that the swat c model is an efficient and robust tool in predicting the soc dynamics within agricultural landscapes 3 4 swat c performance at individual sites since the soc data used for swat c evaluation was collected from different sites with specific conditions i e soil and climate and management practices i e tillage irrigation or residue removal we examined performance of swat c at individual sites fig 7 the simulated soc for ames r2 0 96 nse 0 96 pbias 3 3 aurora r2 0 96 nse 0 96 pbias 1 0 champaign r2 0 74 nse 0 22 pbias 5 8 ithaca r2 0 98 nse 0 98 pbias 0 1 and rosemount r2 0 83 nse 0 79 pbias 2 0 agreed well with measured soc from these sites at arlington r2 0 008 nse 246 4 pbias 9 5 and lafayette r2 0 37 nse 0 59 pbias 0 1 swat c performed much less than at the aforementioned five sites or the average performance across all seven sites although the low pbias indicates that swat c simulated well the overall magnitude of soc at arlington and lafayette it explained less than 50 of the temporal variations of observed soc dynamics note that the tillage treatment at arlington and lafayette are continuous no till zhang 2018 pointed out that the unaddressed growth of weeds or cover crops during the non growing season could sequester co2 from the atmosphere and eventually contribute to soc stock which could contribute to the biased soc estimation by swat c especially in no till sites in addition the accuracy of climate forcing data the lack of detailed management information during the experimental period or in the previous season before the experiments could have contributed to the uncertainties in soc simulation the analysis of swat c performance at individual sites indicates that despite the overall satisfactory performance across sites we should not assume swat c captures well the magnitude and temporal variability of soc at every study site particularly for those with no till practices future efforts that improve swat c for simulating weeds or other post harvest vegetation growth could be of help to better represent no till cropping systems 3 5 swat c performance at different soil depths the vertical distribution of soc generally shows a decrease in soc with soil depth jobb√°gy and jackson 2000 lal 2018 as management practices can exert varied influence on soc at different depths accurate quantification of soc in shallow soil layers and deeper layers is a desired capability of agroecosystem models we analyzed swat c performance by grouping soc measurements into two categories top 30 cm and below 30 cm of soil as shown in fig 8 swat c captured well the variation of soc in both the top 30 cm and below 30 cm soil layers with r2 and nse above 0 95 and pbias less than 0 5 the overall performance of swat c in layers below 30 cm is slightly better than the top 30 cm layer this could be attributed to the fact that surface soil layers are subject to more environmental disturbance than deeper layers such as c inputs the rapid change of temperature and tillage disturbance soc decomposition and transformation between different soc pools within the surface soil layers are expected to be faster than that below 30 cm due to such disturbance the complexity of representing controls of soc in surface layers makes it more difficult to predict soc dynamics than deeper layers note that the majority of soc measurements were conducted in the top 30 cm layer 931 measurements soc measurements collected in soil layers below 30 cm 288 measurements were only available in ithaca in therefore it is intuitive to assume that the assessment of swat c performance for surface layers is more robust and more soc measurements are needed to reliably assess swat c for deep soil layers 3 6 swat c performance by tillage intensity in our compiled soc database there were four tillage treatments chisel plow moldboard plow disk plow and no till applied across the seven study sites among the 47 treatments there were 14 chisel plow cp 7 moldboard plow mp 3 disk plow dk and 23 no till nt treatments respectively the change in tillage intensity would result in the change of bulk density soil porosity and the efficiency of the redistribution of soc within the tillage zone jat et al 2019 kay and vandenbygaart 2002 in addition it has been reported that conventional tillage practices could stimulate soc loss by disrupting soil aggregates and expose c to microbial decomposition compared to nt duiker and beegle 2006 singh et al 2020 wright and hons 2004 singh et al 2020 reported that soc under three nt treatments nt with winter wheat cover crop and nt with wheat soybean double crop were 39 69 and 51 greater than mp similarly soc in the top 15 cm of soil in nt system was found to be significantly higher than that of mp system duiker and beegle 2006 therefore we examined the swat c performance in response to the change of tillage practices the performance of swat c for simulating soc dynamics under different tillage practices is shown in fig 9 in general swat c performed well for all four tillage practices for example swat c achieved r2 and nse values above 0 95 for cp dk and nt even though the performance of swat c for mp is slightly less than other tillage practices it explained over 75 of variation of measured soc and achieved high nse of 0 78 and low pbias of 0 9 changes in management practices are generally reflected faster in active soc pools than passive pools kaiser et al 2014 pandey et al 2014 mainly due to the shorter turnover time of active soc than passive soc the design of multiple compartment soc in swat c allows the model to capture the changes of environmental factors in a timely manner which likely contributes to the improved performance of swat c in simulating soc under different tillage practices overall the results indicate that swat c can reflect the impacts of tillage practices on soc dynamics notably changes in tillage practices could also influence environmental variables such as soil temperature and soil moisture it is shown that the relationships between soil temperature and soil moisture could vary under different tillage practices fig s2 however the relationships between soil temperature and soil moisture do not monotonicaly increase or decrease with tillage intensity therefore more in depth research to fully understand how tillage practices influence environmental factors that control the dynamics of soc awaits further research in the future 3 7 limitations and uncertainties the analyses in the previous sessions clearly show that the enhanced swat c can credibly replicate soc dynamics in agricultural soils however there are limitations and uncertainties associated with the observed data used in this study and the model itself although existing frameworks exist for analyzing errors associated with observed data sexton et al 2010 yen et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and model structure yen et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 2011 they often require accurate prior knowledge about the errors associated with the different uncertainty sources and how they are interacting with each other the lack of that information could lead to incomplete and misleading assessment of uncertainties zhang and zhao 2012 therefore here we did not intend to conduct a complete uncertainty assessment but focused on evaluating different options of improving environmental factor representation to better simulate soc dynamics based on our modeling experience we identified the following limitations of the study and suggest future efforts are required to further elucidate those uncertainty sources for example the lack of detailed management data as model input is certainly a limiting factor for accurate model simulation zhang et al 2013b showed that accurate dates of management practices e g planting harvesting tillage and fertilization could pronouncedly improve model simulations of carbon balance of agroecosystems there are also limitations associated with the model structure although we analyzed the impact of methods used to calculate temperature moisture and tillage factors we did not conduct comprehensive analysis of the impacts of soil aeration on carbon dynamics soil aeration could be affected by several factors such as soil moisture and tillage generally high soil moisture content would reduce pore space and lead to low soil aeration while pore space would increase at low soil moisture content and lead to increased soil aeration tillage practices could improve soil aeration in surface soil layers in the current swat c the estimation of the oxygen factor has been simplified without considering the connection between soil aeration and soil moisture and tillage in addition we assumed that the soil moisture factor in swat c is positively correlated with soil moisture without considering the impact of extreme soil moisture conditions e g drought or flooding on soc decomposition it was reported that soc decomposition would reach the optimal rate at intermediate soil moisture level and both dry and wet soil conditions could inhibit soc decomposition liang et al 2021 monard et al 2012 sierra et al 2017 we noted these limitations might introduce bias in the soc estimation and further improvement of the swat c is expected to better represent these factors in the future 4 conclusions we modified and tested multiple methods representing soil temperature soil moisture and tillage effects on soc decomposition and transformation in the swat c model to improve its capacity in simulating soc dynamics we examined the performance of swat c at seven corn production sites which include 47 treatments and 1219 soc measurements between 1980 and 2013 in the u s corn belt the new algorithms in swat c offer users the flexibility to identify the best performing methods to estimate environmental control factors from a total of 24 combinations of different soil temperature 3 options soil moisture 2 options and tillage 4 options methods using anova and tukey s hsd tests we found that swat c simulations of soc dynamics are sensitive to the methods used to represent the three environmental factors indicating that the availability of different options is desired for achieving optimal performance for different application purposes and locations comparison of the simulation resulting from the 24 combinations shows that the combination of the original methods i e tmpf1 izaurralde et al 2006 watf1 neitsch et al 2011 and tillf2 izaurralde et al 2006 included in the swat c model by zhang et al 2013b performed the least among all 24 available combinations with r2 of 0 76 nse of 0 56 and pbias of 16 31 in contrast the best performing combination tillf3 watf2 tmpf3 of newly added options table 1 achieved r2 nse and pbias of 0 96 0 96 and 0 12 respectively we also analyzed the performance of swat c at individual sites different soil depths and under different tillage intensities and the results indicate that swat c performed well for 5 out of 7 test sites both top 30 and 30 120 cm depths and for various tillage types these results indicate the strengths of swat c to capture well the general patterns of soc dynamics under different site conditions e g climatic edaphic and agronomic but specific attention should be paid if application is intended to capture well soc dynamics for a specific site or application purpose potential sources of uncertainties in swat c simulations include the errors associated with climatic and soil data lack of detailed management information as inputs and the incomplete understanding and representation of environmental controls of soc dynamics such as the effects of soil aeration and the interaction between different factors overall our results demonstrated satisfactory performance of the swat c model to replicate soc dynamics across a wide range of climatic terrain and management conditions the changes made to enable swat c to choose among different options representing environmental controls are key to improve its performance however further enhancement such as the better representation of no till treatment will also be needed to further improve the performance of the model we anticipate the swat c as an open source model will contribute to future carbon assessment and management in agroecosystems and support robust decision making to promote climate smart agriculture software soil and water assessment tool carbon swat c operating systems windows linux programming language
