20945,to increase energy production offshore wind farms are currently installed far from shore providing a challenge for vessels to undertake maintenance tasks from the designated hub port service operation vessels sovs are utilized to carry out the offshore wind turbines maintenance tasks which act as a servicing station having required technicians and daughter crafts i e crew transfer vessels ctv onboard to facilitate on time and on demand servicing of wind turbines this paper proposes an optimization framework called optiroute for daily or short term maintenance operations based on route planning and scheduling while minimizing the cost under different operational constraints different heuristic and clustering techniques are developed and integrated to make the framework computationally effective optiroute considers climate data vessels specifications failure information wind farm attributes and cost related specifics the series of the overall operational tasks are divided into sequential sessions including maintenance crew pick up and drop off tasks while the vessel routing optimization is performed for all sessions separately optiroute reliability is tested by employing different case studies while a user friendly graphical user interface gui is also developed to depict the various maintenance scheduling scenarios experimental results reveal that optiroute can efficiently increase the operational window especially when sov and ctvs are used together keywords offshore wind farm service operation vessel sov crew transfer vessel ctv optimal route planning reduction of fuel consumption maintenance operation maintenance cost reduction 1 introduction recent advancements in the offshore wind turbine technology play a significant role in shaping the world economics and energy dependent industries thereby moving progressively towards greener energy resources however even with the rapid advancements towards efficient offshore wind turbine design these are still not cost effective compared to other renewable energy resources such as solar energy güney 2019 and are not affordable especially by the developing countries ghimire and kim 2018 this is not only due to the high manufacturing and installation cost of the turbines but also because of the associated high maintenance and operation cost which accounts significantly in case of offshore wind farms li et al 2016 in order to address this challenge there have been many efforts put forward to develop efficient methods and digital frameworks for planning maintenance operations of offshore wind farms however the offshore wind sector is still lagging to effectively adopt and integrate these tools in their day to day operations mainly due to the inherent challenges to simulate realistic operational scenarios moreover most of the current efforts and studies in this field focus on simulating the long term life cycle operational and maintenance planning under the presence of strong assumptions hofmann 2011 apart from the high cost the ineffective planning of maintenance operations with large vessels like service operation vessel sov and crew transfer vessels ctv can result in high fuel consumption leading to an increment of overall maintenance cost and more importantly this also contributes towards the carbon footprint of the offshore wind farms according to a study by kaldellis and apostolou 2017 the operational and maintenance activities may account up to 5 10 of the total greenhouse emissions throughout the life cycle of an offshore wind farm therefore the planning of the daily operations and maintenance work in an offshore wind farm is an essential but complex and challenging problem irawan et al 2017 one of the key factors that significantly affect the overall maintenance cost is the route planning and scheduling of the maintenance fleet to transport technicians and spare parts to each turbine requiring the maintenance work on a daily or short term basis in general the main objective of the operational planning task is to provide an optimal maintenance vessel routing and a maintenance schedule for a particular day within the planning horizon for any type of maintenance activity which is identified prior to the optimization the optimization is carried out while minimizing the overall maintenance cost and maximizing the wind farm availability various factors constraints affect the optimal planning of the maintenance activities within an offshore wind farm including weather conditions such as significant wave height and wind speed availability type and size of maintenance vessels failure type maintenance crew spare parts etc once these constraints are taken into account the decision has to be made on 1 type of vessels to be used to carry out the particular maintenance work and 2 the visiting sequence of the turbines by the vessels used during the suggested maintenance work generally in practice and for a particular day the maintenance operation starts with a report indicating the list of turbines requiring maintenance or repair work then for each turbine and failure type the number and type of technicians spare parts and estimated time to complete the maintenance work are identified furthermore the specific vessel type to carry out the maintenance work and visit the wind turbines as well as the requirement for the vessel to stay in close proximity or not during the maintenance work is also specified later on taking into account the prevailing climate and other operational constraints an operations department member of staff creates a transfer plan stock williams and swamy 2019 and provides it to the maintenance team the travelling sequence of the vessels visiting the various wind turbines is manually determined either before or during the maintenance work if the vessel is required to stay close to the turbine during the maintenance work its waiting stand by location is usually determined by the vessel captain stock williams and swamy 2019 state that for 10 maintenance tasks there can be approximately 3 6 million possibilities for the creation of an operational plan therefore manually planning of these activities can be extremely cumbersome and time consuming there exist a substantial amount of literature work which addresses this particular challenge either using optimization dai et al 2015 irawan et al 2017 stock williams and swamy 2019 or simulation abdollahzadeh et al 2016 dalgic et al 2015a c li et al 2016 martin et al 2016 tools the majority of the existing studies are simulation based ones simulating the maintenance operations for the entire life cycle of the wind farm on the other hand the routing optimization problem addressed in the literature is overwhelmingly complicated which mostly results in high computational cost and local optimal solution laporte 2009 however to the best of the authors knowledge no existing optimization based work reflects a complete realistic scenario on the usage of sov ctv or their combination for the daily route planning also including an estimation of the vessels fuel consumption which is one of the important economic advantages of the entire offshore wind farm s maintenance planning operation considering the complexity and criticality of the problem there is a need for a computationally robust and effective operational planning framework therefore the present study proposes the development of an optimal operational planning framework optiroute which provides both on board the ships and at the on shore operations and maintenance base the capability to plan and assess offshore wind farm operations in advance based on optimal route planning vessel positions weather conditions as well as considering the expected fuel consumption and associated cost the main contributions of the present work include 1 a novel optimal operational planning methodology based on the two types of vessels sov and ctv used separately or combined 2 a computationally effective heuristic optimization and cluster strategy for optimal daily or short term route planning and scheduling under the presence of operational constraints 3 verification of the proposed framework under different operational scenarios 4 development and implementation of a user graphic interface ugi to depict above scenarios in the proposed framework daily route planning and scheduling occur by considering five sets of input parameters related to the climate maintenance fleet wind farm turbine failure and cost a novel optimization and planning strategy is developed after carefully analyzing the currently practised operational planning at different wind farms which is integrated into the proposed framework in order to provide a complete realistic daily route planning and scheduling of maintenance vessels furthermore to make the framework computationally effective the optimization problem is simplified by dividing the planning task for any particular day into two sessions technician drop off and pick drop sessions then a k mean clustering capó et al 2017 and iterative optimization kelley 1999 based strategies are developed to ensure the usage of the optimum number of vessels and to effectively plan both sessions while satisfying the vessels operational constraints in this respect the present paper is structured as follows section two demonstrates the related work and existing literature on the suggested issue in hand section three further elaborates on the novel proposed optimization framework of the daily route planning and scheduling of maintenance vessel activities in offshore wind farms section four presents the results and discussion on a number of different case studies related to the above framework and finally section 5 provides the final comments and suggestions for future work concluding the present paper 2 relevant literature there are various efforts put forward by different researchers to address the operational challenge of offshore wind farms as mentioned previously existing studies can be broadly categorized into two categories simulation based ones abdollahzadeh et al 2016 dalgic et al 2015a c erguido et al 2017 li et al 2016 martin et al 2016 sarker and faiz 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which simulate the operational planning of the entire life of the wind farm based on the predictive turbine failure and optimization based ones dai et al 2015 dawid et al 2017 gutierrez alcoba et al 2019 irawan et al 2017 raknes et al 2017 schrotenboer uit het broek jargalsaikhan and roodbergen 2018 stålhane et al 2015 stock williams and swamy 2019 which try to optimize the maintenance scheduling problems for the predetermined preventive corrective and condition based maintenance tasks in this section we describe some of the current literature which focuses on the daily route planning and scheduling problem for offshore wind farms recently a metaheuristic optimization methodology was proposed by stock williams and swamy 2019 to determine strengths and weaknesses in any maintenance plan and provides an estimation on investment from implementation which follows the analogy of the travelling salesman problem for route planning in an offshore wind farm the authors argue that compared to heuristic and exact optimizers metaheuristics are more flexible while they also are problem independent optimization techniques as it does not require any amendments in the optimizer itself with the change of objective therefore compared to heuristic these should be adopted to address the operational problem in offshore wind farms however due to their random search nature metaheuristics do not ensure an optimal solution to the problem and require a large number of iterations to find a near optimal solution which makes them computationally expensive in dai et al 2015 the authors proposed a mathematical model for vessel routing and scheduling problem of maintenance vessel for an offshore wind farm in order to determine the optimal routes from the maintenance port to the failed turbines to transfer the maintenance technicians optimization was performed using a commercial software xpress optimizer and maintenance operation was performed with two different vessels recently based on dai s work irawan et al 2017 proposed a maintenance operational planning method for multiple wind farms and the optimization problem was solved by using the mixed integer linear programming however unlike the proposed framework dai et al 2015 and irawan et al 2017 suggested the planning and initiation of the maintenance operations from the hub port moreover he above maintenance works neither address the problem of specifically using sovs and ctvs nor include the vessels stay and waiting time at the wind turbine location and process of performing a far or short stay stålhane et al 2015 proposed two different optimization models such as arc flow which is based on a commercial software using a branch and bound technique to solve the optimization and the path flow which used a heuristic based method to generate an optimal subset of routes and schedules for the vessels an adaptive large neighborhood search alhs heuristic for the short term operational planning was proposed by schrotenboer et al 2018 alhs optimizes the vessel routes for technician pick up and delivery in order to investigate the technician sharing between different wind farms over multiple periods a similar approach was also utilized by raknes et al 2017 however instead of starting the maintenance work from the maintenance port raknes et al 2017 have taken into account the vessel stay at the wind farm during multiple shifts a clustering based heuristic algorithm was proposed by dawid et al 2017 in their approach the failed turbines were first clustered which were then sorted based on the total number of technicians required by the turbines in each cluster and a maintenance vessel was utilized in order to plan the maintenance operations in each cluster along with the operational planning and vessel scheduling some authors stålhane et al 2019 have also integrated the optimization of the size and type of the maintenance fleet however along with the usage of sovs and ctvs none of the aforementioned works incorporates the different operation modes of the maintenance vessels such as fast transit transit and dynamic positioning mode moreover most of the existing works use commercial optimizers which also limits their usage apart from the specific optimization based approaches maintenance operation and route planning is also performed based on the human factors for instance a hybrid human error assessment and reduction technique is proposed by islam et al 2020 to estimate human error probability hep for marine and offshore systems a data driven study was performed by musharraf et al 2020 which used a decision tree algorithm to create a set of decision rules these rules were then used to describe how people use different attributes of emergency scenarios to choose an egress route furthermore similar to the concept of sov rahman et al 2020 developed an offshore resource centre orc which acts as a service station at sea and carries anything required for short and long term maintenance including technicians and materials this enables the maintenance operations to be carried out quickly and effectively thereby increasing the offshore wind farm productivity here the concept of orc is proposed in a more generic form and in a broader sense have risk reduction objectives to provide an intermediate point for helicopters and also provide forward staging or response asset for an emergency in another recent study rahman et al colbourne and khan n d also performed a risk based cost benefit analysis of the orc 3 proposed framework in this section the algorithmic detail of optiroute will be first introduced after describing the basic terminologies the proposed mathematical model for daily route planning with sov and ctv in line with the cluster and optimization techniques and optiroute s user interface will be introduced fig 1 shows the workflow of optiroute with its inputs and outputs the overall optimization workflow of the proposed framework considers four different sets of input parameters such as the climate vessel specifications and fleet configuration wind farm attributes the turbines failure attributes and cost these inputs are then processed during an optimization process in order to optimize the daily routing of sovs and ctvs so as to plan the maintenance tasks for the failed wind turbines the whole operational task is completed with multiple sovs ctvs and or combination of both based on the inputted data the framework starts the optimization process with the objective to minimize the fuel consumption and maximize the wind farm availability while using the least number of maintenance vessels 3 1 basic terminology and problem description let a wind farm w consist of n wind turbines on a particular day there exist a set j of n turbines requiring maintenance work which we shall call as failed turbines i e j j j j 1 2 n w the objective for the proposed framework is to complete the maintenance work for j within the planning horizon using a single or multiple sovs v s o v v v s o v v 1 2 n s o v ctvs v c t v v v c t v v 1 2 n c t v or combination of both while minimizing the total distance travelled d t o t a l and fuel consumption f t o t a l thereby minimizing the overall operational cost furthermore to complete the maintenance work within the planning horizon the total time t t o t a l taken to complete the maintenance work should be less than or equal to the available weather window to start the route planning and scheduling for j the framework requires a set of user specified input parameters i i e i v i w i j i c associated with the weather i e i 1 e i 4 e maintenance vessels i v wind farm i w i 1 w i 4 w failed turbines i j and fuel cost i c for each turbine in j the framework requires a separate subset of input parameters such as i j i i j i 1 2 8 j 1 2 n moreover if multiple sovs or ctvs are considered to be utilized then the framework considers that all the sovs and ctvs are of similar characteristics and requires vessel specification parameters for sov i s o v and ctv i c t v separately i e i v i s o v i c t v after defining i the framework first creates two sets of turbines j s o v and j c t v each one is a subset of j i e j s o v j c t v j containing the turbines which are required to be serviced by v s o v and v c t v respectively during the simulation the framework finds an optimal travelling sequence for v s o v and v c t v to serve j while taking into account the operational constraints and minimizing the overall fuel consumption in litres thereby minimizing the overall distance travelled by vessels and increasing the weather window fig 2 illustrates the route planning of the maintenance vessels using the proposed framework as discussed earlier the proposed optimization framework is used for daily and short term planning and scheduling of maintenance work in this respect it is assumed that the user operator is already aware of the specific failure type therefore similar to gutierrez alcoba et al 2019 raknes et al 2017 stock williams and swamy 2019 no specific failure model is directly integrated within the proposed framework the optimization process for route planning commences by sorting the turbine based on their distance from the current location of the maintenance vessels which can be either in port or at standby location instead of considering distance as an input the proposed framework considers the locations of turbines j maintenance hub port r and standby positions s of sov as longitudinal p l o n and latitudinal p l a t coordinates i e p p l p l a t l p l o n l j r s the haversine distance formula hdf bradley 1942 was utilized to precisely calculate the distance between turbines port and standby positions therefore the location of a j t h turbine in j is represented using longitudinal p l o n and latitudinal p l a t coordinates i e p j p j j p l o n j j p l a t j j j 1 2 n and the haversine distance d p j p p j q between two failed turbines j p and j q is measured using equation 1 where p j p and p j q represents the position of j p and j q respectively 1a δ p l a t p l a t j p p l a t j q δ p l o n p l o n j p p l o n j q ω sin 2 δ p l a t 2 cos p l a t j p cos p l a t j q sin 2 δ p l o n 2 1b λ 2 atan 2 ω 1 ω 1c d p j p p j q ω λ 3 hdf measures the great circle distance in meters m between two points using their longitudes and latitudes which is the shortest distance over the earth surface unlike other distance formulas such as the spherical law of cosines banerjee 2004 the hdf is well conditioned even for the numerical computation of small distances as in reality the voyage of a vessel between two turbines is not performed in a straight line therefore a contagious factor η of the percentage of overall distance travelled by vessels was also added to induce the effect of curvy motion of the maintenance vessels while travelling among the turbines so the curvy haversine distance between j p and j q is measured using equation 2 2 d p j p p j q ω λ 1 η 100 the time taken in hours h and vessels fuel consumed in litres l t to travel between j p and j q is calculated using equations 3 and 4 3 t p j p p j q d p j p p j q s o 4 f p j p p j q t p j p p j q f o where s o and f o is the vessel speed in meter per hours m h and fuel consumption in litre per hours l h at fast transit o 1 transit o 2 and dynamic position o 3 operational mode i e s o f o o 1 o 2 o 3 which will be discussed in detail later in this section 3 2 framework input parameters as described in the previous section the suggested optimization framework considers a set of input parameters such as the weather maintenance fleet wind farm turbine failure and cost below we give a brief description of each set of input parameters 3 2 1 climate inputs i e for the climate inputs there is a single weather window per day for maintenance vessels therefore significant wave height and average wind speed with at least a minute resolution for the whole day are taken into account to start the maintenance work the predicted average wind speed and significant wave height must be lower than the maximum operation wind speed and significant wave height of the vessels the starting time of the maintenance work is also essential to initiate the optimization process if this time is not provided then the sunrise time is considered as the start time of the maintenance work furthermore if the average significant wave height and wind speed are less than the vessels maximum limit for the whole day then the weather window is considered as the one between maintenance work s start time and sunset time the weather window also reflects the best time to carry out the maintenance work as it is particularly related with good accessibility to the turbine table 1 provides a set of input parameters associated with climate 3 2 2 turbine failure inputs i j the daily planning of the maintenance work requires the identification of failed turbines to be served on a particular day therefore the main input required by the framework is the turbine failure information which contains the set of turbines j needed to be maintained on any particular day type of vessel used to perform maintenance work the number of technicians required to complete the maintenance work i 1 j vessels stay information at the turbines predicted total time it takes to complete the maintenance work etc for each failed turbine in j a set of the input parameter shown in table 2 are essential for the framework to plan the vessels optimal routing moreover the total repair time for a turbine includes time taken by the technician to 1 reach the turbine 2 finish the maintenance work and 3 test the turbine here it is noteworthy that the equipment weight and the number of technicians are considered as operational constraints while planning the maintenance operations with ctvs these will be only taken into account by the framework if the user selects to employ a ctv for the whole operational planning task or a set of turbines in the proposed framework the decision on the selection of the vessel for a turbine is made by the user however it is recommended to use sov for a turbine if it requires an equipment replacement which weights more then the ctv s load carrying capacity or if the type of the failure associated with the turbine is of major failure which requires long repair time and more number of technicians another important parameter that greatly affects the operational planning is the identification of whether the vessel is required to be present at the turbine during the maintenance operation from the daily maintenance planning of real case studies of an existing wind farm it was observed that after delivering the technicians a vessel may perform either a near stay i e staying close to the turbine or a far stay i e staying at a specified location far from the turbine but close to the wind farm therefore to represent a more realistic scenario if the vessel stays at the turbine then the framework considers the type of stay near stay or far stay for each turbine the near stay location of the vessel is represented as a measure of its overall unit length on the other hand if far stay is chosen then the location of this needs to be inputted as well 3 2 3 vessel specification inputs i v another set of critical inputs are related to the maintenance vessels specifications as the operational planning is performed using sov and cvt so the specification for these two vessel types is required as input as well offshore support vessel i s o v table 3 shows the input related to sovs specifications in the current study it is considered that there is only one sov available however the framework can be used with multiple sovs in order to increase the weather window for an sov three different operational modes tasks are considered fast transit transit and dynamic positioning these tasks are segmented based on the sov s operational speed and fuel consumption during the development of the proposed framework it was observed that the sov is on fast transit task while moving outside the wind farm and it is on the transit task while travelling within the wind farm the dynamic position mode of the vessel is also included which is only used when sov approaches towards the turbine to deploy the gangway to transfer technicians and equipment to the wind turbine this mode is also used when sov requires to perform a near stay at the turbine crew transfer vessel i c t v inputs related to the ctvs are shown in table 4 as mentioned before in an offshore wind farm sov act as a service platform and ctvs are launched from sov if they are required to be utilized during the maintenance work within the wind farm therefore the maintenance work starting location for the ctvs is the same as for the sov s moreover in the case of ctvs the technician and equipment carrying capacity of ctv are considered as operational constraints 3 2 4 offshore wind farm inputs i w the framework takes into account the location of the turbines port and sov standby location as longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates table 5 shows the input parameters related to the wind farm and vessel locations 3 2 5 cost input i c as the framework optimizes the operational work while minimizing the total distance and fuel consumption therefore only cost associated inputs for the framework is the costs of the sov and ctv engine fuel table 6 3 3 maintenance planning with sov to simplify the operational planning problem the whole planning task is partitioned into two sessions drop off and pick up sessions drop off session begins when the sov leaves the port or its standby location and ends when the technicians are dropped off at the last turbine only if the last turbine does not require sov to stay however if the last turbine requires sov to stay then the drop off session finishes after sov completes the near or far stay for the last turbine after the drop off session the pick up session begins which includes route planning to pick up the technicians from the turbines this session is planned excluding the turbines which require sov to stay this session ends when the sov reaches the inputted standby location the optimization is performed separately for both sessions and the fuel consumption cost and overall time taken to complete the maintenance work is the sum of both drop in and pick up sessions the pseudo code of this heuristic route planning approach using sov is provided in algorithm 1 and explained below before planning any of the two sessions the framework first checks if average significant wave height and average wind speed are less then the vessels limiting significant wave height and average wind speed i 1 e i 2 s o v and i 2 e i 3 s o v if this condition is satisfied then the framework first starts planning the drop off session in drop off session first the framework identifies the present location of sov which can be either at port or standby p l l r s afterwards a turbine j a having the minimum distance from p l is identified it is placed first in the travelling sequence f s o v of sov and eliminated from j s o v if it requires to stay at the turbine so during maintenance planning this turbine will be visited first this was done in order to take into account the sov s different operating mode i e o 1 o 2 and o 3 outside the wind farm the sov performs a fast transit task i e to travel from port standby location to j a and inside the wind farm the sov employs the transit task which is considered when the sov travels among the turbines as the sov has different operational speed at these modes therefore the fuel consumption the time taken to travel and the overall cost are different at these modes as well as stated before it was observed from a real scenario of an existing wind farm that when the sov is required to stay at the turbine it either stays somewhere near the turbine or at a specific location which is far from the turbine but close to the wind farm the sov waits at these locations to pick up the technicians before travelling to other turbines as mentioned in subsection 3 2 2 to include this behaviour of the sov the framework takes two further inputs by the user the sov is required to stay at a turbine then the user has to identify whether it will be staying close or far from the turbine these two scenarios are categorized as near stay and far stay by the framework for near stay the sov stays at a distance equal to one unit of the overall length which is industry standard it is noteworthy that to move at this distance the framework takes into account the dynamic positioning mode and calculates the fuel consumption based on this mode whereas if the sov has to perform a far stay waiting then the user is required to input the location coordinates where the sov will stay during the maintenance work of that turbine in this case the fuel consumption for the sov to travel to this location is calculated based on the transit task algorithm 1 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using sov algorithm 2 the pseudo code of pick up session planning for sov if the time taken by the sov to travel to the far stay location is more than the total repair time required by the turbine i e i 3 j a 2 t i 7 j a p j a then it is recommended to select the near stay waiting option instead of the far stay one moreover to increase the operational window sov leaves the far stay location before the maintenance work is finished for instance consider that the maintenance work at a particular turbine finishes at 13 00 h and it takes the sov half an hour to reach to that turbine from its far stay location then the sov will leave the far stay location at 12 30 h to pick up the technicians so that it reaches the turbine on time this option increases the operational window to a substantial amount the waiting time t s o v j a for the sov at j a during the far stay i 7 j a or near stay i 8 j a is equal to 5 i 3 j a 2 t i 7 j a p j a or i 3 j a 2 t i 8 j a p j a respectively which is the turbine s total repair time i 3 j a minus twice the time taken by the sov to reach the stay locations if j a requires vessel to stay then time taken to complete the maintenance work for j a is the sum of time taken by the sov to travel to j a t p l p j a time taken to perform far or near stay t i 7 j a p j a or t i 8 j a p j a waiting time t s o v j a and twice of average dynamic position and crew transfer time i 6 s o v after approaching close to a turbine the sov then uses its dynamic positioning mode to get close to the turbines and deploys the gangway to transfer the technicians afterwards it un deploys the gangway and retreats from the turbine using again its dynamic positioning mode therefore i 6 s o v includes time to approach and retreat from the turbine to deploy and un deploy the gangway and to transfer the technicians after identifying the first turbine sov is set on the transit mode o 2 and the travel sequence for the rest of the turbines is planned all the remaining turbines are enumerated again based on the distance from the first turbine under the transit mode from this enumeration a turbine j b having minimum distance is selected and placed second in the travelling sequence f s o v similar to j a based on the vessel stay requirement for j b travel time and time taken to complete the maintenance work and accordingly fuel consumed to reach this turbine is calculated similarly the travel sequence of all the turbines in j s o v is identified for the drop off session the total time taken by the sov during the drop off session is the sum of travel time from initial sov location to and between the turbines time taken to reach the far or near stay locations and the total repair time of the turbines which require for the vessel to stay after completing the drop off session optimal planning for the pick up session is carried out during the pick up session the first turbine is the one that is visited last during the drop off session similar to drop off all the combinations of travel patterns between the remaining turbines were enumerated and the combination which gives the lowest fuel consumption and satisfies all the constraints is selected during this process the turbines requiring sov to stay are eliminated it is also noteworthy that sov starts the pick up session only when all the turbines have completed the maintenance work as the prime objective for the framework is to minimize the fuel consumption however it will be significantly increased if the sov travels to the turbines which finish the maintenance work early if all the turbines require the sov to stay then no pick up session will be planned and the sov will go back to its inputted standby location after picking up the technicians from the last turbine if after finishing the drop off and pick up session the total time to complete the maintenance works increases the available weather window or exact time at which maintenance work finishes t m is higher than the inputted maintenance work finish time i 4 e then a different heuristic strategy is adopted to increase the available weather window in this technique a set of failed turbines j s o v is determined for those maintenance works that can be finished within the specified time where j s o v j s o v the pseudo code of this technique is provided in algorithm 3 in this technique if t m i 4 e then all the turbines in j s o v are first sorted based on the distance from i 12 s o v the first turbine in the sorted set of j s o v is removed and inserted to j s o v which is then inputted to algorithm 1 along with i if t m for the first turbine is less than i 4 e then it is taken as the first turbine in the travelling sequence otherwise the second turbine is removed and inserted to j s o v this process is repeated for all the n turbines until a turbine satisfying the condition t m i 4 e is identified if no turbine satisfies this condition then the framework indicates that no turbine can be completely maintained at the present day afterwards the remaining turbines in j s o v are sorted based on the previously selected one and closest one is added to j s o v at this stage there are two turbines in j s o v which is inputted to algorithm 1 to calculate t m if t m i 4 e then that turbine is eliminated from j s o v and another closest one is added to it similarly this process is repeated until there are no turbines left in j s o v algorithm 3 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using sov when all turbines cannot be maintained within a single weather window 3 4 maintenance planning with ctv the operational planning for ctvs is carried in a similar way as for the sov the main difference compared to the operational planning of sov is that the number of available ctvs can be much higher along with the weather window there are constraints on the number of technicians that a ctv can carry and on the weight of the equipment or spare parts moreover during operational planning the framework prefers to use less number of ctvs instead of using multiple ctvs the initial location for ctvs to start the operational work is the sov as ctvs are launched from there the pseudo code for route planning of ctvs is shown in algorithm 4 during the drop off session planning the total number of technicians h t o t a l required by the turbines j c t v which will be visited by the ctv is calculated first if h t o t a l is higher than the technician capacity i 1 c t v of the ctv then it performs multiple journeys to and from the sov to deliver the technicians in multiple journeys however the number of these journeys should be kept to a minimum number therefore a heuristic approach is proposed to perform route planning for ctvs while ensuring a minimum number of ctv journeys and the optimal number of technicians in its every journey in each trip the ctv has to carry a precise number of technicians that will be delivered to respective turbines in case of h t o t a l i 1 c t v to decide the number of trips and technicians in each trip the proposed framework first sorts the j c t v based on the distance from i 12 s o v in the first trip t 1 ctv carries h 1 i 1 c t v technicians and goes to the first turbine j a in j c t v if the number of available technicians on the ctv is greater or equal to the technicians required by j a i 1 j a then this turbine is placed first in the travelling sequence f 1 which is also eliminated from j c t v otherwise this turbine is ignored for this trip and the ctv will move to the next neighbouring turbine now h 1 i 1 j a technicians are being left in the turbine afterwards the turbine in j c t v are again sorted based on distance j a and the ctv visits the first turbine and if available at the ctv required technicians are dropped off at the turbines similarly this process is repeated for all n turbines if after visiting all the turbines there are technicians left on the vessel i e h 1 0 then the aforementioned process is repeated but this time ctv carry h 1 i 1 c t v 1 if no technicians are left then h 1 i 1 c t v 1 technicians ctv will carry its first trip later the ctv will go to the sov to pick up the required number of technicians for the remaining turbines and f 2 travel sequence will be planed insert 3 4 1 clustering strategy if multiple ctvs are available for the particular day and if the overall time taken t m by a single ctv to complete the maintenance work is more than the inputted time i 4 e then the k means clustering technique capó et al 2017 is utilized to divide the turbines into groups clusters based on their distances from the sov for each cluster a ctv is utilized to accommodate the turbines but the total number of clusters cannot be more than the number of available ctvs first the turbines to be maintained are divided into two clusters of turbines using k means clustering and for each cluster algorithm 4 is utilized if the t m for any of the set is greater then i 4 e the number of clusters φ is increased by one and again algorithm 4 is run for each cluster φ continue increasing until for all clusters t m i 4 e however when φ gets equal to the total number of available ctvs and there also exists a cluster for which t m i 4 e then planning of that cluster is performed using a technique similar to algorithm 3 the pseudo code of the clustering techniques is presented in algorithm 5 algorithm 4 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using a single ctv 3 5 maintenance planning with combined sov and ctv the framework can also be used to plan maintenance operations using both sov and ctvs in this case the user is required to indicate the type of vessel which will be used to serve the turbine the framework first creates the two sets of turbines one for sov and one for ctv and route planning for both sets is performed separately it was observed during the experimentation that operational window increases when sov and ctv are used together algorithm 5 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using multiple ctvs 3 6 user interface of optiroute a graphical user interface gui was also developed based on the proposed techniques using the c programming language and the microsoft visual studio platform the gui consists of a main graphical window and an input and output dialog box the main window shown in fig 3 is an opengl shreiner et al 2013 based interface for the visualization of the turbines and planning of the vessel routing during the maintenance work to start the operational planning for a particular day the user first accesses the input dialog box which is shown in fig 4 a the user then enters all the required inputs associated with climate vessel configuration and location a separate dialog box is created to input the turbine attributes and failure data which can be seen in fig 4 b and can be accessed from the input dialog box the framework outputs such as total cost overall fuel consumption and total time taken to complete the maintenance work and travel sequence of the vessel can be viewed from the output dialog box fig 4 c instead of using the input dialog boxes the user can also use a standard input microsoft excel file with different sheets for input categories 4 results and discussion in this section the proposed optimization framework using different test cases is presented and verified it has to be noted that a variety of test cases are presented in order to demonstrate the applicability of optiroute the mentioned cases have been also conducted after consultation with a major sov owner operator 4 1 optimization framework verification in this subsection a number of case studies and output results are presented for different test cases six different test cases were carried out to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the framework first four test cases represent the operational planning using an sov under different parametric configuration the operational planning using ctv is given in the fifth test case the last test case demonstrates the operational planning when both ctv and sov are used simultaneously the input data related to climate sov ctv wind farm and cost utilized to run these test cases are presented in tables 7 11 respectively which is obtained from an existing wind farm based in the united kingdom name and location of this wind farm are not mentioned due to confidentiality reasons as shown in table 7 the maintenance work in each case study starts at 05 00 h and has to be finished before the sun set time the single weather window is considered with average significant wave height and wind speed of 1 07 m and 10 42 m s respectively which is the weather data of a particular day and obtained from internal communications with the vessel owner operator only one sov and three ctvs are considered and the maximum operational wind speed and wave height for both vessel types are higher than the average significant wave height and wind speed for the sov the average time to approach the turbine and to deploy the gangway for technicians transfer is assumed to be equal to 30 min and the technician transfer time for ctv is set to 15 min through communication with industry experts there are 91 turbines in the wind farm whose location layout is shown in fig 4 which is plotted using their actual longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates showing on the x and y axis respectively it should be noted that all the results provided in figs 1 11 are the framework actual outputs and plots correspond to the framework graphical interface 4 1 1 employing sov only case study i in this case table 12 gives the input specifications of this test case and fig 6 depicts the graphical results of the optimised route plan the wind turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with the sov while the arrows show the way in and back from the standby location to the wind turbines four turbines turbine 4 turbine 20 turbine 36 and turbine 52 are considered to be maintained using the sov all the turbines required the sov to stay among these turbines two of them require sov to perform the short stay while the remaining two necessitate far stay during maintenance operations to pick up the technicians the sov performed a far stay for two of them while for the other two it remained close to the turbine all turbines required minor repair work apart from turbine 36 for which the estimated total repair time is 6 h the locations of the sov at the start and after finishing the work is different the output results of the framework in fig 10 show that the maintenance work finished at 18 51 h with overall fuel consumption of 10 202 79 l t all the turbines are maintained and technicians are recovered with the following sov travailing sequence 36 fs 20 ns 4 ns 52 fs here ns and fs represent the near stay and far stay respectively case study ii table 13 presents the failure data utilized for this test case in which no turbine requires for the sov to be present during the maintenance operations maintenance work for each turbine requires a varying number of technicians fig 7 shows the results of the framework in which turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with sov and the arrows show the way in and back from standby location to the turbines the initial standby location is represented with a solid triangle similar to case study i maintenance work is carried out using the sov however none of the turbines requires sov to stay in total 7 turbines turbine 4 turbine 5 turbine 6 turbine 12 turbine 23 turbine 45 and turbine 50 require minor maintenance work the maintenance work starts at 05 00 h and finishes at 14 55 h and all the turbines are maintained with overall fuel consumption of 11 387 81 l t the travel sequence of the sov during the drop off session is 12 d 6 d 5 d 4 d 23 d 50 d 45 d here the d symbol represents the delivery of the technicians as all the turbines do not require sov to stay therefore optimizing the drop off session the route planning for the sov to pick up the technicians is carried out the sov s travel sequence during the pick up session is 45 p 50 p 12 p 6 p 5 p 4 p 23 p where symbol p represents the technicians pick up the sov has the same start and return location case study iii failure data utilized in this test case and its results are shown in table 14 and fig 8 respectively table 14 provides the input specifications of the failed turbines among these turbines only one require sov to perform the short stay and remaining two necessitate far stay during maintenance operations maintenance work for each turbine requires a varying number of technicians fig 8 shows the graphical results for this test case in which turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with sov and the arrows show the way in and back from standby location to the turbines in this test case four turbines require maintenance work which is carried out with the sov three turbines require the sov to stay near them and one of them requires a far stay similar to case study i sov s initial standby location and standby location after finishing the maintenance work are different turbine 4 turbine 9 turbine 21 and turbine 22 are recovered with the following sov travel sequence 21 fs 9 ns 4 ns 22 fs the overall fuel consumption for this case study is 5264 31 l t and maintenance work is finished at 16 28 case study iv similar to the previous three test cases in this test case seven turbines turbine 56 turbine 70 turbine 71 turbine 72 turbine 77 turbine 78 and turbine 79 required minor maintenance work using sov table 15 presents the input specifications and the failure data utilized for this test case fig 9 shows the results of the framework and turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with sov and the arrows show the way in and back from standby location to the turbines all turbines require sov to perform a near stay during maintenance with the different initial and final destination which is depicted with a grey solid triangle all the turbines required sov to perform the near stay sov started the maintenance from the port therefore out of seven turbines turbine 56 and turbine 79 cannot be served on the present day and the maintenance work for these two turbines is shifted to the next day the maintenance work finishes at 17 07 with the sov s travelling sequence as follows 72 ns 78 ns 77 ns 71 ns 70 ns the overall fuel consumption in the case is 8792 21 l t 4 1 2 ctvs only case study v in this sub section we discuss a case study for ctvs the maintenance work is carried out using a single ctv while none of the turbines requires the vessel to stay at the turbine failure data and input specifications for this test case are shown in table 16 and the results obtained from the optimization framework for this case are given in fig 10 turbines highlighted in red in fig 10 require maintenance work to be carried out in two different journeys of ctv the arrows show the way in and back from sov to the turbines none of the failed tribunes requires ctv to stay during maintenance and it comes back to sov after completing maintenance work whose location is depicted with a solid grey triangle the maintenance starts after the ctv is launched from the sov to transfer the technicians ctv performs two journeys from the sov in the first trip the ctv carries 11 technicians and delivers them to turbine 4 5 6 and 32 after delivering the technicians to these turbines the ctv goes back to the sov and picks up 7 more technicians and delivers them to turbines 23 50 and 57 the travel sequences of ctv during the first and second journey of the drop off session are sov 4 d 5 d 6 d 32 d sov and sov 23 d 50 d 45 d sov respectively similarly the travel sequence is sov 45 d 50 d 32 d 23 d 5 d sov and sov 4 d 6 d sov respectively for the first and second journey during the pick up session the maintenance work starts at 05 00 and finishes at 11 50 with overall fuel consumption of 535 43 l it should be noted that the maintenance work finish time for this case is less compared to the previous cases this is due to the fact that travel time for the ctv is less compared to sov and that no turbine requires a ctv to stay at the turbine therefore the maintenance work for all the turbines is carried out in parallel and finishes in less amount of time 4 1 3 employing a combination of sov and ctv case study vi in this case we discuss a test case in which both a ctv and an sov are used in parallel the failure data and input specification given in table 17 used in this test case are similar to the one used in case study v however the maintenance work for turbines 4 5 and 32 is carried out using an sov it is noteworthy that the maintenance work finishes approximately 2 h earlier when a ctv and an sov are used together the overall fuel consumption of the sov and ctv is 3938 88 l t and 22 281 l t respectively the results of this test case can be seen in fig 11 4 2 overall results in this sub section the overall results and findings of all the case studies are discussed as shown in table 18 in the first four cases the sov is used for maintenance work of different turbines under different parameter settings for the first three cases all the turbines were visited by the sov and the maintenance work was completed within the given weather window sov is also utilized for the fourth case study but the initial position of the sov before starting the maintenance work was considered as the hub port therefore the sov is unable to visit turbine 56 and turbine 79 within the given weather window the overall fuel consumption of case study ii is higher compared to the other cases as in this case the number of turbines visited by the sov is higher furthermore the failure data used in case study v and vi is the same however the overall time to finish the maintenance work in case vi is smaller than in case v during the experimentation it was observed that the overall time taken to perform the maintenance work is less and a higher number of turbines can be accommodated when sov and ctv are used together in comparison to the other test cases thanks to the effective heuristic strategy used in the proposed framework the computational time to perform optimization for all the test cases was less than a minute this time may increase if there is a larger number of turbines that have to be visited however it will be still efficient enough to allow daily and spontaneous route and maintenance planning for both sov and ctv although a comparative study would further verify the proposed approach and help to analyse the quality of the solutions it was not possible due to the novelty of the problem as discussed before to the best of the authors knowledge non of the existing approaches for route planning of maintenance vessels of wind turbines replicates the realistic scenario and tackles the similar aspects of the problem such as usage of combined sovs and ctvs under the various operation modes of vessels while including different weather windows 5 conclusions and future work the present study proposes an optimization framework for the daily operational planning of the maintenance fleet on an offshore wind farm a heuristic optimization technique was developed and integrated within the framework the new framework optimizes the entire maintenance task sequence in order to reduce the overall fuel consumption and increase the overall wind farm operational window during the optimization process the climate data such as average significant wave height and average wind speed for a particular day is used to plan a single weather window the framework also considers the inputs related to the vessels specifications and their fuel consumption to simulate an actual scenario a different number of inputs related to wind turbines were also considered during the optimization the optimization for the ctvs and sov is performed separately and the whole maintenance operation task is divided into two sessions pick up and drop off ones the framework first optimally plans the drop off session and if required the framework then plans the pick up session the fuel consumption for both sessions is calculated to obtain the overall fuel computation for a particular day the reliability and feasibility of the framework were tested using a number of test cases while it was observed that the new framework can reduce overall fuel consumption and increase the operational window to a great extent it was also observed that the operational window increases if sov and ctvs are used together in future the proposed framework can be further enhanced by considering the type of technicians available for the maintenance work and a cluster strategy used to cluster the wind turbines which have similar failure attributes moreover the suggested framework can be integrated with a simulator to optimize the operational activities for the entire life cycle of the wind farm providing the corresponding life cycle technical and financial outputs along with the concept of offshore resource centre rahman et al 2020 we also intend to integrate a failure model similar to scheu et al 2017 within the proposed framework credit authorship contribution statement

20945,to increase energy production offshore wind farms are currently installed far from shore providing a challenge for vessels to undertake maintenance tasks from the designated hub port service operation vessels sovs are utilized to carry out the offshore wind turbines maintenance tasks which act as a servicing station having required technicians and daughter crafts i e crew transfer vessels ctv onboard to facilitate on time and on demand servicing of wind turbines this paper proposes an optimization framework called optiroute for daily or short term maintenance operations based on route planning and scheduling while minimizing the cost under different operational constraints different heuristic and clustering techniques are developed and integrated to make the framework computationally effective optiroute considers climate data vessels specifications failure information wind farm attributes and cost related specifics the series of the overall operational tasks are divided into sequential sessions including maintenance crew pick up and drop off tasks while the vessel routing optimization is performed for all sessions separately optiroute reliability is tested by employing different case studies while a user friendly graphical user interface gui is also developed to depict the various maintenance scheduling scenarios experimental results reveal that optiroute can efficiently increase the operational window especially when sov and ctvs are used together keywords offshore wind farm service operation vessel sov crew transfer vessel ctv optimal route planning reduction of fuel consumption maintenance operation maintenance cost reduction 1 introduction recent advancements in the offshore wind turbine technology play a significant role in shaping the world economics and energy dependent industries thereby moving progressively towards greener energy resources however even with the rapid advancements towards efficient offshore wind turbine design these are still not cost effective compared to other renewable energy resources such as solar energy güney 2019 and are not affordable especially by the developing countries ghimire and kim 2018 this is not only due to the high manufacturing and installation cost of the turbines but also because of the associated high maintenance and operation cost which accounts significantly in case of offshore wind farms li et al 2016 in order to address this challenge there have been many efforts put forward to develop efficient methods and digital frameworks for planning maintenance operations of offshore wind farms however the offshore wind sector is still lagging to effectively adopt and integrate these tools in their day to day operations mainly due to the inherent challenges to simulate realistic operational scenarios moreover most of the current efforts and studies in this field focus on simulating the long term life cycle operational and maintenance planning under the presence of strong assumptions hofmann 2011 apart from the high cost the ineffective planning of maintenance operations with large vessels like service operation vessel sov and crew transfer vessels ctv can result in high fuel consumption leading to an increment of overall maintenance cost and more importantly this also contributes towards the carbon footprint of the offshore wind farms according to a study by kaldellis and apostolou 2017 the operational and maintenance activities may account up to 5 10 of the total greenhouse emissions throughout the life cycle of an offshore wind farm therefore the planning of the daily operations and maintenance work in an offshore wind farm is an essential but complex and challenging problem irawan et al 2017 one of the key factors that significantly affect the overall maintenance cost is the route planning and scheduling of the maintenance fleet to transport technicians and spare parts to each turbine requiring the maintenance work on a daily or short term basis in general the main objective of the operational planning task is to provide an optimal maintenance vessel routing and a maintenance schedule for a particular day within the planning horizon for any type of maintenance activity which is identified prior to the optimization the optimization is carried out while minimizing the overall maintenance cost and maximizing the wind farm availability various factors constraints affect the optimal planning of the maintenance activities within an offshore wind farm including weather conditions such as significant wave height and wind speed availability type and size of maintenance vessels failure type maintenance crew spare parts etc once these constraints are taken into account the decision has to be made on 1 type of vessels to be used to carry out the particular maintenance work and 2 the visiting sequence of the turbines by the vessels used during the suggested maintenance work generally in practice and for a particular day the maintenance operation starts with a report indicating the list of turbines requiring maintenance or repair work then for each turbine and failure type the number and type of technicians spare parts and estimated time to complete the maintenance work are identified furthermore the specific vessel type to carry out the maintenance work and visit the wind turbines as well as the requirement for the vessel to stay in close proximity or not during the maintenance work is also specified later on taking into account the prevailing climate and other operational constraints an operations department member of staff creates a transfer plan stock williams and swamy 2019 and provides it to the maintenance team the travelling sequence of the vessels visiting the various wind turbines is manually determined either before or during the maintenance work if the vessel is required to stay close to the turbine during the maintenance work its waiting stand by location is usually determined by the vessel captain stock williams and swamy 2019 state that for 10 maintenance tasks there can be approximately 3 6 million possibilities for the creation of an operational plan therefore manually planning of these activities can be extremely cumbersome and time consuming there exist a substantial amount of literature work which addresses this particular challenge either using optimization dai et al 2015 irawan et al 2017 stock williams and swamy 2019 or simulation abdollahzadeh et al 2016 dalgic et al 2015a c li et al 2016 martin et al 2016 tools the majority of the existing studies are simulation based ones simulating the maintenance operations for the entire life cycle of the wind farm on the other hand the routing optimization problem addressed in the literature is overwhelmingly complicated which mostly results in high computational cost and local optimal solution laporte 2009 however to the best of the authors knowledge no existing optimization based work reflects a complete realistic scenario on the usage of sov ctv or their combination for the daily route planning also including an estimation of the vessels fuel consumption which is one of the important economic advantages of the entire offshore wind farm s maintenance planning operation considering the complexity and criticality of the problem there is a need for a computationally robust and effective operational planning framework therefore the present study proposes the development of an optimal operational planning framework optiroute which provides both on board the ships and at the on shore operations and maintenance base the capability to plan and assess offshore wind farm operations in advance based on optimal route planning vessel positions weather conditions as well as considering the expected fuel consumption and associated cost the main contributions of the present work include 1 a novel optimal operational planning methodology based on the two types of vessels sov and ctv used separately or combined 2 a computationally effective heuristic optimization and cluster strategy for optimal daily or short term route planning and scheduling under the presence of operational constraints 3 verification of the proposed framework under different operational scenarios 4 development and implementation of a user graphic interface ugi to depict above scenarios in the proposed framework daily route planning and scheduling occur by considering five sets of input parameters related to the climate maintenance fleet wind farm turbine failure and cost a novel optimization and planning strategy is developed after carefully analyzing the currently practised operational planning at different wind farms which is integrated into the proposed framework in order to provide a complete realistic daily route planning and scheduling of maintenance vessels furthermore to make the framework computationally effective the optimization problem is simplified by dividing the planning task for any particular day into two sessions technician drop off and pick drop sessions then a k mean clustering capó et al 2017 and iterative optimization kelley 1999 based strategies are developed to ensure the usage of the optimum number of vessels and to effectively plan both sessions while satisfying the vessels operational constraints in this respect the present paper is structured as follows section two demonstrates the related work and existing literature on the suggested issue in hand section three further elaborates on the novel proposed optimization framework of the daily route planning and scheduling of maintenance vessel activities in offshore wind farms section four presents the results and discussion on a number of different case studies related to the above framework and finally section 5 provides the final comments and suggestions for future work concluding the present paper 2 relevant literature there are various efforts put forward by different researchers to address the operational challenge of offshore wind farms as mentioned previously existing studies can be broadly categorized into two categories simulation based ones abdollahzadeh et al 2016 dalgic et al 2015a c erguido et al 2017 li et al 2016 martin et al 2016 sarker and faiz 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which simulate the operational planning of the entire life of the wind farm based on the predictive turbine failure and optimization based ones dai et al 2015 dawid et al 2017 gutierrez alcoba et al 2019 irawan et al 2017 raknes et al 2017 schrotenboer uit het broek jargalsaikhan and roodbergen 2018 stålhane et al 2015 stock williams and swamy 2019 which try to optimize the maintenance scheduling problems for the predetermined preventive corrective and condition based maintenance tasks in this section we describe some of the current literature which focuses on the daily route planning and scheduling problem for offshore wind farms recently a metaheuristic optimization methodology was proposed by stock williams and swamy 2019 to determine strengths and weaknesses in any maintenance plan and provides an estimation on investment from implementation which follows the analogy of the travelling salesman problem for route planning in an offshore wind farm the authors argue that compared to heuristic and exact optimizers metaheuristics are more flexible while they also are problem independent optimization techniques as it does not require any amendments in the optimizer itself with the change of objective therefore compared to heuristic these should be adopted to address the operational problem in offshore wind farms however due to their random search nature metaheuristics do not ensure an optimal solution to the problem and require a large number of iterations to find a near optimal solution which makes them computationally expensive in dai et al 2015 the authors proposed a mathematical model for vessel routing and scheduling problem of maintenance vessel for an offshore wind farm in order to determine the optimal routes from the maintenance port to the failed turbines to transfer the maintenance technicians optimization was performed using a commercial software xpress optimizer and maintenance operation was performed with two different vessels recently based on dai s work irawan et al 2017 proposed a maintenance operational planning method for multiple wind farms and the optimization problem was solved by using the mixed integer linear programming however unlike the proposed framework dai et al 2015 and irawan et al 2017 suggested the planning and initiation of the maintenance operations from the hub port moreover he above maintenance works neither address the problem of specifically using sovs and ctvs nor include the vessels stay and waiting time at the wind turbine location and process of performing a far or short stay stålhane et al 2015 proposed two different optimization models such as arc flow which is based on a commercial software using a branch and bound technique to solve the optimization and the path flow which used a heuristic based method to generate an optimal subset of routes and schedules for the vessels an adaptive large neighborhood search alhs heuristic for the short term operational planning was proposed by schrotenboer et al 2018 alhs optimizes the vessel routes for technician pick up and delivery in order to investigate the technician sharing between different wind farms over multiple periods a similar approach was also utilized by raknes et al 2017 however instead of starting the maintenance work from the maintenance port raknes et al 2017 have taken into account the vessel stay at the wind farm during multiple shifts a clustering based heuristic algorithm was proposed by dawid et al 2017 in their approach the failed turbines were first clustered which were then sorted based on the total number of technicians required by the turbines in each cluster and a maintenance vessel was utilized in order to plan the maintenance operations in each cluster along with the operational planning and vessel scheduling some authors stålhane et al 2019 have also integrated the optimization of the size and type of the maintenance fleet however along with the usage of sovs and ctvs none of the aforementioned works incorporates the different operation modes of the maintenance vessels such as fast transit transit and dynamic positioning mode moreover most of the existing works use commercial optimizers which also limits their usage apart from the specific optimization based approaches maintenance operation and route planning is also performed based on the human factors for instance a hybrid human error assessment and reduction technique is proposed by islam et al 2020 to estimate human error probability hep for marine and offshore systems a data driven study was performed by musharraf et al 2020 which used a decision tree algorithm to create a set of decision rules these rules were then used to describe how people use different attributes of emergency scenarios to choose an egress route furthermore similar to the concept of sov rahman et al 2020 developed an offshore resource centre orc which acts as a service station at sea and carries anything required for short and long term maintenance including technicians and materials this enables the maintenance operations to be carried out quickly and effectively thereby increasing the offshore wind farm productivity here the concept of orc is proposed in a more generic form and in a broader sense have risk reduction objectives to provide an intermediate point for helicopters and also provide forward staging or response asset for an emergency in another recent study rahman et al colbourne and khan n d also performed a risk based cost benefit analysis of the orc 3 proposed framework in this section the algorithmic detail of optiroute will be first introduced after describing the basic terminologies the proposed mathematical model for daily route planning with sov and ctv in line with the cluster and optimization techniques and optiroute s user interface will be introduced fig 1 shows the workflow of optiroute with its inputs and outputs the overall optimization workflow of the proposed framework considers four different sets of input parameters such as the climate vessel specifications and fleet configuration wind farm attributes the turbines failure attributes and cost these inputs are then processed during an optimization process in order to optimize the daily routing of sovs and ctvs so as to plan the maintenance tasks for the failed wind turbines the whole operational task is completed with multiple sovs ctvs and or combination of both based on the inputted data the framework starts the optimization process with the objective to minimize the fuel consumption and maximize the wind farm availability while using the least number of maintenance vessels 3 1 basic terminology and problem description let a wind farm w consist of n wind turbines on a particular day there exist a set j of n turbines requiring maintenance work which we shall call as failed turbines i e j j j j 1 2 n w the objective for the proposed framework is to complete the maintenance work for j within the planning horizon using a single or multiple sovs v s o v v v s o v v 1 2 n s o v ctvs v c t v v v c t v v 1 2 n c t v or combination of both while minimizing the total distance travelled d t o t a l and fuel consumption f t o t a l thereby minimizing the overall operational cost furthermore to complete the maintenance work within the planning horizon the total time t t o t a l taken to complete the maintenance work should be less than or equal to the available weather window to start the route planning and scheduling for j the framework requires a set of user specified input parameters i i e i v i w i j i c associated with the weather i e i 1 e i 4 e maintenance vessels i v wind farm i w i 1 w i 4 w failed turbines i j and fuel cost i c for each turbine in j the framework requires a separate subset of input parameters such as i j i i j i 1 2 8 j 1 2 n moreover if multiple sovs or ctvs are considered to be utilized then the framework considers that all the sovs and ctvs are of similar characteristics and requires vessel specification parameters for sov i s o v and ctv i c t v separately i e i v i s o v i c t v after defining i the framework first creates two sets of turbines j s o v and j c t v each one is a subset of j i e j s o v j c t v j containing the turbines which are required to be serviced by v s o v and v c t v respectively during the simulation the framework finds an optimal travelling sequence for v s o v and v c t v to serve j while taking into account the operational constraints and minimizing the overall fuel consumption in litres thereby minimizing the overall distance travelled by vessels and increasing the weather window fig 2 illustrates the route planning of the maintenance vessels using the proposed framework as discussed earlier the proposed optimization framework is used for daily and short term planning and scheduling of maintenance work in this respect it is assumed that the user operator is already aware of the specific failure type therefore similar to gutierrez alcoba et al 2019 raknes et al 2017 stock williams and swamy 2019 no specific failure model is directly integrated within the proposed framework the optimization process for route planning commences by sorting the turbine based on their distance from the current location of the maintenance vessels which can be either in port or at standby location instead of considering distance as an input the proposed framework considers the locations of turbines j maintenance hub port r and standby positions s of sov as longitudinal p l o n and latitudinal p l a t coordinates i e p p l p l a t l p l o n l j r s the haversine distance formula hdf bradley 1942 was utilized to precisely calculate the distance between turbines port and standby positions therefore the location of a j t h turbine in j is represented using longitudinal p l o n and latitudinal p l a t coordinates i e p j p j j p l o n j j p l a t j j j 1 2 n and the haversine distance d p j p p j q between two failed turbines j p and j q is measured using equation 1 where p j p and p j q represents the position of j p and j q respectively 1a δ p l a t p l a t j p p l a t j q δ p l o n p l o n j p p l o n j q ω sin 2 δ p l a t 2 cos p l a t j p cos p l a t j q sin 2 δ p l o n 2 1b λ 2 atan 2 ω 1 ω 1c d p j p p j q ω λ 3 hdf measures the great circle distance in meters m between two points using their longitudes and latitudes which is the shortest distance over the earth surface unlike other distance formulas such as the spherical law of cosines banerjee 2004 the hdf is well conditioned even for the numerical computation of small distances as in reality the voyage of a vessel between two turbines is not performed in a straight line therefore a contagious factor η of the percentage of overall distance travelled by vessels was also added to induce the effect of curvy motion of the maintenance vessels while travelling among the turbines so the curvy haversine distance between j p and j q is measured using equation 2 2 d p j p p j q ω λ 1 η 100 the time taken in hours h and vessels fuel consumed in litres l t to travel between j p and j q is calculated using equations 3 and 4 3 t p j p p j q d p j p p j q s o 4 f p j p p j q t p j p p j q f o where s o and f o is the vessel speed in meter per hours m h and fuel consumption in litre per hours l h at fast transit o 1 transit o 2 and dynamic position o 3 operational mode i e s o f o o 1 o 2 o 3 which will be discussed in detail later in this section 3 2 framework input parameters as described in the previous section the suggested optimization framework considers a set of input parameters such as the weather maintenance fleet wind farm turbine failure and cost below we give a brief description of each set of input parameters 3 2 1 climate inputs i e for the climate inputs there is a single weather window per day for maintenance vessels therefore significant wave height and average wind speed with at least a minute resolution for the whole day are taken into account to start the maintenance work the predicted average wind speed and significant wave height must be lower than the maximum operation wind speed and significant wave height of the vessels the starting time of the maintenance work is also essential to initiate the optimization process if this time is not provided then the sunrise time is considered as the start time of the maintenance work furthermore if the average significant wave height and wind speed are less than the vessels maximum limit for the whole day then the weather window is considered as the one between maintenance work s start time and sunset time the weather window also reflects the best time to carry out the maintenance work as it is particularly related with good accessibility to the turbine table 1 provides a set of input parameters associated with climate 3 2 2 turbine failure inputs i j the daily planning of the maintenance work requires the identification of failed turbines to be served on a particular day therefore the main input required by the framework is the turbine failure information which contains the set of turbines j needed to be maintained on any particular day type of vessel used to perform maintenance work the number of technicians required to complete the maintenance work i 1 j vessels stay information at the turbines predicted total time it takes to complete the maintenance work etc for each failed turbine in j a set of the input parameter shown in table 2 are essential for the framework to plan the vessels optimal routing moreover the total repair time for a turbine includes time taken by the technician to 1 reach the turbine 2 finish the maintenance work and 3 test the turbine here it is noteworthy that the equipment weight and the number of technicians are considered as operational constraints while planning the maintenance operations with ctvs these will be only taken into account by the framework if the user selects to employ a ctv for the whole operational planning task or a set of turbines in the proposed framework the decision on the selection of the vessel for a turbine is made by the user however it is recommended to use sov for a turbine if it requires an equipment replacement which weights more then the ctv s load carrying capacity or if the type of the failure associated with the turbine is of major failure which requires long repair time and more number of technicians another important parameter that greatly affects the operational planning is the identification of whether the vessel is required to be present at the turbine during the maintenance operation from the daily maintenance planning of real case studies of an existing wind farm it was observed that after delivering the technicians a vessel may perform either a near stay i e staying close to the turbine or a far stay i e staying at a specified location far from the turbine but close to the wind farm therefore to represent a more realistic scenario if the vessel stays at the turbine then the framework considers the type of stay near stay or far stay for each turbine the near stay location of the vessel is represented as a measure of its overall unit length on the other hand if far stay is chosen then the location of this needs to be inputted as well 3 2 3 vessel specification inputs i v another set of critical inputs are related to the maintenance vessels specifications as the operational planning is performed using sov and cvt so the specification for these two vessel types is required as input as well offshore support vessel i s o v table 3 shows the input related to sovs specifications in the current study it is considered that there is only one sov available however the framework can be used with multiple sovs in order to increase the weather window for an sov three different operational modes tasks are considered fast transit transit and dynamic positioning these tasks are segmented based on the sov s operational speed and fuel consumption during the development of the proposed framework it was observed that the sov is on fast transit task while moving outside the wind farm and it is on the transit task while travelling within the wind farm the dynamic position mode of the vessel is also included which is only used when sov approaches towards the turbine to deploy the gangway to transfer technicians and equipment to the wind turbine this mode is also used when sov requires to perform a near stay at the turbine crew transfer vessel i c t v inputs related to the ctvs are shown in table 4 as mentioned before in an offshore wind farm sov act as a service platform and ctvs are launched from sov if they are required to be utilized during the maintenance work within the wind farm therefore the maintenance work starting location for the ctvs is the same as for the sov s moreover in the case of ctvs the technician and equipment carrying capacity of ctv are considered as operational constraints 3 2 4 offshore wind farm inputs i w the framework takes into account the location of the turbines port and sov standby location as longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates table 5 shows the input parameters related to the wind farm and vessel locations 3 2 5 cost input i c as the framework optimizes the operational work while minimizing the total distance and fuel consumption therefore only cost associated inputs for the framework is the costs of the sov and ctv engine fuel table 6 3 3 maintenance planning with sov to simplify the operational planning problem the whole planning task is partitioned into two sessions drop off and pick up sessions drop off session begins when the sov leaves the port or its standby location and ends when the technicians are dropped off at the last turbine only if the last turbine does not require sov to stay however if the last turbine requires sov to stay then the drop off session finishes after sov completes the near or far stay for the last turbine after the drop off session the pick up session begins which includes route planning to pick up the technicians from the turbines this session is planned excluding the turbines which require sov to stay this session ends when the sov reaches the inputted standby location the optimization is performed separately for both sessions and the fuel consumption cost and overall time taken to complete the maintenance work is the sum of both drop in and pick up sessions the pseudo code of this heuristic route planning approach using sov is provided in algorithm 1 and explained below before planning any of the two sessions the framework first checks if average significant wave height and average wind speed are less then the vessels limiting significant wave height and average wind speed i 1 e i 2 s o v and i 2 e i 3 s o v if this condition is satisfied then the framework first starts planning the drop off session in drop off session first the framework identifies the present location of sov which can be either at port or standby p l l r s afterwards a turbine j a having the minimum distance from p l is identified it is placed first in the travelling sequence f s o v of sov and eliminated from j s o v if it requires to stay at the turbine so during maintenance planning this turbine will be visited first this was done in order to take into account the sov s different operating mode i e o 1 o 2 and o 3 outside the wind farm the sov performs a fast transit task i e to travel from port standby location to j a and inside the wind farm the sov employs the transit task which is considered when the sov travels among the turbines as the sov has different operational speed at these modes therefore the fuel consumption the time taken to travel and the overall cost are different at these modes as well as stated before it was observed from a real scenario of an existing wind farm that when the sov is required to stay at the turbine it either stays somewhere near the turbine or at a specific location which is far from the turbine but close to the wind farm the sov waits at these locations to pick up the technicians before travelling to other turbines as mentioned in subsection 3 2 2 to include this behaviour of the sov the framework takes two further inputs by the user the sov is required to stay at a turbine then the user has to identify whether it will be staying close or far from the turbine these two scenarios are categorized as near stay and far stay by the framework for near stay the sov stays at a distance equal to one unit of the overall length which is industry standard it is noteworthy that to move at this distance the framework takes into account the dynamic positioning mode and calculates the fuel consumption based on this mode whereas if the sov has to perform a far stay waiting then the user is required to input the location coordinates where the sov will stay during the maintenance work of that turbine in this case the fuel consumption for the sov to travel to this location is calculated based on the transit task algorithm 1 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using sov algorithm 2 the pseudo code of pick up session planning for sov if the time taken by the sov to travel to the far stay location is more than the total repair time required by the turbine i e i 3 j a 2 t i 7 j a p j a then it is recommended to select the near stay waiting option instead of the far stay one moreover to increase the operational window sov leaves the far stay location before the maintenance work is finished for instance consider that the maintenance work at a particular turbine finishes at 13 00 h and it takes the sov half an hour to reach to that turbine from its far stay location then the sov will leave the far stay location at 12 30 h to pick up the technicians so that it reaches the turbine on time this option increases the operational window to a substantial amount the waiting time t s o v j a for the sov at j a during the far stay i 7 j a or near stay i 8 j a is equal to 5 i 3 j a 2 t i 7 j a p j a or i 3 j a 2 t i 8 j a p j a respectively which is the turbine s total repair time i 3 j a minus twice the time taken by the sov to reach the stay locations if j a requires vessel to stay then time taken to complete the maintenance work for j a is the sum of time taken by the sov to travel to j a t p l p j a time taken to perform far or near stay t i 7 j a p j a or t i 8 j a p j a waiting time t s o v j a and twice of average dynamic position and crew transfer time i 6 s o v after approaching close to a turbine the sov then uses its dynamic positioning mode to get close to the turbines and deploys the gangway to transfer the technicians afterwards it un deploys the gangway and retreats from the turbine using again its dynamic positioning mode therefore i 6 s o v includes time to approach and retreat from the turbine to deploy and un deploy the gangway and to transfer the technicians after identifying the first turbine sov is set on the transit mode o 2 and the travel sequence for the rest of the turbines is planned all the remaining turbines are enumerated again based on the distance from the first turbine under the transit mode from this enumeration a turbine j b having minimum distance is selected and placed second in the travelling sequence f s o v similar to j a based on the vessel stay requirement for j b travel time and time taken to complete the maintenance work and accordingly fuel consumed to reach this turbine is calculated similarly the travel sequence of all the turbines in j s o v is identified for the drop off session the total time taken by the sov during the drop off session is the sum of travel time from initial sov location to and between the turbines time taken to reach the far or near stay locations and the total repair time of the turbines which require for the vessel to stay after completing the drop off session optimal planning for the pick up session is carried out during the pick up session the first turbine is the one that is visited last during the drop off session similar to drop off all the combinations of travel patterns between the remaining turbines were enumerated and the combination which gives the lowest fuel consumption and satisfies all the constraints is selected during this process the turbines requiring sov to stay are eliminated it is also noteworthy that sov starts the pick up session only when all the turbines have completed the maintenance work as the prime objective for the framework is to minimize the fuel consumption however it will be significantly increased if the sov travels to the turbines which finish the maintenance work early if all the turbines require the sov to stay then no pick up session will be planned and the sov will go back to its inputted standby location after picking up the technicians from the last turbine if after finishing the drop off and pick up session the total time to complete the maintenance works increases the available weather window or exact time at which maintenance work finishes t m is higher than the inputted maintenance work finish time i 4 e then a different heuristic strategy is adopted to increase the available weather window in this technique a set of failed turbines j s o v is determined for those maintenance works that can be finished within the specified time where j s o v j s o v the pseudo code of this technique is provided in algorithm 3 in this technique if t m i 4 e then all the turbines in j s o v are first sorted based on the distance from i 12 s o v the first turbine in the sorted set of j s o v is removed and inserted to j s o v which is then inputted to algorithm 1 along with i if t m for the first turbine is less than i 4 e then it is taken as the first turbine in the travelling sequence otherwise the second turbine is removed and inserted to j s o v this process is repeated for all the n turbines until a turbine satisfying the condition t m i 4 e is identified if no turbine satisfies this condition then the framework indicates that no turbine can be completely maintained at the present day afterwards the remaining turbines in j s o v are sorted based on the previously selected one and closest one is added to j s o v at this stage there are two turbines in j s o v which is inputted to algorithm 1 to calculate t m if t m i 4 e then that turbine is eliminated from j s o v and another closest one is added to it similarly this process is repeated until there are no turbines left in j s o v algorithm 3 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using sov when all turbines cannot be maintained within a single weather window 3 4 maintenance planning with ctv the operational planning for ctvs is carried in a similar way as for the sov the main difference compared to the operational planning of sov is that the number of available ctvs can be much higher along with the weather window there are constraints on the number of technicians that a ctv can carry and on the weight of the equipment or spare parts moreover during operational planning the framework prefers to use less number of ctvs instead of using multiple ctvs the initial location for ctvs to start the operational work is the sov as ctvs are launched from there the pseudo code for route planning of ctvs is shown in algorithm 4 during the drop off session planning the total number of technicians h t o t a l required by the turbines j c t v which will be visited by the ctv is calculated first if h t o t a l is higher than the technician capacity i 1 c t v of the ctv then it performs multiple journeys to and from the sov to deliver the technicians in multiple journeys however the number of these journeys should be kept to a minimum number therefore a heuristic approach is proposed to perform route planning for ctvs while ensuring a minimum number of ctv journeys and the optimal number of technicians in its every journey in each trip the ctv has to carry a precise number of technicians that will be delivered to respective turbines in case of h t o t a l i 1 c t v to decide the number of trips and technicians in each trip the proposed framework first sorts the j c t v based on the distance from i 12 s o v in the first trip t 1 ctv carries h 1 i 1 c t v technicians and goes to the first turbine j a in j c t v if the number of available technicians on the ctv is greater or equal to the technicians required by j a i 1 j a then this turbine is placed first in the travelling sequence f 1 which is also eliminated from j c t v otherwise this turbine is ignored for this trip and the ctv will move to the next neighbouring turbine now h 1 i 1 j a technicians are being left in the turbine afterwards the turbine in j c t v are again sorted based on distance j a and the ctv visits the first turbine and if available at the ctv required technicians are dropped off at the turbines similarly this process is repeated for all n turbines if after visiting all the turbines there are technicians left on the vessel i e h 1 0 then the aforementioned process is repeated but this time ctv carry h 1 i 1 c t v 1 if no technicians are left then h 1 i 1 c t v 1 technicians ctv will carry its first trip later the ctv will go to the sov to pick up the required number of technicians for the remaining turbines and f 2 travel sequence will be planed insert 3 4 1 clustering strategy if multiple ctvs are available for the particular day and if the overall time taken t m by a single ctv to complete the maintenance work is more than the inputted time i 4 e then the k means clustering technique capó et al 2017 is utilized to divide the turbines into groups clusters based on their distances from the sov for each cluster a ctv is utilized to accommodate the turbines but the total number of clusters cannot be more than the number of available ctvs first the turbines to be maintained are divided into two clusters of turbines using k means clustering and for each cluster algorithm 4 is utilized if the t m for any of the set is greater then i 4 e the number of clusters φ is increased by one and again algorithm 4 is run for each cluster φ continue increasing until for all clusters t m i 4 e however when φ gets equal to the total number of available ctvs and there also exists a cluster for which t m i 4 e then planning of that cluster is performed using a technique similar to algorithm 3 the pseudo code of the clustering techniques is presented in algorithm 5 algorithm 4 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using a single ctv 3 5 maintenance planning with combined sov and ctv the framework can also be used to plan maintenance operations using both sov and ctvs in this case the user is required to indicate the type of vessel which will be used to serve the turbine the framework first creates the two sets of turbines one for sov and one for ctv and route planning for both sets is performed separately it was observed during the experimentation that operational window increases when sov and ctv are used together algorithm 5 the pseudo code of route planning algorithm using multiple ctvs 3 6 user interface of optiroute a graphical user interface gui was also developed based on the proposed techniques using the c programming language and the microsoft visual studio platform the gui consists of a main graphical window and an input and output dialog box the main window shown in fig 3 is an opengl shreiner et al 2013 based interface for the visualization of the turbines and planning of the vessel routing during the maintenance work to start the operational planning for a particular day the user first accesses the input dialog box which is shown in fig 4 a the user then enters all the required inputs associated with climate vessel configuration and location a separate dialog box is created to input the turbine attributes and failure data which can be seen in fig 4 b and can be accessed from the input dialog box the framework outputs such as total cost overall fuel consumption and total time taken to complete the maintenance work and travel sequence of the vessel can be viewed from the output dialog box fig 4 c instead of using the input dialog boxes the user can also use a standard input microsoft excel file with different sheets for input categories 4 results and discussion in this section the proposed optimization framework using different test cases is presented and verified it has to be noted that a variety of test cases are presented in order to demonstrate the applicability of optiroute the mentioned cases have been also conducted after consultation with a major sov owner operator 4 1 optimization framework verification in this subsection a number of case studies and output results are presented for different test cases six different test cases were carried out to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the framework first four test cases represent the operational planning using an sov under different parametric configuration the operational planning using ctv is given in the fifth test case the last test case demonstrates the operational planning when both ctv and sov are used simultaneously the input data related to climate sov ctv wind farm and cost utilized to run these test cases are presented in tables 7 11 respectively which is obtained from an existing wind farm based in the united kingdom name and location of this wind farm are not mentioned due to confidentiality reasons as shown in table 7 the maintenance work in each case study starts at 05 00 h and has to be finished before the sun set time the single weather window is considered with average significant wave height and wind speed of 1 07 m and 10 42 m s respectively which is the weather data of a particular day and obtained from internal communications with the vessel owner operator only one sov and three ctvs are considered and the maximum operational wind speed and wave height for both vessel types are higher than the average significant wave height and wind speed for the sov the average time to approach the turbine and to deploy the gangway for technicians transfer is assumed to be equal to 30 min and the technician transfer time for ctv is set to 15 min through communication with industry experts there are 91 turbines in the wind farm whose location layout is shown in fig 4 which is plotted using their actual longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates showing on the x and y axis respectively it should be noted that all the results provided in figs 1 11 are the framework actual outputs and plots correspond to the framework graphical interface 4 1 1 employing sov only case study i in this case table 12 gives the input specifications of this test case and fig 6 depicts the graphical results of the optimised route plan the wind turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with the sov while the arrows show the way in and back from the standby location to the wind turbines four turbines turbine 4 turbine 20 turbine 36 and turbine 52 are considered to be maintained using the sov all the turbines required the sov to stay among these turbines two of them require sov to perform the short stay while the remaining two necessitate far stay during maintenance operations to pick up the technicians the sov performed a far stay for two of them while for the other two it remained close to the turbine all turbines required minor repair work apart from turbine 36 for which the estimated total repair time is 6 h the locations of the sov at the start and after finishing the work is different the output results of the framework in fig 10 show that the maintenance work finished at 18 51 h with overall fuel consumption of 10 202 79 l t all the turbines are maintained and technicians are recovered with the following sov travailing sequence 36 fs 20 ns 4 ns 52 fs here ns and fs represent the near stay and far stay respectively case study ii table 13 presents the failure data utilized for this test case in which no turbine requires for the sov to be present during the maintenance operations maintenance work for each turbine requires a varying number of technicians fig 7 shows the results of the framework in which turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with sov and the arrows show the way in and back from standby location to the turbines the initial standby location is represented with a solid triangle similar to case study i maintenance work is carried out using the sov however none of the turbines requires sov to stay in total 7 turbines turbine 4 turbine 5 turbine 6 turbine 12 turbine 23 turbine 45 and turbine 50 require minor maintenance work the maintenance work starts at 05 00 h and finishes at 14 55 h and all the turbines are maintained with overall fuel consumption of 11 387 81 l t the travel sequence of the sov during the drop off session is 12 d 6 d 5 d 4 d 23 d 50 d 45 d here the d symbol represents the delivery of the technicians as all the turbines do not require sov to stay therefore optimizing the drop off session the route planning for the sov to pick up the technicians is carried out the sov s travel sequence during the pick up session is 45 p 50 p 12 p 6 p 5 p 4 p 23 p where symbol p represents the technicians pick up the sov has the same start and return location case study iii failure data utilized in this test case and its results are shown in table 14 and fig 8 respectively table 14 provides the input specifications of the failed turbines among these turbines only one require sov to perform the short stay and remaining two necessitate far stay during maintenance operations maintenance work for each turbine requires a varying number of technicians fig 8 shows the graphical results for this test case in which turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with sov and the arrows show the way in and back from standby location to the turbines in this test case four turbines require maintenance work which is carried out with the sov three turbines require the sov to stay near them and one of them requires a far stay similar to case study i sov s initial standby location and standby location after finishing the maintenance work are different turbine 4 turbine 9 turbine 21 and turbine 22 are recovered with the following sov travel sequence 21 fs 9 ns 4 ns 22 fs the overall fuel consumption for this case study is 5264 31 l t and maintenance work is finished at 16 28 case study iv similar to the previous three test cases in this test case seven turbines turbine 56 turbine 70 turbine 71 turbine 72 turbine 77 turbine 78 and turbine 79 required minor maintenance work using sov table 15 presents the input specifications and the failure data utilized for this test case fig 9 shows the results of the framework and turbines highlighted in red require maintenance work to be carried out with sov and the arrows show the way in and back from standby location to the turbines all turbines require sov to perform a near stay during maintenance with the different initial and final destination which is depicted with a grey solid triangle all the turbines required sov to perform the near stay sov started the maintenance from the port therefore out of seven turbines turbine 56 and turbine 79 cannot be served on the present day and the maintenance work for these two turbines is shifted to the next day the maintenance work finishes at 17 07 with the sov s travelling sequence as follows 72 ns 78 ns 77 ns 71 ns 70 ns the overall fuel consumption in the case is 8792 21 l t 4 1 2 ctvs only case study v in this sub section we discuss a case study for ctvs the maintenance work is carried out using a single ctv while none of the turbines requires the vessel to stay at the turbine failure data and input specifications for this test case are shown in table 16 and the results obtained from the optimization framework for this case are given in fig 10 turbines highlighted in red in fig 10 require maintenance work to be carried out in two different journeys of ctv the arrows show the way in and back from sov to the turbines none of the failed tribunes requires ctv to stay during maintenance and it comes back to sov after completing maintenance work whose location is depicted with a solid grey triangle the maintenance starts after the ctv is launched from the sov to transfer the technicians ctv performs two journeys from the sov in the first trip the ctv carries 11 technicians and delivers them to turbine 4 5 6 and 32 after delivering the technicians to these turbines the ctv goes back to the sov and picks up 7 more technicians and delivers them to turbines 23 50 and 57 the travel sequences of ctv during the first and second journey of the drop off session are sov 4 d 5 d 6 d 32 d sov and sov 23 d 50 d 45 d sov respectively similarly the travel sequence is sov 45 d 50 d 32 d 23 d 5 d sov and sov 4 d 6 d sov respectively for the first and second journey during the pick up session the maintenance work starts at 05 00 and finishes at 11 50 with overall fuel consumption of 535 43 l it should be noted that the maintenance work finish time for this case is less compared to the previous cases this is due to the fact that travel time for the ctv is less compared to sov and that no turbine requires a ctv to stay at the turbine therefore the maintenance work for all the turbines is carried out in parallel and finishes in less amount of time 4 1 3 employing a combination of sov and ctv case study vi in this case we discuss a test case in which both a ctv and an sov are used in parallel the failure data and input specification given in table 17 used in this test case are similar to the one used in case study v however the maintenance work for turbines 4 5 and 32 is carried out using an sov it is noteworthy that the maintenance work finishes approximately 2 h earlier when a ctv and an sov are used together the overall fuel consumption of the sov and ctv is 3938 88 l t and 22 281 l t respectively the results of this test case can be seen in fig 11 4 2 overall results in this sub section the overall results and findings of all the case studies are discussed as shown in table 18 in the first four cases the sov is used for maintenance work of different turbines under different parameter settings for the first three cases all the turbines were visited by the sov and the maintenance work was completed within the given weather window sov is also utilized for the fourth case study but the initial position of the sov before starting the maintenance work was considered as the hub port therefore the sov is unable to visit turbine 56 and turbine 79 within the given weather window the overall fuel consumption of case study ii is higher compared to the other cases as in this case the number of turbines visited by the sov is higher furthermore the failure data used in case study v and vi is the same however the overall time to finish the maintenance work in case vi is smaller than in case v during the experimentation it was observed that the overall time taken to perform the maintenance work is less and a higher number of turbines can be accommodated when sov and ctv are used together in comparison to the other test cases thanks to the effective heuristic strategy used in the proposed framework the computational time to perform optimization for all the test cases was less than a minute this time may increase if there is a larger number of turbines that have to be visited however it will be still efficient enough to allow daily and spontaneous route and maintenance planning for both sov and ctv although a comparative study would further verify the proposed approach and help to analyse the quality of the solutions it was not possible due to the novelty of the problem as discussed before to the best of the authors knowledge non of the existing approaches for route planning of maintenance vessels of wind turbines replicates the realistic scenario and tackles the similar aspects of the problem such as usage of combined sovs and ctvs under the various operation modes of vessels while including different weather windows 5 conclusions and future work the present study proposes an optimization framework for the daily operational planning of the maintenance fleet on an offshore wind farm a heuristic optimization technique was developed and integrated within the framework the new framework optimizes the entire maintenance task sequence in order to reduce the overall fuel consumption and increase the overall wind farm operational window during the optimization process the climate data such as average significant wave height and average wind speed for a particular day is used to plan a single weather window the framework also considers the inputs related to the vessels specifications and their fuel consumption to simulate an actual scenario a different number of inputs related to wind turbines were also considered during the optimization the optimization for the ctvs and sov is performed separately and the whole maintenance operation task is divided into two sessions pick up and drop off ones the framework first optimally plans the drop off session and if required the framework then plans the pick up session the fuel consumption for both sessions is calculated to obtain the overall fuel computation for a particular day the reliability and feasibility of the framework were tested using a number of test cases while it was observed that the new framework can reduce overall fuel consumption and increase the operational window to a great extent it was also observed that the operational window increases if sov and ctvs are used together in future the proposed framework can be further enhanced by considering the type of technicians available for the maintenance work and a cluster strategy used to cluster the wind turbines which have similar failure attributes moreover the suggested framework can be integrated with a simulator to optimize the operational activities for the entire life cycle of the wind farm providing the corresponding life cycle technical and financial outputs along with the concept of offshore resource centre rahman et al 2020 we also intend to integrate a failure model similar to scheu et al 2017 within the proposed framework credit authorship contribution statement

schofield 1974 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 one can draw the following conclusions there are numerous criteria that can be used for estimating safety of navigation risk assessment and classification of sea areas in fact the criteria for classifying sea areas are not uniform and the boundary between them is not always clearly defined such a situation may therefore cause problems with distinguishing sea areas difficult for navigation and or restricted sea areas see fig 1 every restricted sea area is an area difficult for navigation however not every difficult sea area can be considered as restricted sea area the example being english channel this sea area due to high traffic intensity frequent occurrences of fog and strong tidal currents is commonly considered as a difficult sea area however according to the manoeuvre s classification of sea areas it can be also considered as unrestricted waters for numerous ships criteria that would normalize sea areas e g based on their assigned navigational risk indicators to easy or difficult to navigate are not always known or due to their complexity are not widely used on seagoing vessels jurdziński 1999 consequently knowledge whether the passage of a ship under a low slung bridge or other suspended obstacle e g a power cable at a given cruising speed is safe or unsafe is not always available and or properly understood by the ship s personnel rutkowski 2019b various methods have been proposed including ship s domain to assess the navigational collision risk of maritime transportation in high seas

concerning an effective method that examines the same risk and gives a specific value for the speed at which the vessel should operate when passing under bridges in shallow water with limited overhead clearance ohc and limited under keel clearance ukc according to voyage instructions and charter party requirements every vessel shall undertake her passage at sea at the best possible speed weather and safe navigation permitting unless otherwise required jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019b according to the colreg international rules and regulations for prevention of collisions at sea guidelines of the land control services and movement organizations including pilot services and vessel traffic systems vts the recommendations of local maritime administrations ship owners guidelines and the rules of so called good sea practice the ship should always move at a safe speed however a safe speed understood according to the provisions of colreg is not the same as the safe speed set according to the rules of so called good maritime practice gucma and jagniszczak 1997 jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2020 vermeer 1977 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 huanga et al 2019 schofield and lynda 2004 in fact safe speed in the understanding of colreg applies only to the speed that allows collision free operation of the ship with respect to objects located on the water surface and not objects located under water or in particular when passing under bridges or other suspended waters obstacles located on the ship passage route in addition these regulations do not specify what should be understood by the term safe speed and what should be considered as the value of that safe speed and what is a dangerous speed the selection of the appropriate value of the ship s speed and the trajectory of the ship s movement in restricted sea areas and especially in shallow waters when passing under bridges on navigational channels is left in the hands of the person conning the ship usually the captain and the rules of the so called good seamanship or maritime practice which is also not clearly defined and not always properly understood another point is the term ship s domain the ship s domain in maritime terminology cheng et al 2017 fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 hansen et al 2013 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 wang 2016 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 zhu et al 2001 is defined as the area around a vessel which is indispensable for maintaining the safety of navigation according to the definition of the ship s domain every ship will be safe in the navigational sense as long as she is the exclusive object that can generate danger within her domain rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b this means that the appearance of any navigational obstacle intruder within the ship s domain its exclusivity area will dramatically increase the navigational risk and may result in an inevitable collision the ship s domain will therefore determine a certain area two dimensional domain or some part of space three dimensional domain around the ship in which to graphically assess the navigational safety of the ship and determine its navigational risk the ship s domain as a measurement of a ship s safety has been well studied since it was proposed although there are many ship s domains e g cheng et al 2017 fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 hansen et al 2013 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 wang 2016 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 zhu et al 2001 with different shapes and sizes obtained by different method most of them are two dimensional 2d domains rather than spatial 3d that would include aspects such as ship squat required under keel clearance ukc and or required overhead clearance ohc 3d domains in port areas were described e g by cheng et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 and rutkowski 2018 rutkowski 2020 they assumed that ship domain is an area 2d domain or part of space 3d domain around the examined object that will enable the navigator to visually assess ship s navigational safety and to determine navigational risk as a result of these analyses the author suggests the use of a simplified three dimensional model of the ship s domain rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2019b in which the selection of the optimal speed of the ship should be considered depending on the potential threats detected in relation to its three axes of shading x y z where v x is the safe speed due to the braking distance stopping the ship at the appropriate time to avoid collision taking into account the need to retain the manoeuvrability of the ship and in particular its turning ability vx depends on the length of the vessel s domain sdl vy is the safe speed due to external disturbances and restrictions on the water lane fairway taking into account the need to maintain the manoeuvrability of the ship and in particular its course stability vy depends on the width of the vessel s domain sdw vz is the safe speed due to the limited value of the under keel clearance ukc and or over head clearance ohc considering the maximum value of the ship s squat effect the ship s draft and air draft ukc and ohc v z depends on

safe speed v zh on shallow waters when passing the bridges or other suspended obstacles calculating based on the analysis of a 3 d model of the ship s domain parameters in the oz plane and in particular the ship s domain height parameter sd h estimated in vertical plane above the water surface 2 methodology for determining charted vertical clearance cvc ship s domain height sd h and optimal safe speed v zh when passing the bridges or other suspended obstacles to determine the charted vertical clearance cvc to estimate the ship s required overhead ohc clearance we need to know what is the meaning of charted elevation what system has been used on navigational charts for measuring the heights of object ashore gucma and jagniszczak 1997 jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019b most of the charted elevation and or heights of objects on land on tidal waters are referred above the mean high water springs mhws line and are measured from mhws so for example heights contours and the height of lights are measured from mhws however we must also keep in mind that the planes of reference are not exactly the same as shown above for all navigational charts and in such cases the navigational officer shall always check for the possible notes under the chart title on the charts covered areas without tides such e g the baltic sea the charted depths heights and vertical clearance are usually described with respect to the mean sea level msl in fact on older british admiralty ba charts in the areas with the tides the clearance under objects is usually given from mhws however this is not the case with new ba charts which refer to highest astronomical tide hat as the name suggests that is the highest tide that can be expected to reach under normal conditions not taking into account any air pressure or wind we can find the height of hat above chart datum for the standard ports on a table of levels on the chart on the tidal water the charted vertical clearance under bridges or power cables are usually marked on charts with respect to the high water reference planes yielding lower vertical clearances on the chart which are safer as such the chance that the observed vertical clearance beneath a bridge is smaller than the charted height is rather small however we must also keep in mind that the planes of reference are not exactly the same as the ones shown above for all navigational charts rutkowski 2019b in the charts covered areas without tides such as the baltic sea the charted vertical clearance charted depths and heights are usually described with respect to the mean sea level which is always appointed with accuracy 0 50 m in fact in this case it means also that in worst scenario the observed vertical clearance under bridge or power cable can be up to 0 50 m smaller than the clearance marked on the chart referred to msl the term clearance height is synonymous with the vertical clearance overhead clearance ohc means the minimum clearance available between the highest point on the vessel and the bridge or other similar structures below which the vessel is required to pass rutkowski 2019b when calculating the overhead clearance the air draft as a vertical height of the ship s highest point above the waterline must be considered to calculate the air draft adt we can use the following formulas for reference see also

including any fixed mast or aerial and in addition 1 under bridges the minimum ohc is 1 m when the local regulations require an overhead clearance at any location in excess of 1 m the greater allowance will prevail 2 if the vessel is required to pass under the power cables the following must be taken into consideration if the voyage orders specify a draft or cargo nomination that after master s best efforts will result in ohc less than the limits mentioned above the master must notify the ship s technical and commercial operations jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019b an ohc limit less than the limits mentioned above may be permitted if allowed by the local regulations rules or recommendations by the relevant authorities and if it has been confirmed that other vessels of similar build size draft and speed have already established the safety of such a transit under prevailing environmental conditions it is also very important to discuss the calculated overhead clearance with the pilot along with the passage plan we must discuss in details the transits under bridges or power cables with reference to the calculated overhead clearance it is important to make the appropriate logbook entries about this discussion if the conditions outlined in this document cannot be met and the vessel is required to breach the overhead clearance limits the captain must generate the

over head clearance ohc r when calculating the required overhead clearance rutkowski 2019b the air draft as a vertical height of the ship s highest point above the waterline must be considered in fact this value can be a little reduced by a part of squat effect which increase in body sink age the squat effect barrass 1994 ferreiro 1992 millward 1990 nowicki 1999 porada 1972 rutkowski 2019b occurs at all times when a vessel is making headway through the water or secured alongside a berth with a flow of water passing around the hull but the amplified effects experienced in confined and shallow waters have a profound effect on the safety of the vessel the squat effect is caused when buoyancy or the hull pressure is reduced and the vessel is forced deeper into the water to support its weight generally as a rule of thumb the squat increases where a channel width is less than 8 25 times the beam combined with a static ukc of less than 20 of the draft nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2019b the squat of the vessel is an approximation of additional immersion based on the following the vessel s draft speed and block coefficient the width and shape of the channel and the available depth squat should be calculated using the speed through the water rather than the speed over the ground barrass 1994 nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b reducing the speed is the best means to reduce a vessel s dynamic draft and is an essential consideration for passage planning also on full form ships such as tankers the squat effect leads to an increase of the forward draft and tends to trim a vessel by the head for squat and ukc calculation the user should always use the form designated for his vessel and accepted by the company nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b otherwise the estimated risk indicator rnd may not be adequate for the ship the tidal stream and current need only be considered in calculating squat when a vessel is secured alongside a berth since the main factor in calculating squat is speed through the water the tidal stream and current will not affect the amount of squat a vessel experiences when underway and making way it must also be noted that any calculation made for squat is approximate and for guidance only due to the inherent inaccuracy of the information affecting it extreme caution and judgment should be exercised in calculating and applying squat keeping potential error on the safe side ferreiro 1992 nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b vermeer 1977 the squat effect equals the total parallel body sink plus any subsequent trimming of the vessel nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b the water flow will follow different patterns in relation to the different shapes of the forward and aft hull the aft hull is shaped to give a stable inflow to the propeller while the forward hull is designed for other objectives differences in the flow pattern influence the hull pressure or buoyancy fluctuations in the buoyancy on the forward and aft hulls lead to trimming of the vessel in general the following applies nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b vermeer 1977 block coefficient c b 0 7 vessel trims forward block coefficient c b 0 7 no apparent trim block coefficient c b 0 7 vessel trims aft for vessels with a block coefficient c b 0 7 the application of squat is based on the following 75 of the squat is an increase in body sinkage and 25 is a change in trim by the head rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b vermeer 1977 while navigating in confined restricted waters other conditions that should be considered along with squat include turning which causes listing and increased drafts depending on the beam of the vessel also the steering characteristics and course keeping ability can be affected when the ukc diminishes that is the turning circle radius may increase in such case the required speed v z can be defined as the ship s safe and or optimal speed due to the limited value of the under keel clearance and over head clearance taking into account the maximum value of the ship s squat ship s draft air draft ukc and ohc in this case v z depends on the ship s domain depth sd d and ship s

meaning as long as it is the exclusive object that can generate danger within its domain with reference to a vertical plane oz of the three dimensional co ordinates xyz established up from the central point of the local ship s reference system one can state unambiguously that every ship will remain safe as long the value of the ship s domain height sd h is smaller than the real value of distance h 0 between water level and the height of the nearest objects hanging above the water therefore component r nd can be referred to as the vertical component of the navigational risk r n which concerns keeping sufficient required over head clearance air draft clearance or shortly risk concerning air draft clearance 16 r n h 0 w h e n h o s d h s d h h o s d h h n w h e n h n h o s d h 1 w h e n h o

navigation with reference to all underwater objects or obstructions hanging above the water on height equal or bigger than h 0 component of the navigational risk r nh 0 if the distance h 0 measured between water level and the height of the nearest objects hanging above the water is smaller or equal to the ship s air draft h n adt that is h o h n according to formula 16 sea passage can be unfeasible 1 1 in our analyses we exclude the situation when the ship can change her draft due to for example a de ballasting operation or highly risky in that situation the value of the navigational risk r nh will equal one and in all probability it will signify unquestionable 100 risk of collision when passing under bridges or other suspended water obstacles e g power cables ropeways furthermore we can also say that the value of navigational risk r nh when passing under bridges or other suspended water obstacles hanging above the water on height h 0 limited between h n and sd h k will be limited between zero and one r nh 0 1 the relationship between vessel speed v ship s air draft h n adt ship s squat domain height sd h and navigational risk factor r nh prepared for vlcc warta has been presented in table 9 and fig 3 table 9 shows that as the speed increases the ship s squat increases the height of the ship s domain decreases and the r nh risk indicator also decreases theoretically one could suppose that at higher speeds the ship crossing under the bridge would be completely safe in relation to required overhead clearance ohc in our case however we must also remember about additional restrictions regarding the required ship s speed v zd described in more details in rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b that concerns keeping required under keel clearance on shallow water and navigation risk factor r nd on low accepted level speeds higher than 9 knots would be too dangerous for the warta ship due to the large ship s squat and factor r nd 1 a ship speed of about 6 knots 1 knot could be considered appropriate 5 conclusion summing up it can be stated that regardless of the voyage option adopted according to colreg regulations and the principles of good seamanship the ship should always move at a safe speed according to colreg what is a safe speed will depend on the vessel and circumstances bearing in mind that every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that it can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions colreg sets out some factors to be considered by all vessels and vessels with operational radar however the unambiguous definition of a safe speed disregarding the ship s margin of safety determined by the outline of its three dimensional domain is too complex an issue which at the present state of knowledge cannot give us an unambiguous answer as to the specific value of the ship s safe speed when navigating in restricted sea areas practice prescribes that choosing the right ship speed in restricted sea areas on confined waters is a form of compromise between the optimal speed due to time or fuel consumption and the safe speed set for the current navigational situation gucma and jagniszczak 1997 jurdziński 1999 nowicki 1999 ozturk et al 2019 porada 1972 rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2019b the optimum speed the right one will therefore be the speed enabling travel to be made at the right time fulfilling the contract and at the same time guaranteeing a constant safety margin so called speed reserves in the event of unpredictable emergency situations and those resulting from the deployment position of navigational obstacles around the ship as a result the optimal speed setting will always be reduced to the comparative analysis of individual components of the safe speed v x v y v z determined based on the outline of the ship s domain from a practical point of view the initial element for the analysis of the navigational risk in restricted waters areas restricted by the water depth air vertical clearance under the bridges and or width of navigable waters is the estimation of the ship s domain parameters her depth sd d height sd h width sd w and length sd l the author s own research e g rutkowski 2016 to rutkowski 2019b proves that these activities calculations can be performed on a ship in real time and their results if necessary e g for controlling the movement of ships manoeuvring in restricted waters based on the value of their navigational risk indicators can be attached to standard reports e g via the ship s automatic identification system ais in practice this means that a thorough analysis of the navigational risk of ships sailing in restricted waters is also possible and may help us choose such conditions internal and or external in which the sea passage will be effective safe and in line with the needs of the global maritime transportation system

schofield 1974 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 one can draw the following conclusions there are numerous criteria that can be used for estimating safety of navigation risk assessment and classification of sea areas in fact the criteria for classifying sea areas are not uniform and the boundary between them is not always clearly defined such a situation may therefore cause problems with distinguishing sea areas difficult for navigation and or restricted sea areas see fig 1 every restricted sea area is an area difficult for navigation however not every difficult sea area can be considered as restricted sea area the example being english channel this sea area due to high traffic intensity frequent occurrences of fog and strong tidal currents is commonly considered as a

based on their assigned navigational risk indicators to easy or difficult to navigate are not always known or due to their complexity are not widely used on seagoing vessels jurdziński 1999 consequently knowledge whether the passage of a ship under a low slung bridge or other suspended obstacle e g a power cable at a given cruising speed is safe or unsafe is not always available and or properly understood by the ship s personnel rutkowski 2019b various methods have been proposed including ship s domain to assess the navigational collision risk of maritime transportation in high seas

concerning an effective method that examines the same risk and gives a specific value for the speed at which the vessel should operate when passing under bridges in shallow water with limited overhead clearance ohc and limited under keel clearance ukc according to voyage instructions and charter party requirements every vessel shall undertake her passage at sea at the best possible speed weather and safe navigation permitting unless otherwise required jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019b according to the colreg international rules and regulations for prevention of collisions at sea guidelines of the land control services and movement organizations including pilot services and vessel traffic systems vts the recommendations of local maritime administrations ship owners guidelines and the rules of so called good sea practice the ship should always move at a safe speed however a safe speed understood according to the provisions of colreg is not the same as the safe speed set according to the rules of so called good maritime practice gucma and jagniszczak 1997 jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2020 vermeer 1977 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 huanga et al 2019 schofield and lynda 2004 in fact safe speed in the understanding of colreg applies only to the speed that allows collision free operation of the ship with respect to objects located on the water surface and not objects located under water or in particular when passing under bridges or other suspended waters obstacles located on the ship passage route in addition these regulations do not specify what should be understood by the term safe speed and what should be considered as the value of that safe speed and what is a dangerous speed the selection of the appropriate value of the ship s speed and the trajectory of the ship s movement in restricted sea areas and especially in shallow waters when passing under bridges on navigational channels is left in the hands of the person conning the ship usually the captain and the rules of the so called good seamanship or maritime practice which is also not clearly defined and not always properly understood another point is the term ship s domain the ship s domain in maritime terminology cheng et al 2017 fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 hansen et al 2013 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 wang 2016 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 zhu et al 2001 is defined as the area around a vessel which is indispensable for maintaining the safety of navigation according to the definition of the ship s domain every ship will be safe in the navigational sense as long as she is the exclusive object that can generate danger within her domain rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b this means that the appearance of any navigational obstacle intruder within the ship s domain its exclusivity area will dramatically increase the navigational risk and may result in an inevitable collision the ship s domain will therefore determine a certain area two dimensional domain or some part of space three dimensional domain around the ship in which to graphically assess the navigational safety of the ship and determine its navigational risk the ship s domain as a measurement of a ship s safety has been well studied since it was proposed although there are many ship s domains e g cheng et al 2017 fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 hansen et al 2013 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 wang 2016 wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 zhu et al 2001 with different shapes and sizes obtained by different method most of them are two dimensional 2d domains rather than spatial 3d that would include aspects such as ship squat required under keel clearance ukc and or required overhead clearance ohc 3d domains in port areas were described e g by cheng et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 and rutkowski 2018 rutkowski 2020 they assumed that ship domain is an area 2d domain or part of space 3d domain around the examined object that will enable the navigator to visually assess ship s navigational safety and to determine navigational risk as a result of these analyses the author suggests the use of a simplified three dimensional model of the ship s domain rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2019b in which the selection of the optimal speed of the ship should be considered depending on the potential threats detected in relation to its three axes of shading x y z where v x is the safe speed due to the braking distance stopping the ship at the appropriate time to avoid collision taking into account the need to retain the manoeuvrability of the ship and in particular its turning ability vx depends on the length of the vessel s domain sdl vy is the safe speed due to external disturbances and restrictions on the water

safe speed v zh on shallow waters when passing the bridges or other suspended obstacles calculating based on the analysis of a 3 d model of the ship s domain parameters in the oz plane and in particular the ship s domain height parameter sd h estimated in vertical plane above the water surface 2 methodology for determining charted vertical clearance cvc ship s domain height sd h and optimal safe speed v zh when passing the bridges or other suspended obstacles to determine the charted vertical clearance cvc to estimate the ship s required overhead ohc clearance we need to know what is the meaning of charted elevation what system has been used on navigational charts for measuring the heights of object ashore gucma and jagniszczak 1997 jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019b most of the charted elevation and or heights of objects on land on tidal waters are referred above the mean high water springs mhws line and are measured from mhws so for example heights contours and the height of lights are measured from mhws however we must also keep in mind that the planes of reference are not exactly the same as shown above for all navigational charts and in such cases the navigational officer shall always check for the possible notes under the chart title on the charts covered areas without tides such e g the baltic sea the charted depths heights and vertical clearance are usually described with respect to the mean sea level msl in fact on older british admiralty ba charts in the areas with the tides the clearance under objects is usually given from mhws however this is not the case with new ba charts which refer to highest astronomical tide hat as the name suggests that is the highest tide that can be expected to reach under normal conditions not taking into account any air pressure or wind we can find the height of hat above chart datum for the standard ports on a table of levels on the chart on the tidal water the charted vertical clearance under bridges or power cables are usually marked on charts with respect to the high water reference planes yielding lower vertical clearances on the chart which are safer as such the chance that the observed vertical clearance beneath a bridge is smaller than the charted height is rather small however we must also keep in mind that the planes of reference are not exactly the same as the ones shown above for all navigational charts rutkowski 2019b in the charts covered areas without tides such as the baltic sea the charted vertical clearance charted depths and heights are usually described with respect to the mean sea level which is always appointed with accuracy 0 50 m in fact in this case it means also that in worst scenario the observed vertical clearance under bridge or power cable can be up to 0 50 m smaller than the clearance marked on the chart referred to msl the term clearance height is synonymous with the vertical clearance overhead clearance ohc means the minimum clearance available between the highest point on the vessel and the bridge or other similar structures below which the vessel is required to pass rutkowski 2019b when calculating the overhead clearance the air draft as a vertical height of the ship s highest point above the waterline must be considered to calculate the air draft adt we can use the following formulas for reference see also

including any fixed mast or aerial and in addition 1 under bridges the minimum ohc is 1 m when the local regulations require an overhead clearance at any location in excess of 1 m the greater allowance will prevail 2 if the vessel is required to pass under the power cables the following must be taken into consideration if the voyage orders specify a draft or cargo nomination that after master s best efforts will result in ohc less than the limits mentioned above the master must notify the ship s technical and commercial operations jurdziński 1999 rutkowski 2019b an ohc limit less than the limits mentioned above may be permitted if allowed by the local regulations rules or recommendations by the relevant authorities and if it has been confirmed that other vessels of similar build size draft and speed have already established the safety of such a transit under prevailing environmental conditions it is also very important to discuss the calculated overhead clearance with the pilot along with the passage plan we must discuss in details the transits under bridges or power cables with reference to the calculated overhead clearance it is important to make the appropriate logbook entries about this discussion if the conditions outlined in this document cannot be met and the vessel is required to breach the overhead clearance limits the captain must generate the temporary deviations from the company procedures if in doubt he she shall abort the passage or vacate the berth keep all parties informed and maintain suitable records for selection of ship s domain

over head clearance ohc r when calculating the required overhead clearance rutkowski 2019b the air draft as a vertical height of the ship s highest point above the waterline must be considered in fact this value can be a little reduced by a part of squat effect which increase in body sink age the squat effect barrass 1994 ferreiro 1992 millward 1990 nowicki 1999 porada 1972 rutkowski 2019b occurs at all times when a vessel is making headway through the water or secured alongside a berth with a flow of water passing around the hull but the amplified effects experienced in confined and shallow waters have a profound effect on the safety of the vessel the squat effect is caused when buoyancy or the hull pressure is reduced and the vessel is forced deeper into the water to support its weight generally as a rule of thumb the squat increases where a channel width is less than 8 25 times the beam combined with a static ukc of less than 20 of the draft nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2019b the squat of the vessel is an approximation of additional immersion based on the following the vessel s draft speed and block coefficient the width and shape of the channel and the available depth squat should be calculated using the speed through the water rather than the speed over the ground barrass 1994 nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b reducing the speed is the best means to reduce a vessel s dynamic draft and is an essential consideration for passage planning also on full form ships such as tankers the squat effect leads to an increase of the forward draft and tends to trim a vessel by the head for squat and ukc calculation the user should always use the form designated for his vessel and accepted by the company nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b otherwise the estimated risk indicator rnd may not be adequate for the ship the tidal stream and current need only be considered in calculating squat when a vessel is secured alongside a berth since the main factor in calculating squat is speed through the water the tidal stream and current will not affect the amount of squat a vessel experiences when underway and making way it must also be noted that any calculation made for squat is approximate and for guidance only due to the inherent inaccuracy of the information affecting it extreme caution and judgment should be exercised in calculating and applying squat keeping potential error on the safe side ferreiro 1992 nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b vermeer 1977 the squat effect equals the total parallel body sink plus any subsequent trimming of the vessel nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b the water flow will follow different patterns in relation to the different shapes of the forward and aft hull the aft hull is shaped to give a stable inflow to the propeller while the forward hull is designed for other objectives differences in the flow pattern influence the hull pressure or buoyancy fluctuations in the buoyancy on the forward and aft hulls lead to trimming of the vessel in general the following applies nowicki 1999 rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b vermeer 1977 block coefficient c b 0 7 vessel trims forward block coefficient c b 0 7 no apparent trim block coefficient c b 0 7 vessel trims aft for vessels with a block coefficient c b 0 7 the application of squat is based on the following 75 of the squat is an increase in body sinkage and 25 is a change in trim by the head rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b vermeer 1977 while navigating in confined restricted waters other conditions that should be considered along with squat include turning which causes listing and increased drafts depending on the beam of the vessel also the steering characteristics and course keeping ability can be affected when the ukc diminishes that is the turning circle radius may increase in such case the required speed v z can be defined as the ship s safe and or optimal speed due to the limited value of the under keel clearance and over head clearance taking into account the maximum value of the ship s squat ship s draft air draft ukc and ohc in this case v z depends on the ship s domain depth sd d and ship s

meaning as long as it is the exclusive object that can generate danger within its domain with reference to a vertical plane oz of the three dimensional co ordinates xyz established up from the central point of the local ship s reference system one can state unambiguously that every ship will remain safe as long the value of the ship s domain height sd h is smaller than the real value of distance h 0 between water level and the height of the nearest objects hanging above the water therefore component r nd can be referred to as the vertical component of the navigational risk r n which concerns keeping sufficient required over head clearance air draft clearance or shortly risk concerning air draft clearance 16 r n h 0 w h e n h o s d h s d h h o s d h h n w h e n h n h o s d h 1 w h e n h o

navigation with reference to all underwater objects or obstructions hanging above the water on height equal or bigger than h 0 component of the navigational risk r nh 0 if the distance h 0 measured between water level and the height of the nearest objects hanging above the water is smaller or equal to the ship s air draft h n adt that is h o h n according to formula 16 sea passage can be unfeasible 1 1 in our analyses we exclude the situation when the ship can change her draft due to for example a de ballasting operation or highly risky in that situation the value of the navigational risk r nh will equal one and in all probability it will signify unquestionable 100 risk of collision when passing under bridges or other suspended water obstacles e g power cables ropeways furthermore we can also say that the value of navigational risk r nh when passing under bridges or other suspended water obstacles hanging above the water on height h 0 limited between h n and sd h k will be limited between zero and one r nh 0 1 the relationship between vessel speed v ship s air draft h n adt ship s squat domain height sd h and navigational risk factor r nh prepared for vlcc warta has been presented in table 9 and fig 3 table 9 shows that as the speed increases the ship s squat increases the height of the ship s domain decreases and the r nh risk indicator also decreases theoretically one could suppose that at higher speeds the ship crossing under the bridge would be completely safe in relation to required overhead clearance ohc in our case however we must also remember about additional restrictions regarding the required ship s speed v zd described in more details in rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2020 rutkowski 2019b that concerns keeping required under keel clearance on shallow water and navigation risk factor r nd on low accepted level speeds higher than 9 knots would be too dangerous for the warta ship due to the large ship s squat and factor r nd 1 a ship speed of about 6 knots 1 knot could be considered appropriate 5 conclusion summing up it can be stated that regardless of the voyage option adopted according to colreg regulations and the principles of good seamanship the ship should always move at a safe speed according to colreg what is a safe speed will depend on the vessel and circumstances bearing in mind that every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that it can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions colreg sets out some factors to be considered by all vessels and vessels with operational radar however the unambiguous definition of a safe speed disregarding the ship s margin of safety determined by the outline of its three dimensional domain is too complex an issue which at the present state of knowledge cannot give us an unambiguous answer as to the specific value of the ship s safe speed when navigating in restricted sea areas practice prescribes that choosing the right ship speed in restricted sea areas on confined waters is a form of compromise between the optimal speed due to time or fuel consumption and the safe speed set for the current navigational situation gucma and jagniszczak 1997 jurdziński 1999 nowicki 1999 ozturk et al 2019 porada 1972 rutkowski 2019a rutkowski 2019b the optimum speed the right one will therefore be the speed enabling travel to be made at the right time fulfilling the contract and at the same time guaranteeing a constant safety margin so called speed reserves in the event of unpredictable emergency situations and those resulting from the deployment position of navigational obstacles around the ship as a result the optimal speed setting will always be reduced to the comparative analysis of individual components of the safe speed v x v y v z determined based on the outline of the ship s domain from a practical point of view the initial element for the analysis of the navigational risk in restricted waters areas restricted by the water depth air vertical clearance under the bridges and or width of navigable waters is the estimation of the ship s domain parameters her depth sd d height sd h width sd w and length sd l the author s own research e g rutkowski 2016 to rutkowski 2019b proves that these activities calculations can be performed on a ship in real time and their results if necessary e g for controlling the movement of ships manoeuvring in restricted waters based on the value of their navigational risk indicators can be attached to standard reports e g via the ship s automatic identification system ais in practice this means that a thorough analysis of the navigational risk of ships sailing in restricted waters is also possible and may help us choose such conditions internal and or external in which the sea passage will be effective safe and in line with the needs of the global maritime transportation system

20947,the drilling risers are the most critical and vulnerable connection of floating drilling platform and subsea wellhead in order to improve the operation efficiency the operators have attempted to suspend the drilling operations and keep the drilling risers connected to the wellhead to survive in the storm thus the fragility of the drilling risers under storm is of paramount importance to drilling operations this paper is aimed at proposing an efficient and robust brann based non intrusive approach for the fragility assessment of the deepwater drilling riser subject to storms the proposed approach which could effectively reflect the non linear relationship between the input and output data can generate thousands of non numerical data under limited finite element analysis fea of the drilling risers while the monte carlo simulation mcs could be further incorporated to calculate the fragility curve a case study was conducted to demonstrate the characteristics with respect to significantly computational reduction of the proposed approach compared to the conventional mcs method and the proposed approach was verified to be robust and efficient in assessing the fragility of the drilling risers under storms the related conclusions could be used to provide reference for operations of drilling risers under harsh environment keywords deepwater drilling riser bayesian regularization artificial neuron network fragility assessment non intrusive model limit state equations logistic regression 1 introduction drilling riser system is the critical offshore equipment in deepwater drilling as shown in fig 1 its main functions are to connect the submarine wellhead system and the floating drilling platform isolate seawater and establish a circulation path for the drilling fluid mao et al 2016 the drilling riser system is mainly composed of upper flexible joint ufj telescopic joint exposed and buoyant riser joint lower flexible joint lfj and bops the top end of the drilling riser is connected to the drilling platform through the tensioner the telescopic joint is composed of internal and external barrels with relative motion which can compensate for the vertical movement of the riser caused by the large heave motion of the drilling platform the lfj and ufj can improve the mechanical properties at both ends of the riser and reduce large bending moments to avoid damage to the riser api rp 16q 1993 the occurrence of tropical storms and typhoons are found to be frequent in the south china sea scs it is reported that the typhoons occurred averagely more than 10 times one year in the scs generally the drilling risers should be disconnected from the bop before a storm is completely formed then the risers are retrieved to the storage area before typhoon evacuation of the platform and once the weather conditions improve the risers will be reconnected to the bops liu et al 2018 however for enhancing the efficiency of operation the operators have attempted to suspend the drilling operations and keep the drilling risers connected to the wellhead to survive in the storm thus the non drilling time for the well will be reduced

of deepwater drilling riser fracture failure with bayesian networks approach subsequently chang et al 2018 used the fuzzy petri net model to assess the comprehensive risk of deepwater drilling riser system however fragility assessment of deepwater drilling risers subject to storms can be found sporadically in literatures thus far the concept of fragility is the conditional probability of structure failure under given values of natural accidents intensity measures ims wang et al 2018 in this study the ims of typhoons or storms could be wave height wave period and current velocity for the drilling riser the fragility analysis could be used to quantitatively assess the conditional probability of failure of it subject to typhoons or storms thus providing reference for risk decision making of the drilling riser operations in harsh environment therefore it is very necessary to conduct fragility assessment of deepwater drilling riser system to evaluate and predict its failure probability quantitatively under storm conditions the fragility assessment has been widely applied to estimate the failure probability of structures under natural accidents such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods which is usually expressed with a fragility curve where the im of hazard conditions and the probability of failure are shown on the coordinate axis ellingwood et al 2004 kameshwar et al 2018 mai et al 2017 noh et al 2015 ioannou et al 2017 bernier et al 2019 argyroudis et al 2019 choi et al 2004 conducted the seismic fragility assessment of typical bridges in moderate seismic zones using lognormal assumption landucci et al 2012 2014 proposed a developed and validated fragility model based on mechanical damage which can be used to directly assess the equipment failure probability of horizontal cylindrical vessels and atmospheric storage tanks subject to floods khakzad et al 2017 assessed the fragility of chemical storage tanks based on monte carlo simulations triggered by floods ataei et al 2015 proposed a surrogate model to conduct fragility assessment of coastal bridges in hurricane prone zones in the above mentioned literatures the limit state equation for fragility assessment of a structure is a definite mathematical formula and the monte carlo simulation which is used to generate the fragility curve does not involve complicated numerical calculations whereas the drilling risers are such specific object although there is definite mathematical formula to represent its limit state equations when it is operated under harsh environments it is computationally expensive and inefficient to conduct a mass of dynamic response analysis by using finite element method to achieve the interested results used for monte carlo simulation for the purpose of improving the computational efficiency some methodologies of fragility analysis using artificial neural networks anns have been proposed recently to construct a nonlinear relationship between input and output lagaros et al 2009 lagaros et al 2009 mitropoulou et al 2011 ferrario et al 2015 calabresea et al 2013 wang et al 2018 whereas conventional ann algorithm may have a small bias but a large variance which is the overfitting problem as an alternative bayesian regularized artificial neural network brann can solve the overfitting problem due to its better generalization ability especially in the case of less data kaur et al 2013 gianola et al 2011 shi et al 2019a b shi et al 2018 2019 2019 however for general applications of ann the problem is that it is difficult to determine the appropriate number of input samples and the appropriate number of hidden neurons in this study a computationally efficient methodology based on developed brann model to evaluate fragility of deepwater drilling riser system subject to storms is proposed the developed brann model can characterize relation between the im of storms and the damage measures dms of the deepwater drilling riser system then a large number of im dms data is generated through the developed brann model to calculate the fragility curve more efficiently rather than the traditional monte carlo method a case study of deepwater drilling riser system under storms is conducted limited finite element analysis fea of drilling risers subject to storms are initially performed and then used to develop brann dms deterministic bdd model subsequently the fragility curve of drilling risers subject to storms is calculated by the bdd model 2 background 2 1 brann ann can efficiently characterize the complicated nonlinear relationship between the input and output among different kinds of ann the multi layer perception mlp with back propagation bp algorithm as shown in fig 2 which is basis to develop the brann is the most widely used because of its good function approximation shi et al 2019a b it is observed that the architecture consists of input layer hidden layer and output layer the input layer includes n neurons expressing n factors characterizing the storm conditions in this research n 3 since 3 main factors namely wave height wave period and current velocity are considered the output layer includes 3 neurons presenting 3 factors characterizing the dynamic responses of the drilling riser i e the ufj angle lfj angle and equivalent stress es in this study while the neurons in hidden layer are varied in this study for the prediction of dynamic response of drilling risers the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer needs to be determined because ann is sensitive to the properties of the input and output data w x i i and w y i are series of weights shi et al 2018 however the traditional ann algorithm may have the overfitting problem the brann minimizes the objective function f including a combination of mean squared error function e d and the weight attenuation function e w and determines the optimal weights and objective function parameters α β with a probability manner shi et al 2018 in addition brann can effectively remove certain pairs of parameters which contribute less to reduction of the error function therefore brann has better generalization ability to overcome the overfitting problem 1 f β e d α e w 2 e d 1 n i n y i t i 2 1 n i n e i 2 3 e w 1 2 i m w i 2 2 2 riser model and limit state equations 2 2 1 riser and load models the analysis of fragility primarily requires to establish the mechanical analysis model of riser and estimate the load conditions during storms as mentioned above during the drilling operation the top end of the riser is connected to drilling platform via a tensioner which provides sufficient top tension force and the bottom end of the riser is connected with lower marine riser package lmrp bop and wellhead as shown in fig 3 a lateral deformation of the drilling riser occurs under the combined loads of wave current and offset of platform the mechanical model of drilling riser is shown in fig 3 b both environmental loads and riser deformation are in horizontal direction the lateral vibration equation of drilling riser under harsh environments is a fourth order partial differential equation wang et al 2015a b c 4 e i 4 y z t z 4 z t z t y z t z c y z t t m 2 z t t 2 f y z t where e is the elasticity modulus i is the second moment of area t z t is the riser axial force c is the damping coefficient m is the vibration mass of the riser per unit length and f y z t is the combined hydrodynamic force on the riser per unit length as the riser is a slender cylindrical structure the combined hydrodynamic loads on the riser caused by wave and current are calculated according to modified morison equation wang et al 2015a b c 5 f y z t π d r 2 4 ρ a w π d 2 r 4 ρ c m 1 a w 2 y t 2 d

induced by wave and current respectively c m is inertia force coefficient c d is drag force coefficient the established riser analysis model requires to be solved by finite element method with the commercial software abaqus to obtain the dynamic response characteristics subject to storms however a large number of fea for fragility assessment is not recommended as it is time and labor consuming 2 2 2 limit state equations during the drilling operation extreme conditions such as typhoon and storm can lead to large deformation of drilling riser while large deformation can increase the bend moment of riser liu et al 2018 the fracture of riser would occur if the bend moment exceeds the endurance limit of drilling riser the failure mode in the form of fracture of the drilling riser may cause serious consequences such as casualties drilling downtime platform overturning etc in order to prevent drilling riser failures during harsh environment api provides recommended operating guidelines for the three operating modes which are drilling mode connected non drilling mode and emergency disconnect ed mode shown in table 1 api rp 16q 1993 the angle of upper flex joint the angle of lower flex joint and es of the riser are three limit factors for different operation modes iso 13624 1 2009 bai et al 2005 the maximum upper lower flex joint angle limits for the connected non drilling mode and emergency disconnect mode are intended to prevent damage to the riser upper lower flex joint and bop stack the purpose of the maximum es analysis is to guarantee that the drilling riser is strong enough to support the maximum design loads in this research the determination criteria of connected non drilling operation mode will be referred as storm condition is considered thus for the drilling riser upper and lower flex joint angle and es are three dms if any one of the three dms exceeds the corresponding determination criteria the drilling riser is considered to be failure 6 p f p l s e r s 0 a measure of the fragility of a structural system is its failure probability the probability of failure p f is evaluated as the probability of violation of a limit state equation lse l s e r s expressed in terms of the load variable s and resistance variable r for the fragility assessment of the drilling riser in this paper based on a comparison between the dms of the drilling riser induced by storms load variables e g ufj and lfj angle es and the resistance of the drilling riser the maximum ufj lfj angle and es limits lses for different dms of the drilling riser are defined as follows 7 l s e σ i σ i σ 0 8 l s e θ u i θ u i θ u 0 9 l s e θ l i θ l i θ l 0 where l s e σ i l s e θ u i l s e θ l i are limit state equations for es ufj angle and lfj angle of the

allowable values of es ufj angle and lfj angle resistance variables respectively defined as table 1 based on the lses the state of the drilling riser can be determined obviously i e safe or failed 2 3 logistic regression the limit state equations are calculated to determine the drilling riser is safe or failure for the experiment with a binary output the probability function can be obtained using logistic regression in eq 10 10 p z e ψ z 1 e ψ z where ψ z β 0 β 1 z is the logit function and β 0 and β 1 are the parameters of the logistic regression which can be determined using maximum likelihood estimation method as shown by hosmer et al 2013 and van erp and van gelder 2012 assuming a binary experiment y 1 if the riser is fail and y 0 if the riser is safe with a probability distribution of p z the likelihood function for n observations can be derived as shown in eq 11 11 l i k e l i h o o d i 1 n p y y i x x i i 1 n p x i y i 1 p x i 1 y i 3 methodology of the brann based fragility assessment 3 1 fragility assessment framework the schematic of the proposed methodology was depicted in fig 4 while the main procedure for brann based fragility assessment of the deepwater drilling riser system subject to storms as shown in fig 4 a which will be followed in the subsequent case applications will be addressed in more detail in this part step1 2 structure modeling and conducting fea simulations indeed structure modeling involves establishing a set of mechanical analysis model of drilling riser and estimating the load conditions of wave and current during storms fea is performed to calculate the dms of the drilling riser e g ufj angle lfj angle and es subject to storms and provide the benchmark data for developing and checking bdd model in the following step step3 bdd model development and checking the detailed bdd model development and checking procedure will be further illuminated in section 3 2 the purpose of developing and checking bdd model is to establish a robust brann based non intrusive model which can characterize relation between the im of storms and the dms of deepwater drilling risers step4 determination of random various distribution e g significant wave height h s the zero crossing wave period t z current velocity u generally it is assumed that the significant wave height follows a weibull distribution with two parameters the wave period follows a lognormal distribution and current velocity follows a weibull distribution with two parameters too based on the present sea state statistic data in south china sea the maximum likelihood estimation mle is applied to estimate those unknown parameters in above distributions thus the mentioned above random various distributions are determined step5 ims generating through latin hypercube sampling lhs lhs is a stratified sampling method which divides the probability distribution into n interval with equal probabilities n is the sampling size a variety of ims are generated through lhs method from the above determined random various distributions step6 im dms data cloud generating based on the developed bdd model in the step3 dms of the drilling riser can be obtained accurately and efficiently given the ims step7 9 lses calculating for every im dms data generated from the developed bdd model the lses of the drilling riser are defined according to eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 in section 2 2 step10 11 failure determination based on the lses and im y dataset generating for i th im dm data if any one of the defined three lses e g l e s σ i l e s θ u i l e s θ l i is negative the riser fails recorded as y 1 otherwise the riser survives recorded as y 0 thus all im y data is recorded for logistic regression and conducting fragility assessment of drilling risers in the next steps step12 14 fragility curves of drilling riser under storms calculation using logistic regression mentioned in section 2 3 step15 end of the procedure 3 2 procedure to develop the brann based model this part briefly demonstrates the procedure for bdd model developing and checking as shown in fig 4 b which will be employed in the following application the detailed steps are as follows step16 parametric normalization prior to the division of all the fea simulation the purpose of parametric normalization is to reduce data redundancy the normalization can be expressed as follows 12 z n 2 z z m i n z m i x z m i n 1 where z n is the normalized value z is parametric value z min is the minimum parametric value and z max is the maximum parametric value step17 dividing all the fea simulations into developing set and checking set the developing set which consists of training set 85 and testing set 15 is used to develop varied models and the checking set is used to check the generalization of developed models step18 setting the sample size and developing models coefficient determination r 2 between predicted data and simulation data of developing set is subsequently computed when the r 2 reaches its maximum value the model can be used to check the generalization in the next step step19 the model derived from the step3 is then used to estimate data of checking set similarly the r 2 between simulation data and predicted data of checking set is computed step20 increasing the size of developing set and repetitively carrying out step 3 and step 4 until n is equal to n which equals to the maximum samples of the developing set eventually both r 2 of developing set and checking set of each step 3 and step 4 are regarded as the indicator for the generalization of the brann dms deterministic bdd models after the optimal sample size of the developing set is determined the developed bdd model can be immediately used for the proposed fragility assessment procedure in section 3 1 4 case study 4 1 fea of the deepwater drilling riser 4 1 1 basic data a deepwater drilling riser system in the south china sea scs is selected for case study table 2 shows the basic parameters of the riser the sea state in the scs is selected for dynamic analysis of drilling riser for the current the returning period of surface current velocity u is shown in table 3 in terms of the wave the encounter frequencies of significant wave height h s and zero crossing wave period t z are shown in table 4 11 surface current velocities i e 0 2 m s 0 4 m s 0 6 m s 0 8 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s 1 4 m s 1 6 m s 1 8 m s 2 0 m s 2 2 m s are considered to conduct fea therefore regarding the combinations of wave states and current states 803 73 wave states 11 current velocities fea simulations are conducted to provide benchmark data for developing and checking bdd model in the following step according to the statistical material it is noted that t p 1 41 t z 4 1 2 dynamic response of the drilling riser 803 fea simulations are conducted in this research according to the sea states in section 4 1 1 and the dynamic responses or dms of the riser which are ufj angle lfj angle and es in this study can be calculated through the fea simulation result for illustrative purpose fig 5 shows one result of 803 fem simulations under the wave h s 11 5 m t z 10 5 s and the current u 1 8 m s in this study analysis time of 3 h is adopted to ensure a realistic and stable dynamic response thus it is considerably time consuming to conduct fea simulations for all 803 drilling riser simulations from the results shown in fig 5 the dynamic response of the riser fluctuates greatly in the initial stage of analysis time thus the results of dynamic response during this period are ignored from result of the dynamic response of the riser stress after the analysis time of 0 25 h shown in fig 5 a the maximum es of the riser is 449 2 mpa which exceeds the allowable stress 369 84 mpa moreover the maximum lfj angle is 12 82 which exceeds the critical limit 9 shown in fig 5 b from the result shown in fig 5 b the value of ufj angle is under the critical limit therefore the drilling riser is considered to be failure under this sea state according to the guidelines and limit state equations defined in section 2 2 4 2 brann dms deterministic modelling this part focuses on the bdd model developing and checking by employing those 803 fea simulations above the corresponding brann architecture is adopted in section 2 1 4 2 1 data division accordingly all the 803 fea simulations are divided into developing set 400 simulations and checking set 403 simulations additionally the simulation inputs of the developing set employed for bdd model development significantly influence model generalization the more simulation inputs the more accuracy and robustness of this developed model however large simulations are time consuming and labor consuming for engineering application therefore it is worthy to balance the tradeoff between the robustness and the simulation inputs thus it is necessary to study the influence of the simulation input number of developing set on the model generalization the number of fea simulations constituting of the developing set is varied in order to illustrate the influence of the simulation inputs on the generalization of this bdd model 5 cases are accordingly categorized case 1 contains 50 simulations case 2 contains 100 simulations case 3 contains 200 simulations case 4 contains 300 simulations and case 5 contains 400 simulations all the 5 cases contain 15 hidden neurons in addition each checking set of the 5 cases to check the generalization of each correspondingly developed model contains all the remaining 403 fem simulations besides the simulation input number it is difficult to confirm the appropriate hidden neuron numbers for application of brann therefore in this paper another 6 cases are accordingly categorized to determine the optimal number of hidden neuron case 6 contains 400 simulations and 1 hidden neuron case 7 contains 400 simulations and 5 hidden neurons case 8 contains 400 simulations and 10 hidden neurons case 9 contains 400 simulations and 15 hidden neuron case 10 contains 400 simulations and 20 hidden neurons case 11 contains 400 simulations and 25 hidden neurons in addition each checking set of the 6 cases to check the generalization of each correspondingly developed model contains all the 403 fem simulations 4 2 2 model development and checking fig 6 demonstrates the robustness analysis of bdd model under varied simulation inputs fig 6 a 6 c show the coefficient determination r 2 results of developing set and checking set of brann under varied simulation inputs it is observed that the r 2 of developing set becomes stable increase and comes near 1 with the increase of simulation input numbers meanwhile the r 2 of checking set also becomes steady and comes close to 0 999 along with the incremental simulation input numbers it is proved that the developed bdd model has no overfitting problem it is also worth noted that the maximum r 2 of checking set is 0 998 which is for ufj angle training and checking under 400 simulation inputs therefore it can be seen from the above results that the brann based model is quite robust and accurate and the optimal number of simulation inputs can be determined to be 400 however besides the number of simulation inputs brann is also sensitive to hidden neuron numbers for general application fig 7 demonstrates the robustness analysis of bdd model under varied hidden neuron numbers fig 7 a 7 c show the coefficient determination r 2 results of developing set and checking set of brann under varied hidden neuron numbers it is observed that the coefficient determination r 2 of developing set becomes stable and approaches 1 with the increase of hidden neuron numbers meanwhile the r 2 of checking set also becomes steady and comes close to 0 998 along with the incremental hidden neuron numbers it is also proved that the developed bdd model has no overfitting problem it is also worth noted that the maximum r2 of checking set is 0 997 which is for ufj training and checking under 15 hidden neuron numbers and 400 simulation inputs therefore it can be seen from the above results that the brann based model is quite robust and accurate and the optimal number of hidden neuron can be determined to be 15 thus the developed brann based model with 400 simulation input numbers and 15 hidden neuron numbers is determined moreover fig 8 shows the checking results for the developed bdd model it is can be seen that the checking results are satisfactory most of the results are distributed around the blue diagonal line it is furtherly proved the accuracy and robustness of the proposed brann based model and it is also worth to note from the above results that the developed bdd model is more appropriate for ufj angle 4 3 brann based fragility assessment after being developed and checked the determined bdd model can be used to conduct fast running simulations thus a large number of im dms data can be generated efficiently to calculate the fragility curve this section is to describe the generation of fragility curve of the riser subjected to storms by combining the efficient and robust brann based non intrusive model with monte carlo simulation mcs 4 3 1 determined bdd model based mcs to generate the fragility curves of the drilling riser subject to the storms mcs in conjunction with the determined bdd model was used to generate a large amount of random values of lses as in eq 7 to eq 9 for illustrative purposes only ims of storms in this study which are regarded as the random variables include wave height wave period and current velocity based on the sea states listed in tables 3 and 4 the significant wave height is assumed to follow the two parameter weibull distribution whose probability density function pdf is shown in eq 13 13 f x k λ k λ x λ k 1 exp x λ k x 0 where x is the variable k and λ are the shape and scale parameters respectively correspondingly the zero crossing wave period t z conditional on h s is practically modeled by a lognormal distribution 14 f x σ μ 1 x σ 2 π exp ln x μ 2 σ 2 2 x 0 where x is the variable μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation similarly the current surface velocity is modeled as weibull distribution in eq 13 the maximum likelihood estimation mle is applied to estimate those unknown parameters given wave data shown in table 3 through the mle the evaluation results of the unknown parameters in eq 13 and eq 14 are listed in table 5 normally the sample size will significantly impact the accuracy of mcs in order to determine the appropriate sample size lhs is then performed to randomly extract 5 groups of input ims of storms randomly according to the above weibull distribution and lognormal distribution lhs is a stratified sampling method which divides the probability distribution into n interval with equal probabilities n is the sampling size the most advantage of lhs is that it can efficiently reduce the sampling size meanwhile make the samples cover all the ims of sea states as much as possible in order to make the samples cover all the sea states in storms the lower boundary and upper boundary of sampling are determined in table 6 note for each group we obtain m m 803 2000 5000 samples of ims note that the sample size of 803 which is equal to fea data size is regarded as the sample size of conventional mcs method with those ims the dms of the riser are calculated accurately and efficiently by applying the developed bdd model thus the number of mcs can expand to m in other words an im dms dataset containing m samples is generated for each im dms data the state of the riser can be determined according to values of lses as in eq 7 to eq 9 if the riser fails y 1 0 otherwise y 0 0 finally an im y dataset containing m samples is generated to carry out fragility assessment of the riser subject to storms directly the statistical data of samples with varied sample sizes using lhs is shown in fig 9 4 3 2 fragility curves of the riser subjected to storms this part is to describe the generation of fragility curve of the riser subjected to storms and determine the appropriate sample size through the logistic regression mentioned in section 2 3 for each random value of significant wave height h s a failure probability p h s can be predicted using eq 10 forming a likelihood function for each set of h s y and p h s using eq 11 the optimal values of β 0 and β 1 can be estimated using the mle analysis for each random value of current velocity the optimal values of β 0 and β 1 can be as well as estimated following the same procedure the results of the optimal values of logistic regression parameters are shown in table 7 while fig 10 and fig 11 demonstrate the 5 groups of fragility curves calculated with 803 2000 and 5000 samples note that the sample size of 803 which is equal to fea data size is regarded as the sample size of the conventional mcs method as can be seen from fig 10 when probability value of failure is 0 5 the interval of the uncertainty in im of wave height is about 1 03 under 803 samples when the sample size increases to 2000 the interval of the uncertainty is reduced to 0 594 however as sample size increases from 2000 to 5000 the interval is significantly reduced to 0 074 from fig 11 we can see that when probability value of failure is 0 5 the interval of the uncertainty in im of current velocity will be about 0 267 under 803 samples when the sample size increases to 2000 the interval of the uncertainty decreases to 0 090 however as sample size increases from 2000 to 5000 the interval is significantly reduced to 0 021 although the uncertainty interval will further decrease with the increase of the samples more than 5000 samples would considerably increase the computational cost thus the sample size is determined to be 5000 as the trade off between computational cost and uncertainty the fragility curves of the riser subject to the storms calculated by 5000 samples are depicted in fig 12 and fig 13 one can conclude from fig 12 when the significant wave height is less than h s 3 5m the probability of failure of the riser is equal to 0 which means the drilling riser can keep drilling normally under this sea state the failure probability of the riser reaches 65 when the significant wave height is h s 7 5m thus the operators are suggested to suspend the drilling operations and keep the drilling risers connected to the wellhead to survive in the storm while the failure probability of the riser is more than 95 under the sea state of h s 9m which indicates that emergency disconnect of the riser should be performed timely to avoid serious damage to the drilling riser system and secure the well under this extreme condition as mentioned before the current velocity is another im of storms fig 13 shows the fragility curve subject to storms as im of current velocity as outlined in fig 13 the critical current velocity for drilling safely is u 0 7 m s the critical current velocity for non drilling is u 1 4 m s as can be seen from the fragility curve in fig 13 the failure probability of riser reaches to 80 under the current velocity of 1 4 m s it means that the riser is likely to be at risk of failure in drilling mode thus the drilling riser is suggested to be connected to the wellhead for non drilling mode to survive in the storm moreover the critical current velocity for performing emergency disconnect of the riser system is u 1 8 m s to avoid risk of failure of the drilling riser as stated in section 4 1 2 a deepwater drilling riser system in the south china sea is selected for analysis the selected drilling riser was seen to fail when exposed to a storm with the wave h s 11 5 m t z 10 5 s and the current u 1 8 m s this observation has been denoted in figs 12 and 13 with a vertical dotted line for which the probability of failure in case of the wave h s 11 5 m and the current u 1 8 m s is equal to 1 0 4 3 3 validation of the proposed methodology a comparison is made between conventional mcs method and the proposed brann based methodology fig 14 demonstrates the results of comparisons between the conventional mcs method and the proposed brann based methodology to generate the fragility curves with 803 samples with respect to the fragility curves in fig 14 we can see that the brann based method curve stays coherent with the conventional mcs curve it is proved that the proposed brann dms deterministic model and the brann based methodology which could effectively reflect the non linear relationship between the input and output data can generate thousands of non numerical data under limited fea to assess the fragility of the drilling risers under storms additionally from the results shown in figs 10 and 11 the fragility curves of the drilling riser calculated using the proposed brann based methodology have a narrower uncertainty interval compared to the conventional mcs method due to the limited sample size of the conventional mcs method thus the proposed approach is verified to be robust and efficient in assessing the fragility of the drilling risers under storms with lower uncertainty 5 conclusions this study proposed an efficient and robust brann based non intrusive methodology for fragility assessment of deepwater drilling risers subject to storms the brann dms deterministic model is proved to be efficient and robust for building the statistical relation between the intensity measures of storms and the dynamic response of the riser the conclusions of this research are listed as follows the development of the brann dms deterministic model a numerical model with 15 hidden neurons and 400 simulation input numbers is proposed to study the dynamic response of the drilling riser subject to storms this developed brann model consists of three key parts input layer hidden layer and output layer besides the developed brann based model with 400 simulation input numbers and 15 hidden neurons is proved to be efficient and robust for predicting dms of the drilling riser subject to storms since the r 2 of the checking set would become steady and comes close to 1 along with the incremental simulation input numbers or hidden neuron numbers the brann dms deterministic model based framework for fragility assessment of deepwater drilling risers subject to storms after being developed and checked the determined bdd model can be used to conduct fast running simulations thus a large number of im dms data can be generated efficiently to calculate the fragility curve with mcs and logistic regression a comparison is made between conventional mcs method and the proposed approach to calculate the fragility curves of the drilling riser subject to storms the proposed approach was verified to be robust and efficient in assessing the fragility of the drilling risers under storms with lower uncertainty application of the proposed methodology was demonstrated on a deepwater drilling riser subject to storms in south china sea the fragility curve generated with the logistic regression assumption is described by significant wave height and current velocity the analysis results from the fragility curves could provide reference for decision making of drilling riser operations under harsh environment credit

20947,the drilling risers are the most critical and vulnerable connection of floating drilling platform and subsea wellhead in order to improve the operation efficiency the operators have attempted to suspend the drilling operations and keep the drilling risers connected to the wellhead to survive in the storm thus the fragility of the drilling risers under storm is of paramount importance to drilling operations this paper is aimed at proposing an efficient and robust brann based non intrusive approach for the fragility assessment of the deepwater drilling riser subject to storms the proposed approach which could effectively reflect the non linear relationship between the input and output data can generate thousands of non numerical data under limited finite element analysis fea

regularization artificial neuron network fragility assessment non intrusive model limit state equations logistic regression 1 introduction drilling riser system is the critical offshore equipment in deepwater drilling as shown in fig 1 its main functions are to connect the submarine wellhead system and the floating drilling platform isolate seawater and establish a circulation path for the drilling fluid mao et al 2016 the drilling riser system is mainly composed of upper flexible joint ufj telescopic joint exposed and buoyant riser joint lower flexible joint lfj and bops the top end of the drilling riser is connected to the drilling platform through the tensioner the telescopic joint is composed of internal and external barrels with relative motion which can compensate for the vertical movement of the riser caused by the large heave motion of the drilling platform the lfj and ufj can improve the mechanical properties at both ends of the riser and reduce large bending moments to avoid damage to the riser api rp 16q 1993 the occurrence of tropical storms and typhoons are found to be frequent in the south china sea scs it is reported that the typhoons occurred averagely more than 10 times one year in the scs generally the drilling risers should be disconnected from the bop before a storm is completely formed then the risers are retrieved to the storage area before typhoon evacuation of the platform and once the weather conditions improve the risers will be reconnected to the bops liu et al 2018 however for enhancing the efficiency of operation the operators have attempted to suspend the drilling operations and keep the drilling risers connected to the wellhead to survive in the storm thus the non drilling time for the well will be reduced significantly numerous researches have been done by previous investigators on design approaches mechanical behaviors operation safety analysis of the drilling risers meng et al 2018 chang 2008 wang et al 2015a b c wang et al 2015 2015 2016 mao et al 2016 ju et al 2012 liu et al 2016 more recently researchers have shifted their focuses to risk and reliability analysis of drilling risers chang et al 2018a b and nie et al 2019 applied bayesian network to carry out studies on risk assessment for emergency disconnect of deepwater drilling riser chang et al 2019 investigated the risk and reliability of deepwater drilling riser fracture failure with bayesian networks approach subsequently chang et al 2018 used the fuzzy petri net model to assess the comprehensive risk of deepwater drilling riser system however fragility assessment of deepwater drilling risers subject to storms can be found sporadically in literatures thus far the concept of fragility is the conditional probability of structure failure under given values of natural accidents intensity measures ims wang et al 2018 in this study the ims of typhoons or storms could be wave height wave period and current velocity for the drilling riser the fragility analysis could be used to quantitatively assess the conditional probability of failure of it subject to typhoons or storms thus providing reference for risk decision making of the drilling riser operations in harsh environment therefore it is very necessary to conduct fragility assessment of deepwater drilling riser system to evaluate and predict its failure probability quantitatively under storm conditions the fragility assessment has been widely applied to estimate the failure probability of structures under natural accidents such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods which is usually expressed with a fragility curve where the im of hazard conditions and the probability of failure are shown on the coordinate axis ellingwood et al 2004 kameshwar et al 2018 mai et al 2017 noh et al 2015 ioannou et al 2017 bernier et al 2019 argyroudis et al 2019 choi et al 2004 conducted the seismic fragility assessment of typical bridges in moderate seismic zones using lognormal assumption landucci et al 2012 2014 proposed a developed and validated fragility model based on mechanical damage which can be used to directly assess the equipment failure probability of horizontal cylindrical vessels and atmospheric storage tanks subject to floods khakzad et al 2017 assessed the fragility of chemical storage tanks based on monte carlo simulations triggered by floods ataei et al 2015 proposed a surrogate model to conduct fragility assessment of coastal bridges in hurricane prone zones in the above mentioned literatures the limit state equation for fragility assessment of a structure is a definite mathematical formula and the monte carlo simulation which is used to generate the fragility curve does not involve complicated numerical calculations whereas the drilling risers are such specific object although there is definite mathematical formula to represent its limit state equations when it is operated under harsh environments it is computationally expensive and inefficient to conduct a mass of dynamic response analysis by using finite element method to achieve the interested results used for monte carlo simulation for the purpose of improving the computational efficiency some methodologies of fragility analysis using artificial neural networks anns have been proposed recently to construct a nonlinear relationship between input and output lagaros et al 2009 lagaros et al 2009 mitropoulou et al 2011 ferrario et al 2015 calabresea et al 2013 wang et al 2018 whereas conventional ann algorithm may have a small bias but a large variance which is the overfitting problem as an alternative bayesian regularized artificial neural network brann can solve the overfitting problem due to its better generalization ability especially in the case of less data kaur et al 2013 gianola et al 2011 shi et al 2019a b shi et al 2018 2019 2019 however for general applications of ann the problem is that it is difficult to determine the appropriate number of input samples and the appropriate number of hidden neurons in this study a computationally efficient methodology based on developed brann model to evaluate fragility of deepwater drilling riser system subject to storms is proposed the developed brann model can characterize relation between the im of storms and the damage measures dms of the deepwater drilling riser system then a large number of im dms data is generated through the developed brann model to calculate the fragility curve more efficiently rather than the traditional monte carlo method a case study of deepwater drilling riser system under storms is conducted limited finite element analysis fea of drilling risers subject to storms are initially performed and then used to develop brann dms deterministic bdd model subsequently the fragility curve of drilling risers subject to storms is calculated by the bdd model 2 background 2 1 brann ann can efficiently characterize the complicated nonlinear relationship between the input and output among different kinds of ann the multi layer perception mlp with back propagation bp algorithm as shown in fig 2 which is basis to develop the brann is the most widely used because of its good function approximation shi et al 2019a b it is observed that the architecture consists of input layer hidden layer and output layer the input layer includes n neurons expressing n factors characterizing the storm conditions in this research n 3 since 3 main factors namely wave height wave period and current velocity are considered the output layer includes 3 neurons presenting 3 factors characterizing the dynamic responses of the drilling riser i e the ufj angle lfj angle and equivalent stress es in this study while the neurons in hidden layer are varied in this study for the prediction of dynamic response of drilling risers the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer needs to be determined because ann is sensitive to the properties of the input and output data w x i i and w y i are series of weights shi et al 2018 however the traditional ann algorithm may have the overfitting problem the brann minimizes the objective function f including a combination of mean squared error function e d and the weight attenuation function e w and determines the optimal weights and objective function parameters α β with a probability manner shi et al 2018 in addition brann can effectively remove certain pairs of parameters which contribute less to reduction of the error function therefore brann has better generalization ability to overcome the overfitting problem 1 f β e d α e w 2 e d 1 n i n y i t i 2 1 n i n e i 2 3 e w 1 2 i m w i 2 2 2 riser model and limit state equations 2 2 1 riser and load models the analysis of fragility primarily requires to establish the mechanical analysis model of riser and estimate the load conditions during storms as mentioned above during the drilling operation the top end of the riser is connected to drilling platform via a tensioner which provides sufficient top tension force and the bottom end of the riser is connected with lower marine riser package lmrp bop and wellhead as shown in fig 3 a lateral deformation of the drilling riser occurs under the combined loads of wave current and offset of platform the mechanical model of drilling riser is shown in fig 3 b both environmental loads and riser deformation are in horizontal direction the lateral vibration equation of drilling riser under harsh environments is a fourth order partial differential equation wang et al 2015a b c 4 e i 4 y z t z 4 z t z t y z t z c y z t t m 2 z t t 2 f y z t where e is the elasticity modulus i is the second moment of area t z t is the riser axial force c is the damping coefficient m is the vibration mass of the riser per unit length and f y z t is the combined hydrodynamic force on the riser per unit length as the riser is a slender cylindrical structure the combined hydrodynamic loads on the riser caused by wave and current are calculated according to modified morison equation wang et al 2015a b c 5 f y z t π d r 2 4 ρ a w π d 2 r 4 ρ c m 1 a w 2 y t 2 d

induced by wave and current respectively c m is inertia force coefficient c d is drag force coefficient the established riser analysis model requires to be solved by finite element method with the commercial software abaqus to obtain the dynamic response characteristics subject to storms however a large number of fea for fragility assessment is not recommended as it is time and labor consuming 2 2 2 limit state equations during the drilling operation extreme conditions such as typhoon and storm can lead to large deformation of drilling riser while large deformation can increase the bend moment of riser liu et al 2018 the fracture of riser would occur if the bend moment exceeds the endurance limit of drilling riser the failure mode in the form of fracture of the drilling riser may cause serious consequences such as casualties drilling downtime platform overturning etc in order to prevent drilling riser failures during harsh environment api provides recommended operating guidelines for the three operating modes which are drilling mode connected non drilling mode and emergency disconnect ed mode shown in table 1 api rp 16q 1993 the angle of upper flex joint the angle of lower flex joint and es of the riser are three limit factors for different operation modes iso 13624 1 2009 bai et al 2005 the maximum upper lower flex joint angle limits for the connected non drilling mode and emergency disconnect mode are intended to prevent damage to the riser upper lower flex joint and bop stack the purpose of the maximum es analysis is to guarantee that the drilling riser is strong enough to support the maximum design loads in this research the determination criteria of connected non drilling operation mode will be referred as storm condition is considered thus for the drilling riser upper and lower flex joint angle and es are three dms if any one of the three dms exceeds the corresponding determination criteria the drilling riser is considered to be failure 6 p f p l s e r s 0 a measure of the fragility of a structural system is its failure probability the probability of failure p f is evaluated as the probability of violation of a limit state equation lse l s e r s expressed in terms of the load variable s and resistance variable r for the fragility assessment of the drilling riser in this paper based on a comparison between the dms of the drilling riser induced by storms load variables e g ufj and lfj angle es and the resistance of the drilling riser the maximum ufj lfj angle and es limits lses for different dms of the drilling riser are defined as follows 7 l s e σ i σ i σ 0 8 l s e θ u i θ u i θ u 0 9 l s e θ l i θ l i θ l 0 where l s e σ i l s e θ u i l s e θ l i are limit state equations for es ufj angle and lfj angle of the

allowable values of es ufj angle and lfj angle resistance variables respectively defined as table 1 based on the lses the state of the drilling riser can be determined obviously i e safe or failed 2 3 logistic regression the limit state equations are calculated to determine the drilling riser is safe or failure for the experiment with a binary output the probability function can be obtained using logistic regression in eq 10 10 p z e ψ z 1 e ψ z where ψ z β 0 β 1 z is the logit function and β 0 and β 1 are the parameters of the logistic regression which can be determined using maximum likelihood estimation method as shown by hosmer et al 2013 and van erp and van gelder 2012 assuming a binary experiment y 1 if the riser is fail and y 0 if the riser is safe with a probability distribution of p z the likelihood function for n observations can be derived as shown in eq 11 11 l i k e l i h o o d i 1 n p y y i x x i i 1 n p x i y i 1 p x i 1 y i 3 methodology of the brann based fragility assessment 3 1 fragility assessment framework the schematic of the proposed methodology was depicted in fig 4 while the main procedure for brann based fragility assessment of the deepwater drilling riser system subject to storms as shown in fig 4 a which will be followed in the subsequent case applications will be addressed in more detail in this part step1 2 structure modeling and conducting fea simulations indeed structure modeling involves establishing a set of mechanical analysis model of drilling riser and estimating the load conditions of wave and current during storms fea is performed to calculate the dms of the drilling riser e g ufj angle lfj angle and es subject to storms and provide the benchmark data for developing and checking bdd model in the following step step3 bdd model development and checking the detailed bdd model development and checking procedure will be further illuminated in section 3 2 the purpose of developing and checking bdd model is to establish a robust brann based non intrusive model which can characterize relation between the im of storms and the dms of deepwater drilling risers step4 determination of random various distribution e g significant wave height h s the zero crossing wave period t z current velocity u generally it is assumed that the significant wave height follows a weibull distribution with two parameters the wave period follows a lognormal distribution and current velocity follows a weibull distribution with two parameters too based on the present sea state statistic data in south china sea the maximum likelihood estimation mle is applied to estimate those unknown parameters in above distributions thus the mentioned above random various distributions are determined step5 ims generating through latin hypercube sampling lhs lhs is a stratified sampling method which divides the probability distribution into n interval with equal probabilities n is the sampling size a variety of ims are generated through lhs method from the above determined random various distributions step6 im dms data cloud generating based on the developed bdd model in the step3 dms of the drilling riser can be obtained accurately and efficiently given the ims step7 9 lses calculating for every im dms data generated from the developed bdd model the lses of the drilling riser are defined according to eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 in section 2 2 step10 11 failure determination based on the lses and im y dataset generating for i th im dm data if any one of the defined three lses e g l e s σ i l e s θ u i l e s θ l i is negative the riser fails recorded as y 1 otherwise the riser survives recorded as y 0 thus all im y data is recorded for logistic regression and conducting fragility assessment of drilling risers in the next steps step12 14 fragility curves of drilling riser under storms calculation using logistic regression mentioned in section 2 3 step15 end of the procedure 3 2 procedure to develop the brann based model this part briefly demonstrates the procedure for bdd model developing and checking as shown in fig 4 b which will be employed in the following application the detailed steps are as follows step16 parametric normalization prior to the division of all the fea simulation the purpose of parametric normalization is to reduce data redundancy the normalization can be expressed as follows 12 z n 2 z z m i n z m i x z m i n 1 where z n is the normalized value z is parametric value z min is the minimum parametric value and z max is the maximum parametric value step17 dividing all the fea simulations into developing set and checking set the developing set which consists of training set 85 and testing set 15 is used to develop varied models and the checking set is used to check the generalization of developed models step18 setting the sample size and developing models coefficient determination r 2 between predicted data and simulation data of developing set is subsequently computed when the r 2 reaches its maximum value the model can be used to check the generalization in the next step step19 the model derived from the step3 is then used to estimate data of checking set similarly the r 2 between simulation data and predicted data of checking set is computed step20 increasing the size of developing set and repetitively carrying out step 3 and step 4 until n is equal to n which equals to the maximum samples of the developing set eventually both r 2 of developing set and checking set of each step 3 and step 4 are regarded as the indicator for the generalization of the brann dms deterministic bdd models after the optimal sample size of the developing set is determined the developed bdd model can be immediately used for the proposed fragility assessment procedure in section 3 1 4 case study 4 1 fea of the deepwater drilling riser 4 1 1 basic data a deepwater drilling riser system in the south china sea scs is selected for case study table 2 shows the basic parameters of the riser the sea state in the scs is selected for dynamic analysis of drilling riser for the current the returning period of surface current velocity u is shown in table 3 in terms of the wave the encounter frequencies of significant wave height h s and zero crossing wave period t z are shown in table 4 11 surface current velocities i e 0 2 m s 0 4 m s 0 6 m s 0 8 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s 1 4 m s 1 6 m s 1 8 m s 2 0 m s 2 2 m s are considered to conduct fea therefore regarding the combinations of wave states and current states 803 73 wave states 11 current velocities fea simulations are conducted to provide benchmark data for developing and checking bdd model in the following step according to the statistical material it is noted that t p 1 41 t z 4 1 2 dynamic response of the drilling riser 803 fea simulations are conducted in this research according to the sea states in section 4 1 1 and the dynamic responses or dms of the riser which are ufj angle lfj angle and es in this study can be calculated through the fea simulation result for illustrative purpose fig 5 shows one result of 803 fem simulations under the wave h s 11 5 m t z 10 5 s and the current u 1 8 m s in this study analysis time of 3 h is adopted to ensure a realistic and stable dynamic response thus it is considerably time consuming to conduct fea simulations for all 803 drilling riser simulations from the results shown in fig 5 the dynamic response of the riser fluctuates greatly in the initial stage of analysis time thus the results of dynamic response during this period are ignored from result of the dynamic response of the riser stress after the analysis time of 0 25 h shown in fig 5 a the maximum es of the riser is 449 2 mpa which exceeds the allowable stress 369 84 mpa moreover the maximum lfj angle is 12 82 which exceeds the critical limit 9 shown in fig 5 b from the result shown in fig 5 b the value of ufj angle is under the critical limit therefore the drilling riser is considered to be failure under this sea state according to the guidelines and limit state equations defined in section 2 2 4 2 brann dms deterministic modelling this part focuses on the bdd model developing and checking by employing those 803 fea simulations above the corresponding brann architecture is adopted in section 2 1 4 2 1 data division accordingly all the 803 fea simulations are divided into developing set 400 simulations and checking set 403 simulations additionally the simulation inputs of the developing set employed for bdd model development significantly influence model generalization the more simulation inputs the more accuracy and robustness of this developed model however large simulations are time consuming and labor consuming for engineering application therefore it is worthy to balance the tradeoff between the robustness and the simulation inputs thus it is necessary to study the influence of the simulation input number of developing set on the model generalization the number of fea simulations constituting of the developing set is varied in order to illustrate the influence of the simulation inputs on the generalization of this bdd model 5 cases are accordingly categorized case 1 contains 50 simulations case 2 contains 100 simulations case 3 contains 200 simulations case 4 contains 300 simulations and case 5 contains 400 simulations all the 5 cases contain 15 hidden neurons in addition each checking set of the 5 cases to check the generalization of each correspondingly developed model contains all the remaining 403 fem simulations besides the simulation input number it is difficult to confirm the appropriate hidden neuron numbers for application of brann therefore in this paper another 6 cases are accordingly categorized to determine the optimal number of hidden neuron case 6 contains 400 simulations and 1 hidden neuron case 7 contains 400 simulations and 5 hidden neurons case 8 contains 400 simulations and 10 hidden neurons case 9 contains 400 simulations and 15 hidden neuron case 10 contains 400 simulations and 20 hidden neurons case 11 contains 400 simulations and 25 hidden neurons in addition each checking set of the 6 cases to check the generalization of each correspondingly developed model contains all the 403 fem simulations 4 2 2 model development and checking fig 6 demonstrates the robustness analysis of bdd model under varied simulation inputs fig 6 a 6 c show the coefficient determination r 2 results of developing set and checking set of brann under varied simulation inputs it is observed that the r 2 of developing set becomes stable increase and comes near 1 with the increase of simulation input numbers meanwhile the r 2 of checking set also becomes steady and comes close to 0 999 along with the incremental simulation input numbers it is proved that the developed bdd model has no overfitting problem it is also worth noted that the maximum r 2 of checking set is 0 998 which is for ufj angle training and checking under 400 simulation inputs therefore it can be seen from the above results that the brann based model is quite robust and accurate and the optimal number of simulation inputs can be determined to be 400 however besides the number of simulation inputs brann is also sensitive to hidden neuron numbers for general application fig 7 demonstrates the robustness analysis of bdd model under varied hidden neuron numbers fig 7 a 7 c show the coefficient determination r 2 results of developing set and checking set of brann under varied hidden neuron numbers it is observed that the coefficient determination r 2 of developing set becomes stable and approaches 1 with the increase of hidden neuron numbers meanwhile the r 2 of checking set also becomes steady and comes close to 0 998 along with the incremental hidden neuron numbers it is also proved that the developed bdd model has no overfitting problem it is also worth noted that the maximum r2 of checking set is 0 997 which is for ufj training and checking under 15 hidden neuron numbers and 400 simulation inputs therefore it can be seen from the above results that the brann based model is quite robust and accurate and the optimal number of hidden neuron can be determined to be 15 thus the developed brann based model with 400 simulation input numbers and 15 hidden neuron numbers is determined moreover fig 8 shows the checking results for the developed bdd model it is can be seen that the checking results are satisfactory most of the results are distributed around the blue diagonal line it is furtherly proved the accuracy and robustness of the proposed brann based model and it is also worth to note from the above results that the developed bdd model is more appropriate for ufj angle 4 3 brann based fragility assessment after being developed and checked the determined bdd model can be used to conduct fast running simulations thus a large number of im dms data can be generated efficiently to calculate the fragility curve this section is to describe the generation of fragility curve of the riser subjected to storms by combining the efficient and robust brann based non intrusive model with monte carlo simulation mcs 4 3 1 determined bdd model based mcs to generate the fragility curves of the drilling riser subject to the storms mcs in conjunction with the determined bdd model was used to generate a large amount of random values of lses as in eq 7 to eq 9 for illustrative purposes only ims of storms in this study which are regarded as the random variables include wave height wave period and current velocity based on the sea states listed in tables 3 and 4 the significant wave height is assumed to follow the two parameter weibull distribution whose probability density function pdf is shown in eq 13 13 f x k λ k λ x λ k 1 exp x λ k x 0 where x is the variable k and λ are the shape and scale parameters respectively correspondingly the zero crossing wave period t z conditional on h s is practically modeled by a lognormal distribution 14 f x σ μ 1 x σ 2 π exp ln x μ 2 σ 2 2 x 0 where x is the variable μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation similarly the current surface velocity is modeled as weibull distribution in eq 13 the maximum likelihood estimation mle is applied to estimate those unknown parameters given wave data shown in table 3 through the mle the evaluation results of the unknown parameters in eq 13 and eq 14 are listed in table 5 normally the sample size will significantly impact the accuracy of mcs in order to determine the appropriate sample size lhs is then performed to randomly extract 5 groups of input ims of storms randomly according to the above weibull distribution and lognormal distribution lhs is a stratified sampling method which divides the probability distribution into n interval with equal probabilities n is the sampling size the most advantage of lhs is that it can efficiently reduce the sampling size meanwhile make the samples cover all the ims of sea states as much as possible in order to make the samples cover all the sea states in storms the lower boundary and upper boundary of sampling are determined in table 6 note for each group we obtain m m 803 2000 5000 samples of ims note that the sample size of 803 which is equal to fea data size is regarded as the sample size of conventional mcs method with those ims the dms of the riser are calculated accurately and efficiently by applying the developed bdd model thus the number of mcs can expand to m in other words an im dms dataset containing m samples is generated for each im dms data the state of the riser can be determined according to values of lses as in eq 7 to eq 9 if the riser fails y 1 0 otherwise y 0 0 finally an im y dataset containing m samples is generated to carry out fragility assessment of the riser subject to storms directly the statistical data of samples with varied sample sizes using lhs is shown in fig 9 4 3 2 fragility curves of the riser subjected to storms this part is to describe the generation of fragility curve of the riser subjected to storms and determine the appropriate sample size through the logistic regression mentioned in section 2 3 for each random value of significant wave height h s a failure probability p h s can be predicted using eq 10 forming a likelihood function for each set of h s y and p h s using eq 11 the optimal values of β 0 and β 1 can be estimated using the mle analysis for each random value of current velocity the optimal values of β 0 and β 1 can be as well as estimated following the same procedure the results of the optimal values of logistic regression parameters are shown in table 7 while fig 10 and fig 11 demonstrate the 5 groups of fragility curves calculated with 803 2000 and 5000 samples note that the sample size of 803 which is equal to fea data size is regarded as the sample size of the conventional mcs method as can be seen from fig 10 when probability value of failure is 0 5 the interval of the uncertainty in im of wave height is about 1 03 under 803 samples when the sample size increases to 2000 the interval of the uncertainty is reduced to 0 594 however as sample size increases from 2000 to 5000 the interval is significantly reduced to 0 074 from fig 11 we can see that when probability value of failure is 0 5 the interval of the uncertainty in im of current velocity will be about 0 267 under 803 samples when the sample size increases to 2000 the interval of the uncertainty decreases to 0 090 however as sample size increases from 2000 to 5000 the interval is significantly reduced to 0 021 although the uncertainty interval will further decrease with the increase of the samples more than 5000 samples would considerably increase the computational cost thus the sample size is determined to be 5000 as the trade off between computational cost and uncertainty the fragility curves of the riser subject to the storms calculated by 5000 samples are depicted in fig 12 and fig 13 one can conclude from fig 12 when the significant wave height is less than h s 3 5m the probability of failure of the riser is equal to 0 which means the drilling riser can keep drilling normally under this sea state the failure probability of the riser reaches 65 when the significant wave height is h s 7 5m thus the operators are suggested to suspend the drilling operations and keep the drilling risers connected to the wellhead to survive in the storm while the failure probability of the riser is more than 95 under the sea state of h s 9m which indicates that emergency disconnect of the riser should be performed timely to avoid serious damage to the drilling riser system and secure the well under this extreme condition as mentioned before the current velocity is another im of storms fig 13 shows the fragility curve subject to storms as im of current velocity as outlined in fig 13 the critical current velocity for drilling safely is u 0 7 m s the critical current velocity for non drilling is u 1 4 m s as can be seen from the fragility curve in fig 13 the failure probability of riser reaches to 80 under the current velocity of 1 4 m s it means that the riser is likely to be at risk of failure in drilling mode thus the drilling riser is suggested to be connected to the wellhead for non drilling mode to survive in the storm moreover the critical current velocity for performing emergency disconnect of the riser system is u 1 8 m s to avoid risk of failure of the drilling riser as stated in section 4 1 2 a deepwater drilling riser system in the south china sea is selected for analysis the selected drilling riser was seen to fail when exposed to a storm with the wave h s 11 5 m t z 10 5 s and the current u 1 8 m s this observation has been denoted in figs 12 and 13 with a vertical dotted line for which the probability of failure in case of the wave h s 11 5 m and the current u 1 8 m s is equal to 1 0 4 3 3 validation of the proposed methodology a comparison is made between conventional mcs method and the proposed brann based methodology fig 14 demonstrates the results of comparisons between the conventional mcs method and the proposed brann based methodology to generate the fragility curves with 803 samples with respect to the fragility curves in fig 14 we can see that the brann based method curve stays coherent with the conventional mcs curve it is proved that the proposed brann dms deterministic model and the brann based methodology which could effectively reflect the non linear relationship between the input and output data can generate thousands of non numerical data under limited fea to assess the fragility of the drilling risers under storms additionally from the results shown in figs 10 and 11 the fragility curves of the drilling riser calculated using the proposed brann based methodology have a narrower uncertainty interval compared to the conventional mcs method due to the limited sample size of the conventional mcs method thus the proposed approach is verified to be robust and efficient in assessing the fragility of the drilling risers under storms with lower uncertainty 5 conclusions this study proposed an efficient and robust brann based non intrusive methodology for fragility assessment of deepwater drilling risers subject to storms the brann dms deterministic model is proved to be efficient and robust for building the statistical relation between the intensity measures of storms and the dynamic response of the riser the conclusions of this research are listed as follows the development of the brann dms deterministic model a numerical model with 15 hidden neurons and 400 simulation input numbers is proposed to study the dynamic response of the drilling riser subject to storms this developed brann model consists of three key parts input layer hidden layer and output layer besides the developed brann based model with 400 simulation input numbers and 15 hidden neurons is proved to be efficient and robust for predicting dms of the drilling riser subject to storms since the r 2 of the checking set would become steady and comes close to 1 along with the incremental simulation input numbers or hidden neuron numbers the brann dms deterministic model based framework for fragility assessment of deepwater drilling risers subject to storms after being developed and checked the determined bdd model can be used to conduct fast running simulations thus a large number of im dms data can be generated efficiently to calculate the fragility curve with mcs and logistic regression a comparison is made between conventional mcs method and the proposed approach to calculate the fragility curves of the drilling riser subject to storms the proposed approach was verified to be robust and efficient in assessing the fragility of the drilling risers under storms with lower uncertainty application of the proposed methodology was demonstrated on a deepwater drilling riser subject to storms in south china sea the fragility curve generated with the logistic regression assumption is described by significant wave height and current velocity the analysis results from the fragility curves could provide reference for decision making of drilling riser operations under harsh environment credit

20948,the interaction between the semi submersible offshore fish farm soff and waves was investigated by numerical simulations and dedicated model tests the soff generally consists of three main components such as large pontoon frame system and net system and the hydrodynamic forces cannot be calculated by the same method due to the big difference in the main dimensions of them therefore a hybrid numerical method of direct time domain and indirect time domain for the soff was proposed in this paper and the calculation program was originally developed in the present numerical method the three dimensional potential theory was used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads on the large pontoon through indirect time domain and the morison equation and screen model were used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads on the frame system and net system respectively then the total hydrodynamic loads on the soff at each time step can be obtained and the motion responses of the soff were calculated in the time domain the model tests were carried out in the wave basin and the heave and pitch motions with wave periods were obtained the numerical results were verified by the experimental results a good agreement exists between the numerical results and experimental results then the effects of some key parameters on the motion responses were investigated by the present numerical model such as draft wave height and net solidity ratio the results show that the draught of soff has an obvious influence on the heave and pitch motion in addition heave and pitch response amplitudes are positively correlated with wave amplitude and the change of net solidity ratio has a notable effect on the heave motion and pitch motion keywords aquaculture engineering numerical simulation model test hydrodynamic potential theory motion response 1 introduction last several decades have witnessed the rapid growth of ocean resources and space demand in addition global demand for seafood has also increased sharply so fishery production is becoming more and more exuberant and the industry has moved to more exposed sites with large currents and waves over the past decade because of lack of available nearshore production sites in heavily utilized coastal zones klebert et al 2013 chu et al 2019 increasingly attention has been attracted to the fishery and aquaculture equipment the word s first semi submersible offshore fish farm soff ocean farm 1 see fig 1 a has arrived at frohavet in 2017 and the deep blue 1 see fig 1 b has been installed in yellow sea in 2018 these new type soff aspires to address central issues related to sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry these new type soff always consists of large pontoon space frame and net in which the large pontoon can provide sufficient buoyancy for the soff and the space frame is made by slender bars and used to fixed the net hydrodynamic analysis is so important for the new type soff in the design stage numerical simulations and model tests for the study of both steady and unsteady performance of aquaculture units have been presented during the past decades the mooring loads of a realistic aquaculture fish farm system in both regular and irregular waves were investigated by numerical simulations and model tests shen et al 2018 the net cage was modelled using truss elements that represented several

linear mathematical model of a freely floating 2d closed flexible fish cages in waves have been developed it was found that the wave induced rigid body motion responses of a flexible cffc in sway heave and roll were significantly different from the responses of a rigid cffc and non linear free surface effects must be accounted for inside the tank in realistic sea conditions strand and faltinsen 2019 the hydrodynamic characteristics of a floater net system in oscillatory and steady flows were investigated through forced oscillation experiments in a towing tank and the effects of keulegan carpenter number reynolds number and reduced velocity were studied fu et al 2014 an innovative hybrid method was proposed to determine the hydroelastic responses of full scale floater and net systems and the net for the fish cage was vertically and peripherally divided into similar interconnected sections with different hydrodynamic parameters which were assumed to be uniformly distributed

al 2016 a novel concept that combines multiple megawatt vertical axis wind turbines and a solar array with a floating steel fish farming cage was proposed and fully coupled time domain simulations for the combined wind solar aquaculture system were carried out to estimate the extreme responses of this system in survival conditions zheng et al 2020 the system of soff does include three main components the big pontoon space frame system and net system compared to a realistic soff the total system was simplified to reduce the complexity of the soff and the main dimensions of these components have a big difference in order to calculate the motion responses of the soff a hybrid numerical method of direct time domain and indirect time domain for the soff was developed in this paper in this numerical method the pontoon was considered as the large body while the pipes and columns were considered as the small bodies in this study the hydrodynamic loads of the pontoon were calculated by using the potential theory through the indirect time domain however the hydrodynamic loads on the slender bodies were obtained by the morison formula in the direct time domain and the hydrodynamic loads of the net system were calculated by screen model in the direct time domain then the total hydrodynamic loads of the soff were obtained in each time step then the motion equations of the soff were built in the time domain and the 2 stage predictor corrector method was used to solve the motion equations and the hybrid calculation program was originally developed and the motion responses of a soff at different wave conditions were analyzed the physical model tests in the wave basin were conducted to verify the numerical model next the effect of the draught water parameters and net solidity ratio on the motion responses of the soff were studied finally some conclusions were presented 2 theory and numerical method the motion responses of the soff are solved by a numerical simulation method there are three components in the soff which are pontoon frame system and net system in brief the hydrodynamic forces acting on the pontoon frame system and net system are calculated firstly next the motion equations of the soff are presented according to newton s second law then the motion responses are obtained by solving the motion equations by the 2 stage predictor corrector method the theoretical model for the pontoon frame system and net system is described in some detail in the following in order to simplify the expression coordinate systems are introduced one is the global coordinate system o xyz or called fixed reference axes fra with the origin located at the mean free surface of the fluid as shown in fig 2 the x y and z axis are positive and point to the bow port and upwards for all three coordinates the other one is the local system o xyz fixed on the floating soff relative to the mean position with the origins located at the center of gravity cog of the floating soff the axis of the local coordinate system is parallel to the axis of the global coordinate system at the initial time respectively the soff is assumed as a rigid body that has six degrees of freedom dof namely surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the wave direction β is defined as the angle between the wave propagating direction and the positive x axis measured clock wise in the oxy plane of the fra as shown in fig 2 2 1 hydrodynamic forces of large pontoon the wave body interaction is a complicated problem and cannot be solved without some simplifying assumptions for a large body the pontoon of soff the relative fluid displacement and hence the viscous energy dissipation is small thus the only source of energy dissipation is the propagation of the gravity waves which undergo significant scattering or diffraction when the structure spans more than about a fifth of the incident wavelength sarpkaya 2010 the fluid is assumed to be inviscid continuous and incompressible the flow is considered as irrotational flow so the potential theory can be used to calculate the interaction of free surface gravity with the pontoons faltinsen 1995 in this linear theory analysis the amplitude of the surface wave is small and the floating structure is undergoing small oscillations under these assumptions the velocity potential φ x y z t can be separated into three parts 1 φ x y z t ϕ x y z e i ω t ϕ i ϕ d j 1 6 ϕ r j x j e i ω t where ϕ x y z is the space potential of the velocity potential φ x y z t based on the linear superposition theory ϕ x y z can be decomposed to the sum of incident wave potential ϕ i diffraction potential ϕ d and unit radiation potential ϕ r j the subscript j 1 2 6 denotes the j th dof of the body x y z is the coordinate of the field points in the fra x j is the j th dof of the structure ω is the wave angular frequency i is the standard imaginary unit t is time the velocity potential should satisfy the helmholtz equation 2 φ k sin θ 2 φ 0 which will reduce to the laplace equation in the case of normal incidence θ 0 as well as the boundary conditions such as linear free surface the stationary bottom surface the wetted surface of the floating body and the far field condition and the incident wave potential can be written as 2 φ i x y z t ϕ i x y z e i ω t i g a cosh k z d ω cosh k d e i ω t k x cos β y sin β α where a is the amplitude of the incident wave d is the water depth β is the incident wave direction g is gravitational acceleration α is the wave phase k is the wave number which is related to the angular frequency ω through the dispersion relation 3 ω 2 g k tanh k d the diffraction wave potential ϕ d x y z should satisfy the governing equation and the boundary conditions and it will be expressed in terms of pulsating sources distributed over the mean wetted surface of the floating structures on the basis of green s theorem then wave exciting forces including froude krylov force and diffraction force will be calculated by using the incident wave potential and diffraction wave potential faltinsen 1995 the radiation wave potential will be also solved by the direct boundary element method after the velocity potential φ x y z t is obtained the first order hydrodynamic pressure distribution can be calculated by using the linearized bernoulli s equation 4 p ρ φ x y z t t the first order

krylov force due to incident wave f d j is the j th mode diffracting force f r j l is j th mode radiation force due to l th mode motion of unit amplitude the real and imaginary parts in eq 9 are called added mass and radiation damping coefficients and they can be expressed as 10 a j l ρ ω s 0 im φ r l n j d s 11 b j l ρ s 0 re φ r l n j d s here re and im denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex variable respectively variations in the wetted hull surface due to severe sea waves and or large amplitude motions may contribute significantly to nonlinear hydrodynamic loads nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov wave forces over the instantaneous wetted surface should be calculated from the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic model and the integral area of eq 7 will be changed from s 0 to s which is the instantaneous wetted surface of the floating structure however the diffraction and radiation components are of comparable magnitude and are linear quantities the diffraction force in short crest waves contributed by all the diffracting panels is 12 f d t e t n d p 1 n p j 1 a j p f d ω j p β p e i k j p x g cos χ p k j p y g sin χ p ω j p t α j p where e t is the euler rotation matrix at time t β p χ p θ 3 t is the relative heading angle of the wave direction with respect to the structure where θ 3 t is the yaw motion angle of the structure and f d ω j p β p is the diffraction wave force induced by a unit amplitude incident wave with frequency ω j p and relative wave direction β p whose components are expressed in eq 8 and calculated by a hydrodynamic analysis prior to the current time domain analysis n d is the number of wave directions and n p is the number of wave components in the p th wave direction a j p is the wave amplitude 2 2 hydrodynamic forces of the frame the frame system consists of many pipes and columns and the diameter is obviously smaller than the diameter of the pontoon and the diffraction parameter for the pipes and columns and the diffraction are negligibly small so the pipes and columns are considered slender structures for slender structural members having cross sectional dimensions sufficiently small to allow the gradients of fluid particle velocities and accelerations in the direction normal to the member to be neglected wave loads may be calculated using morison s load formula being a sum of an inertia force proportional to acceleration and a drag force proportional to the square of velocity the hydrodynamic force exerted on the pipes can be estimated by summing up sectional forces on each strip of the structure and the force vector acting on a strip can be decomposed in a normal force f n p and a tangential force f t p the normal force and the tangential drag force per unit length can be written as 13 f n p ρ c a a x l ρ 1 c a a v 1 2 ρ d c d v r v r 14 f t p 1 2 ρ c t d v 2 15 v r γ v w v c x l where x l is the velocity of member normal to axis x l is the acceleration of member normal to axis v

drag force per unit length along the long direction of the slender structure which is under the instantaneous water surface then hydrodynamic forces of the frame system of soff can be calculated by superposing the force of each pipe and column at every time step 2 3 hydrodynamic forces of the net the hydrodynamic forces acting on the net system are modelled by the screen type force model kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 the net is divided into net panels each with an area a representing a part of the physical net the net solidity ratio can be calculated by the following equation 19 s n 2 d w l w d w l w 2 where d w is twine diameter l w is twine length hydrodynamic force on a net panel under waves and currents was divided into drag and lift force calculated from 20 f d n 1 2 ρ c d n

n are the drag and lift coefficients of the net panel respectively which can be expressed as functions of solidity ratio reynolds number and inflow angle the drag and lift coefficients were calculated using formulas derived by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 n d and n l are the unit vectors in the direction of the drag and lift force respectively which are calculated by the following formula 22 n d v r v r 23 n l v r n en v r v r n en v r where n en is the unit normal vector of the net panel and the direction of it in the positive flow direction and the unit vectors and relative velocity will be calculated at each time step then the hydrodynamic forces of the net system will be obtained through adding the forces of each net panel 2 4 motion equations of the soff in time domain to consider the coupling effects between soff and the effect of external forces the time domain coupled analyses are fulfilled in the regular wave the motion equation in the time domain can be given as 24 m μ μ s x c x f w f b g f s f net where m is the structural mass matrix μ is the added mass matrices of the large body μ s is the added mass matrices of the small body c is the damping matrices of the large body f w t is the wave exciting force vector including the nonlinear froude krylov force and the diffraction force f b is the hydrostatic force vector which can be calculated by integrating the hydrostatic pressure over the instantaneous wetted surface of the structure g is the gravity force f s is the hydrodynamic force of the slender body f net is the hydrodynamic force of the net structure x t is the structure acceleration response vector if the initial conditions are given the motions and the forces can be calculated by the above equations in each time step the coupling second order differential equations are solved by numerical integration and a 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm is used in the present work 3 experiment 3 1 the model and facilities the model tests of the soff were conducted in the seakeeping wave basin at the china ship scientific research center cssrc in wuxi city china the basin has dimensions of 69 m in length 46 m in width and 4 m in water depth the system arrangement of the wave basin is shown in fig 3 waves are generated by the flap type wave generator and opposite to wave maker a wave dissipation beach is installed to absorb the incoming waves the soff is obviously different from the traditional offshore structure the physical model of soff see fig 4 consists of the pontoon primary frame system net system and upper building the net diameter is significantly smaller than the main dimensions of the pontoon and frame system so different scales are used 3 1 1 pontoon and frame system the pontoon is an important part of the soff and it mainly provides buoyancy for the soff and the draught of the soff can be adjusted by adjusting the ballast water in the pontoon the diameter of the pontoon is 40 m in the prototype the frame system consists of several pipes with different diameter and the diameter of pipes vary from 1 0 m to 4 0 m in the prototype in accordance with the dimensions of the wave basin and the diameter of the soff and the tested wave conditions the selected scale for pontoon and frame system was 1 27 78 the scale of pontoon and frame system was designed by the gravity similarity the motion responses of the soff were measured by an untouched motion capturing system a data acquisition system would sample the wave elevation and motion response simultaneously during the model tests the frame system and pontoon are connected and the frame system and pontoon model is made up of plexiglass the components of the soff are described in fig 5 the detailed parameters of the pontoon and frame system in this study are presented in table 1 both end of center column are round table type which is convenient to connect with the pontoon and the upper building the mechanical parameters of the soff in prototype and model scale are listed in table 2 which are already include the effect of the net system 3 1 2 net system the net is supported by the frame system and the fish living space is constituted by frame system and net system the diameter of net twine is only 0 003 m and the mesh size of the net is 0 0235 m and the solidity of the net is 0 239 if the selected scale of the net system is the same as the ones for the pontoon and frame system the diameter of the net would be 0 0001 m in the model and there is no net with such puniness diameter so the scale of the net must be different from the scale for the pontoon and frame system as we known the main hydrodynamic force on the net is drag force so the drag force of the net in the model must similar to that in the prototype then the prototype net is used in the physical model which is shown in fig 4 3 2 experiment set ups the scale ratio of the model to the prototype soff is λ 1 27 78 the corresponding water depth for model tests is 1 8 m so an artificial bottom was built at the 1 8 m depth in the wave basin in order to prevent the model from drifting away in free floating conditions soft lines were attached to the model in a symmetric pattern as shown in fig 6 the stiffness of the soft line is 10 8 n m in the model the attachment point of lines is located on the cross section of the pontoon and the other attachment point of lines is located on the free surface and the mooring radius is 3 5 m in the model the experimental model of soff is shown in fig 7 prior to the regular wave tests free decay tests in calm water were conducted to verify the setup and properties of the models and to obtain the natural periods and damping levels of the soff the model tests were conducted under white noise waves to obtain the responses amplitude operators rao of motion the 6 dof motion responses of the soff were measured by an optical remote motion capturing system 4 numerical simulation and validations 4 1 numerical model description in the present paper the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the above theory the numerical model of the soff was built by using the ansys and the numerical simulating model is shown in fig 8 there are 5132 panels for the pontoon regarding the hydrodynamic modeling the pontoon was considered as large volume structures and its hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass radiation damping and wave excitation forces were estimated based on potential flow theory the hydrodynamic forces on the frame system were obtained by morison s load formula the mesh size of the pipes and columns is 0 5 m and there are 4204 elements for the frame system the hydrodynamic forces on the net system were obtained by the screen model the instantaneous incident wave surface was considered in this calculation while calculating the hydrodynamic forces on the frame system and net system then the motion equations in the time domain were calculated by the 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm the soff is also assumed as a rigid body in the numerical simulation the time step is 0 4 s in the numerical simulation in the past research on the effect of single net structure on the attenuation of flow velocity has shown that the formulas for flow velocity reduction of the cage nets are as follows aarsnes et al 1990 25 v v 0 i 1 n c r i 26 r i 1 0 0 46 c d where r i is the flow velocity reduction factor n c is the number of upstream crossings of other plane nets before the current hits the actual plane net and the net solidity ratio is 0 239 c d is about 0 39 when the inflow angle is 0 the fluid velocity reduction wake factor in the rear half of the soff is obtained by equation 26 and r 0 82 however a smaller fluid velocity reduction may be suitable for cylindrical cages such as r 0 69 zhan et al 2006 in addition considering that the space frame system will also dissipate a certain amount of fluid energy the fluid velocity reduction is taken as 0 69 in this paper 4 2 decay tests table 3 shows the natural periods and linear damping coefficients for the soff from the decay tests it is found that the natural periods of vertical motions calculated by numerical simulations are in good agreement with the target values and the relative error of heave roll and pitch natural period are 5 31 5 68 and 4 66 respectively the damping ratio of heave is 0 16 and 0 17 obtained by model test and numerical simulation while the amplitude of heave is 1 0 m respectively and the damping ratios of roll and pitch gave in table 3 are the value when the roll and pitch amplitude is 1 respectively fig 9 compares the free decay curves of heave roll and pitch oscillation test of soff in the calm water obtained by the numerical simulations and experiments from these figures it is indicated that the time history curves of oscillation tests obtained from the present numerical simulation agree with those from model tests from fig 9 a it is found that the vertical displacements acquired through numerical simulation are basically consistent with the test results in large scale oscillation the natural periods of heave calculated by the numerical method is about 44 6 s which is smaller than the one obtained by model test fig 9 b shows the time history of roll motion which indicates that the natural period of roll calculated by the numerical method is slightly smaller than that of model tests it can be seen from fig 9 c that a similar phenomenon appears in the pitch decay curve besides it is found that as the oscillation amplitude decreases the gap of vertical displacement obtained by numerical calculation and tests increases it indicates that the damping ratios calculated by the numerical method is agreed with the ones obtained by model tests when the oscillation amplitude of heave is large 4 3 motion response of the soff the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the present numerical method and the heave and pitch motion are compared with the ones obtained by experiments in fig 10 the horizontal axis represents the wave period and the vertical axis represents the amplitude of motion under regular waves with the wave amplitude of 1 m it can be seen that the heave motions calculated by numerical simulation are the same as the ones of experiments when the wave period is smaller than 10 s from fig 10 a and the numerical results become smaller than the experimental results as the wave period in the range of 10 s 12 s however as the wave period increases the numerical results of heave become bigger than the ones obtained by model tests the main reason is that the fluid is viscous in the experiment and the net and the frame have a shielding effect on the fluid particle velocity so the experimental value is relatively small from fig 10 b it is found that the trend of pitch motions with wave periods calculated by numerical calculation is the same as the experimental results however pitch motions calculated by the numerical method are bigger than those obtained by model tests especially when the wave period is between 10 s and 14 s two factors have caused this phenomenon on the one hand there is a difference in linear damping ratio during smaller pitch oscillation on the other hand the fluid particle velocity will be reduced after passing through the front net and frame system of the soff the energy dissipation comes from the propagation of the gravity waves which undergo significant scattering or diffraction when the waves pass through the large pontoon that spans more than a fifth of the incident wavelength this will further reduce the fluid particle velocity but the fluid velocity reduction is not considered the scattering and diffraction of the pontoon in this paper it should be measured the fluid velocity reduction caused by large pontoon by further experiments 5 results with numerical sensitivity study 5 1 effect of draught on the motion response the soff is towed to the target sea area by dry towing and then sinks to the design draft by increasing the ballast water in addition the draught of the soff will also be adjusted under different sea conditions and the motion responses will present different variation tendencies with the different drafts of the soff fig 11 presents the heave and pitch motions with the wave periods at the different drafts of the soff it can be found from fig 11 a that when the wave period is the same the heave motion increases with the decrease of the draft in addition as the wave period increases the difference in heave responses at different draught increases the heave responses at a draft of 32 m are 1 4 1 6 times larger than those with a draft of 37 m and the heave responses with a draft of 22 m are 1 4 4 9 times larger than those with a draft of 37 m and the biggest difference between the heave motions with the two draughts occurs when the wave period is 6 s the main reason for the above phenomenon is that there is a large pontoon at the bottom of the soff and the interaction between the pontoon and waves will cause large wave forces and the wave forces will increase with the decrease of the draught because of the closer to the free surface the bigger the fluid particle velocity it can be observed from fig 11 b that the pitch motion increases with the decrease of the draft when the wave period is at the range of 8 s 12 s and the pitch motion increase with the increase of the draft when the wave period is bigger than 14 5 s the pitch motions at a draft of 22 m are 2 5 times bigger than those at a draft of 37 m as the wave period is 10 s and the pitch motions at a draft of 32 m are 1 3 times bigger than those at a draft of 37 m as wave period is 10 s however the pitch motions at a draft of 32 m are close to the pitch motions at a draft of 37 m while the wave period is less than 8 s and the pitch motions at a draft of 37 m are obviously larger than those at a draft of 22 m when the wave period is bigger than 16 s it indicates that the draft of the soff can be increased to avoid large motion responses at the severe sea states 5 2 effect of wave amplitude on the motion response fig 12 shows the motion responses of the soff with a draft of 37 m under different wave conditions the horizontal axis represents the wave amplitude which is ranges from 1 0 m to 3 0 m and the vertical axis represents the amplitude of the motion response in the figures from fig 12 it is found that heave and pitch response amplitude is positively correlated with wave amplitude and the heave response increases linearly with the increase of the wave amplitude the heave motion at a wave amplitude of 3 0 m is 3 2 times bigger than that at a wave amplitude of 1 0 m when the wave period is 12 s besides the growth rate of heave response with wave amplitude at a wave period of 12 s is bigger than that at a wave period of 8 s it can be observed from fig 12 b that pitch response increases sharply with the increase of the wave amplitude the pitch motion at a wave amplitude of 3 0 m is 7 4 times bigger than that at a wave amplitude of 1 0 m when the wave period is 12 s in addition the growth rate of pitch response with wave amplitude at 12 s is close to that at 8 s 5 3 effect of net solidity ratio on the motion response in the following section the effects of the net solidity ratio on the motion response will be analyzed the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the present numerical method while using three different nets and the parameters of the net are shown in table 4 the comparison of motion responses of the soff with the different net is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a it can be seen that there is little influence of net solidity ratio on the heave motion when the wave period is smaller than 12 s however the heave motion increases with the increase of net solidity ratio when the wave period is bigger than 12 s and the gap of heave motions of soff with different nets increases with the increase of the wave period when the wave period is bigger than 12 s the amplitude of heave motion of the soff with a net of sn 0 34 is 3 33 larger than that when a net of sn 0 239 is adopted in the soff also the amplitude of heave motion of the soff with a net of sn 0 34 is 3 69 larger than that when a net of sn 0 127 is adopted in the soff it indicates that the soff will suffer larger wave loads under the action of long period waves when a big solidity ratio net is used it can be seen from fig 13 b that pitch motions increase with the increase of the net solidity ratio when the wave period is ranges from 6 s to 12 s however pitch motions decrease with the increase of the net solidity ratio when the wave period is bigger than 14 s it indicates that the damping effect of the net system is more significant at the short wave and the damping effect becomes weaker as the wave length increases 6 conclusions this research work is focused on the interaction of the soff and waves for calculating the motion responses of the soff a hybrid numerical model of the direct time domain and indirect time domain for the soff is proposed in the present paper the hydrodynamic loads of the large pontoon are obtained by indirect time domain and the hydrodynamic loads of the frame system and net system are computed by direct time domain under the instantaneous water surface then the motion equation of the soff is built in the time domain and the 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm is used to integrate the estimated acceleration for the structure velocity and position the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the present numerical method and verified by the model tests then the effects of the draft wave height and net solidity ratio on the motion responses of the soff are analyzed the conclusions are summarized as follow 1 the present numerical method can simulate the performances of the soff and the trend of motion response agrees with the experimental results the fluid velocity reduction should be considered while calculating the hydrodynamic loads of the frame system and net system 2 the draught of soff has obvious influences on the heave and pitch motions and the heave motions increase with the decrease of the draft at the same wave condition and the heave responses with a draft of 22 m are 1 4 4 9 times larger than those with a draft of 37 m for pitch motion it increases with the decrease of the draft when the wave period is at the range of 8 s 12 s and the pitch motions increase with the increase of the draft when the wave period is bigger than 14 5 s these numerical results indicate that the wave loads on the soff can be reduced by increasing the draft and the motion response can be reduced 3 the heave and pitch motion are closely proportional to the wave height however there is some difference in the growth rate of the heave motions at various wave periods 4 the interaction between the net and waves produces two effects on the one hand the net will be subjected to wave loads on the other hand the net can also exert a damping effect and shielding effect and the net mainly plays a load role for heave motion and the wave loads acting on the net increase with the increase of net solidity ratio however the damping effect for pitch motion is more significant at longer waves besides the net with different solidity ratios receive different wave loads and at the same time the damping effect is also different credit authorship contribution statement yu ji miao writing methodology software

20948,the interaction between the semi submersible offshore fish farm soff and waves was investigated by numerical simulations and dedicated model tests the soff generally consists of three main components such as large pontoon frame system and net system and the hydrodynamic forces cannot be calculated by the same method due to the big difference in the main dimensions of them therefore a hybrid numerical method of direct time domain and indirect time domain for the soff was proposed in this paper and the calculation program was originally developed in the present numerical method the three dimensional potential theory was used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads on the large pontoon through indirect time domain and the morison equation and screen model were used to calculate the hydrodynamic loads on the frame system and net system respectively then the total hydrodynamic loads on the soff at each time step can be obtained and the motion responses of the soff were calculated in the time domain the model tests were carried out in the wave basin and the heave and pitch motions with wave periods were obtained the numerical results were verified by the experimental results a good agreement exists between the numerical results and experimental results then the effects of some key parameters on the motion responses were investigated by the present numerical model such as draft wave height and net solidity ratio the results show that the draught of soff has an obvious influence on the heave and pitch motion in addition heave and pitch response amplitudes are positively correlated with wave amplitude and the change of net solidity ratio has a notable effect on the heave motion and pitch motion keywords aquaculture engineering numerical simulation model test hydrodynamic potential theory motion response 1 introduction last several decades have witnessed the rapid growth of ocean resources and space demand in addition global demand for seafood has also increased sharply so fishery production is becoming more and more exuberant and the industry has moved to more exposed sites with large currents and waves over the past decade because of lack of available nearshore production sites in heavily utilized coastal zones klebert et al 2013 chu et al 2019 increasingly attention has been attracted to the fishery and aquaculture equipment the word s first semi submersible offshore fish farm soff ocean farm 1 see fig 1 a has arrived at frohavet in 2017 and the deep blue 1 see fig 1 b has been installed in yellow sea in 2018 these new type soff aspires to address central issues related to sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry these new type soff always consists of large pontoon space frame and net in which the large pontoon can provide sufficient buoyancy for the soff and the space frame is made by slender bars and used to fixed the net hydrodynamic analysis is so important for the new type soff in the design stage numerical

linear mathematical model of a freely floating 2d closed flexible fish cages in waves have been developed it was found that the wave induced rigid body motion responses of a flexible cffc in sway heave and roll were significantly different from the responses of a rigid cffc and non linear free surface effects must be accounted for inside the tank in realistic sea conditions strand and faltinsen 2019 the hydrodynamic characteristics of a floater net system in oscillatory and steady flows were investigated through forced oscillation experiments in a towing tank and the effects of keulegan carpenter number reynolds number and reduced velocity were studied fu et al 2014 an innovative hybrid method was proposed to determine the hydroelastic responses of full scale floater and net

al 2016 a novel concept that combines multiple megawatt vertical axis wind turbines and a solar array with a floating steel fish farming cage was proposed and fully coupled time domain simulations for the combined wind solar aquaculture system were carried out to estimate the extreme responses of this system in survival conditions zheng et al 2020 the system of soff does include three main components the big pontoon space frame system and net system compared to a realistic soff the total system was simplified to reduce the complexity of the soff and the main dimensions of these components have a big difference in order to calculate the motion responses of the soff a hybrid numerical method of direct time domain and indirect time domain for the soff was developed in this paper in this numerical method the pontoon was considered as the large body while the pipes and columns were considered as the small bodies in this study the hydrodynamic loads of the pontoon were calculated by using the potential theory through the indirect time domain however the hydrodynamic loads on the slender bodies were obtained by the morison formula in the direct time domain and the hydrodynamic loads of the net system were calculated by screen model in the direct time domain then the total hydrodynamic loads of the soff were obtained in each time step then the motion equations of the soff were built in the time domain and the 2 stage predictor corrector method was used to solve the motion equations and the hybrid calculation program was originally developed and the motion responses of a soff at different wave conditions were analyzed the physical model tests in the wave basin were conducted to verify the numerical model next the effect of the draught water parameters and net solidity ratio on the motion responses of the soff were studied finally some conclusions were presented 2 theory and numerical method the motion responses of the soff are solved by a numerical simulation method there are three components in the soff which are pontoon frame system and net system in brief the hydrodynamic forces acting on the pontoon frame system and net system are calculated firstly next the motion equations of the soff are presented according to newton s second law then the motion responses are obtained by solving the motion equations by the 2 stage predictor corrector method the theoretical model for the pontoon frame system and net system is described in some detail in the following in order to simplify the expression coordinate systems are introduced one is the global coordinate system o xyz or called fixed reference axes fra with the origin located at the mean free surface of the fluid as shown in fig 2 the x y and z axis are positive and point to the bow port and upwards for all three coordinates the other one is the local system o xyz fixed on the floating soff relative to the mean position with the origins located at the center of gravity cog of the floating soff the axis of the local coordinate system is parallel to the axis of the global coordinate system at the initial time respectively the soff is assumed as a rigid body that has six degrees of freedom dof namely surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the wave direction β is defined as the angle between the wave propagating direction and the positive x axis measured clock wise in the oxy plane of the fra as shown in fig 2 2 1 hydrodynamic forces of large pontoon the wave body interaction is a complicated problem and cannot be solved without some simplifying assumptions for a large body the pontoon of soff the relative fluid displacement and hence the viscous energy dissipation is small thus the only source of energy dissipation is the propagation of the gravity waves which undergo significant scattering or diffraction when the structure spans more than about a fifth of the incident wavelength sarpkaya 2010 the fluid is assumed to be inviscid continuous and incompressible the flow is considered as irrotational flow so the potential theory can be used to calculate the interaction of free surface gravity with the pontoons faltinsen 1995 in this linear theory analysis the amplitude of the surface wave is small and the floating structure is undergoing small oscillations under these assumptions the velocity potential φ x y z t can be separated into three parts 1 φ x y z t ϕ x y z e i ω t ϕ i ϕ d j 1 6 ϕ r j x j e i ω t where ϕ x y z is the space potential of the velocity potential φ x y z t based on the linear superposition theory ϕ x y z can be decomposed to the sum of incident wave potential ϕ i diffraction potential ϕ d and unit radiation potential ϕ r j the subscript j 1 2 6 denotes the j th dof of the body x y z is the coordinate of the field points in the fra x j is the j th dof of the structure ω is the wave angular frequency i is the standard imaginary unit t is time the velocity potential should satisfy the helmholtz equation 2 φ k sin θ 2 φ 0 which will reduce to the laplace equation in the case of normal incidence θ 0 as well as the boundary conditions such as linear free surface the stationary bottom surface the wetted surface of the floating body and the far field condition and the incident wave potential can be written as 2 φ i x y z t ϕ i x y z e i ω t i g a cosh k z d ω cosh k d e i ω t k x cos β y sin β α where a is the amplitude of the incident wave d is the water depth β is the incident wave direction g is gravitational acceleration α is the wave phase k is the wave number which is related to the angular frequency ω through the dispersion relation 3 ω 2 g k tanh k d the diffraction wave potential ϕ d x y z should satisfy the governing equation and the boundary conditions and it will be expressed in terms of pulsating sources distributed over the mean wetted surface of the floating structures on the basis of green s theorem then wave exciting forces including froude krylov force and diffraction force will be calculated by using the incident wave potential and diffraction wave potential faltinsen 1995 the radiation wave potential will be also solved by the direct boundary element method after the velocity potential φ x y z t is obtained the first order hydrodynamic pressure distribution can be calculated by using the linearized bernoulli s equation 4 p ρ φ x y z t t the first order

called added mass and radiation damping coefficients and they can be expressed as 10 a j l ρ ω s 0 im φ r l n j d s 11 b j l ρ s 0 re φ r l n j d s here re and im denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex variable respectively variations in the wetted hull surface due to severe sea waves and or large amplitude motions may contribute significantly to nonlinear hydrodynamic loads nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov wave forces over the instantaneous wetted surface should be calculated from the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic model and the integral area of eq 7 will be changed from s 0 to s which is the instantaneous wetted surface of the floating structure however the diffraction and radiation components are of comparable magnitude and are linear quantities the diffraction force in short crest waves contributed by all the diffracting panels is 12 f d t e t n d p 1 n p j 1 a j p f d ω j p β p e i k j p x g cos χ p k j p y g sin χ p ω j p t α j p where e t is the euler rotation

prior to the current time domain analysis n d is the number of wave directions and n p is the number of wave components in the p th wave direction a j p is the wave amplitude 2 2 hydrodynamic forces of the frame the frame system consists of many pipes and columns and the diameter is obviously smaller than the diameter of the pontoon and the diffraction parameter for the pipes and columns and the diffraction are negligibly small so the pipes and columns are considered slender structures for slender structural members having cross sectional dimensions sufficiently small to allow the gradients of fluid particle velocities and accelerations in the direction normal to the member to be neglected wave loads may be calculated using morison s load formula being a sum of an inertia force proportional to acceleration and a drag force proportional to the square of velocity the hydrodynamic force exerted on the pipes can be estimated by summing up sectional forces on each strip of the structure and the force vector acting on a strip can be decomposed in a normal force f n p and a tangential force f t p the normal force and the tangential drag force per unit length can be written as 13 f n p ρ c a a x l ρ 1 c a a v 1 2 ρ d c d v r v r 14 f t p 1 2 ρ c t d v 2 15 v r γ v w v c x l where x l is the velocity of member normal to axis x l is the acceleration of member normal to axis v

drag force per unit length along the long direction of the slender structure which is under the instantaneous water surface then hydrodynamic forces of the frame system of soff can be calculated by superposing the force of each pipe and column at every time step 2 3 hydrodynamic forces of the net the hydrodynamic forces acting on the net system are modelled by the screen type force model kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 the net is divided into net panels each with an area a representing a part of the physical net the net solidity ratio can be calculated by the following equation 19 s n 2 d w l w d w l w 2 where d w is twine diameter l w is twine length hydrodynamic force on a net panel under waves and currents was divided into drag and lift force calculated from 20 f d n 1 2 ρ c d n

n are the drag and lift coefficients of the net panel respectively which can be expressed as functions of solidity ratio reynolds number and inflow angle the drag and lift coefficients were calculated using formulas derived by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 n d and n l are the unit vectors in the direction of the drag and lift force respectively which are calculated by the following formula 22 n d v r v r 23 n l v r n en v r v r n en v r where n en is the unit normal vector of the net panel and the direction of it in the positive flow direction and the unit vectors and relative velocity will be calculated at each time step then the hydrodynamic forces of the net system will be obtained through adding the forces of each net panel 2 4 motion equations of the soff in time domain to consider the coupling effects between soff and the effect of external forces the time domain coupled analyses are fulfilled in the regular wave the motion equation in the time domain can be given as 24 m μ μ s x c x f w f b g f s f net where m is the structural mass matrix μ is the added mass matrices of the large body μ s is the added mass matrices of the small body c is the damping matrices of the large body f w t is the wave exciting force vector including the nonlinear froude krylov force and the diffraction force f b is the hydrostatic force vector which can be calculated by integrating the hydrostatic pressure over the instantaneous wetted surface of the structure g is the gravity force f s is the hydrodynamic force of the slender body f net is the hydrodynamic force of the net structure x t is the structure acceleration response vector if the initial conditions are given the motions and the forces can be calculated by the above equations in each time step the coupling second order differential equations are solved by numerical integration and a 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm is used in the present work 3 experiment 3 1 the model and facilities the model tests of the soff were conducted in the seakeeping wave basin at the china ship scientific research center cssrc in wuxi city china the basin has dimensions of 69 m in length 46 m in width and 4 m in water depth the system arrangement of the wave basin is shown in fig 3 waves are generated by the flap type wave generator and opposite to wave maker a wave dissipation beach is installed to absorb the incoming waves the soff is obviously different from the traditional offshore structure the physical model of soff see fig 4 consists of the pontoon primary frame system net system and upper building the net diameter is significantly smaller than the main dimensions of the pontoon and frame system so different scales are used 3 1 1 pontoon and frame system the pontoon is an important part of the soff and it mainly provides buoyancy for the soff and the draught of the soff can be adjusted by adjusting the ballast water in the pontoon the diameter of the pontoon is 40 m in the prototype the frame system consists of several pipes with different diameter and the diameter of pipes vary from 1 0 m to 4 0 m in the prototype in accordance with the dimensions of the wave basin and the diameter of the soff and the tested wave conditions the selected scale for pontoon and frame system was 1 27 78 the scale of pontoon and frame system was designed by the gravity similarity the motion responses of the soff were measured by an untouched motion capturing system a data acquisition system would sample the wave elevation and motion response simultaneously during the model tests the frame system and pontoon are connected and the frame system and pontoon model is made up of plexiglass the components of the soff are described in fig 5 the detailed parameters of the pontoon and frame system in this study are presented in table 1 both end of center column are round table type which is convenient to connect with the pontoon and the upper building the mechanical parameters of the soff in prototype and model scale are listed in table 2 which are already include the effect of the net system 3 1 2 net system the net is supported by the frame system and the fish living space is constituted by frame system and net system the diameter of net twine is only 0 003 m and the mesh size of the net is 0 0235 m and the solidity of the net is 0 239 if the selected scale of the net system is the same as the ones for the pontoon and frame system the diameter of the net would be 0 0001 m in the model and there is no net with such puniness diameter so the scale of the net must be different from the scale for the pontoon and frame system as we known the main hydrodynamic force on the net is drag force so the drag force of the net in the model must similar to that in the prototype then the prototype net is used in the physical model which is shown in fig 4 3 2 experiment set ups the scale ratio of the model to the prototype soff is λ 1 27 78 the corresponding water depth for model tests is 1 8 m so an artificial bottom was built at the 1 8 m depth in the wave basin in order to prevent the model from drifting away in free floating conditions soft lines were attached to the model in a symmetric pattern as shown in fig 6 the stiffness of the soft line is 10 8 n m in the model the attachment point of lines is located on the cross section of the pontoon and the other attachment point of lines is located on the free surface and the mooring radius is 3 5 m in the model the experimental model of soff is shown in fig 7 prior to the regular wave tests free decay tests in calm water were conducted to verify the setup and properties of the models and to obtain the natural periods and damping levels of the soff the model tests were conducted under white noise waves to obtain the responses amplitude operators rao of motion the 6 dof motion responses of the soff were measured by an optical remote motion capturing system 4 numerical simulation and validations 4 1 numerical model description in the present paper the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the above theory the numerical model of the soff was built by using the ansys and the numerical simulating model is shown in fig 8 there are 5132 panels for the pontoon regarding the hydrodynamic modeling the pontoon was considered as large volume structures and its hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass radiation damping and wave excitation forces were estimated based on potential flow theory the hydrodynamic forces on the frame system were obtained by morison s load formula the mesh size of the pipes and columns is 0 5 m and there are 4204 elements for the frame system the hydrodynamic forces on the net system were obtained by the screen model the instantaneous incident wave surface was considered in this calculation while calculating the hydrodynamic forces on the frame system and net system then the motion equations in the time domain were calculated by the 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm the soff is also assumed as a rigid body in the numerical simulation the time step is 0 4 s in the numerical simulation in the past research on the effect of single net structure on the attenuation of flow velocity has shown that the formulas for flow velocity reduction of the cage nets are as follows aarsnes et al 1990 25 v v 0 i 1 n c r i 26 r i 1 0 0 46 c d where r i is the flow velocity reduction factor n c is the number of upstream crossings of other plane nets before the current hits the actual plane net and the net solidity ratio is 0 239 c d is about 0 39 when the inflow angle is 0 the fluid velocity reduction wake factor in the rear half of the soff is obtained by equation 26 and r 0 82 however a smaller fluid velocity reduction may be suitable for cylindrical cages such as r 0 69 zhan et al 2006 in addition considering that the space frame system will also dissipate a certain amount of fluid energy the fluid velocity reduction is taken as 0 69 in this paper 4 2 decay tests table 3 shows the natural periods and linear damping coefficients for the soff from the decay tests it is found that the natural periods of vertical motions calculated by numerical simulations are in good agreement with the target values and the relative error of heave roll and pitch natural period are 5 31 5 68 and 4 66 respectively the damping ratio of heave is 0 16 and 0 17 obtained by model test and numerical simulation while the amplitude of heave is 1 0 m respectively and the damping ratios of roll and pitch gave in table 3 are the value when the roll and pitch amplitude is 1 respectively fig 9 compares the free decay curves of heave roll and pitch oscillation test of soff in the calm water obtained by the numerical simulations and experiments from these figures it is indicated that the time history curves of oscillation tests obtained from the present numerical simulation agree with those from model tests from fig 9 a it is found that the vertical displacements acquired through numerical simulation are basically consistent with the test results in large scale oscillation the natural periods of heave calculated by the numerical method is about 44 6 s which is smaller than the one obtained by model test fig 9 b shows the time history of roll motion which indicates that the natural period of roll calculated by the numerical method is slightly smaller than that of model tests it can be seen from fig 9 c that a similar phenomenon appears in the pitch decay curve besides it is found that as the oscillation amplitude decreases the gap of vertical displacement obtained by numerical calculation and tests increases it indicates that the damping ratios calculated by the numerical method is agreed with the ones obtained by model tests when the oscillation amplitude of heave is large 4 3 motion response of the soff the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the present numerical method and the heave and pitch motion are compared with the ones obtained by experiments in fig 10 the horizontal axis represents the wave period and the vertical axis represents the amplitude of motion under regular waves with the wave amplitude of 1 m it can be seen that the heave motions calculated by numerical simulation are the same as the ones of experiments when the wave period is smaller than 10 s from fig 10 a and the numerical results become smaller than the experimental results as the wave period in the range of 10 s 12 s however as the wave period increases the numerical results of heave become bigger than the ones obtained by model tests the main reason is that the fluid is viscous in the experiment and the net and the frame have a shielding effect on the fluid particle velocity so the experimental value is relatively small from fig 10 b it is found that the trend of pitch motions with wave periods calculated by numerical calculation is the same as the experimental results however pitch motions calculated by the numerical method are bigger than those obtained by model tests especially when the wave period is between 10 s and 14 s two factors have caused this phenomenon on the one hand there is a difference in linear damping ratio during smaller pitch oscillation on the other hand the fluid particle velocity will be reduced after passing through the front net and frame system of the soff the energy dissipation comes from the propagation of the gravity waves which undergo significant scattering or diffraction when the waves pass through the large pontoon that spans more than a fifth of the incident wavelength this will further reduce the fluid particle velocity but the fluid velocity reduction is not considered the scattering and diffraction of the pontoon in this paper it should be measured the fluid velocity reduction caused by large pontoon by further experiments 5 results with numerical sensitivity study 5 1 effect of draught on the motion response the soff is towed to the target sea area by dry towing and then sinks to the design draft by increasing the ballast water in addition the draught of the soff will also be adjusted under different sea conditions and the motion responses will present different variation tendencies with the different drafts of the soff fig 11 presents the heave and pitch motions with the wave periods at the different drafts of the soff it can be found from fig 11 a that when the wave period is the same the heave motion increases with the decrease of the draft in addition as the wave period increases the difference in heave responses at different draught increases the heave responses at a draft of 32 m are 1 4 1 6 times larger than those with a draft of 37 m and the heave responses with a draft of 22 m are 1 4 4 9 times larger than those with a draft of 37 m and the biggest difference between the heave motions with the two draughts occurs when the wave period is 6 s the main reason for the above phenomenon is that there is a large pontoon at the bottom of the soff and the interaction between the pontoon and waves will cause large wave forces and the wave forces will increase with the decrease of the draught because of the closer to the free surface the bigger the fluid particle velocity it can be observed from fig 11 b that the pitch motion increases with the decrease of the draft when the wave period is at the range of 8 s 12 s and the pitch motion increase with the increase of the draft when the wave period is bigger than 14 5 s the pitch motions at a draft of 22 m are 2 5 times bigger than those at a draft of 37 m as the wave period is 10 s and the pitch motions at a draft of 32 m are 1 3 times bigger than those at a draft of 37 m as wave period is 10 s however the pitch motions at a draft of 32 m are close to the pitch motions at a draft of 37 m while the wave period is less than 8 s and the pitch motions at a draft of 37 m are obviously larger than those at a draft of 22 m when the wave period is bigger than 16 s it indicates that the draft of the soff can be increased to avoid large motion responses at the severe sea states 5 2 effect of wave amplitude on the motion response fig 12 shows the motion responses of the soff with a draft of 37 m under different wave conditions the horizontal axis represents the wave amplitude which is ranges from 1 0 m to 3 0 m and the vertical axis represents the amplitude of the motion response in the figures from fig 12 it is found that heave and pitch response amplitude is positively correlated with wave amplitude and the heave response increases linearly with the increase of the wave amplitude the heave motion at a wave amplitude of 3 0 m is 3 2 times bigger than that at a wave amplitude of 1 0 m when the wave period is 12 s besides the growth rate of heave response with wave amplitude at a wave period of 12 s is bigger than that at a wave period of 8 s it can be observed from fig 12 b that pitch response increases sharply with the increase of the wave amplitude the pitch motion at a wave amplitude of 3 0 m is 7 4 times bigger than that at a wave amplitude of 1 0 m when the wave period is 12 s in addition the growth rate of pitch response with wave amplitude at 12 s is close to that at 8 s 5 3 effect of net solidity ratio on the motion response in the following section the effects of the net solidity ratio on the motion response will be analyzed the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the present numerical method while using three different nets and the parameters of the net are shown in table 4 the comparison of motion responses of the soff with the different net is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a it can be seen that there is little influence of net solidity ratio on the heave motion when the wave period is smaller than 12 s however the heave motion increases with the increase of net solidity ratio when the wave period is bigger than 12 s and the gap of heave motions of soff with different nets increases with the increase of the wave period when the wave period is bigger than 12 s the amplitude of heave motion of the soff with a net of sn 0 34 is 3 33 larger than that when a net of sn 0 239 is adopted in the soff also the amplitude of heave motion of the soff with a net of sn 0 34 is 3 69 larger than that when a net of sn 0 127 is adopted in the soff it indicates that the soff will suffer larger wave loads under the action of long period waves when a big solidity ratio net is used it can be seen from fig 13 b that pitch motions increase with the increase of the net solidity ratio when the wave period is ranges from 6 s to 12 s however pitch motions decrease with the increase of the net solidity ratio when the wave period is bigger than 14 s it indicates that the damping effect of the net system is more significant at the short wave and the damping effect becomes weaker as the wave length increases 6 conclusions this research work is focused on the interaction of the soff and waves for calculating the motion responses of the soff a hybrid numerical model of the direct time domain and indirect time domain for the soff is proposed in the present paper the hydrodynamic loads of the large pontoon are obtained by indirect time domain and the hydrodynamic loads of the frame system and net system are computed by direct time domain under the instantaneous water surface then the motion equation of the soff is built in the time domain and the 2 stage predictor corrector algorithm is used to integrate the estimated acceleration for the structure velocity and position the motion responses of the soff are calculated by the present numerical method and verified by the model tests then the effects of the draft wave height and net solidity ratio on the motion responses of the soff are analyzed the conclusions are summarized as follow 1 the present numerical method can simulate the performances of the soff and the trend of motion response agrees with the experimental results the fluid velocity reduction should be considered while calculating the hydrodynamic loads of the frame system and net system 2 the draught of soff has obvious influences on the heave and pitch motions and the heave motions increase with the decrease of the draft at the same wave condition and the heave responses with a draft of 22 m are 1 4 4 9 times larger than those with a draft of 37 m for pitch motion it increases with the decrease of the draft when the wave period is at the range of 8 s 12 s and the pitch motions increase with the increase of the draft when the wave period is bigger than 14 5 s these numerical results indicate that the wave loads on the soff can be reduced by increasing the draft and the motion response can be reduced 3 the heave and pitch motion are closely proportional to the wave height however there is some difference in the growth rate of the heave motions at various wave periods 4 the interaction between the net and waves produces two effects on the one hand the net will be subjected to wave loads on the other hand the net can also exert a damping effect and shielding effect and the net mainly plays a load role for heave motion and the wave loads acting on the net increase with the increase of net solidity ratio however the damping effect for pitch motion is more significant at longer waves besides the net with different solidity ratios receive different wave loads and at the same time the damping effect is also different credit authorship contribution statement yu ji miao writing methodology software

20949,this paper aims to derive new simple and consistently reliable residual strength equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of steel dented stiffened cylinders under combined axial compression and radial pressure including hydrostatic pressure for this two types of the stiffened cylinders namely stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders which are generally main components of offshore marine structures used in semi submersibles submarines tension legs of platforms tlps and other various types of floating offshore structures are investigated firstly the various collision damage scenarios which illustrated the collision accidents of offshore stiffened cylinders with supply vessels or floating subjects were analysed then a finite element modelling of the stiffened

stiffened cylinders were carried out by changing the design variables based on the rigorous case of the study results new simple design equations which are used to predict the ultimate residual strength of the damaged stiffened cylinders under combined loads are proposed through a regression study finally the accuracy and reliability of the proposed equations have been compared with available test data and a nonlinear finite element analysis nfea these equations can be useful for the initial design stage of stiffened cylinders under the risk conditions of offshore structures in

platforms submarines and recently as columns of offshore wind turbine foundations during operations these structures are constantly serviced by supply vessels of ship traffic trading vessels offshore tankers merchant ship and other ships related to offshore activity therefore collisions between these ships and offshore structures are unavoidable during its service the major collided structures may lead to catastrophic consequences as endangering human life environmental pollution and financial losses a common damaged structure of tlps is illustrated in fig 1 the accident of the us submarine greeneville with the fishing vessel ehime maru in 2001 is shown in fig 2 obviously the offshore stiffened cylinders should be designed to have enough strength and safety against potential collisions the key concern is to assess the ultimate residual strength of the structural system after collisions and to guarantee that they are acceptable for safety operation therefore the prediction of the residual strength of these structures has crucial importance for decision making to allow the structural system operation or a stop of operation theoretical and experimental studies in residual strength of locally dented stiffened cylinder have progressed remarkably over the last few decades ronalds et al 1987 1988 performed the quasi static impact test on small scale stringer stiffened cylinders and these models were then loaded under axial compressive until collapsed harding et al 1995 investigated the effects of local denting damage on eight small scale ring stiffened cylinders subjected to axial compression load walker et al 1987 1988 reported the test results of damaged ring stiffened cylinders under combined axial compressive and hydrostatic pressure loadings furthermore the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders is also relatively investigated in few studies and there is a limited database of experiments smith and creswell 1987 saraiva and cyrino 2007 amante et al 2008 2010 maddalena et al 2012 recently ghazijahani et al 2014a presented the test results of 27 locally dented steel unstiffened cylinders under axial compression and 14 thin walled intact and dented cylinders under external pressure ghazijahani et al 2014 and 8 dented tubes under bending loads ghazijahani et al 2015 it is noted that most of the available experimental works which were generated the damages on models by quasi static denting where the effects of strain rate and inertial forces were not considered it is quite different from actual cases because most ships and offshore structural collisions in the actual ocean have occurred under dynamic collisions more recently cho et al 2017 and do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c conducted four large scaled fabricated ring stiffened cylinders and two stringer stiffened cylinders under the dynamic mass impact all specimens were subsequently tested under hydrostatic pressure to assess the reduction in ultimate strength buckling designs of intact stiffened cylinders under various loading are well understood based on a large database of available test results by many researchers for hydrostatic loadings kendrick 1964 1965 1970 1972 reynolds 1960 lunchick 1959 yamamoto et al 1989 miller and kinra 1981 agelidis et al 1983 morandi et al 1996 dowling et al 1986 krasovsky et al 2007 cerik et al 2013a 2013b cho et al 2017 2018 do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c and combined axial compression and radial pressure loadings sridharan et al 1980 odland 1981 dowling et al 1982 miller et al 1982 ellinas et al 1984 cho and lee 1998 das et al 2011 furthermore several code recommendations for predicting the ultimate strength of intact stiffened cylinder are given in the dnv 2013 api 2004 bsi 2009 gl 2009 abs 2014 rules and cho et al 1998 das et al 2011 however until recently there was no reliable formulations and code recommendation to assess the effects of damage on the ultimate strength of stiffened cylinder under combined axial compression and radial pressure or external hydrostatic pressure loadings thus it is sorely necessary to propose the new design equations to predict the residual ultimate strength of these structures and this study aims to fill that gap recently nonlinear finite element modelling nfem is a powerful tool to predict the ship and offshore cylinder structure collisions however one of the main challenges when modelling ship and offshore cylindrical structure collisions is the accuracy and reliability of numerical results because ship and offshore cylinder structure collision modellings are very complicated produces it is included material properties geometries loadings and boundary conditions others for both striking ships or free floating subjects and offshore structures therefore the accuracy and reliability of numerical results need to be validated by comparing them with available experimental results then it can be used for performing further investigations on full scale actual stiffened cylinder structures to develop design guidelines and deriving formulations do et al 2018a cerik 2015 furthermore many researchers have conducted numerical analyses of the ship and offshore cylinder structure collisions cho et al 2017 and do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 2020 performed the numerical investigations on the residual ultimate strength of dented ring and stringer stiffened cylinders under external hydrostatic pressure cerik 2015 provided numerical results of the residual ultimate strengths of locally dented steel stiffened cylinders subjected to axial compression the numerical simulations on damaged stiffened cylinders under various loading conditions were also performed by prabu et al 2010 ramasamy et al 2014 rathinam and prabu 2015 and ghazijahani et al 2014b 2014b 2015 thus from the computational economic and scientific efficiency a carefully implemented nfea which is validated method with reliable experimental results could be the most potentially effective way to evaluate the residual ultimate strength of damaged stiffened cylinders under various loadings although residual strength can be accurately predicted by applying nfea modelling and simulations take much time and complications therefore estimation of empirical formulations by convenient calculation way have regularly been used in the initial structural design steps against this background the current paper aims to derive new simple and consistently reliable equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of damaged ring and or stringer stiffened cylinders under combined loadings the proposed formulations were derived through the regression analyses of the rigorous parametric study results by nfea the accuracy and reliability of proposed equations have been established by comparing them with available experimental data and nfea results 2 description of reference test data first a series of experimental studies of stiffened cylinders were provided by a project of the cohesive buckling research programme this project focused on the residual ultimate strength of dented stiffened cylinders of offshore structures in various loadings in addition it was performed in different united kingdom universities from 1983 to 1985 hse 1992 the project provided reliable and valuable test data for validating numerical prediction approaches and existing formulations of ultimate strength in the first series harding and onoufriou 1995 performed eight small scale ring stiffened cylinder models from cy 2 to cy 9 under quasi static denting at mid bay of the cylinder these specimens were then tested under axial compression for assessing the effects of local damages on ultimate strength internal transducers measured the relative displacement of the two end plates in contact with the model so that the end shortening can be inferred the load was applied in small increments and the step size was reduced as the collapse approached to ensure that nonlinearity in the response and the peak load was accurately measured the depth of the dent in each model is different the material properties and measured dimensions of ring stiffened cylinder models are presented in table 1 similarly ronalds et al 1988 examined the effect of local denting damages for the ultimate strength of stringer stiffened cylinder specimens from 3b1 3b4 the details of dimensions and material properties for stringer stiffened cylinder specimens are provided in table 2 second the experimental results of three stringer stiffened cylinders and six ring stiffened cylinders provided by cho et al 2017 and authors do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c in ulsanlab university of ulsan korea among them six specimens ss c 1 ss c 2 and rs c 1 to rs c 4 were tested under dynamic mass impact using a drop testing machine three specimens ss i rs i and rs ii were the intact specimens which were necessary to determine the reduction factor on ultimate strength when comparing them with damaged specimens after generating the damages all specimens were performed under hydrostatic pressure it is noted that all models in both projects were fabricated using cold bending and tig welding after fabricating processes all models were applied heat treatment processes for reducing the level of the residual stresses due to welding moreover the initial imperfection for each specimen was measured and the maximum initial imperfection values were generally lower than the code tolerance requirements bsi 2009 api 2004 the material properties and measured dimensions of specimens are given in tables 2 and 3 furthermore detailed explanations of experimental installations and experimental results are given in do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 3 numerical analysis 3 1 finite element modelling the nonlinear finite element was carried out using the software package abaqus in the analysis the finite element model consists of full dimensions of the test specimens including the end plate and the end ring the full geometries of specimens were modelled and meshed with s4r four node reduced integration shell elements in the abaqus element library five through thickness integration section points and hourglass control of the simpson rule were applied the thickness of elements at welding locations was not increased and taken into account in numerical simulations this assumption may not lead to a critical difference between the actual behaviour and the numerical behaviour convergence simulations were performed to select the optimal mesh size for each series specimen in this paper the mesh size of the outer contact zone coarse mesh was two times of the contact zone fine mesh the chosen mesh size of the contact zone for specimens of cy 2 to cy 9 and 3b1 to 3b4 was 2 mm 2 mm the mesh size of the outer contact zone was 6 mm 6 mm in a similar manner the mesh size of the contact region for specimens of ss i to ss c 2 and rs i to rs c 4 was 5 5 mm while that of the outer contact region was 10 mm 10 mm these mesh sizes are sufficiently fine to record the deformed shape and stress strain response precisely of the specimen it is noted that if the mesh size of an element is smaller than shell thickness it may lead to errors in contact calculations the striker mass was modelled as rigid elements r3d4 3 d bilinear rigid quadrilateral element in abaqus explicit the contact between the striker mass surface and cylinder shell was defined as the general contact algorithm with the penalty contact approach the contact friction coefficient was chosen by 0 23 kõrgesaar et al 2018 for considering the sliding of the striker mass surface and cylinder shell the tangential contact behaviour was modelled with a hard contact of pressure overclosure definition the total collision duration was set to be 0 5s 3 2 material properties for collision simulations the true stress and true strain were achieved using the engineering stress and strain in the static tensile tests as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the results calculated from eqs 1 and 2 were then substituted into eqs 3 7 for considering the strain hardening and yield plateau furthermore it is well known that the collision simulation results are strongly affected by strain rate definition the local damages were large strain rate evolution in the impact region therefore the revised formulations provided in references do et al 2018a 2018b were used for considering the effects of strain rate as shown in eqs 8 11 these formulations have been derived using the extensive dynamic tensile test results with different marine steels in the numerical model the true plastic strain was determined through eq 12 in this study the effects of strain rate were generated from 10 s 20 s 50 s 70 s 100 s to 150 s as shown in fig 3 also the models were not loaded until fracture hence no fracture criterion was set 1 σ t r σ ε 1 2 ε t r l n ε 1 3 σ t r e ε t r when 0 ε t r ε y t r 4 σ t r σ y t r σ h s t r σ y t r ε

2 12 ε p l t r ε t r σ t r e for residual strength simulations the material properties were assumed as elastic perfectly plastic material because residual ultimate strength assessment is one type of quasi static problem the effect of strain rate was therefore neglected additionally the dynamic responses of the collapsing structures and ultimate strength or pressure reduction owning to the rushing water inside of the chamber were not considered 3 3 collision analysis the main goal of collision analysis was to achieve the initial damage deformation these damaged models were then transferred to residual ultimate strength analysis in the next step based on the experimental data in the previous section collision simulations included the quasi static impact and dynamic impact analysis for quasi static impact analysis the explicit solver in abaqus was applied a real time simulation of a quasi static process was computationally impractical it is imperative to increase the speed of the process to obtain an economical solution if an explicit solver was used furthermore it should be considered to keep the inertia forces level low to overcome the stress wave propagation with highly concentrating localized denting therefore the period of simulation is to be determined as short as possible the dominant response in a quasi static analysis would be the first structural mode the first natural frequency and the corresponding time period of the test models was calculated by performing modal analysis with the dent depth obtained in actual tests this value was used to estimate an upper value of impact velocity it was found out to be lower than 1 of the wave speed in metals about 5000 m s starting with this value after a series of simulations with different loading rates by examining the results the total simulation period was determined as 0 016s until 0 008s the knife edge indenter is moved downwards to the models up to the maximum dent depth attained in actual tests after 0 008 s the indenter is retracted in a quasi static impact simulation the actual mass of the indenter was not important however to minimize the noise in contact calculations the mass of the indenter should be of the order of the struck model accordingly the mass was taken as 2 kg for models cy 2 to cy9 and 3b1 to 3b4 for dynamic impact analysis the collision force occurred in a short time the strain rate effect is the most important parameter in collision responses with the high impact velocity the damages were large strain rate levels and local at the impacted region another important point in dynamic impact analysis was the effect of inertial forces in fact the energy absorbed in dynamic impact analysis will be larger than that in the corresponding quasi static impact analysis depending on the level of inertial forces and the impact velocity in the dropped object was calculated as eq 13 all elements of striking mass were tied to a reference point where inertial properties and impact velocity of striker were applied the applied boundary conditions were used the same as actual experiments for example the nonlinear finite element modelling of models ss c 1 and cy 3 was described in fig 4 13 i m p a c t v e l o c i t y m s 2 a c c e l e r a t i o n d u e t o g r a v i t y m s 2 d r o p h e i g h t m it is inevitable that specimens will vibrate elastically during the collision processes therefore rayleigh damping was applied to reduce these vibrations and quickly achieve a static equilibrium state rayleigh damping was calculated as eq 14 in this equation m is the system structural mass matrix while k is the system structural stiffness matrix the coefficient α is examined as the lowest natural frequency of the specimen and it was obtained by performing the subspace eigen solver of modal analysis the coefficient β is the stiffness proportional damping factor which is neglected in this study 14 c α m β k 3 4 collapse analysis when the impact simulation was completed the damaged geometry of model was subsequently applied to the collapse analysis for assessing the reduction in ultimate strength this process was updated all changing of the node coordinates for the dented areas thus all residual stress contributions from the impact analysis were incorporated into the collapse analysis the modified riks method was applied in the collapse analysis it is noted that the materials was assumed as elastic perfect plastic by neglecting the strain hardening series of numerical simulations were carried out to assess the effects of the damages on the reduction in ultimate strength under axial compressive load for models cy2 to cy9 and 3b1 to 3b4 respectively for these models all degrees of freedom at one end of the cylinders were restrained in the other end of the specimen all elements were attached to a reference point which allowed the axial displacement and fixed with other five degrees of freedom as shown in fig 5 a furthermore collapse analysis for models rs i to rs c 4 and ss i to ss c 2 were illustrated in fig 5b the specimen was restrained for all nodes at the open end flange and applied the external hydrostatic pressure to determine the ultimate strength reduction of the damaged cylinder the intact specimens were used for comparing them with damaged specimens the intact specimen simulations were performed by using the same assumptions as damaged specimens however the initial imperfection welding residual stress and cold bending residual stress should be considered in numerical modelling when considering the initial imperfection of cylinder the best way was to take into account directly the measurement of imperfection values in finite modelling models these values were good to consider both local buckling and overall buckling modes however if the initial imperfection values were not supported it could be carried out buckle analyses and achieved the eigenvalue buckle generally the first buckling mode was selected for creating the initial imperfection the problem was how large imperfection magnitude was included according to api 2004 and pd5500 psi 2009 rules the upper limit of tolerable imperfection value was 0 5 r mean radius of a cylinder additionally muttaqie et al 2019 examined the initial imperfection magnitude was approximately 0 4 of shell thickness he obtained this value by comparing the numerical results and experimental results of a series of small scaled cylinder specimens the welding residual stresses caused by the temperature changes the melt material to connect structures together it is located around the welding part and inside structures in this study the welding residual stress was directly inputted as the initial stresses of nodes in numerical modelling the details of equations to determine the welding residual stresses are given in cho et al 2017 the distribution of welding residual stress is presented in fig 6 for model ss i for the cold bending residual stress the quasi static bending simulations of flat plate were performed one end of the flat plate was fixed while that of the other side was applied rolling load until the expected shape of a cylinder shell in modelling the integration points through the shell thickness were assumed as 21 points the residual stress distribution by cold bending for model ss i was described in figs 7 and 8 where t and z are cylinder shell thickness and coordinate with respect to the shell top plane 3 5 benchmarking numerical predictions with experimental results to validate the presented numerical modelling strategy the experimental data gave by harding and onoufriou 1995 and ronalds and dowling 1998 were utilized these models were already given in the previous section the axial shortening stress strain relations which obtained in the tests and through numerical analysis are shown in fig 9 for the stringer and ring stiffened cylinder models respectively in this figure the axial stress and axial shortening strain were non dimensional with yield stress and yield strain respectively overall a good correlation exists between actual test results and numerical results for ring and stringer stiffened cylinder models furthermore the ultimate compressive load attained in the tests and the values obtained from numerical analyses are listed for each model as shown in table 4 for all models the mean of the modelling uncertainty factor x m the ratio of the test values over that of prediction values is 0 965 and its cov coefficient of variation is 5 644 although there is slight overprediction considering the uncertainties related to experiments such as non uniformity in load application imperfections and material properties the agreement is considered satisfactory these values are acceptable for predictions of ultimate strength for validation numerical methods of models that generated the damages by dynamic mass impact the experimental data gave by do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c are used the axial shortening displacement pressure curves obtained in the tests and through numerical analysis are shown in fig 10 for the stringer and ring stiffened cylinder respectively also the predicted deformed shapes were compared to experimental results in fig 11 in general a good agreement was achieved between actual test results and numerical results furthermore the summary of collapse pressure attained in the tests and the values obtained from numerical analyses are listed for each model as shown in table 5 in this table the mean of x m modelling uncertainty factor was 1 039 and the small cov was 1 941 therefore based on the high accuracy of the numerical modelling strategy approach developed in this study it is suggested that this numerical method can be applied to investigate the residual ultimate strength of actual design stiffened cylinders for developing design codes or validating the collision problems 4 derivation of empirical formulation after benchmarking numerical predictions with experimental results the series nfea of rigorous parametric studies on the full scaled ring and stringer stiffened cylinders were carried out by changing the design variables the material properties and dimensions of stiffened cylinders were selected as the reality tension leg platforms semi submersibles and or submarine design concept in the abs 2014 api 2004 and pd5500 2009 rules the nfea strategy approach developed in the previous section was applied the dimensions and material properties of stringer and ring stiffened cylinders were presented in tables 6 and 7 the range of cylinder radius to cylinder thickness r t was from 97 to 454 for a ring stiffened cylinder and from 11 to 475 for a stringer stiffened cylinder it is noted that there is a small dimension as model rs 9 and a quite large dimension as model rs 6 in table 6 they may not similar to an actual submarine dimension because the range of r t in table 6 is not only focused on submarine structures but also focused on other types of offshore cylindrical structures for collision analysis the abaqus s dynamic explicit solver approach was applied the global mesh size was 80 80 mm while that of fine mesh at the contact area was 40 40 mm these mesh size were selected by performing the convergence test to choose the optimum ones the rigid hemisphere striker header shape was used for creating the damage on the model dnv gl 2017 divided the numerical analysis of ship and offshore structures collision scenario into three design regions ductile design shared energy design and strength design and recommended that ship and offshore structures collision drops in the ductile design in the ductile design region the striking ship can be assumed as a rigid body so that the finite element analysis can be highly simplified the collision velocities were determined as 1 0 m s 2 5 m s 5 0 m s 7 5 m s and 10 m s and together with striker mass of 10 tons 20 tons 50 tons and 100 tons for each velocity these velocities can be represented the collisions of offshore stiffened cylinders with floating objects or dropped items from platform decks additionally when considering the collision between the offshore stiffened cylinder and visiting supply vessels or passing vessels trading vessels offshore tankers merchant ship and other ships related to offshore activity the collision velocities were 1 0 m s 2 0 m s and 3 0 m s while the striker masses were selected as 1000 tons 3000 tons 5000 tons and 7500 tons for each velocity therefore the total of numerical analysis cases was 256 for stringer stiffened cylinders and 320 for ring stiffened cylinders the aim of collision analysis is to generate the initial geometric deformation for the next residual strength analysis with various loadings for residual ultimate strength analysis the modified riks approach in abaqus was used as mentioned in the previous section there were two types of loading considered in this study the first loading was external hydrostatic pressure and the second loading was combination of axial compression and radial pressure for the external hydrostatic pressure loading when the impact simulation was completed the damaged geometry specimen was subsequently applied to the residual ultimate strength analysis for assessing the reduction in collapse pressure with this process all residual stress contributions from the impact analysis were incorporated into the collapse analysis it is noted that in the residual strength simulation the material was assumed as linear perfectly plastic for the combined loadings the radial pressure at 0 2 pc collapse pressure of damaged model and 0 5 pc was applied and it was then performed progressive collapse analysis for axial compressive loading thus the total of numerical analysis cases is 576 for external hydrostatic pressure loading and while that of 1152 cases for combined loadings the procedures involved in performing numerical analysis and deriving the empirical residual strength formulations are described in fig 12 4 1 design equations for prediction of extent damage before deriving equations to forecast the residual strength of locally dented stiffened cylinders the formulations for assessing the maximum permanent dent depth were derived as eqs 15 29 detailed explanations of derived formulation procedures are

both damaged ring stiffened cylinder and stringer stiffened cylinder under external hydrostatic pressure the detail procedures to derive equations were provided 4 2 1 proposed formulations for damaged stringer stiffened cylinder the various stress component distributions included bending stress axial stress shear stress and von mises stress of damaged model ss 4 under hydrostatic pressure are plotted in fig 13 under hydrostatic loading the main contribution stresses were axial and bending stresses with 408 7 and 403 4 mpa respectively interestingly the shear stress contribution was about 50 when compared to the contribution of axial and bending stresses the von mises stress distributions in post collapse shape was 355 mpa the von mises stress distributions at different stages of damage evolution under hydrostatic pressure are described in fig 14 it is noted that the first stage was the damaged shape which was transferred from collision simulation and the next stages are propagated of the deformed shapes until collapsed shape the model was failed in local buckling at the stringer stiffened panels the extent of damage was started from the dented zone then it was propagated until near boundary condition furthermore the local tripping occurred for both stringer and ring stiffeners the stringers and ring stiffeners prevented the damage extent and resisted the general buckling for the cylinder shell it is evident that the undamaged sections were not affected due to collision and responded as the intact stringer stiffened cylinder fig 15 shows the pressure radial displacement curves at the hit point of model ss 4 r t 210 for various dent depths in this figure the collapse pressure of the dented cylinder p dam was non dimensionalized with that of the intact cylinder p in while the dent depth d was non dimensionalised with a radius of cylinder r the collapse pressure of the stringer stiffened cylinder was significantly affected by the local damage when the dent depth was increased the ultimate strength of the model was noticeable reduced owing to loss of stiffness and decreasing of load carrying capacity the procedures to derive the formulations to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer stiffened cylinders under dynamic mass impact are presented in fig 12 in the previous section series of finite element analyses were carried out to assess the effect of the dent depth on the ultimate strength of stiffened cylinder under hydrostatic pressure before deriving the equation the effects of basic parameters on the residual strength of the dented stiffened cylinder were investigated the main goal of this stage was to find the suitable dependent parameters that can be used for deriving equations the dependence of the non dimensional reduction factor r u p dam p in has been checked with basic parameters such as l s r l s t d r w sf t sf h sw t sw e σ y the combinations of the basic parameters were also investigated such as z z l 2 r t 1 ν batdorf slenderness parameter z e σ y and l t r e σ y the trends and dependent degrees between r u and different parameters are presented in table 8 it is noted that the non dimensional parameter d r has the strongest effect on reduction factor r u therefore this parameter should be used to derive the equation after investigating the dependent parameters the regression analysis was carried out with the best fit values of the numerical results the best fit curve obtained from numerical results is plotted in fig 16 the equation to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer stiffened cylinders was derived as eq 30 the accuracy of proposed equations was quite good with a mean of x m was 1 01 and a cov was 3 30 the other form of the equation was also derived with a mean of x m of 1 01 and a cov of 3 6 as illustrated in eq 31 when the safety design was considered the design formulation is given in eq 32 by multiplying eq 30 with mean 2 standard deviation as indicated in fig 16 30 r u p d a m p i n e x p 1 796 δ d mean equation 31 r u p d a m p i n 1 246 δ d 2 1 773 δ d 1 32 r u p d a m p i n e x p 0 058 1 796 δ d design equation after deriving the equation the final stage is to check the skewness of x m numerical analysis results derived equation results with the basic parameters by applying the cross validation charts this stage was important when performing the regression diagnostic method to derive the formulation if the skewness of x m with basic parameters greatly occurs these parameters need to take into account in the derived equations the skewness of x m against the basic parameters is described in figs 17 19 in these figures there is no sharpness trend line thus the proposed equations have been provided with adequate parameters 4 2 2 proposed formulations for damaged ring stiffened cylinder before deriving new formulations let us re visit the existing formula provided by authors in reference do et al 2018a these equations have high accuracy when comparing them with the existing test results however it was only considered the striker header shape by a knife edge type in general the result of extent damage under collision and residual strength under external hydrostatic pressure was strongly affected by the types of striker header shape furthermore the numerical investigations reported by do et al 2018b 2018c 2020 were also concluded that the most serious case in extended damages and residual ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinder is a type of hemispherical striker header therefore in this section these equations have improved by considering the hemispherical indenter based on the regression analysis the residual strength equation was empirically derived for determining the reduction factor r u as indicated in eq 33 when considering the safety design the design formulation is given in eq 34 by multiplying eq 33 with mean 2 standard deviation as shown in fig 20 the proposed equation has a mean x m of 0 988 together with a cov of 2 68 it is noted that the details of the derived equation procedures to calculate the residual ultimate strength of the ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure can be found in reference do et al 2018a in addition more detail of the progressive collapse of a rings stiffened cylinder is depicted in figs 21 and 22 the first stage is the damaged shape which is transferred from collision simulation and the next stages were propagated of the deformed shapes until collapsed shape the model was failed in overall buckling the extent of damage was started from the dented zone then it was propagated until near boundary condition 33 r u p d a m p i n e x p 5 54 δ d 1 14 mean equation 34 r u p d a m p i n e x p 0 067 5 54 δ d

stiffened cylinder under combined axial compression and radial pressure 4 3 1 residual ultimate strength formulations for stringer stiffened cylinder in this section the simple proposed formulation was derived by a series of the numerical analysis results of the reality design concept of a stringer stiffened cylinder the nfea was performed with the techniques in the previous section an example of geometry of stringer stiffened cylinder and loadings considered as shown in fig 23 most marine structural members fail in the regime of the interaction between the elastic buckling and yielding the failure modes can be identified as follows local shell buckling stringer shell collapse between ring frames stringer tripping and general instability therefore any good ultimate strength formulations need to employ inelastic buckling formulations as their basis cho et al 1998 to predict the ultimate strength of intact stringer stiffened cylinders the design equations presented by cho et al 1998 were applied these equations were considered all the failure modes of stringer stiffened cylinders under combined loadings which are presented in equations c 1 in appendix c these equations have a fair accuracy when compared to the 90 available experimental models with a mean of x m was 1 05 and a cov was 14 3 the accuracy of the provided equations was better than that of well known equations such as bsi 2009 api 2004 and dnv gl 2014 for stringer stiffened cylinders the effects of radial pressure on the axial load carrying capacity were not significant unless the radial pressure is close to the collapse pressure in this study the radial pressure at 0 2 p c collapse pressure of damaged model and 0 5 p c were applied and then performing progressive collapse analysis for axial compressive loading it is noted that the collapse patterns which are observed in the combined loading case are quite similar to the ones in the axial compression case the comparisons of different stress component distributions of damaged model ss 4 under combined axial compression and radial pressure are described in fig 24 it is clear that the main contribution stresses were bending and axial stresses with 555 4 and 543 8 mpa respectively a quite similar to hydrostatic loading the shear stress contribution was about 50 when compared to the contribution of axial and bending stresses while the von mises stress distributions was 513 7 mpa the comparisons of collapsed shape between an intact case and a damaged case with d r 0 05 were presented in fig 25 it is demonstrated that the collapsed shape of the intact model seems to be symmetrical while that of damaged model was asymmetric the reason was to lack of symmetry in the cross section owning to the local denting damage also the axial compression applied eccentrically leads to an additional moment with the middle surface of the wall furthermore the average axial stress strain curve of intact model is compared to that of the damaged model as shown in fig 26 in this figure the ultimate strength reduction is not to a large extent when increasing the dent depth the same procedures to derive formulation in the previous section after the dependent parameters were investigated the regression analyses were carried out through the numerical results a close form formulation is described as a best fit curve in fig 27 the reduction factor was determined by the ratio of axial compression strength of damaged model to that of the intact model the axial compression strength of the intact model under combined loadings was calculated by c 1 in appendix c the reduction factor r ux s was empirically derived as eq 35 namely the mean equation when the safety design was considered the design formulation is given in eq 36 once the ultimate strength of an intact cylinder under combined loadings σ xin s is provided the residual ultimate strength is evaluated by multiplying with the strength reduction factor r ux s as presented in eq 37 the mean of x m ratio of num prop values is 0 998 together with a cov of 1 68 finally the skewness of x m numerical analysis results proposed equation results was also checked with the basic parameters by applying the cross validation charts and it was no sharpness trend line in these figures thus the derived equations have been provided adequate parameters 35 r u x s σ x d s σ

axial compression and radial pressure the equations reported by cho et al 1988 are applied these equations have quite good accuracy when compared to the 30 available test models with a mean of x m is 1 028 together with cov of 7 9 this cov is acceptable to predict the ultimate strength of the intact ring stiffened cylinder under combined loadings the details of the equations are given in appendix d fig 28 illustrates the collapsed shape between an intact case and a dented case with d r 0 03 it is clear that the intact cylinder fails in an axisymmetric collapse mode where an inward bulging around the whole perimeter is formed however in all damaged cases the non axisymmetric collapse was obtained the local damage triggers a different collapse mechanism which is not identical to the one expected for the intact case the dent causes a redistribution of the axial stresses in which an early yielding starts at the edges of the dent and leading to the outward bulging of the shell for combined loading is performed by keeping the radial pressure constant at several values and applying axial compression until collapsed in this study the radial pressure at 0 2 p c and 0 5 p c were applied the ultimate strength interactive curves for the dented ring stiffened cylinder under combined loading are shown in fig 29 in this figure the axial stress and radial pressure of the model were nondimensionalized with yield stress and yield pressure respectively similar procedures for deriving residual strength equations of stringer stiffened cylinders first the dependence of r u and various basic parameters was investigated such as l r r t d r and l t and e σ y it was also using combined variables as z z l 2 r t 1 ν batdorf slenderless parameter z e σ y and l t r e σ y the results demonstrate that the ratio of d r was the strongest effect on r ux r the best fit curve to predict the residual ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinder is depicted in fig 30 based on the regression analyses a closed form formula was derived empirically for assessing the reduction factor r ux r as eq 38 if the safety design is considered the design equation is given in eq 39 the mean of x m ratio of num prop values was 0 986 together with a cov of 3 80 38 r u x r σ x d r σ x i n r e x p 4 95 d r mean equation 39 r u x r σ x d r σ x i n r e x p 0 093 4 95 d r design equation by

reliable when compared to existing test results furthermore the mean of x m modelling uncertainty factor is 1 039 and fairy small cov is 1 941 for residual ultimate strength analyses therefore it is recommended that this numerical method can be applied to investigate the residual ultimate strength of actual design stiffened cylinders under various loadings for hydrostatic pressure loading the stringer stiffened cylinder was failed in local buckling at the stringer stiffener panels the extent of damage was started from the dented zone then it was propagated until near boundary condition the local tripping occurred for both stringer and ring stiffeners ring stiffeners and stringer stiffeners were prevented from the damage extent and resisted the general buckling of the cylinder shell by contrast with the stringer stiffened cylinder the ring stiffened cylinder was failed in overall buckling mode it is interesting that the undamaged sections for both stringer and ring stiffened cylinders are not affected by collision and responded as the intact cases for combined axial compression and radial pressure loading the collapsed shape of the intact cylinder showed symmetry while that of the damaged stiffened cylinder is asymmetry the reason was to lack of symmetry in the cross section owning to the local denting damages also the axial compression applied eccentrically leads to an additional moment with the middle surface of the wall furthermore the ultimate strength of the ring stiffened cylinder was significantly reduced when the dent depth increased while that of the stringer stiffened cylinder is not drastic for ring stiffened cylinders the shell slenderness was strongly affected by ultimate strength when the ratio of r t was increased the effects of local damages on the load carrying capacity were more serious for stringer stiffened cylinders it was however less affected by the local damages on the load carrying capacity when r t is increased simple equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure or combined axial compression and radial pressure have successfully derived as eqs 30 35 and 33 38 for stringer stiffened cylinders and ring stiffened cylinders respectively when considering the safety design the design equations are given as eqs 32 36 and 34 39 by multiplying each equation with mean 2 standard deviation for stringer stiffened cylinders and ring stiffened cylinders respectively in these equations once the maximum permanent dent depth is provided the residual ultimate strength can be rapidly calculated by multiplying with the strength reduction factor as proposed equations also the accuracy of the mean equation when compared to the numerical prediction of the stiffened cylinder under hydrostatic pressure was fairly good with the mean of x m ratio of numerical proposed equation values is 1 01 and 0 988 together with cov of 3 30 and 2 68 for ring and stringer stiffened cylinder respectively for combined axial compression and radial pressure loadings the means of x m are 0 986 and 0 998 together with cov of 3 80 and 1 68 for stringer stiffened cylinders and ring stiffened cylinders respectively to authenticate the derived equations as a new method to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure loading the proposed equation results were compared with existing experimental results the comparison of the proposed formulation results and test results are presented in table 9 the mean of x m proposed formulation values experimental values is 0 973 together with a cov of 3 08 this accuracy is acceptable for design equations to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure it is noted that the proposed equations were derived with the range of cylinder radius to cylinder thickness r t from 97 to 454 for a ring stiffened cylinder and from 11 to 475 for a stringer stiffened cylinder therefore the application of the proposed equations should be possibly restricted to these ranges of r t nevertheless these newly proposed equations may be used for quick calculation of code calibrations also it is recommended that proposed equations may be useful for the initial design goals and serviceability limit state evaluation of stringer or and ring stiffened cylinders under various loadings including hydrostatic pressure or combined axial compression and radial pressure of marine structures in risk conditions 6 concluding remarks the main goal of the current study is to the validity of the proposed numerical modelling strategy method and to derive the empirical equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinder combined loads based on the results provided from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn the present study is successfully conducted the simple equations for the first time for predicting the residual ultimate strength of locally dented stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure and combined axial compression and radial pressure loadings these equations have quite good accurate and reliable when compared to the existing experimental results they are convenient to apply in the initial design goals of the structure s strength and serviceability under the risk conditions of marine stiffened cylinder structures the proposed numerical modelling strategy approach developed in this study is reasonably accurate and reliable when compared to existing test results thus it is recommended that this presented numerical analysis methodology could be applied to both new and existing offshore stiffened cylinders and practically useful for designers or platform owners for investigating the residual ultimate strength of these structures under various loadings in the risk based safety analysis for hydrostatic pressure loading the stringer stiffened cylinder was failed in local buckling at the stringer stiffener panels while that of the ring stiffened cylinder was failed in overall buckling mode the extent of damage was started from the dented zone then it was propagated until near boundary condition the local tripping occurred for both stringer and ring stiffeners for combined axial compression and radial pressure loading the collapsed shape of the intact cylinder showed symmetry while that of the damaged stiffened cylinder is asymmetry owning to the effects of local denting damages furthermore the ultimate strength of the ring stiffened cylinder is significantly reduced when the dent depth increased while that of the stringer stiffened cylinder is not drastic for stringer stiffened cylinders it is however less affected by the local damages on the load carrying capacity when r t is increased it is suggested that the further research should be considered for advanced and optimal structural designs to increase the residual ultimate strength of stiffened cylinder structures against ship collisions and combined loadings also the damage interaction analyses should be extended to more complex structures actual bow stern and side structures of offshore supply vessels should be utilized to determine likely levels of crushing forces a

20949,this paper aims to derive new simple and consistently reliable residual strength equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of steel dented stiffened cylinders under combined axial compression and radial pressure including hydrostatic pressure for this two types of the stiffened cylinders namely stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders which are generally main components of offshore marine structures used in semi submersibles submarines tension legs of platforms tlps and other various types of floating offshore structures are investigated firstly the various collision damage scenarios which illustrated the collision accidents of offshore stiffened cylinders with supply vessels or floating subjects were analysed then a finite element modelling of the stiffened cylinders was developed using a commercial software package abaqus explicit after being validated against available test results next rigorous parametric studies on full scaled design examples of stiffened cylinders were carried out by changing the design variables based on the rigorous case of the study results new simple design equations which are used to predict the ultimate residual strength of the damaged stiffened cylinders under combined loads are proposed through a regression study finally the accuracy and reliability of the proposed equations have been compared with available test data and a nonlinear finite element analysis nfea these equations can be useful for the initial design stage of stiffened cylinders under the risk conditions of offshore structures in

platforms submarines and recently as columns of offshore wind turbine foundations during operations these structures are constantly serviced by supply vessels of ship traffic trading vessels offshore tankers merchant ship and other ships related to offshore activity therefore collisions between these ships and offshore structures are unavoidable during its service the major collided structures may lead to catastrophic consequences as endangering human life environmental pollution and financial losses a common damaged structure of tlps is illustrated in fig 1 the accident of the us submarine greeneville with the fishing vessel ehime maru in 2001 is shown in fig 2 obviously the offshore stiffened cylinders should be designed to have enough strength and safety against potential collisions the key concern is to assess the ultimate residual strength of the structural system after collisions and to guarantee that they are acceptable for safety operation therefore the prediction of the residual strength of these structures has crucial importance for decision making to allow the structural system operation or a stop of operation theoretical and experimental studies in residual strength of locally dented stiffened cylinder have progressed remarkably over the last few decades ronalds et al 1987 1988 performed the quasi static impact test on small scale stringer stiffened cylinders and these models were then loaded under axial compressive until collapsed harding et al 1995 investigated the effects of local denting damage on eight small scale ring stiffened cylinders subjected to axial compression load walker et al 1987 1988 reported the test results of damaged ring stiffened cylinders under combined axial compressive and hydrostatic pressure loadings furthermore the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders is also relatively investigated in few studies and there is a limited database of experiments smith and creswell 1987 saraiva and cyrino 2007 amante et al 2008 2010 maddalena et al 2012 recently ghazijahani et al 2014a presented the test results of 27 locally dented steel unstiffened cylinders under axial compression and 14 thin walled intact and dented cylinders under external pressure ghazijahani et al 2014 and 8 dented tubes under bending loads ghazijahani et al 2015 it is noted that most of the available experimental works which were generated the damages on models by quasi static denting where the effects of strain rate and inertial forces were not considered it is quite different from actual cases because most ships and offshore structural collisions in the actual ocean have occurred under dynamic collisions more recently cho et al 2017 and do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c conducted four large scaled fabricated ring stiffened cylinders and two stringer stiffened cylinders under the dynamic mass impact all specimens were subsequently tested under hydrostatic pressure to assess the reduction in ultimate strength buckling designs of intact stiffened cylinders under various loading are well understood based on a large database of available test results by many researchers for hydrostatic loadings kendrick 1964 1965 1970 1972 reynolds 1960 lunchick 1959 yamamoto et al 1989 miller and kinra 1981 agelidis et al 1983 morandi et al 1996 dowling et al 1986 krasovsky et al 2007 cerik et al 2013a 2013b cho et al 2017 2018 do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c and combined axial compression and radial pressure loadings sridharan et al 1980 odland 1981 dowling et al 1982 miller et al 1982 ellinas et al 1984 cho and lee 1998 das et al 2011 furthermore several code recommendations for predicting the ultimate strength of intact stiffened cylinder are given in the dnv 2013 api 2004 bsi 2009 gl 2009 abs 2014 rules and cho et al 1998 das et al 2011 however until recently there was no reliable formulations and code recommendation to assess the effects of damage on the ultimate strength of stiffened cylinder under combined axial compression and radial pressure or external hydrostatic pressure loadings thus it is sorely necessary to propose the new design equations to predict the residual ultimate strength of these structures and this study aims to fill that gap recently nonlinear finite element modelling nfem is a powerful tool to predict the ship and offshore cylinder structure collisions however one of the main challenges when modelling ship and offshore cylindrical structure collisions is the accuracy and reliability of numerical results because ship and offshore cylinder structure collision modellings are very complicated produces it is included material properties geometries loadings and boundary conditions others for both striking ships or free floating subjects and offshore structures therefore the accuracy and reliability of numerical results need to be validated by comparing them with available experimental results then it can be used for performing further investigations on full scale actual stiffened cylinder structures to develop design guidelines and deriving formulations do et al 2018a cerik 2015 furthermore many researchers have conducted numerical analyses of the ship and offshore cylinder structure collisions cho et al 2017 and do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 2020 performed the numerical investigations on the residual ultimate strength of dented ring and stringer stiffened cylinders under external hydrostatic pressure cerik 2015 provided numerical results of the residual ultimate strengths of locally dented steel stiffened cylinders subjected to axial compression the numerical simulations on damaged stiffened cylinders under various loading conditions were also performed by prabu et al 2010 ramasamy et al 2014 rathinam and prabu 2015 and ghazijahani et al 2014b 2014b 2015 thus from the computational economic and scientific efficiency a carefully implemented nfea which is validated method with reliable experimental results could be the most potentially effective way to evaluate the residual ultimate strength of damaged stiffened cylinders under various loadings although residual strength can be accurately predicted by applying nfea modelling and simulations take much time and complications therefore estimation of empirical formulations by convenient calculation way have regularly been used in the initial structural design steps against this background the current paper aims to derive new simple and consistently reliable equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of damaged ring and or stringer stiffened cylinders under combined loadings the proposed formulations were derived through the regression analyses of the rigorous parametric study results by nfea the accuracy and reliability of proposed equations have been established by comparing them with available experimental data and nfea results 2 description of reference test data first a series of experimental studies of stiffened cylinders were provided by a project of the cohesive buckling research programme this project focused on the residual ultimate strength of dented stiffened cylinders of offshore structures in various loadings in addition it was performed in different united kingdom universities from 1983 to 1985 hse 1992 the project provided reliable and valuable test data for validating numerical prediction approaches and existing formulations of ultimate strength in the first series harding and onoufriou 1995 performed eight small scale ring stiffened cylinder models from cy 2 to cy 9 under quasi static denting at mid bay of the cylinder these specimens were then tested under axial compression for assessing the effects of local damages on ultimate strength internal transducers measured the relative displacement of the two end plates in contact with the model so that the end shortening can be inferred the load was applied in small increments and the step size was reduced as the collapse approached to ensure that nonlinearity in the response and the peak load was accurately measured the depth of the dent in each model is different the material properties and measured dimensions of ring stiffened cylinder models are presented in table 1 similarly ronalds et al 1988 examined the effect of local denting damages for the ultimate strength of stringer stiffened cylinder specimens from 3b1 3b4 the details of dimensions and material properties for stringer stiffened cylinder specimens are provided in table 2 second the experimental results of three stringer stiffened cylinders and six ring stiffened cylinders provided by cho et al 2017 and authors do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c in ulsanlab university of ulsan korea among them six specimens ss c 1 ss c 2 and rs c 1 to rs c 4 were tested under dynamic mass impact using a drop testing machine three specimens ss i rs i and rs ii were the intact specimens which were necessary to determine the reduction factor on ultimate strength when comparing them with damaged specimens after generating the damages all specimens were performed under hydrostatic pressure it is noted that all models in both projects were fabricated using cold bending and tig welding after fabricating processes all models were applied heat treatment processes for reducing the level of the residual stresses due to welding moreover the initial imperfection for each specimen was measured and the maximum initial imperfection values were generally lower than the code tolerance requirements bsi 2009 api 2004 the material properties and measured dimensions of specimens are given in tables 2 and 3 furthermore detailed explanations of experimental installations and experimental results are given in do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 3 numerical analysis 3 1 finite element modelling the nonlinear finite element was carried out using the software package abaqus in the analysis the finite element model consists of full dimensions of the test specimens including the end plate and the end ring the full geometries of specimens were modelled and meshed with s4r four node reduced integration shell elements in the abaqus element library five through thickness integration section points and hourglass control of the simpson rule were applied the thickness of elements at welding locations was not increased and taken into account in numerical simulations this assumption may not lead to a critical difference between the actual behaviour and the numerical behaviour convergence simulations were performed to select the optimal mesh size for each series specimen in this paper the mesh size of the outer contact zone coarse mesh was two times of the contact zone fine mesh the chosen mesh size of the contact zone for specimens of cy 2 to cy 9 and 3b1 to 3b4 was 2 mm 2 mm the mesh size of the outer contact zone was 6 mm 6 mm in a similar manner the mesh size of the contact region for specimens of ss i to ss c 2 and rs i to rs c 4 was 5 5 mm while that of the outer contact region was 10 mm 10 mm these mesh sizes are sufficiently fine to record the deformed shape and stress strain response precisely of the specimen it is noted that if the mesh size of an element is smaller than shell thickness it may lead to errors in contact calculations the striker mass was modelled as rigid elements r3d4 3 d bilinear rigid quadrilateral element in abaqus explicit the contact between the striker mass surface and cylinder shell was defined as the general contact algorithm with the penalty contact approach the contact friction coefficient was chosen by 0 23 kõrgesaar et al 2018 for considering the sliding of the striker mass surface and cylinder shell the tangential contact behaviour was modelled with a hard contact of pressure overclosure definition the total collision duration was set to be 0 5s 3 2 material properties for collision simulations the true stress and true strain were achieved using the engineering stress and strain in the static tensile tests as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the results calculated from eqs 1 and 2 were then substituted into eqs 3 7 for considering the strain hardening and yield plateau furthermore it is well known that the collision simulation results are strongly affected by strain rate definition the local damages were large strain rate evolution in the impact region therefore the revised formulations provided in references do et al 2018a 2018b were used for considering the effects of strain rate as shown in eqs 8 11 these formulations have been derived using the extensive dynamic tensile test results with different marine steels in the numerical model the true plastic strain was determined through eq 12 in this study the effects of strain rate were generated from 10 s 20 s 50 s 70 s 100 s to 150 s as shown in fig 3 also the models were not loaded until fracture hence no fracture criterion was set 1 σ t r σ ε 1 2 ε t r l n ε 1 3 σ t r e ε t r when 0 ε t r ε y t r 4 σ t r σ y t r σ h s t r σ y t r ε

2 12 ε p l t r ε t r σ t r e for residual strength simulations the material properties were assumed as elastic perfectly plastic material because residual ultimate strength assessment is one type of quasi static problem the effect of strain rate was therefore neglected additionally the dynamic responses of the collapsing structures and ultimate strength or pressure reduction owning to the rushing water inside of the chamber were not considered 3 3 collision analysis the main goal of collision analysis was to achieve the initial damage deformation these damaged models were then transferred to residual ultimate strength analysis in the next step based on the experimental data in the previous section collision simulations included the quasi static impact and dynamic impact analysis for quasi static impact analysis the explicit solver in abaqus was applied a real time simulation of a quasi static process was computationally impractical it is imperative to increase the speed of the process to obtain an economical solution if an explicit solver was used furthermore it should be considered to keep the inertia forces level low to overcome the stress wave propagation with highly concentrating localized denting therefore the period of simulation is to be determined as short as possible the dominant response in a quasi static analysis would be the first structural mode the first natural frequency and the corresponding time period of the test models was calculated by performing modal analysis with the dent depth obtained in actual tests this value was used to estimate an upper value of impact velocity it was found out to be lower than 1 of the wave speed in metals about 5000 m s starting with this value after a series of simulations with different loading rates by examining the results the total simulation period was determined as 0 016s until 0 008s the knife edge indenter is moved downwards to the models up to the maximum dent depth attained in actual tests after 0 008 s the indenter is retracted in a quasi static impact simulation the actual mass of the indenter was not important however to minimize the noise in contact calculations the mass of the indenter should be of the order of the struck model accordingly the mass was taken as 2 kg for models cy 2 to cy9 and 3b1 to 3b4 for dynamic impact analysis the collision force occurred in a short time the strain rate effect is the most important parameter in collision responses with the high impact velocity the damages were large strain rate levels and local at the impacted region another important point in dynamic impact analysis was the effect of inertial forces in fact the energy absorbed in dynamic impact analysis will be larger than that in the corresponding quasi static impact analysis depending on the level of inertial forces and the impact velocity in the dropped object was calculated as eq 13 all elements of striking mass were tied to a reference point where inertial properties and impact velocity of striker were applied the applied boundary conditions were used the same as actual experiments for example the nonlinear finite element modelling of models ss c 1 and cy 3 was described in fig 4 13 i m p a c t v e l o c i t y m s 2 a c c e l e r a t i o n d u e t o g r a v i t y m s 2 d r o p h e i g h t m it is inevitable that specimens will vibrate elastically during the collision processes therefore rayleigh damping was applied to reduce these vibrations and quickly achieve a static equilibrium state rayleigh damping was calculated as eq 14 in this equation m is the system structural mass matrix while k is the system structural stiffness matrix the coefficient α is examined as the lowest natural frequency of the specimen and it was obtained by performing the subspace eigen solver of modal analysis the coefficient β is the stiffness proportional damping factor which is neglected in this study 14 c α m β k 3 4 collapse analysis when the impact simulation was completed the damaged geometry of model was subsequently applied to the collapse analysis for assessing the reduction in ultimate strength this process was updated all changing of the node coordinates for the dented areas thus all residual stress contributions from the impact analysis were incorporated into the collapse analysis the modified riks method was applied in the collapse analysis it is noted that the materials was assumed as elastic perfect plastic by neglecting the strain hardening series of numerical simulations were carried out to assess the effects of the damages on the reduction in ultimate strength under axial compressive load for models cy2 to cy9 and 3b1 to 3b4 respectively for these models all degrees of freedom at one end of the cylinders were restrained in the other end of the specimen all elements were attached to a reference point which allowed the axial displacement and fixed with other five degrees of freedom as shown in fig 5 a furthermore collapse analysis for models rs i to rs c 4 and ss i to ss c 2 were illustrated in fig 5b the specimen was restrained for all nodes at the open end flange and applied the external hydrostatic pressure to determine the ultimate strength reduction of the damaged cylinder the intact specimens were used for comparing them with damaged specimens the intact specimen simulations were performed by using the same assumptions as damaged specimens however the initial imperfection welding residual stress and cold bending residual stress should be considered in numerical modelling when considering the initial imperfection of cylinder the best way was to take into account directly the measurement of imperfection values in finite modelling models these values were good to consider both local buckling and overall buckling modes however if the initial imperfection values were not supported it could be carried out buckle analyses and achieved the eigenvalue buckle generally the first buckling mode was selected for creating the initial imperfection the problem was how large imperfection magnitude was included according to api 2004 and pd5500 psi 2009 rules the upper limit of tolerable imperfection value was 0 5 r mean radius of a cylinder additionally muttaqie et al 2019 examined the initial imperfection magnitude was approximately 0 4 of shell thickness he obtained this value by comparing the numerical results and experimental results of a series of small scaled cylinder specimens the welding residual stresses caused by the temperature changes the melt material to connect structures together it is located around the welding part and inside structures in this study the welding residual stress was directly inputted as the initial stresses of nodes in numerical modelling the details of equations to determine the welding residual stresses are given in cho et al 2017 the distribution of welding residual stress is presented in fig 6 for model ss i for the cold bending residual stress the quasi static bending simulations of flat plate were performed one end of the flat plate was fixed while that of the other side was applied rolling load until the expected shape of a cylinder shell in modelling the integration points through the shell thickness were assumed as 21 points the residual stress distribution by cold bending for model ss i was described in figs 7 and 8 where t and z are cylinder shell thickness and coordinate with respect to the shell top plane 3 5 benchmarking numerical predictions with experimental results to validate the presented numerical modelling strategy the experimental data gave by harding and onoufriou 1995 and ronalds and dowling 1998 were utilized these models were already given in the previous section the axial shortening stress strain relations which obtained in the tests and through numerical analysis are shown in fig 9 for the stringer and ring stiffened cylinder models respectively in this figure the axial stress and axial shortening strain were non dimensional with yield stress and yield strain respectively overall a good correlation exists between actual test results and numerical results for ring and stringer stiffened cylinder models furthermore the ultimate compressive load attained in the tests and the values obtained from numerical analyses are listed for each model as shown in table 4 for all models the mean of the modelling uncertainty factor x m the ratio of the test values over that of prediction values is 0 965 and its cov coefficient of variation is 5 644 although there is slight overprediction considering the uncertainties related to experiments such as non uniformity in load application imperfections and material properties the agreement is considered satisfactory these values are acceptable for predictions of ultimate strength for validation numerical methods of models that generated the damages by dynamic mass impact the experimental data gave by do et al 2018a 2018b 2018c are used the axial shortening displacement pressure curves obtained in the tests and through numerical analysis are shown in fig 10 for the stringer and ring stiffened cylinder respectively also the predicted deformed shapes were compared to experimental results in fig 11 in general a good agreement was achieved between actual test results and numerical results furthermore the summary of collapse pressure attained in the tests and the values obtained from numerical analyses are listed for each model as shown in table 5 in this table the mean of x m modelling uncertainty factor was 1 039 and the small cov was 1 941 therefore based on the high accuracy of the numerical modelling strategy approach developed in this study it is suggested that this numerical method can be applied to investigate the residual ultimate strength of actual design stiffened cylinders for developing design codes or validating the collision problems 4 derivation of empirical formulation after benchmarking numerical predictions with experimental results the series nfea of rigorous parametric studies on the full scaled ring and stringer stiffened cylinders were carried out by changing the design variables the material properties and dimensions of stiffened cylinders were selected as the reality tension leg platforms semi submersibles and or submarine design concept in the abs 2014 api 2004 and pd5500 2009 rules the nfea strategy approach developed in the previous section was applied the dimensions and material properties of stringer and ring stiffened cylinders were presented in tables 6 and 7 the range of cylinder radius to cylinder thickness r t was from 97 to 454 for a ring stiffened cylinder and from 11 to 475 for a stringer stiffened cylinder it is noted that there is a small dimension as model rs 9 and a quite large dimension as model rs 6 in table 6 they may not similar to an actual submarine dimension because the range of r t in table 6 is not only focused on submarine structures but also focused on other types of offshore cylindrical structures for collision analysis the abaqus s dynamic explicit solver approach was applied the global mesh size was 80 80 mm while that of fine mesh at the contact area was 40 40 mm these mesh size were selected by performing the convergence test to choose the optimum ones the rigid hemisphere striker header shape was used for creating the damage on the model dnv gl 2017 divided the numerical analysis of ship and offshore structures collision scenario into three design regions ductile design shared energy design and strength design and recommended that ship and offshore structures collision drops in the ductile design in the ductile design region the striking ship can be assumed as a rigid body so that the finite element analysis can be highly simplified the collision velocities were determined as 1 0 m s 2 5 m s 5 0 m s 7 5 m s and 10 m s and together with striker mass of 10 tons 20 tons 50 tons and 100 tons for each velocity these velocities can be represented the collisions of offshore stiffened cylinders with floating objects or dropped items from platform decks additionally when considering the collision between the offshore stiffened cylinder and visiting supply vessels or passing vessels trading vessels offshore tankers merchant ship and other ships related to offshore activity the collision velocities were 1 0 m s 2 0 m s and 3 0 m s while the striker masses were selected as 1000 tons 3000 tons 5000 tons and 7500 tons for each velocity therefore the total of numerical analysis cases was 256 for stringer stiffened cylinders and 320 for ring stiffened cylinders the aim of collision analysis is to generate the initial geometric deformation for the next residual strength analysis with various loadings for residual ultimate strength analysis the modified riks approach in abaqus was used as mentioned in the previous section there were two types of loading considered in this study the first loading was external hydrostatic pressure and the second loading was combination of axial compression and radial pressure for the external hydrostatic pressure loading when the impact simulation was completed the damaged geometry specimen was subsequently applied to the residual ultimate strength analysis for assessing the reduction in collapse pressure with this process all residual stress contributions from the impact analysis were incorporated into the collapse analysis it is noted that in the residual strength simulation the material was assumed as linear perfectly plastic for the combined loadings the radial pressure at 0 2 pc collapse pressure of damaged model and 0 5 pc was applied and it was then performed progressive collapse analysis for axial compressive loading thus the total of numerical analysis cases is 576 for external hydrostatic pressure loading and while that of 1152 cases for combined loadings the procedures involved in performing numerical analysis and deriving the empirical residual strength formulations are described in fig 12 4 1 design equations for prediction of extent damage before deriving equations to forecast the residual strength of locally dented stiffened cylinders the formulations for assessing the maximum permanent dent depth were derived as eqs 15 29 detailed explanations of derived formulation procedures are given by authors in reference do et al 2018a 2020 these equations have highly accurate and reliable when compared with the available experimental data and other existing equations the mean of x m is 1

both damaged ring stiffened cylinder and stringer stiffened cylinder under external hydrostatic pressure the detail procedures to derive equations were provided 4 2 1 proposed formulations for damaged stringer stiffened cylinder the various stress component distributions included bending stress axial stress shear stress and von mises stress of damaged model ss 4 under hydrostatic pressure are plotted in fig 13 under hydrostatic loading the main contribution stresses were axial and bending stresses with 408 7 and 403 4 mpa respectively interestingly the shear stress contribution was about 50 when compared to the contribution of axial and bending stresses the von mises stress distributions in post collapse shape was 355 mpa the von mises stress distributions at different stages of damage evolution under hydrostatic pressure are described in fig 14 it is noted that the first stage was the damaged shape which was transferred from collision simulation and the next stages are propagated of the deformed shapes until collapsed shape the model was failed in local buckling at the stringer stiffened panels the extent of damage was started from the dented zone then it was propagated until near boundary condition furthermore the local tripping occurred for both stringer and ring stiffeners the stringers and ring stiffeners prevented the damage extent and resisted the general buckling for the cylinder shell it is evident that the undamaged sections were not affected due to collision and responded as the intact stringer stiffened cylinder fig 15 shows the pressure radial displacement curves at the hit point of model ss 4 r t 210 for various dent depths in this figure the collapse pressure of the dented cylinder p dam was non dimensionalized with that of the intact cylinder p in while the dent depth d was non dimensionalised with a radius of cylinder r the collapse pressure of the stringer stiffened cylinder was significantly affected by the local damage when the dent depth was increased the ultimate strength of the model was noticeable reduced owing to loss of stiffness and decreasing of load carrying capacity the procedures to derive the formulations to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer stiffened cylinders under dynamic mass impact are presented in fig 12 in the previous section series of finite element analyses were carried out to assess the effect of the dent depth on the ultimate strength of stiffened cylinder under hydrostatic pressure before deriving the equation the effects of basic parameters on the residual strength of the dented stiffened cylinder were investigated the main goal of this stage was to find the suitable dependent parameters that can be used for deriving equations the dependence of the non dimensional reduction factor r u p dam p in has been checked with basic parameters such as l s r l s t d r w sf t sf h sw t sw e σ y the combinations of the basic parameters were also investigated such as z z l 2 r t 1 ν batdorf slenderness parameter z e σ y and l t r e σ y the trends and dependent degrees between r u and different parameters are presented in table 8 it is noted that the non dimensional parameter d r has the strongest effect on reduction factor r u therefore this parameter should be used to derive the equation after investigating the dependent parameters the regression analysis was carried out with the best fit values of the numerical results the best fit curve obtained from numerical results is plotted in fig 16 the equation to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer stiffened cylinders was derived as eq 30 the accuracy of proposed equations was quite good with a mean of x m was 1 01 and a cov was 3 30 the other form of the equation was also derived with a mean of x m of 1 01 and a cov of 3 6 as illustrated in eq 31 when the safety design was considered the design formulation is given in eq 32 by multiplying eq 30 with mean 2 standard deviation as indicated in fig 16 30 r u p d a m p i n e x p 1 796 δ d mean equation 31 r u p d a m p i n 1 246 δ d 2 1 773 δ d 1 32 r u p d a m p i n e x p 0 058 1 796 δ d design equation after deriving the equation the final stage is to check the skewness of x m numerical analysis results derived equation results with the basic parameters by applying the cross validation charts this stage was important when performing the regression diagnostic method to derive the formulation if the skewness of x m with basic parameters greatly occurs these parameters need to take into account in the derived equations the skewness of x m against the basic parameters is described in figs 17 19 in these figures there is no sharpness trend line thus the proposed equations have been provided with adequate parameters 4 2 2 proposed formulations for damaged ring stiffened cylinder before deriving new formulations let us re visit the existing formula provided by authors in reference do et al 2018a these equations have high accuracy when comparing them with the existing test results however it was only considered the striker header shape by a knife edge type in general the result of extent damage under collision and residual strength under external hydrostatic pressure was strongly affected by the types of striker header shape furthermore the numerical investigations reported by do et al 2018b 2018c 2020 were also concluded that the most serious case in extended damages and residual ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinder is a type of hemispherical striker header therefore in this section these equations have improved by considering the hemispherical indenter based on the regression analysis the residual strength equation was empirically derived for determining the reduction factor r u as indicated in eq 33 when considering the safety design the design formulation is given in eq 34 by multiplying eq 33 with mean 2 standard deviation as shown in fig 20 the proposed equation has a mean x m of 0 988 together with a cov of 2 68 it is noted that the details of the derived equation procedures to calculate the residual ultimate strength of the ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure can be found in reference do et al 2018a in addition more detail of the progressive collapse of a rings stiffened cylinder is depicted in figs 21 and 22 the first stage is the damaged shape which is transferred from collision simulation and the next stages were propagated of the deformed shapes until collapsed shape the model was failed in overall buckling the

stiffened cylinder under combined axial compression and radial pressure 4 3 1 residual ultimate strength formulations for stringer stiffened cylinder in this section the simple proposed formulation was derived by a series of the numerical analysis results of the reality design concept of a stringer stiffened cylinder the nfea was performed with the techniques in the previous section an example of geometry of stringer stiffened cylinder and loadings considered as shown in fig 23 most marine structural members fail in the regime of the interaction between the elastic buckling and yielding the failure modes can be identified as follows local shell buckling stringer shell collapse between ring frames stringer tripping and general instability therefore any good ultimate strength formulations need to employ inelastic buckling formulations as their basis cho et al 1998 to predict the ultimate strength of intact stringer stiffened cylinders the design equations presented by cho et al 1998 were applied these equations were considered all the failure modes of stringer stiffened cylinders under combined loadings which are presented in equations c 1 in appendix c these equations have a fair accuracy when compared to the 90 available experimental models with a mean of x m was 1 05 and a cov was 14 3 the accuracy of the provided equations was better than that of well known equations such as bsi 2009 api 2004 and dnv gl 2014 for stringer stiffened cylinders the effects of radial pressure on the axial load carrying capacity were not significant unless the radial pressure is close to the collapse pressure in this study the radial pressure at 0 2 p c collapse pressure of damaged model and 0 5 p c were applied and then performing progressive collapse analysis for axial compressive loading it is noted that the collapse patterns which are observed in the combined loading case are quite similar to the ones in the axial compression case the comparisons of different stress component distributions of damaged model ss 4 under combined axial compression and radial pressure are described in fig 24 it is clear that the main contribution stresses were bending and axial stresses with 555 4 and 543 8 mpa respectively a quite similar to hydrostatic loading the shear stress contribution was about 50 when compared to the contribution of axial and bending stresses while the von mises stress distributions was 513 7 mpa the comparisons of collapsed shape between an intact case and a damaged case with d r 0 05 were presented in fig 25 it is demonstrated that the collapsed shape of the intact model seems to be symmetrical while that of damaged model was asymmetric the reason was to lack of symmetry in the cross section owning to the local denting damage also the axial compression applied eccentrically leads to an additional moment with the middle surface of the wall furthermore the average axial stress strain curve of intact model is compared to that of the damaged model as shown in fig 26 in this figure the ultimate strength reduction is not to a large extent when increasing the dent depth the same procedures to derive formulation in the previous section after the dependent parameters were investigated the regression analyses were carried out through the numerical results a close form formulation is described as a best fit curve in fig 27 the reduction factor was determined by the ratio of axial compression strength of damaged model to that of the intact model the axial compression strength of the intact model under combined loadings was calculated by c 1 in appendix c the reduction factor r ux s was empirically derived as eq 35 namely the mean equation when the safety design was considered the design formulation is given in eq 36 once the ultimate strength of an intact cylinder under combined loadings σ xin s is provided the residual ultimate strength is evaluated by multiplying with the strength reduction factor r ux s as presented in eq 37 the mean of x m ratio of num prop values is 0 998 together with a cov of 1 68 finally the skewness of x m numerical analysis results proposed equation results was also checked with the basic parameters by applying the cross validation charts and it was no sharpness trend line in these figures thus the derived equations have been provided adequate parameters 35 r u x s σ x d s σ

axial compression and radial pressure the equations reported by cho et al 1988 are applied these equations have quite good accuracy when compared to the 30 available test models with a mean of x m is 1 028 together with cov of 7 9 this cov is acceptable to predict the ultimate strength of the intact ring stiffened cylinder under combined loadings the details of the equations are given in appendix d fig 28 illustrates the collapsed shape between an intact case and a dented case with d r 0 03 it is clear that the intact cylinder fails in an axisymmetric collapse mode where an inward bulging around the whole perimeter is formed however in all damaged cases the non axisymmetric collapse was obtained the local damage triggers a different collapse mechanism which is not identical to the one expected for the intact case the dent causes a redistribution of the axial stresses in which an early yielding starts at the edges of the dent and leading to the outward bulging of the shell for combined loading is performed by keeping the radial pressure constant at several values and applying axial compression until collapsed in this study the radial pressure at 0 2 p c and 0 5 p c were applied the ultimate strength interactive curves for the dented ring stiffened cylinder under combined loading are shown in fig 29 in this figure the axial stress and radial pressure of the model were nondimensionalized with yield stress and yield pressure respectively similar procedures for deriving residual strength equations of stringer stiffened cylinders first the dependence of r u and various basic parameters was investigated such as l r r t d r and l t and e σ y it was also using combined variables as z z l 2 r t 1 ν batdorf slenderless parameter z e σ y and l t r e σ y the results demonstrate that the ratio of d r was the strongest effect on r ux r the best fit curve to predict the residual ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinder is depicted in fig 30 based on the regression analyses a closed form formula was derived empirically for assessing the reduction factor r ux r as eq 38 if the safety design is considered the design equation is given in eq 39 the mean of x m ratio of num prop values was 0 986 together with a cov of 3 80 38 r u x r σ x d r σ x i n r e x p 4 95 d r mean equation 39 r u x r σ x d r σ x i n r e x p 0 093 4 95 d r design equation by

reliable when compared to existing test results furthermore the mean of x m modelling uncertainty factor is 1 039 and fairy small cov is 1 941 for residual ultimate strength analyses therefore it is recommended that this numerical method can be applied to investigate the residual ultimate strength of actual design stiffened cylinders under various loadings for hydrostatic pressure loading the stringer stiffened cylinder was failed in local buckling at the stringer stiffener panels the extent of damage was started from the dented zone then it was propagated until near boundary condition the local tripping occurred for both stringer and ring stiffeners ring stiffeners and stringer stiffeners were prevented from the damage extent and resisted the general buckling of the cylinder shell by contrast with the stringer stiffened cylinder the ring stiffened cylinder was failed in overall buckling mode it is interesting that the undamaged sections for both stringer and ring stiffened cylinders are not affected by collision and responded as the intact cases for combined axial compression and radial pressure loading the collapsed shape of the intact cylinder showed symmetry while that of the damaged stiffened cylinder is asymmetry the reason was to lack of symmetry in the cross section owning to the local denting damages also the axial compression applied eccentrically leads to an additional moment with the middle surface of the wall furthermore the ultimate strength of the ring stiffened cylinder was significantly reduced when the dent depth increased while that of the stringer stiffened cylinder is not drastic for ring stiffened cylinders the shell slenderness was strongly affected by ultimate strength when the ratio of r t was increased the effects of local damages on the load carrying capacity were more serious for stringer stiffened cylinders it was however less affected by the local damages on the load carrying capacity when r t is increased simple equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure or combined axial compression and radial pressure have successfully derived as eqs 30 35 and 33 38 for stringer stiffened cylinders and ring stiffened cylinders respectively when considering the safety design the design equations are given as eqs 32 36 and 34 39 by multiplying each equation with mean 2 standard deviation for stringer stiffened cylinders and ring stiffened cylinders respectively in these equations once the maximum permanent dent depth is provided the residual ultimate strength can be rapidly calculated by multiplying with the strength reduction factor as proposed equations also the accuracy of the mean equation when compared to the numerical prediction of the stiffened cylinder under hydrostatic pressure was fairly good with the mean of x m ratio of numerical proposed equation values is 1 01 and 0 988 together with cov of 3 30 and 2 68 for ring and stringer stiffened cylinder respectively for combined axial compression and radial pressure loadings the means of x m are 0 986 and 0 998 together with cov of 3 80 and 1 68 for stringer stiffened cylinders and ring stiffened cylinders respectively to authenticate the derived equations as a new method to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure loading the proposed equation results were compared with existing experimental results the comparison of the proposed formulation results and test results are presented in table 9 the mean of x m proposed formulation values experimental values is 0 973 together with a cov of 3 08 this accuracy is acceptable for design equations to predict the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure it is noted that the proposed equations were derived with the range of cylinder radius to cylinder thickness r t from 97 to 454 for a ring stiffened cylinder and from 11 to 475 for a stringer stiffened cylinder therefore the application of the proposed equations should be possibly restricted to these ranges of r t nevertheless these newly proposed equations may be used for quick calculation of code calibrations also it is recommended that proposed equations may be useful for the initial design goals and serviceability limit state evaluation of stringer or and ring stiffened cylinders under various loadings including hydrostatic pressure or combined axial compression and radial pressure of marine structures in risk conditions 6 concluding remarks the main goal of the current study is to the validity of the proposed numerical modelling strategy method and to derive the empirical equations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of stringer and or ring stiffened cylinder combined loads based on the results provided from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn the present study is successfully conducted the simple equations for the first time for predicting the residual ultimate strength of locally dented stringer and or ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure and combined axial compression and radial pressure loadings these equations have quite good accurate and reliable when compared to the existing experimental results they are convenient to apply in the initial design goals of the structure s strength and serviceability under the risk conditions of marine stiffened cylinder structures the proposed numerical modelling strategy approach developed in this study is reasonably accurate and reliable when compared to existing test results thus it is recommended that this presented numerical analysis methodology could be applied to both new and existing offshore stiffened cylinders and practically useful for designers or platform owners for investigating the residual ultimate strength of these structures under various loadings in the risk based safety analysis for hydrostatic pressure loading the stringer stiffened cylinder was failed in local buckling at the stringer stiffener panels while that of the ring stiffened cylinder was failed in overall buckling mode the extent of damage was started from the dented zone then it was propagated until near boundary condition the local tripping occurred for both stringer and ring stiffeners for combined axial compression and radial pressure loading the collapsed shape of the intact cylinder showed symmetry while that of the damaged stiffened cylinder is asymmetry owning to the effects of local denting damages furthermore the ultimate strength of the ring stiffened cylinder is significantly reduced when the dent depth increased while that of the stringer stiffened cylinder is not drastic for stringer stiffened cylinders it is however less affected by the local damages on the load carrying capacity when r t is increased it is suggested that the further research should be considered for advanced and optimal structural designs to increase the residual ultimate strength of stiffened cylinder structures against ship collisions and combined loadings also the damage interaction analyses should be extended to more complex structures actual bow stern and side structures of offshore supply vessels should be utilized to determine likely levels of crushing forces a
