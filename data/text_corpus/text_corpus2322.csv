11610,the scarcity of high quality irrigation water is a global issue facing rice growers forcing many to adopt water management systems that may result in increased salinity and yield reductions while salt concentrations in field water have been shown to vary depending on water management the distribution and build up patterns of dissolved salts are unclear this study was conducted to elucidate the within field spatial and temporal salinity dynamics in water seeded rice cropping systems and to assess current salinity thresholds for rice yield reduction in this two year study water and soil salinity concentrations of eleven field sites were monitored weekly with three sampling points being established in the top middle and bottom basins of each field there was a consistent spatio temporal water salinity pattern among all fields the maximum water salinity within a field occurred during week 2 to week 7 after planting and was greatest farther from the irrigation inlet and where soil salinity was high a model developed to predict water salinity within a field indicates that averaged over an entire growing season the position within a field contributed to 82 of the variation explained by the model while preseason soil salinity contributed to 18 importantly field water salinity was determined to be the most sensitive salinity metric for rice yield as preseason soil salinity was a poor predictor of yield loss the threshold field water salinity concentration was estimated at 0 88dsm 1 lower than the previous report of 1 9dsm 1 these results illustrate the ability to predict water salinity in a rice field with few parameters while highlighting the importance of field water salinity as the main salinity metric for rice cropping systems keywords salinity dynamics rice yield threshold water quality modeling irrigation water quality 1 introduction high quality water available for irrigated agriculture is currently scarce and is expected to become less available due to climate change and population growth hanak and lund 2012 fraiture and wichelns 2010 mirchi et al 2013 schewe et al 2014 wallace 2000 this will result in increased use of marginal water and decreased drainage thereby resulting in increased secondary salinization connor et al 2012 molden et al 2010 rice a globally important staple crop is the most salt sensitive cereal grieve et al 2012 munns and tester 2008 additionally when grown under irrigation rice requires two to three times more water input than other cereals bouman et al 2007 kijne 2006 the current and projected decline in the quantity and quality of water for rice production prompts the need to investigate salinity in rice cropping systems to avoid yield reductions in california rice is the top agricultural water user based on application rate per hectare usda 2013 rice fields in california which are typically divided into several hydrologically connected basins are continuously flooded throughout the growing season with irrigation water entering the topmost basin and cascading through to the bottommost basin the primary water management system in california is a conventional flow through system hereafter referred to as conventional drainage under conventional drainage tailwater discharges to a drainage ditch for much of the growing season the exception being during water holding periods after pesticide applications whereby tailwater drainage is temporary halted to allow for pesticide degradation in the field hill et al 1991 under conventional drainage the amount of tailwater drainage can be as high as 7 6mlha 1 hill et al 2006 and 39 of the total water applied to a field linquist et al 2015 tailwater drainage helps remove salts that accumulate in the field water scardaci et al 2002 thereby preventing the long term accumulation of salt in the soil lekakis et al 2015 recent drought conditions in california have reduced the water available for rice production howitt et al 2015 forcing many growers to reduce the amount of water applied to a field a common method to reduce the water applied to a field is to eliminate the tailwater drainage hereafter referred to as zero drainage while zero drainage can greatly reduce the total water applied to a field it is likely to increase the salinity concentration particularly in bottom basins nevertheless the projected future of decreased water available for rice production in california hill et al 2006 will likely increase the practice of zero drainage this along with an increased reliance on groundwater for irrigation which has a higher salt concentration than surface water grattan 2002 may lead to high salinity in rice fields and reductions in yield crop yield response to salinity is most often displayed using a piecewise linear model ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 maas and hoffman 1977 where the first segment is a tolerance plateau with a slope of zero and the second segment is a concentration dependent line with a negative slope supplementary fig 1 the threshold salinity concentration the concentration beyond which crop yields decline is of utmost concern to both growers and regulators in flooded rice systems a confounding factor is the need to account for both field water salinity i e salinity of the ponded water and soil salinity traditionally field water and soil salinity thresholds for rice have been developed from studies with limited observations over a wide salinity range resulting in large distances between salinity treatments and a large uncertainty in threshold estimates grieve et al 2012 additionally salinity threshold studies occur under steady state conditions whereby salinity stress is kept constant throughout the growing season maas and grattan 1999 conversely field water and soil salinity in commercial rice fields lack temporal uniformity scardaci et al 1996 scardaci et al 2002 and the range of observed salinity concentrations is narrower and lower than in salinity threshold studies the lack of relatedness between field and study conditions and the uncertainty of threshold estimates has led some to question the applicability of current thresholds kijne 2006 shalhevet 1994 especially in rice as yield loss has been reported below the threshold value simmonds et al 2013 these discrepancies have increased the focus on developing thresholds under realistic field conditions kijne 2006 thereby increasing the applicability of threshold estimates elucidating the spatial and temporal salinity dynamics is vital to ameliorate salinity stress in rice fields especially since rice is more sensitive to salinity from tillering to flowering castillo et al 2007 heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 additionally there have been reports of decreased stand establishment in commercial rice fields due to high salinity early in the season scardaci et al 2002 shannon et al 1998 previous studies in commercial fields under conventional drainage have found that water salinity increased in bottom basins of fields scardaci et al 2002 simmonds et al 2013 likely due to evapo concentration simmonds et al 2013 also found water salinity to be higher in areas of the field away from the primary water flow path i e low flow areas results from simmonds et al 2013 and scardaci et al 2002 suggest that location in a field relative to the irrigation inlet and primary water flow path largely determines the field water salinity concentration though it is unclear how applicable these results are in fields under zero drainage a complete understanding of the spatio temporal salinity dynamics in rice fields however is essential to being able to properly manage salinity in rice fields therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 reassess salinity thresholds using commercial rice fields 2 quantify spatial and temporal variation of water and soil salinity in commercial rice fields and 3 develop a model to predict water salinity in fields under zero drainage 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and site descriptions this experiment was carried out in commercial rice fields throughout the upper sacramento valley of california fig 1 during the 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons eleven field sites with zero tailwater drainage or conventional tailwater drainage and a wide range of soil salinity were chosen for this study there were seven field sites in colusa county c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 and c7 two in glenn county g1 and g2 one in butte county b1 and one in yuba county y1 this region has a mediterranean climate characterized by warm dry conditions during the rice growing season the mean air temperature during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons was 22 7 c while the mean precipitation during the growing seasons was 15mm cimis 2016 all field sites have fine textured soils with minimal slope which is typical for rice fields in the region soil taxonomic classifications soil characteristics irrigation practices and variety sown are shown in table 1 field specific pesticide regimens were employed to combat weeds and insect pests 2 2 experimental design each field site contained 9 plots 2m 2m that were split between the top a middle b and bottom c basins fig 2 within each basin three sampling plots were established and numbered 1 2 3 based on their proximity to the primary water flow path plot 1 being closest and plot 3 being farthest from the primary water flow path for basins b and c if water flowed down from both sides of the field then plot 3 was in the middle of the basin as shown in fig 2 if water flowed from only one side of the field then plots in the b and c basins were spaced similar to the a basin all plots were established 15m in from the edge of the field to avoid border effects fig 2 is a representation of the plot design within a field however field sites varied in dimension and number of basins the position of each plot was determined in each field with the position within a field being considered as the combination of the longitudinal distance down the field and the lateral distance across a basin as shown in fig 2 2 3 sampling and measurements after spring land preparation but before fertilizer application and flooding soil samples were taken from each plot at a depth of 0 15cm soils were air dried then ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve for each field site equally weighted portions of the soil samples were mixed to generate a composite field sample from which general field soil property data were determined table 1 soil ph soil texture sodium adsorption ratio and soil organic carbon were determined from the composite field samples using standard methods described in the soil survey laboratory methods manual burt 2014 four types of salinity measurements all based on electrical conductivity ec were made in this study using a calibrated oakton con 450 or an oakton con 400 vernon il usa standardized to 25 c throughout the growing season weekly water salinity measurements were made at the irrigation inlet eciw and at all plot locations ecfw to obtain the measurements the ec probe was carefully lowered into the water and kept submerged until a stable reading was reached soil samples taken from each plot prior to flooding were used to determine the preseason soil salinity ece using the saturated paste technique burt 2014 additionally weekly in season soil solution salinity ecss measurements were made at the same time as ecfw measurements at a1 b2 and c3 plots fig 2 in order to obtain ecss measurements before flooding soil pore water samplers rhizon mom 10cm rhizosphere research products wageningen the netherlands were installed 10cm below the soil surface before obtaining ecss measurements the hose of the pore water sampler was purged by extracting the first 10ml of solution into evacuated vials soil solution was then extracted into evacuated 40ml vials and ecss was measured in situ field water depth measurements were taken at the same locations and at the same time as the ecss measurements upon physiological maturity grain moisture content below 28 yield was quantified at all plot locations a 1 m2 undisturbed representative area within each plot was hand harvested and then a sub sample was oven dried at 70 c until a constant weight was achieved samples were then processed to determine total aboveground biomass and grain yield grain yield was corrected to 14 moisture content 2 4 data analysis r statistical software r core team 2015 was used for data analysis and visualization the following packages were used for data visualization ggplot2 wickham and chang 2016 gtable wickham 2016 maps becker et al 2016 maptools bivand and lewin koh 2016 and raster hijmans 2015 for comparisons of soil and water salinity between the top a1 and bottom c3 of a field a one sample t test was performed results are reported as a percent increase from the top to the bottom basin salinity yield threshold analysis was conducted by determining the convergence point of two linear regression lines seeking to minimize overall deviance to account for potential difference in yield at the field scale a mixed effects modeling approach was employed using the lme4 bates et al 2016 package in this approach field site was a random effect and was allowed to have its own intercept i e yield potential while a water salinity threshold was determined this study was unable to identify a threshold for soil salinity nevertheless the potential effect of soil salinity on yield was assessed using the ece of plot locations above the water salinity threshold the relative importance of soil salinity on yield was evaluated by comparing three mixed effects models 1 3 developed using the lme4 bates et al 2016 package 1 y i j a j b 1 x i j e i j 2 y i j a j b 2 z i j e i j 3 y i j a j b 1 x i j b 2 z i j e i j where yij is the yield at plot i in field j aj is the intercept for field j xij is the water salinity at plot i in field j zij is the soil salinity at plot i in field j b1 is the water salinity coefficient b2 is the soil salinity coefficient and eij is the error term for plot i in field j the relative importance of field water and soil salinity to yield loss was assessed by comparing the akaike s information criterion adjusted for a small sample size aicc marginal r2 values of the models and the significance of the model coefficients the mumin bartoń 2016 package was used to determine aicc values of the models with the lowest aicc value indicating the best model burnham and anderson 2002 the mumin bartoń 2016 package was also used to determine marginal r2 values for the mixed effects models the method used follows the procedure described by nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 where marginal r2 is the proportion of variation explained by the fixed factors the lmertest package kuznetsova et al 2016 was used to determine p values for the mixed effects models as field salinity concentrations varied based on field location and source of irrigation water comparisons of field water salinity among field sites were made relative to the irrigation water salinity during the season the c2 site began receiving water from multiple irrigation inlets and could not be used for this analysis using fields under zero drainage a predictive model for season average relative field water salinity was developed based on a priori knowledge of potential parameters that may influence water salinity position within a field and soil salinity one superior model emerged 4 4 s i j a b 3 w i j b 4 u i j b 5 q i j e i j where sij is the salinity of plot i in field j relative to the salinity of the irrigation water into field j a is the intercept wij is the longitudinal distance down the field from the irrigation inlet for plot i in field j uij is the lateral distance across a basin from the irrigation inlet or basin inlet for plot i in field j qij is the preseason soil salinity of plot i in field j eij is the error term for plot i in field j and b3 b4 and b5 are model coefficients parameters from this season average model were used to develop early and late season models to assess variable contributions throughout the growing season early season is defined as week 1 to week 7 after planting while late season is defined as week 8 to week 15 after planting the relaimpo package groemping and matthias 2013 was used to assess variable contributions to the models this was done by r2 partitioning as done by lindeman et al 1980 model performance was assessed through leave one field out lofo cross validation as employed in other field based agricultural studies pike et al 2009 scudiero et al 2015 stevens et al 2012 using the caret package kuhn 2016 in this lofo cross validation approach a model is developed using data from six of the seven usable fields under zero drainage the model is then used to generate predictions for the seventh field this procedure is repeated seven times so that each field is left out once finally after model validation data from all seven zero drainage fields were used to develop the final models 3 results 3 1 site salinity conditions field average preseason soil salinity ece ranged from 0 29 to 6 25dsm 1 table 1 in general fields with lower preseason soil salinity were under zero drainage while fields with higher preseason soil salinity were under conventional drainage with the exception of c6 which was under zero drainage the irrigation water salinity eciw of fields under zero drainage ranged from 0 08 to 1 38dsm 1 while eciw of fields under conventional drainage ranged from 0 39 to 2 92dsm 1 table 2 fields supplied with groundwater had a higher eciw than fields supplied solely with surface water additionally the eciw of fields supplied with surface water which is under irrigation district control varied largely based on the proportion of recycled water allowed by the irrigation district 3 2 spatial and temporal field water and soil solution salinity dynamics fields differed in size and shape leading to variation in field water salinity ecfw and soil solution salinity ecss build up throughout the field however on average season average ecfw and ecss were 79 and 130 higher respectively in bottom basins compared to the top basins table 3 within a field the maximum observed ecfw tended to occur in the bottom basin between week 2 and week 7 after planting and ranged from 0 36 to 6 06dsm 1 table 2 spikes in ecfw early in the season tended to coincide with low field water depth fig 3 there was no consistent temporal ecss trend among fields data not shown additionally while there was a positive correlation r2 0 40 between season average ecfw and season average ecss fig 4 there is poor correlation when ecss 3dsm 1 3 3 yield results using a mixed effects modeling approach a significant negative correlation was observed between yield and field water salinity above 0 88dsm 1 with a 95 confidence interval of 0 35 1 36dsm 1 fig 5 in contrast the same approach did not result in a significant breakpoint for ecss and ece data not shown potentially due to the nature of the data there was a gap in ece values between 1 88 and 3 88dsm 1 supplementary fig 2 and only three ecss data points per field therefore the effect that soil salinity may have on yield loss was further assessed by comparing models that included and excluded ece and ecfw terms table 4 which helped to determine the importance of the two variables to yield loss the yield model with solely ecfw resulted in a significant regression coefficient of 1971 8kgha 1 per ds m 1 and had a marginal r2 of 0 46 table 4 the yield model with solely ece did not produce a significant regression coefficient and had a marginal r2 of 0 16 the yield model with both ecfw and ece produced a significant regression coefficient for ecfw but not for ece while the marginal r2 was 0 50 additionally the model with only ecfw had a lower aicc value than the models with only ece or with both ecfw and ece 3 4 modeling field water salinity a model was developed that predicts season average ecfw in zero drainage fields based on incoming irrigation water salinity the lateral and longitudinal distance from the inlet and preseason soil salinity with r2 of 0 69 when evaluated against all data and r2 of 0 60 for the lofo cross validation predictions table 5 for the season average water salinity model lateral and longitudinal distance together contributed to 82 of the explained variance in the model while preseason soil salinity contributed 18 table 6 model results for the early season week 1 to week 7 after planting indicate that preseason soil salinity had a larger effect and contributed to 49 of the explained variance in the model while lateral and longitudinal distance contributed to the remaining 51 table 6 in contrast preseason soil salinity did not have a significant effect in the late season week 8 to week 15 after planting table 6 the early season model also performed better than the late season model as the validation r2 for the early season model was 0 68 compared to 0 19 for the late season model table 5 additionally while fields with conventional drainage were not included in the development of the models in the early season model observed relative water salinity of fields with conventional drainage was always lower than the predicted value fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 field water ec is the most sensitive salinity metric for rice yield soil and water salinity are both commonly used to determine whether rice yield may be adversely affected by salinity ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 in this study there were two soil salinity metrics preseason soil salinity ece which came from samples collected at each plot from 0 to 15cm below the soil surface prior to flooding and soil solution salinity ecss which were weekly pore water measurements at 10cm below the soil surface though there was a good correlation r2 0 89 between season average ecss and preseason ece supplementary fig 3 the two soil salinity metrics were employed for different analyses to observe the relationship between soil and field water salinity ecss was used as there were measurements for this metric at the same time and location as ecfw to study the relationship with yield ece was used as there were ece measurements at all plot locations additionally growers are more likely to gather soil samples before the season when the field is dry and this is therefore a more appropriate metric for yield in this study a positive correlation r2 0 40 was observed between season average ecfw and season average ecss fig 4 similarly dickey and nuss 2002 and scardaci et al 2002 found within season correlations of soil and water salinity with r2 values ranging from 0 52 to 0 70 grattan et al 2002 found season average ecfw and postseason ece to correlate with r2 0 88 high correlations between soil and field water salinity led grattan et al 2002 and dickey and nuss 2002 to effectively equate soil salinity averaged from 0 to 15cm below the soil surface with field water salinity the poor correlation between ecfw and ecss observed at ecss values 3dsm 1 fig 4 questions this approach at lower soil salinity concentrations there seems to be good correlation between soil and field water salinity but at higher soil salinity concentrations there is no clear relationship the poor correlation at higher soil salinity necessitates differentiation between soil salinity and field water salinity in flooded rice cropping systems field water salinity correlated better with yield and produced a better model based on aicc values than did preseason soil salinity table 4 furthermore adding preseason soil salinity to the model with field water salinity did not produce a significant regression coefficient for soil salinity worsened the model based on aicc values and did not greatly improve the models predictive capacity these results along with high yields observed under high ece supplementary fig 2 and high ecss supplementary fig 4 suggest that ecfw is the most sensitive index when seeking to predict salinity induced yield loss rice yield responding primarily to water salinity stress may be explained by the morphology of rice roots under flooded culture rice plants develop many surface roots morita and yamazaki 1993 and the rooting depth is partially controlled by environmental conditions yoshida 1981 previous studies have shown that under heterogeneous salinity conditions roots take up water from the least saline areas bazihizina et al 2012 homaee and schmidhalter 2008 it is therefore likely that in fields where soil salinity is much higher than water salinity rice roots preferentially developed and absorbed water from the surface and thereby only exhibited a response to water salinity stress 4 2 threshold concentration of field water salinity is lower than previously reported the effect field water salinity will have on rice yield is a combination of the salt concentration the length of exposure to the stress and the plant susceptibility at that growth stage läuchli and grattan 2007 while it is known that rice is very sensitive to salinity during tillering heenan et al 1988 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 and during reproduction castillo et al 2007 heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 it is not clear which growth stage is most sensitive to salinity nor the relative contribution that salinity stress would have to yield loss if salinity stress occurred during multiple growth stages additionally reductions in stand establishment were not observed in this study therefore water salinity concentrations used for the yield threshold analysis were a season average ecfw developed from weekly field water salinity measurements averaged over the duration of the growing season in which the field was flooded this approach is similar to that taken by others that have contributed to threshold estimates in rice ehrler 1960 grattan et al 2002 narale et al 1969 pearson 1959 venkateswarlu et al 1972 while this study was able to develop a yield threshold for field water salinity the narrow range of season average field water salinity observed 0 10 2 72dsm 1 prevents characterization of crop yield response to very high field water salinity the season average ecfw yield threshold was estimated to be 0 88dsm 1 fig 5 this threshold is well below the previous report of 1 9dsm 1 grattan et al 2002 and this may be due to the different conditions under which values were obtained grattan et al 2002 conducted their study under steady state conditions whereby salinity concentrations remained constant from seeding to maturity in contrast in this study field water salinity varied during the growing season table 2 fig 3 with rice plants experiencing spikes in salinity during tillering a very salt sensitive growth stage heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 this resulted in a lower threshold estimate as the season average salinity concentration incorporates higher field water salinity during a sensitive growth stage and lower field water salinity during less sensitive growth stages ideally growth stage specific salinity thresholds could be developed however this was not feasible in this experiment as the salinity concentrations were not controlled nevertheless the approach taken to establish this threshold estimate addresses a key concern that many have with the traditional threshold slope approach generally salinity studies attempt to characterize the entire range of salinity stress from 0 to 100 yield loss therefore they tend to have too few observations near the threshold value and too many above what is realistic in grower s fields this tends to result in poor definition of the yield threshold van genuchten and hoffman 1984 for the previous 1 9dsm 1 threshold the 95 confidence interval was 0 6 3 2dsm 1 grattan et al 2002 grieve et al 2012 in this study the 95 confidence interval for the 0 88dsm 1 threshold was 0 35 1 36dsm 1 fig 5 the improved definition of this threshold estimate is likely due to this study having more observations near the expected threshold value this along with this study being done under commercial field conditions with realistic seasonal variations in ecfw makes this season average threshold more applicable to commercial rice fields future work should be done to develop salinity thresholds at various growth stages as this could not be achieved in this study 4 3 spatio temporal field water salinity dynamics quantifying the spatial and temporal variation of water salinity in rice fields is the first step towards developing potential management solutions to prevent salinity induced yield loss among all fields consistent spatial water salinity patterns emerged season average ecfw was greater in c3 positions than in a1 positions by an average of 79 table 3 additionally in most field sites the maximum ecfw occurred in the bottom basin and ranged from 0 36 to 6 06dsm 1 table 2 similarly scardaci et al 2002 simmonds et al 2013 and shannon et al 1998 all reported higher water salinity in bottom basins of rice fields it is likely that ecfw increases with increasing distance from the irrigation inlet due to evapo concentration of salts in the field water and the subsequent movement of that salt concentrated water down the field a consistent temporal water salinity pattern also emerged relative ecfw is higher early in the season fig 3 fig 6 and ecfw maxima generally occurred from week 2 to week 7 after planting table 2 this is similar to results reported by scardaci et al 2002 the rise in ecfw early in the season is likely due to two factors first low canopy cover during this period allows for high rates of evaporation from the water surface thereby concentrating salts in the field water second it is common for growers to allow field water to subside early in the season for the application of foliar herbicides university of california cooperative extension 2015 as the field water subsides the surface area to volume ratio of the field water increases such that evapo concentration increases in this study low water depths during this period coincided with higher water salinity fig 3 4 4 modeling field water salinity consistent spatial trends of water salinity among fields allowed for the development of a model capable of predicting season average water salinity throughout a rice field under zero drainage fig 6 table 6 position within a field which is a combination of the longitudinal distance and lateral distance from the irrigation inlet accounted for 82 of the explained variation in the model this result indicates the importance that distance and in effect field size has on water salinity build up within flooded rice fields for the same irrigation water and soil salinity larger fields are at greater risk of having field water salinity increase to yield reducing concentrations the other factor influencing water salinity build up within a field was the preseason soil salinity soil salinity had a significant effect on water salinity build up early in the season contributed to 49 of the explained variance in the early season model table 6 furthermore among all field sites the higher ecfw maxima occurred in sites with high ece table 2 these results may be explained by considering vertical water and solute movement in flooded rice fields rice fields in the region tend to have low rates of percolation during the growing season linquist et al 2015 this along with low transpiration rates early in the growing season results in low advective flow downward studies by bachand et al 2014a b show upward diffusion of solutes in flooded rice fields occurs during periods of minimal transpiration and that the rate of diffusion is dictated by concentration gradients therefore it is likely that in fields with high soil salinity salts were diffusing upward into the field water early in the growing season contributing to greater observed field water salinity temporal differences are also evident from these models the early season model had a substantially higher validation r2 0 68 compared to the late season model 0 19 fig 6 this is due to model parameters having less influence later in the growing season salts from the soil are less likely to diffuse upward later in the season when transpiration is high and there is high advective flow downward additionally low evaporation later in the growing season due to canopy cover and a higher water depth decreases the influence that the spatial position within a field i e longitudinal and lateral distance has on water salinity build up within a field these models also allow comparisons to be made between zero drainage and conventional drainage fields while the sample size for comparison was limited only 3 fields under conventional drainage there is evidence suggesting tailwater drainage reduces field water salinity during the early season water salinity in fields under conventional drainage was overestimated fig 6 indicating that tailwater drainage early in the season reduces field water salinity this is similar to results reported by scardaci et al 2002 tailwater drainage helps remove dissolved salts that accumulate in field water the tailwater drainage early in the season in fields under conventional drainage thus resulted in reduced water salinity in those fields these modeling results highlight the ability to sufficiently predict water salinity in rice fields with a few simple parameters this study did not consider flow rates slope of the field or climatic effects these factors could have an important contribution to explaining water salinity in a field and may have improved model estimates however it is shown that with relatively few factors field water salinity can be reasonably well predicted which facilitates application of these results for use by growers 4 5 management implications this study has several important implications for managing water to control salinity in rice fields first in fields with low soil and irrigation water salinity practicing zero drainage is a viable strategy to reduce water usage without harming yield seven of the eight field sites studied under zero drainage had low soil and irrigation water salinity and in those sites the field average ecfw did not increase beyond the 0 88dsm 1 salinity threshold table 2 in the long term however zero drainage may result in secondary soil salinization if amelioration efforts are not employed one way to reduce the potential long term soil salinity build up is through winter flooding a common practice in california to aid in rice straw decomposition linquist et al 2006 winter flooding can bring up and export solutes that have built up during the growing season bachand et al 2014a the degree to which winter flooding can reduce salt concentrations in rice fields under long term zero drainage management merits further investigation second in fields with either high soil or irrigation water salinity maintaining a higher water depth and allowing for tailwater drainage early in the season will help reduce field water salinity the highest field water salinity occurred early in the growing season table 2 fig 3 when rice is sensitive to salinity heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 in these high salinity fields salt flow from the soil to the field water and high rates of evapo concentration may increase field water salinity to yield reducing concentrations increasing water depth during this period allows for dilution of dissolved salts additionally allowing tailwater drainage during this period may also help reduce field water salinity fig 6 these practices however may not be feasible with many pesticide regimes commonly employed in california as contact herbicides require low water depth to ensure proper coverage and water holding periods imposed after pesticide applications prevents tailwater drainage lastly in most fields studied season average field water salinity reached concentrations that were 50 greater than the irrigation water salinity fig 6 therefore to avoid season average field water salinity increasing beyond the 0 88dsm 1 threshold in the bottom of an average sized field 35ha in this study it is recommended to maintain irrigation water salinity below 0 6dsm 1 this criterion for irrigation water salinity is similar to the 0 75dsm 1 reported by finfrock et al 1960 to maintain irrigation water salinity below 0 6dsm 1 the use of groundwater as an irrigation source should be minimized and irrigation districts should carefully portion the amount of high salinity recycled water allowed in the supplied surface water furthermore as increases in water salinity within a field are largely a function of distance from the irrigation inlet in areas with high soil or irrigation water salinity smaller fields and multiple irrigation inlets should be considered acknowledgements we would like to thank the california rice research board for providing funding for this study furthermore we would

11610,the scarcity of high quality irrigation water is a global issue facing rice growers forcing many to adopt water management systems that may result in increased salinity and yield reductions while salt concentrations in field water have been shown to vary depending on water management the distribution and build up patterns of dissolved salts are unclear this study was conducted to

variation explained by the model while preseason soil salinity contributed to 18 importantly field water salinity was determined to be the most sensitive salinity metric for rice yield as preseason soil salinity was a poor predictor of yield loss the threshold field water salinity concentration was estimated at 0 88dsm 1 lower than the previous report of 1 9dsm 1 these results illustrate the ability to predict water salinity in a rice field with few parameters while highlighting the importance of field water salinity as the main salinity metric for rice cropping systems keywords salinity dynamics rice yield threshold water quality modeling irrigation water quality 1 introduction high quality water available for irrigated agriculture is currently scarce and is expected to become less available due to climate change and population growth hanak and lund 2012 fraiture and wichelns 2010 mirchi et al 2013 schewe et al 2014 wallace 2000 this will result in increased use of marginal water and decreased drainage thereby resulting in increased secondary salinization connor et al 2012 molden et al 2010 rice a globally important staple crop is the most salt sensitive cereal grieve et al 2012 munns and tester 2008 additionally when grown under irrigation rice requires two to three times more water input than other cereals bouman et al 2007 kijne 2006 the current and projected decline in the quantity and quality of water for rice production prompts the need to investigate salinity in rice cropping systems to avoid yield reductions in california rice is the top agricultural water user based on application rate per hectare usda 2013 rice fields in california which are typically divided into several hydrologically connected basins are continuously flooded throughout the growing season with irrigation water entering the topmost basin and cascading through to the bottommost basin the primary water management system in california is a conventional flow through system hereafter referred to as conventional drainage under conventional drainage tailwater discharges to a drainage ditch for much of the growing season the exception being during water holding periods after pesticide applications whereby tailwater drainage is temporary halted to allow for pesticide degradation in the field hill et al 1991 under conventional drainage the amount of tailwater drainage can be as high as 7 6mlha 1 hill et al 2006 and 39 of the total water applied to a field linquist et al 2015 tailwater drainage helps remove salts that accumulate in the field water scardaci et al 2002 thereby preventing the long term accumulation of salt in the soil lekakis et al 2015 recent drought conditions in california have reduced the water available for rice production howitt et al 2015 forcing many growers to reduce the amount of water applied to a field a common method to reduce the water applied to a field is to eliminate the tailwater drainage hereafter referred to as zero drainage while zero drainage can greatly reduce the total water applied to a field it is likely to increase the salinity concentration particularly in bottom basins nevertheless the projected future of decreased water available for rice production in california hill et al 2006 will likely increase the practice of zero drainage this along with an increased reliance on groundwater for irrigation which has a higher salt concentration than surface water grattan 2002 may lead to high salinity in rice fields and reductions in yield crop yield response to salinity is most often displayed using a piecewise linear model ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 maas and hoffman 1977 where the first segment is a tolerance plateau with a slope of zero and the second segment is a concentration dependent line with a negative slope supplementary fig 1 the threshold salinity concentration the concentration beyond which crop yields decline is of utmost concern to both growers and regulators in flooded rice systems a confounding factor is the need to account for both field water salinity i e salinity of the ponded water and soil salinity traditionally field water and soil salinity thresholds for rice have been developed from studies with limited observations over a wide salinity range resulting in large distances between salinity treatments and a large uncertainty in threshold estimates grieve et al 2012 additionally salinity threshold studies occur under steady state conditions whereby salinity stress is kept constant throughout the growing season maas and grattan 1999 conversely field water and soil salinity in commercial rice fields lack temporal uniformity scardaci et al 1996 scardaci et al 2002 and the range of observed salinity concentrations is narrower and lower than in salinity threshold studies the lack of relatedness between field and study conditions and the uncertainty of threshold estimates has led some to question the applicability of current thresholds kijne 2006 shalhevet 1994 especially in rice as yield loss has been reported below the threshold value simmonds et al 2013 these discrepancies have increased the focus on developing thresholds under realistic field conditions kijne 2006 thereby increasing the applicability of threshold estimates elucidating the spatial and temporal salinity dynamics is vital to ameliorate salinity stress in rice fields especially since rice is more sensitive to salinity from tillering to flowering castillo et al 2007 heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 additionally there have been reports of decreased stand establishment in commercial rice fields due to high salinity early in the season scardaci et al 2002 shannon et al 1998 previous studies in commercial fields under conventional drainage have found that water salinity increased in bottom basins of fields scardaci et al 2002 simmonds et al 2013 likely due to evapo concentration simmonds et al 2013 also found water salinity to be higher in areas of the field away from the primary water flow path i e low flow areas results from simmonds et al 2013 and scardaci et al 2002 suggest that location in a field relative to the irrigation inlet and primary water flow path largely determines the field water salinity concentration though it is unclear how applicable these results are in fields under zero drainage a complete understanding of the spatio temporal salinity dynamics in rice fields however is essential to being able to properly manage salinity in rice fields therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 reassess salinity thresholds using commercial rice fields 2 quantify spatial and temporal variation of water and soil salinity in commercial rice fields and 3 develop a model to predict water salinity in fields under zero drainage 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and site descriptions this experiment was carried out in commercial rice fields throughout the upper sacramento valley of california fig 1 during the 2014 and 2015 rice growing seasons eleven field sites with zero tailwater drainage or conventional tailwater drainage and a wide range of soil salinity were chosen for this study there were seven field sites in colusa county c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 and c7 two in glenn county g1 and g2 one in butte county b1 and one in yuba county y1 this region has a mediterranean climate characterized by warm dry conditions during the rice growing season the mean air temperature during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons was 22 7 c while the mean precipitation during the growing seasons was 15mm cimis 2016 all field sites have fine textured soils with minimal slope which is typical for rice fields in the region soil taxonomic classifications soil characteristics irrigation practices and variety sown are shown in table 1 field specific pesticide regimens were employed to combat weeds and insect pests 2 2 experimental design each field site contained 9 plots 2m 2m that were split between the top a middle b and bottom c basins fig 2 within each basin three sampling plots were established and numbered 1 2 3 based on their proximity to the primary water flow path plot 1 being closest and plot 3 being farthest from the primary water flow path for basins b and c if water flowed down from both sides of the field then plot 3 was in the middle of the basin as shown in fig 2 if water flowed from only one side of the field then plots in the b and c basins were spaced similar to the a basin all plots were established 15m in from the edge of the field to avoid border effects fig 2 is a representation of the plot design within a field however field sites varied in dimension and number of basins the position of each plot was determined in each field with the position within a field being considered as the combination of the longitudinal distance down the field and the lateral distance across a basin as shown in fig 2 2 3 sampling and measurements after spring land preparation but before fertilizer application and flooding soil samples were taken from each plot at a depth of 0 15cm soils were air dried then ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve for each field site equally weighted portions of the soil samples were mixed to generate a composite field sample from which general field soil property data were determined table 1 soil ph soil texture sodium adsorption ratio and soil organic carbon were determined from the composite field samples using standard methods described in the soil survey laboratory methods manual burt 2014 four types of salinity measurements all based on electrical conductivity ec were made in this study using a calibrated oakton con 450 or an oakton con 400 vernon il usa standardized to 25 c throughout the growing season weekly water salinity measurements were made at the irrigation inlet eciw and at all plot locations ecfw to obtain the measurements the ec probe was carefully lowered into the water and kept submerged until a stable reading was reached soil samples taken from each plot prior to flooding were used to determine the preseason soil salinity ece using the saturated paste technique burt 2014 additionally weekly in season soil solution salinity ecss measurements were made at the same time as ecfw measurements at a1 b2 and c3 plots fig 2 in order to obtain ecss measurements before flooding soil pore water samplers rhizon mom 10cm rhizosphere research products wageningen the netherlands were installed 10cm below the soil surface before obtaining ecss measurements the hose of the pore water sampler was purged by extracting the first 10ml of solution into evacuated vials soil solution was then extracted into evacuated 40ml vials and ecss was measured in situ field water depth measurements were taken at the same locations and at the same time as the ecss measurements upon physiological maturity grain moisture content below 28 yield was quantified at all plot locations a 1 m2 undisturbed representative area within each plot was hand harvested and then a sub sample was oven dried at 70 c until a constant weight was achieved samples were then processed to determine total aboveground biomass and grain yield grain yield was corrected to 14 moisture content 2 4 data analysis r statistical software r core team 2015 was used for data analysis and visualization the following packages were used for data visualization ggplot2 wickham and chang 2016 gtable wickham 2016 maps becker et al 2016 maptools bivand and lewin koh 2016 and raster hijmans 2015 for comparisons of soil and water salinity between the top a1 and bottom c3 of a field a one sample t test was performed results are reported as a percent increase from the top to the bottom basin salinity yield threshold analysis was conducted by determining the convergence point of two linear regression lines seeking to minimize overall deviance to account for potential difference in yield at the field scale a mixed effects modeling approach was employed using the lme4 bates et al 2016 package in this approach field site was a random effect and was allowed to have its own intercept i e yield potential while a water salinity threshold was determined this study was unable to identify a threshold for soil salinity nevertheless the potential effect of soil salinity on yield was assessed using the ece of plot locations above the water salinity threshold the relative importance of soil salinity on yield was evaluated by comparing three mixed effects models 1 3 developed using the lme4 bates et al 2016 package 1 y i j a j b 1 x i j e i j 2 y i j a j b 2 z i j e i j 3 y i j a j b 1 x i j b 2 z i j e i j where yij is the yield at plot i in field j aj is the intercept for field j xij is the water salinity at plot i in field j zij is the soil salinity at plot i in field j b1 is the water salinity coefficient b2 is the soil salinity coefficient and eij is the error term for plot i in field j the relative importance of field water and soil salinity to yield loss was assessed by comparing the akaike s information criterion adjusted for a small sample size aicc marginal r2 values of the models and the significance of the model coefficients the mumin bartoń 2016 package was used to determine aicc values of the models with the lowest aicc value indicating the best model burnham and anderson 2002 the mumin bartoń 2016 package was also used to determine marginal r2 values for the mixed effects models the method used follows the procedure described by nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 where marginal r2 is the proportion of variation explained by the fixed factors the lmertest package kuznetsova et al 2016 was used to determine p values for the mixed effects models as field salinity concentrations varied based on field location and source of irrigation water comparisons of field water salinity among field sites were made relative to the irrigation water salinity during the season the c2 site began receiving water from multiple irrigation inlets and could not be used for this analysis using fields under zero drainage a predictive model for season average relative field water salinity was developed based on a priori knowledge of potential parameters that may influence water salinity position within a field and soil salinity one superior model emerged 4 4 s i j a b 3 w i j b 4 u i j b 5 q i j e i j where sij is the salinity of plot i in field j relative to the salinity of the irrigation water into field j a is the intercept wij is the longitudinal distance down the field from the irrigation inlet for plot i in field j uij is the lateral distance across a basin from the irrigation inlet or basin inlet for plot i in field j qij is the preseason soil salinity of plot i in field j eij is the error term for plot i in field j and b3 b4 and b5 are model coefficients parameters from this season average model were used to develop early and late season models to assess variable contributions throughout the growing season early season is defined as week 1 to week 7 after planting while late season is defined as week 8 to week 15 after planting the relaimpo package groemping and matthias 2013 was used to assess variable contributions to the models this was done by r2 partitioning as done by lindeman et al 1980 model performance was assessed through leave one field out lofo cross validation as employed in other field based agricultural studies pike et al 2009 scudiero et al 2015 stevens et al 2012 using the caret package kuhn 2016 in this lofo cross validation approach a model is developed using data from six of the seven usable fields under zero drainage the model is then used to generate predictions for the seventh field this procedure is repeated seven times so that each field is left out once finally after model validation data from all seven zero drainage fields were used to develop the final models 3 results 3 1 site salinity conditions field average preseason soil salinity ece ranged from 0 29 to 6 25dsm 1 table 1 in general fields with lower preseason soil salinity were under zero drainage while fields with higher preseason soil salinity were under conventional drainage with the exception of c6 which was under zero drainage the irrigation water salinity eciw of fields under zero drainage ranged from 0 08 to 1 38dsm 1 while eciw of fields under conventional drainage ranged from 0 39 to 2 92dsm 1 table 2 fields supplied with groundwater had a higher eciw than fields supplied solely with surface water additionally the eciw of fields supplied with surface water which is under irrigation district control varied largely based on the proportion of recycled water allowed by the irrigation district 3 2 spatial and temporal field water and soil solution salinity dynamics fields differed in size and shape leading to variation in field water salinity ecfw and soil solution salinity ecss build up throughout the field however on average season average ecfw and ecss were 79 and 130 higher respectively in bottom basins compared to the top basins table 3 within a field the maximum observed ecfw tended to occur in the bottom basin between week 2 and week 7 after planting and ranged from 0 36 to 6 06dsm 1 table 2 spikes in ecfw early in the season tended to coincide with low field water depth fig 3 there was no consistent temporal ecss trend among fields data not shown additionally while there was a positive correlation r2 0 40 between season average ecfw and season average ecss fig 4 there is poor correlation when ecss 3dsm 1 3 3 yield results using a mixed effects modeling approach a significant negative correlation was observed between yield and field water salinity above 0 88dsm 1 with a 95 confidence interval of 0 35 1 36dsm 1 fig 5 in contrast the same approach did not result in a significant breakpoint for ecss and ece data not shown potentially due to the nature of the data there was a gap in ece values between 1 88 and 3 88dsm 1 supplementary fig 2 and only three ecss data points per field therefore the effect that soil salinity may have on yield loss was further assessed by comparing models that included and excluded ece and ecfw terms table 4 which helped to determine the importance of the two variables to yield loss the yield model with solely ecfw resulted in a significant regression coefficient of 1971 8kgha 1 per ds m 1 and had a marginal r2 of 0 46 table 4 the yield model with solely ece did not produce a significant regression coefficient and had a marginal r2 of 0 16 the yield model with both ecfw and ece produced a significant regression coefficient for ecfw but not for ece while the marginal r2 was 0 50 additionally the model with only ecfw had a lower aicc value than the models with only ece or with both ecfw and ece 3 4 modeling field water salinity a model was developed that predicts season average ecfw in zero drainage fields based on incoming irrigation water salinity the lateral and longitudinal distance from the inlet and preseason soil salinity with r2 of 0 69 when evaluated against all data and r2 of 0 60 for the lofo cross validation predictions table 5 for the season average water salinity model lateral and longitudinal distance together contributed to 82 of the explained variance in the model while preseason soil salinity contributed 18 table 6 model results for the early season week 1 to week 7 after planting indicate that preseason soil salinity had a larger effect and contributed to 49 of the explained variance in the model while lateral and longitudinal distance contributed to the remaining 51 table 6 in contrast preseason soil salinity did not have a significant effect in the late season week 8 to week 15 after planting table 6 the early season model also performed better than the late season model as the validation r2 for the early season model was 0 68 compared to 0 19 for the late season model table 5 additionally while fields with conventional drainage were not included in the development of the models in the early season model observed relative water salinity of fields with conventional drainage was always lower than the predicted value fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 field water ec is the most sensitive salinity metric for rice yield soil and water salinity are both commonly used to determine whether rice yield may be adversely affected by salinity ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 in this study there were two soil salinity metrics preseason soil salinity ece which came from samples collected at each plot from 0 to 15cm below the soil surface prior to flooding and soil solution salinity ecss which were weekly pore water measurements at 10cm below the soil surface though there was a good correlation r2 0 89 between season average ecss and preseason ece supplementary fig 3 the two soil salinity metrics were employed for different analyses to observe the relationship between soil and field water salinity ecss was used as there were measurements for this metric at the same time and location as ecfw to study the relationship with yield ece was used as there were ece measurements at all plot locations additionally growers are more likely to gather soil samples before the season when the field is dry and this is therefore a more appropriate metric for yield in this study a positive correlation r2 0 40 was observed between season average ecfw and season average ecss fig 4 similarly dickey and nuss 2002 and scardaci et al 2002 found within season correlations of soil and water salinity with r2 values ranging from 0 52 to 0 70 grattan et al 2002 found season average ecfw and postseason ece to correlate with r2 0 88 high correlations between soil and field water salinity led grattan et al 2002 and dickey and nuss 2002 to effectively equate soil salinity averaged from 0 to 15cm below the soil surface with field water salinity the poor correlation between ecfw and ecss observed at ecss values 3dsm 1 fig 4 questions this approach at lower soil salinity concentrations there seems to be good correlation between soil and field water salinity but at higher soil salinity concentrations there is no clear relationship the poor correlation at higher soil salinity necessitates differentiation between soil salinity and field water salinity in flooded rice cropping systems field water salinity correlated better with yield and produced a better model based on aicc values than did preseason soil salinity table 4 furthermore adding preseason soil salinity to the model with field water salinity did not produce a significant regression coefficient for soil salinity worsened the model based on aicc values and did not greatly improve the models predictive capacity these results along with high yields observed under high ece supplementary fig 2 and high ecss supplementary fig 4 suggest that ecfw is the most sensitive index when seeking to predict salinity induced yield loss rice yield responding primarily to water salinity stress may be explained by the morphology of rice roots under flooded culture rice plants develop many surface roots morita and yamazaki 1993 and the rooting depth is partially controlled by environmental conditions yoshida 1981 previous studies have shown that under heterogeneous salinity conditions roots take up water from the least saline areas bazihizina et al 2012 homaee and schmidhalter 2008 it is therefore likely that in fields where soil salinity is much higher than water salinity rice roots preferentially developed and absorbed water from the surface and thereby only exhibited a response to water salinity stress 4 2 threshold concentration of field water salinity is lower than previously reported the effect field water salinity will have on rice yield is a combination of the salt concentration the length of exposure to the stress and the plant susceptibility at that growth stage läuchli and grattan 2007 while it is known that rice is very sensitive to salinity during tillering heenan et al 1988 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 and during reproduction castillo et al 2007 heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 it is not clear which growth stage is most sensitive to salinity nor the relative contribution that salinity stress would have to yield loss if salinity stress occurred during multiple growth stages additionally reductions in stand establishment were not observed in this study therefore water salinity concentrations used for the yield threshold analysis were a season average ecfw developed from weekly field water salinity measurements averaged over the duration of the growing season in which the field was flooded this approach is similar to that taken by others that have contributed to threshold estimates in rice ehrler 1960 grattan et al 2002 narale et al 1969 pearson 1959 venkateswarlu et al 1972 while this study was able to develop a yield threshold for field water salinity the narrow range of season average field water salinity observed 0 10 2 72dsm 1 prevents characterization of crop yield response to very high field water salinity the season average ecfw yield threshold was estimated to be 0 88dsm 1 fig 5 this threshold is well below the previous report of 1 9dsm 1 grattan et al 2002 and this may be due to the different conditions under which values were obtained grattan et al 2002 conducted their study under steady state conditions whereby salinity concentrations remained constant from seeding to maturity in contrast in this study field water salinity varied during the growing season table 2 fig 3 with rice plants experiencing spikes in salinity during tillering a very salt sensitive growth stage heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 this resulted in a lower threshold estimate as the season average salinity concentration incorporates higher field water salinity during a sensitive growth stage and lower field water salinity during less sensitive growth stages ideally growth stage specific salinity thresholds could be developed however this was not feasible in this experiment as the salinity concentrations were not controlled nevertheless the approach taken to establish this threshold estimate addresses a key concern that many have with the traditional threshold slope approach generally salinity studies attempt to characterize the entire range of salinity stress from 0 to 100 yield loss therefore they tend to have too few observations near the threshold value and too many above what is realistic in grower s fields this tends to result in poor definition of the yield threshold van genuchten and hoffman 1984 for the previous 1 9dsm 1 threshold the 95 confidence interval was 0 6 3 2dsm 1 grattan et al 2002 grieve et al 2012 in this study the 95 confidence interval for the 0 88dsm 1 threshold was 0 35 1 36dsm 1 fig 5 the improved definition of this threshold estimate is likely due to this study having more observations near the expected threshold value this along with this study being done under commercial field conditions with realistic seasonal variations in ecfw makes this season average threshold more applicable to commercial rice fields future work should be done to develop salinity thresholds at various growth stages as this could not be achieved in this study 4 3 spatio temporal field water salinity dynamics quantifying the spatial and temporal variation of water salinity in rice fields is the first step towards developing potential management solutions to prevent salinity induced yield loss among all fields consistent spatial water salinity patterns emerged season average ecfw was greater in c3 positions than in a1 positions by an average of 79 table 3 additionally in most field sites the maximum ecfw occurred in the bottom basin and ranged from 0 36 to 6 06dsm 1 table 2 similarly scardaci et al 2002 simmonds et al 2013 and shannon et al 1998 all reported higher water salinity in bottom basins of rice fields it is likely that ecfw increases with increasing distance from the irrigation inlet due to evapo concentration of salts in the field water and the subsequent movement of that salt concentrated water down the field a consistent temporal water salinity pattern also emerged relative ecfw is higher early in the season fig 3 fig 6 and ecfw maxima generally occurred from week 2 to week 7 after planting table 2 this is similar to results reported by scardaci et al 2002 the rise in ecfw early in the season is likely due to two factors first low canopy cover during this period allows for high rates of evaporation from the water surface thereby concentrating salts in the field water second it is common for growers to allow field water to subside early in the season for the application of foliar herbicides university of california cooperative extension 2015 as the field water subsides the surface area to volume ratio of the field water increases such that evapo concentration increases in this study low water depths during this period coincided with higher water salinity fig 3 4 4 modeling field water salinity consistent spatial trends of water salinity among fields allowed for the development of a model capable of predicting season average water salinity throughout a rice field under zero drainage fig 6 table 6 position within a field which is a combination of the longitudinal distance and lateral distance from the irrigation inlet accounted for 82 of the explained variation in the model this result indicates the importance that distance and in effect field size has on water salinity build up within flooded rice fields for the same irrigation water and soil salinity larger fields are at greater risk of having field water salinity increase to yield reducing concentrations the other factor influencing water salinity build up within a field was the preseason soil salinity soil salinity had a significant effect on water salinity build up early in the season contributed to 49 of the explained variance in the early season model table 6 furthermore among all field sites the higher ecfw maxima occurred in sites with high ece table 2 these results may be explained by considering vertical water and solute movement in flooded rice fields rice fields in the region tend to have low rates of percolation during the growing season linquist et al 2015 this along with low transpiration rates early in the growing season results in low advective flow downward studies by bachand et al 2014a b show upward diffusion of solutes in flooded rice fields occurs during periods of minimal transpiration and that the rate of diffusion is dictated by concentration gradients therefore it is likely that in fields with high soil salinity salts were diffusing upward into the field water early in the growing season contributing to greater observed field water salinity temporal differences are also evident from these models the early season model had a substantially higher validation r2 0 68 compared to the late season model 0 19 fig 6 this is due to model parameters having less influence later in the growing season salts from the soil are less likely to diffuse upward later in the season when transpiration is high and there is high advective flow downward additionally low evaporation later in the growing season due to canopy cover and a higher water depth decreases the influence that the spatial position within a field i e longitudinal and lateral distance has on water salinity build up within a field these models also allow comparisons to be made between zero drainage and conventional drainage fields while the sample size for comparison was limited only 3 fields under conventional drainage there is evidence suggesting tailwater drainage reduces field water salinity during the early season water salinity in fields under conventional drainage was overestimated fig 6 indicating that tailwater drainage early in the season reduces field water salinity this is similar to results reported by scardaci et al 2002 tailwater drainage helps remove dissolved salts that accumulate in field water the tailwater drainage early in the season in fields under conventional drainage thus resulted in reduced water salinity in those fields these modeling results highlight the ability to sufficiently predict water salinity in rice fields with a few simple parameters this study did not consider flow rates slope of the field or climatic effects these factors could have an important contribution to explaining water salinity in a field and may have improved model estimates however it is shown that with relatively few factors field water salinity can be reasonably well predicted which facilitates application of these results for use by growers 4 5 management implications this study has several important implications for managing water to control salinity in rice fields first in fields with low soil and irrigation water salinity practicing zero drainage is a viable strategy to reduce water usage without harming yield seven of the eight field sites studied under zero drainage had low soil and irrigation water salinity and in those sites the field average ecfw did not increase beyond the 0 88dsm 1 salinity threshold table 2 in the long term however zero drainage may result in secondary soil salinization if amelioration efforts are not employed one way to reduce the potential long term soil salinity build up is through winter flooding a common practice in california to aid in rice straw decomposition linquist et al 2006 winter flooding can bring up and export solutes that have built up during the growing season bachand et al 2014a the degree to which winter flooding can reduce salt concentrations in rice fields under long term zero drainage management merits further investigation second in fields with either high soil or irrigation water salinity maintaining a higher water depth and allowing for tailwater drainage early in the season will help reduce field water salinity the highest field water salinity occurred early in the growing season table 2 fig 3 when rice is sensitive to salinity heenan et al 1988 fraga et al 2010 pearson and bernstein 1959 zeng et al 2001 in these high salinity fields salt flow from the soil to the field water and high rates of evapo concentration may increase field water salinity to yield reducing concentrations increasing water depth during this period allows for dilution of dissolved salts additionally allowing tailwater drainage during this period may also help reduce field water salinity fig 6 these practices however may not be feasible with many pesticide regimes commonly employed in california as contact herbicides require low water depth to ensure proper coverage and water holding periods imposed after pesticide applications prevents tailwater drainage lastly in most fields studied season average field water salinity reached concentrations that were 50 greater than the irrigation water salinity fig 6 therefore to avoid season average field water salinity increasing beyond the 0 88dsm 1 threshold in the bottom of an average sized field 35ha in this study it is recommended to maintain irrigation water salinity below 0 6dsm 1 this criterion for irrigation water salinity is similar to the 0 75dsm 1 reported by finfrock et al 1960 to maintain irrigation water salinity below 0 6dsm 1 the use of groundwater as an irrigation source should be minimized and irrigation districts should carefully portion the amount of high salinity recycled water allowed in the supplied surface water furthermore as increases in water salinity within a field are largely a function of distance from the irrigation inlet in areas with high soil or irrigation water salinity

11611,rice cultivation is globally hampered by several conditions which urge farmers to maintain adequate production levels while properly managing irrigation water this has noticeable repercussions on the efficient use of the resource and on water productivity nonetheless more often this latter topic is addressed by estimating the respective values without deeply investigating the possible causes behind such discrepancies the main objective of this paper is to overcome such limitations by i providing a comprehensive and updated overview of irrigation water productivity iwp for rice and ii exploring the role of irrigation water in determining iwp value the analysis of experimental data collected from 51 studies reveals iwp to vary between 0 09 and 8 10kgm 3 with mean and median values of 1 36 and 0 85kgm 3 respectively moreover a non linear relationship between irrigation water amounts and iwp r2 0 81 is depicted further on data are analyzed using an econometric approach specifically a multivariate linear regression model is used to shed light on the joint contribution of water inputs regime and irrigation method to productivity this demonstrates the significant roles of irrigation β 1 006 and rainfall β 0 062 amounts while aerobic regime and irrigation method is proved to be a further key driver β 0 305 such results enable identifying the elements to be enforced if increasing iwp for rice is the prime objective finally some implications are derived for water policy and the connections with weather climatic and environmental conditions that are globally affecting the availability of water in agriculture keywords irrigation water productivity rice water management options multivariate regression 1 introduction with more than 162 million hectares cultivated worldwide faostat 2014 rice is one of the leading food crops and rice farming a strategic activity for several countries rice based farming systems are particularly relevant for the rural poor in asia latin america and africa where agriculture has a prominent subsistence role there it contributes in ensuring food sustenance mancosu et al 2015 fostering local development and economic livelihood for farmers fao 2004 preventing social unrest driven by volatility of commodity prices irri 2013 in many parts of the world rice farming is characterized by a marked specialization which makes the relevant sector highly competitive and profitable in this case most of the final product is oriented to global markets and commercialized via international trade in these areas the economic importance of the sector can be substantial so as its contribution to the economic viability furthermore rice cultivation provides many ecosystem services matsuno et al 2006 used as evidences of the advisability to preserve the activity amongst others the environmental value of submerged paddy fields yoon 2009 the creation of wetland habitats and protected areas natuhara 2013 the aesthetic quality of traditional landscapes jung and ryu 2015 at the same time manifold conditions globally hamper the rice sector affecting both production and competitiveness of rice farming for instance the volatility of paddy rice prices fao 2016 may not compensate for production costs ferrero and nguyen 2004 while in some countries where rice is a heavily protected good it often faces smuggling problems golub 2012 however major concerns are mostly related to water resource both in terms of quantity and quality in the first instance they arise as a problem of water availability shortcomings due to climate induced effects olesen et al 2011 have determined the occurrence of hot spots of water scarcity in several areas bouman et al 2007 further exacerbated by recurring and intensive droughts events this preponderantly influences the possibility of an adequate resource allocation amongst sectors elliot et al 2014 users and even crops within the same production pattern bischetti et al 2014 in addition even if not quantitatively limited irrigation water may suffer from a deteriorated quality soil salinization and resource pollution in general may lead to a lower usability and a scarcer rice production clermont dauphin et al 2010 isquierdo fraga et al 2010 this array of conditions urges rice farming to maintain adequate production levels while properly managing production factors consequently an optimal and rational use of the resource becomes a prime objective possibly encouraged and sustained by water policies operating at regional or supra national level e g european water framework directive from this point of view the adoption of water saving techniques is increasingly stimulated to mitigate the effects of climate change or to release water that would allow expanding cultivated areas crop yield tends to be proportionally affected by the amount of irrigation water received maeda et al 2011 and farmers decisions should properly balance between yield and resource use monaco et al 2016 in this perspective several authors rely on the concept of water productivity molden 1997 to assess the success of different cultivation practices e g brauman et al 2013 lenton 2013 molden et al 2010 though the productivity based approach simplifies real conditions and doesn t embark a large set of stochastic events risks and random shocks beyond farmers control additionally it fails in providing adequate information about the use of resources for these reasons water productivity as a sole indicator conveys too limited information and does not allow to deduce helpful insights on the efficient rational optimal use of irrigation water seckler et al 2003 quoting from wichelns 2015 likewise estimations of productivity and yields over time and locations inadequately indicate desirable changes either in water management practices or in production results the author also recognizes that most of the studies only estimate water productivity without discussing the plausible causes behind the observed discrepancies amongst values according to a fao survey fao 2003 water productivity in agriculture strongly augmented in the period 1961 2001 mostly thanks to yield increase in rice farming this is even exacerbated in recent times by the time the sector has been experiencing the introduction of short cycle high yielding cultivars and ameliorated varieties e g clément and louvel 2013 suitable for the cultivation under limited water supplies the more crop per drop paradigm kijne et al 2003 may benefit from such innovations ben hassen et al 2016 which contribute to stabilize or increase grain yield on the other hand zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 ascribe variability of water productivity also to climate conditions indeed irrigation water productivity for rice was estimated during both the rainy season e g sarkar et al 2002 pandey et al 1989 islam et al 1986 and summer e g uppal et al 1991 hassan et al 1989 marimuthu and lulandaivelu 1987 islam et al 1986 it must also be recognized that irrigation water management is a further source of variability but scarce evidences about this are provided starting from these considerations the study at hand aims at deepening how water inputs and irrigation strategies drive productivity of rice to our best knowledge a comprehensive and updated overview of its productivity values is still missing the only study addressing to this topic was carried out by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 who reviewed crop water productivity for rice and other irrigated crops this analysis could rely upon a small number of publications and trials and was limited to highlight the variation of productivity with respect to individual independent variables the main objective of our analysis is to overcome such limitations exploring the role of irrigation water in determining productivity an extensive literature review was carried out to collect a large set of published experimental data afterwards the analysis was conceived on an econometric basis specifically a multivariate linear regression model was used to shed light on the joint contribution of water inputs i e supplied amounts regime and irrigation method to productivity the next section introduces both conceptual and methodological approach then results are presented and discussed finally some insights to address irrigation water policies are derived 2 conceptual and methodological approach 2 1 irrigation water productivity traditionally rice cultivation requires the use of a large amount of water irrigation water might account for most of the resource used at farm level despite in some cases it might be small barker et al 2003 this is even more valid for arid and semi arid regions where agriculture is mostly or fully dependent on irrigation besides farmers can directly intervene on irrigation volume whereas facilitate and affordable access to water is at farmers disposal they generally have large influence and control over water volumes timing and supply wichelns 2015 irrigation water is thus a key element for rice cultivation practices for this reason water productivity is hereinafter referred to as irrigation water productivity iwp kgm 3 1 i w p 100 p i where p is the paddy rice yield tha 1 and i the seasonal irrigation water volume mm 2 2 data sourcing and collection criteria a review of international literature of the last twenty years was carried out to select a substantial number of studies concerning i the use of water inputs on rice as the sole crop and ii their respective production performances it was aimed at collecting data and information from field experiments performed worldwide during this time span though the development of new practices and the improvement in the use of production factors no marked modifications in the rice production system occurred consequently the influence of new techniques on the rice sector can be considered minimal and the conditions of the production sector quite stable a large dataset was created based on experimental data from studies that provided some precise information only measured values were considered while results from water balance simulations and yield predictive models were excluded papers should i indicate the precipitation amount occurred at the experimental site during the growing season ii report minimally two data between irrigation water productivity yield and irrigation amounts and iii clearly indicate how irrigation water was administered each value was considered individually while average values per experimental year or management strategy applied were not included in the data set a great variability in locations climate and soil type implications agronomic choices e g fertilization rates rice cultivars and water use was noticed such a complexity reflects the heterogeneity of agricultural practices and the possible combinations of production factors that may be adopted at farm level zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 similarly a large array of irrigation strategies was found to facilitate the subsequent analyses and explore their contribution to the variability of iwp such strategies were firstly grouped under the water regime performed i e flooding irrigation or aerobic rice and then further differentiated on the basis of irrigation method and water management table 1 2 3 the regression model a multiple linear regression model was used to investigate the main drivers of iwp the general model is based on the formulation 2 y β x ε with y the vector of observations β the vector of regression coefficients x the matrix of regressors and ε the vector of erratic variables in this study a group of explanatory variables concern total water supply namely the amounts of water received by rainfall and irrigation according to 1 precipitations are not likely to directly affect water productivity rainfall amounts rather enter the model as proxies for climatic conditions implicitly considering i the location of experimental sites and ii the level of water available to agriculture at farm level the same irrigation volume may be differently managed in general terms lower irrigation amounts are more frequently coupled with water saving techniques grain yield however may not be particularly affected by such a condition finally resulting in the increase of iwp to test this hypothesis various water management options described in table 1 were included in the model as dummy variables table 2 lists all the variables considered in the model accordingly the regression model was explicitly defined in its matrix form as 3 i w p 1 i w p 2 i w p n β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 β 4 β 5 β 6 1 r 1 i 1 f l c o n t 1 f l i n t 1 a e i n t 1 a e o t h 1 1 r 2 i

transformation of numeric variables 4 ln i w p 1 ln i w p 2 ln i w p n β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 β 4 β 5 β 6 1 ln r 1 ln i 1 f l c o n t 1 f l i n t 1 a e i n t 1 a e o t h 1 1 ln r 2 ln i 2 f l c o n t 2 f l i

regression model not necessarily equivalent to the previous formulation 3 3 results 3 1 field experiments overview of locations and water management options a total number of 51 publications was selected from international literature they include either regional analyses or field experiments performed over years in 15 different countries across all the continents table 3 the largest part of them was carried out in asian countries especially india n 18 and china n 14 where almost half of the world rice growing area is concentrated faostat 2014 notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the selection criteria did not allow finding relevant literature for a large part of south eastern asia e g the lower mekong basin where top rice exporter countries are located at the same time few studies refer to the rest of the world only two focus on brazil three on australia and few while remaining papers describe various possibilities for rice cultivation in other six countries see the appendix a each selected paper reports the results of several trials carried out at the same experimental site either under different conditions or repeated in different years see appendix altogether the performed experimentations resulted in the 556 treatments finally included in the analysis 204 trials addressed to the continuous flooding method while the most part tested the effects of a reduced water supply on rice quality and production in particular 206 treatments explored intermittent flooding especially in this latter case great attention was paid to alternate wetting and drying awd e g shao et al 2014 chahal et al 2007 and system of rice intensification sri e g gopalakrishnan et al 2014 thakur et al 2014 periodic irrigations on non flooded fields were mainly performed at experimental sites characterized by either temperate or tropical climates where seasonal irrigation water volumes may be higher than 1300mm intermittent irrigations based on soil water content or moisture tension e g ghosh et al 2011 li et al 2007 prevailed in arid and semi arid regions but even in those temperate zones where drought is a limiting factor for rice production here seasonal water supply rarely exceeded 600mm administered through furrow jin et al 2016 he et al 2013 drip he et al 2013 and sprinkler kato et al 2009 irrigations such studies were conducted in more recent years from 2009 onwards for a total number of 29 treatments 5 of total trials 3 2 irrigation water amounts and productivity based on the analysis of the whole dataset table 4 it could be inferred that a precise correspondence between irrigation amounts and management options does not exist water volumes lower than approximately 1700mm might in fact be administered through different irrigation strategies on the contrary higher volumes are typical of submerged paddy fields only nevertheless it is noteworthy that irrigation strategies are significantly different per water volumes applied table 4 this further confirms continuous flooding to be the most water consuming practice with an average seasonal water use of 1208mm this is indeed characterized by a great variability which remarks the actual use of an even larger water supply other data from literature not included in the current analysis are particularly consistent with this latter possibility moreno jiménez et al 2014 supplied rice fields in a mediterranean area of spain with 2400mm while seasonal water use in lombardy region northern italy is estimated in 4020mm altobelli et al 2011 besides irri estimates the use of 1300 1500mm for irrigated rice in asian countries a reduced permanence of water depth i e intermittent flooding instead enables to save 33 of the resource whereas dry land cultivation implies the use of even lower water volumes compared to continuous flooding aerobic rice enables using up to 591mm with a water use reduction ranging from 51 to 59 our findings are further corroborated by other studies that refer to water saving techniques as regards awd it is reported to reduce irrigation by 15 30 lampayan et al 2014 while rice cultivation under dry land conditions potentially lowers water volumes up to 50 bouman et al 2005a b therefore in general terms decreasing irrigation water volumes can be ascribable to different irrigation modalities and managements this also determines higher productivities as by definition in fact an inversely proportional relationship links irrigation water amounts and iwp according to our results it is found out to be non linear fig 1 a the relationship shows a high r squared 0 81 which demonstrates statistical significance for the entire dataset iwp values concerning all the treatments vary between 0 09 and 8 10kgm 3 with mean and median values of 1 36 and 0 85kgm 3 respectively extreme values refer to different sets of experimentations conducted in japan in the former hayashi et al 2006 indicated that under continuous flooding irrespective of the water supply a lower planting density negatively affected iwp which followed a decreasing trend kato et al 2009 instead focussed on yield potential of direct seeded aerobic rice under sprinkler irrigation compared to transplanted rice in puddled fields with a permanent water depth additionally liu et al 2005 made a similar comparison by performing multiple mulched non flooded trials and finally attained two of the highest iwp 8 04 and 8 03kgm 3 moreover non linearity between iwp and i is peculiar of each water management option fig 1b e though the significance of each relationship largely depends on the number of observations consequently lower irrigation amounts are coupled with higher productivities which finally are significantly different one another table 5 the main reason of this may be traced back to a stronger reduction in water volumes rather than in yield these latter are in fact very similar within the same water regime continuous and intermittent flooding show average productions of 6 54tha 1 and 6 56tha 1 respectively non significantly different under a p value 0 05 whereas aerobic rice yields 5 30tha 1 in general terms higher levels of productivity are coupled with higher yields e g jiang et al 2016 kato et al 2009 or the reverse is true dwivedi et al 2012 ceesay 2011 3 3 results of the multivariate analysis prior to multivariate regression a correlation analysis was run to check for multicollinearity amongst explanatory variables in most cases correlation was found to be low between 0 01 and 0 4 table 6 in first instance it is noticeable the negative correlation between irrigation and rainfall the irrigation period is often dependent on the occurrence of rainy events this also supports that in arid and semi arid regions more supplemental irrigation is needed which balances the scarce rainfall amounts conversely either under a full water availability or in tropical and monsoon areas where rainfall during the rice growing season may be high irrigation water volumes may be scarcer finally despite the coefficient between flcont and flint i e 0 584 was over the cut off of 0 50 suggested by hair et al 2010 both the variables were included in the model to not exclude a priori any water management strategy table 7 shows the descriptive statistics relative to both the dependent and the explanatory variables a stepwise procedure based on ordinary least squares ols was then used to run the model thanks to the large number of observations it was considered robust enough as not to perform further bootstrap analyses as shown in table 8 the regression analysis identifies three significant drivers amongst all the explanatory variables included in the model a systematic relationship between dependent variable and significant predictors is demonstrated by the goodness of fit of the model f test significant under p value 0 01 the high adjusted r squared suggests that they jointly contribute for more than 83 to the variability of iwp without problems of multicollinearity as demonstrated by the variance inflation factors vif more in detail iwp mostly depends on water inputs with the role of irrigation largely prevalent over seasonal rainfall amounts in general terms it is further confirmed the relationship between iwp and irrigation as indicated by the respective negative coefficient linking them in this case a unit diminution in ln iwp β 2 1 006 can be observed for a unit augmentation in ln i yet results from the econometric approach go beyond the mere definition of iwp adopted which is irrespective of precipitation amounts the multivariate analysis instead points out its significant and positive relation with rainfall actually it is not the main driver of iwp rather the relationship suggests that under the same irrigation volume higher precipitations are coupled with a very slight increase in iwp β 3 0 062 this indicates the scarcer contribution of local climate conditions to productivity a role statistically significant but quantitatively irrelevant similarly we can hypothesize that a climate induced reduction of rainfall amounts would not markedly affect iwp besides neither water regimes nor irrigation methods are particularly incisive in driving the variability of iwp each variable concerning irrigation strategy was systematically excluded by the model when running as not respecting a significance threshold only the presence or not of aerobic rice specifically aeint is shown as a key driver of iwp in particular the coefficient of the relevant dummy variable β 6 0 305 indicates its diminution if aerobic cultivation is performed it must be pointed out that such relationship doesn t properly indicate the cause and effect nexus operated by the regressors on the dependent variable rather the effects of each independent variable arise all others being equal given the initial assumptions of this study iwp better depicts partial factor productivity barker et al 2003 rather than total factor productivity indeed paddy rice production relies upon multiple other inputs not explored here for this reason the regression equation returned by the model may be interpreted as a partial production function where only water related aspects explain grain yield 5 ln y n 8 273 0 062 ln r n 0 006 ln i n 0 305 a e o t h n ε n n in this case the main driver can be traced back to irrigation strategy followed by rainfall amounts i e climate conditions and locations and lastly by irrigation water volumes yield does not undergo any change following a unit variation in irrigation amounts since the respective elasticity coefficient is proximate to zero 0 006 at the same time all the determinants of yield and other stochastic effects can be summarized by the error term ε 4 discussion data collected from literature review have served as a characterization of production system in several rice producing areas and especially where africa americas and australia studies concerning productivity are scarcely addressed different studies focussing on water consumption and irrigation efficiency refer to very diverse agro systems in many areas of the world agronomic practices in rice cultivation provide the tillage of submerged soil before sowing to disrupt soil structure i e puddling these operations determine a more compact soil with lower percolation losses and increased irrigation efficiency and water productivity the situation is very different in southern europe where puddling is not practiced and data on water consumption irrigation efficiency and productivity are very scant in this regard sánchez llerena et al 2016 estimated that iwp in extremadura spain is around 0 61kgm 3 this shows some similarities with the evidences provided in this paper see the appendix which indicates iwp for northern italian rice ranging between 0 11 and 0 67kgm 3 nonetheless considerations about iwp overview are extremely indicative lower and upper bounds of iwp are still subject to variation given the possibility to widen the case record with further experimental data besides our analysis considered field experiments performed in the last 30 years therefore advanced practices in experimental conditions would strongly affect the possibility of a reasonable comparison within a vast set of data repeating a similar study in the next future taking into consideration either a shorter or a more recent time span will possibly lead to different results as another concern it must be recognized that field experiments are usually performed under optimal and controlled conditions which might not be ensured at farm or regional level a wide heterogeneity in agro climatic parameters and resource use as well as complex dynamics that operate at a larger scale makes difficultly feasible the adoption and the spreading of the same cultivation practices for this reason research should embark more efforts in deepening the possibility to scale up trials and their respective results the relationship between iwp and irrigation water shows how despite very dissimilar observations for experimental conditions and designs overall depicts a significant common trait where no outliers are evident likely the heterogeneity in locations and practices has a minor role in determining the general trend of iwp the identified trend can be considered explanatory of general behaviour also thanks to the large number of observations which enforces its robustness and makes considerations reasonable it founds confirmation in the neoclassical macroeconomic theory mitscherlich 1925 or similarly in the liebig s law of the minimum sprengel 1839 more popular among the agronomists consequently the more irrigation water is used the more marginal grain yield decreases until when it becomes negative and an additional unit of water input causes an output reduction in flooded paddy fields the large amount of water supplied is not used to sustain physiological crop needs but rather is due to agronomic reasons that exploit rice adaptability to submerged soils this is somehow confirmed by the alternative formulation of the regression model eq 5 which attests gross irrigation amounts to be a minor though significant driver of grain yield notwithstanding other conditions yield potentially remains constant at varying administered water volumes no remarkable quantitative differences are observed by shifting from continuous to alternate flooding by contrast yield of aerobic rice is significantly lower owing to higher environmental stresses the crop is subject to and other implications of dry land conditions in this perspective trade offs between reduced yields and increased iwp should be also economically accounted for instance by quantifying economic water productivity ben hassen et al 2016 pereira et al 2012 before recommending water saving strategies outputs from the regression model enable identifying the elements to be enforced and possibly how to do so if increasing iwp is the prime objective ceteris paribus irrigation amounts more affect iwp in this case we can hypothesize that a reduction in supplied water as well as incentives for a more rational use should be encouraged these could be quite easily achieved by charging farmers with a fixed fee per unit of water delivered e g garrido and llamas 2009 water supply tariff is largely proved to be a key factor in determining the amount of water to be used by irrigated agriculture bartolini et al 2007 dono et al 2006 gomez limon and riesgo 2004 favouring a more effective allocation driving the switch to cultivation of less water demanding crops or determining the exploitation of other water sources under the practice of water saving techniques farmers might benefit from a reduction of rice production costs and a possible increase of their revenues monaco et al 2016 on the other hand a strong reduction of water availability may lead to a profound modification of the production pattern actually one of the main objective of farmers is maintaining an adequate economic return which more often benefits from the application of a fixed fee per hectare of irrigated land e g as applied by water users associations in northern italy or in california and is thus conflicting with water saving a variable crop based charge may be a valid compromise solution between the two options the type and the amount of irrigation rate when applicable are elements that policy makers should handle carefully they in fact should not be implemented indiscriminately but rather adapted to each different context in addition though not always aligning with the achievement of a high agricultural productivity formal water markets palomo hierro et al 2015 show potentialities to counteract climate change induced negative impacts as well as improve the efficiency of water use easter et al 1999 like other policy and pricing options they however may lead to scarce environmental and equity benefits only a proper implementation ensures they role in supporting decisions at different levels it is of upmost importance to develop site specific actions in order to improve the intrinsic conditions of each production system for instance the comparison of the performance of italian rice farming with the similar production structures of california and australia calls for agronomic interventions to enhance production potential of available varieties in this perspective the re allocation of either water amongst conflicting uses or irrigation water amongst farmers should be carefully considered 5 conclusions this study contributes to fill the gap in exploring the variability of irrigation water productivity for rice it first explores its numerical variability based on an extensive collection of measured data from international literature accordingly the approach provides an overview of the iwp values such an indicator is not reliable enough to reflect a rational or effective management of water resource consequently iwp issue assumes the connotation of a typical wicked problem that allows to specify only if an experimental condition performs better or worse than others however drawing similar conclusions for data presented in this paper appears quite risky since they result from very different farming practices and site specific conditions in this sense factors related to water use and management confirmed i the inverse relationship between iwp and irrigation volumes and ii the non linear trend consistent with the economic theory of production function this trend characterizes both the whole set of data and the different paddy fields administrations with reference to this last point iwp values are statistically different owing to progressive water savings of the distributed resource repetitions of these calculations including further data are needed in order to confirm or not findings and evidences the regression analysis investigates the joint variability of iwp according to water supplies and their management on the field this approach although limited to a small array of inputs in crop production easily allows to draw some considerations on water policy and its potential effects on the production system as well as the connections with weather climatic and environmental conditions that are impacting at global level the effective availability of water for agriculture the model identified appears sufficiently robust to be also used in a predictive sense indicating the extent to which a modification in the explanatory variables may affect iwp it emerges therefore the possibility of interpreting the results obtained to drive either farm level decisions or decision makers interventions to this end it is valuable to consider the chance to run the same approach on smaller groups of data sets e g per country or per region to obtain more detailed and precise information accordingly to

11611,rice cultivation is globally hampered by several conditions which urge farmers to maintain adequate production levels while properly managing irrigation water this has noticeable repercussions on the efficient use of the resource and on water productivity nonetheless more often this latter topic is addressed by estimating the respective values without deeply investigating the possible causes behind such discrepancies the main objective of this paper is to overcome such limitations by i providing a comprehensive and updated overview of irrigation water productivity iwp for rice and ii exploring the role of irrigation water in determining iwp value the analysis of experimental data collected from 51 studies reveals iwp to vary between 0 09 and 8 10kgm 3 with mean and median values of 1 36 and 0 85kgm 3 respectively moreover a non linear relationship between irrigation water amounts and iwp r2 0 81 is depicted further on data are analyzed using an econometric approach specifically a multivariate linear regression model is used to shed light on the joint contribution of water inputs regime and irrigation method to productivity this demonstrates the significant roles of irrigation β 1 006 and rainfall β 0 062 amounts while aerobic regime and irrigation method is proved to be a further key driver β 0 305 such results enable identifying the elements to be enforced if increasing iwp for rice is the prime objective finally some implications are derived for water policy and the connections with weather climatic and environmental conditions that are globally affecting the availability of water in agriculture keywords irrigation water productivity rice water management options multivariate regression 1 introduction with more than 162 million hectares cultivated worldwide faostat 2014 rice is one of the leading food crops and rice farming a strategic activity for several countries rice based farming systems are particularly relevant for the rural poor in asia latin america and africa where agriculture has a prominent subsistence role there it contributes in ensuring food sustenance mancosu et al 2015 fostering local development and economic livelihood for farmers fao 2004 preventing social unrest driven by volatility of commodity prices irri 2013 in many parts of the world rice farming is characterized by a marked specialization which makes the relevant sector highly competitive and profitable in this case most of the final product is oriented to global markets and commercialized via international trade in these areas the economic importance of the sector can be substantial so as its contribution to the economic viability furthermore rice cultivation provides many ecosystem services matsuno et al 2006 used as evidences of the advisability to preserve the activity amongst others the environmental value of submerged paddy fields yoon 2009 the creation of wetland habitats and protected areas natuhara 2013 the aesthetic quality of traditional landscapes jung and ryu 2015 at the same time manifold conditions globally hamper the rice sector affecting both production and competitiveness of rice farming for instance the volatility of paddy rice prices fao 2016 may not compensate for production costs ferrero and nguyen 2004 while in some countries where rice is a heavily protected good it often faces smuggling problems golub 2012 however major concerns are mostly related to water resource both in terms of quantity and quality in the first instance they arise as a problem of water availability shortcomings due to climate induced effects olesen et al 2011 have determined the occurrence of hot spots of water scarcity in several areas bouman et al 2007 further exacerbated by recurring and intensive droughts events this preponderantly influences the possibility of an adequate resource allocation amongst sectors elliot et al 2014 users and even crops within the same production pattern bischetti et al 2014 in addition even if not quantitatively limited irrigation water may suffer from a deteriorated quality soil salinization and resource pollution in general may lead to a lower usability and a scarcer rice production clermont dauphin et al 2010 isquierdo fraga et al 2010 this array of conditions urges rice farming to maintain adequate production levels while properly managing production factors consequently an optimal and rational use of the resource becomes a prime objective possibly encouraged and sustained by water policies operating at regional or supra national level e g european water framework directive from this point of view the adoption of water saving techniques is increasingly stimulated to mitigate the effects of climate change or to release water that would allow expanding cultivated areas crop yield tends to be proportionally affected by the amount of irrigation water received maeda et al 2011 and farmers decisions should properly balance between yield and resource use monaco et al 2016 in this perspective several authors rely on the concept of water productivity molden 1997 to assess the success of different cultivation practices e g brauman et al 2013 lenton 2013 molden et al 2010 though the productivity based approach simplifies real conditions and doesn t embark a large set of stochastic events risks and random shocks beyond farmers control additionally it fails in providing adequate information about the use of resources for these reasons water productivity as a sole indicator conveys too limited information and does not allow to deduce helpful insights on the efficient rational optimal use of irrigation water seckler et al 2003 quoting from wichelns 2015 likewise estimations of productivity and yields over time and locations inadequately indicate desirable changes either in water management practices or in production results the author also recognizes that most of the studies only estimate water productivity without discussing the plausible causes behind the observed discrepancies amongst values according to a fao survey fao 2003 water productivity in agriculture strongly augmented in the period 1961 2001 mostly thanks to yield increase in rice farming this is even exacerbated in recent times by the time the sector has been experiencing the introduction of short cycle high yielding cultivars and ameliorated varieties e g clément and louvel 2013 suitable for the cultivation under limited water supplies the more crop per drop paradigm kijne et al 2003 may benefit from such innovations ben hassen et al 2016 which contribute to stabilize or increase grain yield on the other hand zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 ascribe variability of water productivity also to climate conditions indeed irrigation water productivity for rice was estimated during both the rainy season e g sarkar et al 2002 pandey et al 1989 islam et al 1986 and summer e g uppal et al 1991 hassan et al 1989 marimuthu and lulandaivelu 1987 islam et al 1986 it must also be recognized that irrigation water management is a further source of variability but scarce evidences about this are provided starting from these considerations the study at hand aims at deepening how water inputs and irrigation strategies drive productivity of rice to our best knowledge a comprehensive and updated overview of its productivity values is still missing the only study addressing to this topic was carried out by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 who reviewed crop water productivity for rice and other irrigated crops this analysis could rely upon a small number of publications and trials and was limited to highlight the variation of productivity with respect to individual independent variables the main objective of our analysis is to overcome such limitations exploring the role of irrigation water in determining productivity an extensive literature review was carried out to collect a large set of published experimental data afterwards the analysis was conceived on an econometric basis specifically a multivariate linear regression model was used to shed light on the joint contribution of water inputs i e supplied amounts regime and irrigation method to productivity the next section introduces both conceptual and methodological approach then results are presented and discussed finally some insights to address irrigation water policies are derived 2 conceptual and methodological approach 2 1 irrigation water productivity traditionally rice cultivation requires the use of a large amount of water irrigation water might account for most of the resource used at farm level despite in some cases it might be small barker et al 2003 this is even more valid for arid and semi arid regions where agriculture is mostly or fully dependent on irrigation besides farmers can directly intervene on irrigation volume whereas facilitate and affordable access to water is at farmers disposal they generally have large influence and control over water volumes timing and supply wichelns 2015 irrigation water is thus a key element for rice cultivation practices for this reason water productivity is hereinafter referred to as irrigation water productivity iwp kgm 3 1 i w p 100 p i where p is the paddy rice yield tha 1 and i the seasonal irrigation water volume mm 2 2 data sourcing and collection criteria a review of international literature of the last twenty years was carried out to select a substantial number of studies concerning i the use of water inputs on rice as the sole crop and ii their respective production performances it was aimed at collecting data and information from field experiments performed worldwide during this time span though the development of new practices and the improvement in the use of production factors no marked modifications in the rice production system occurred consequently the influence of new techniques on the rice sector can be considered minimal and the conditions of the production sector quite stable a large dataset was created based on experimental data from studies that provided some precise information only measured values were considered while results from water balance simulations and yield predictive models were excluded papers should i indicate the precipitation amount occurred at the experimental site during the growing season ii report minimally two data between irrigation water productivity yield and irrigation amounts and iii clearly indicate how irrigation water was administered each value was considered individually while average values per experimental year or management strategy applied were not included in the data set a great variability in locations climate and soil type implications agronomic choices e g fertilization rates rice cultivars and water use was noticed such a complexity reflects the heterogeneity of agricultural practices and the possible combinations of production factors that may be adopted at farm level zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 similarly a large array of irrigation strategies was found to facilitate the subsequent analyses and explore their contribution to the variability of iwp such strategies were firstly grouped under the water regime performed i e flooding irrigation or aerobic rice and then further differentiated on the basis of irrigation method and water management table 1 2 3 the regression model a multiple linear regression model was used to investigate the main drivers of iwp the general model is based on the formulation 2 y β x ε with y the vector of observations β the vector of regression coefficients x the matrix of regressors and ε the vector of erratic variables in this study a group of explanatory variables concern total water supply namely the amounts of water received by rainfall and irrigation according to 1 precipitations are not likely to directly affect water productivity rainfall amounts rather enter the model as proxies for climatic conditions implicitly considering i the location of experimental sites and ii the level of water available to agriculture at farm level the same irrigation volume may be differently managed in general terms lower irrigation amounts are more frequently coupled with water saving techniques grain yield however may not be particularly affected by such a condition finally resulting in the increase of iwp to test this hypothesis various water management options described in table 1 were included in the model as dummy variables table 2 lists all the variables considered in the model accordingly the regression model was explicitly defined in its matrix form as 3 i w p 1 i w p 2 i w p n β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 β 4 β 5 β 6 1 r 1 i 1 f l c o n t 1 f l i n t 1 a e i n t 1 a e o t h 1 1 r 2 i

transformation of numeric variables 4 ln i w p 1 ln i w p 2 ln i w p n β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 β 4 β 5 β 6 1 ln r 1 ln i 1 f l c o n t 1 f l i n t 1 a e i n t 1 a e o t h 1 1 ln r 2 ln i 2 f l c o n t 2 f l i

regression model not necessarily equivalent to the previous formulation 3 3 results 3 1 field experiments overview of locations and water management options a total number of 51 publications was selected from international literature they include either regional analyses or field experiments performed over years in 15 different countries across all the continents table 3 the largest part of them was carried out in asian countries especially india n 18 and china n 14 where almost half of the world rice growing area is concentrated faostat 2014 notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the selection criteria did not allow finding relevant literature for a large part of south eastern asia e g the lower mekong basin where top rice exporter countries are located at the same time few studies refer to the rest of the world only two focus on brazil three on australia and few while remaining papers describe various possibilities for rice cultivation in other six countries see the appendix a each selected paper reports the results of several trials carried out at the same experimental site either under different conditions or repeated in different years see appendix altogether the performed experimentations resulted in the 556 treatments finally included in the analysis 204 trials addressed to the continuous flooding method while the most part tested the effects of a reduced water supply on rice quality and production in particular 206 treatments explored intermittent flooding especially in this latter case great attention was paid to alternate wetting and drying awd e g shao et al 2014 chahal et al 2007 and system of rice intensification sri e g gopalakrishnan et al 2014 thakur et al 2014 periodic irrigations on non flooded fields were mainly performed at experimental sites characterized by either temperate or tropical climates where seasonal irrigation water volumes may be higher than 1300mm intermittent irrigations based on soil water content or moisture tension e g ghosh et al 2011 li et al 2007 prevailed in arid and semi arid regions but even in those temperate zones where drought is a limiting factor for rice production here seasonal water supply rarely exceeded 600mm administered through furrow jin et al 2016 he et al 2013 drip he et al 2013 and sprinkler kato et al 2009 irrigations such studies were conducted in more recent years from 2009 onwards for a total number of 29 treatments 5 of total trials 3 2 irrigation water amounts and productivity based on the analysis of the whole dataset table 4 it could be inferred that a precise correspondence between irrigation amounts and management options does not exist water volumes lower than approximately 1700mm might in fact be administered through different irrigation strategies on the contrary higher volumes are typical of submerged paddy fields only nevertheless it is noteworthy that irrigation strategies are significantly different per water volumes applied table 4 this further confirms continuous flooding to be the most water consuming practice with an average seasonal water use of 1208mm this is indeed characterized by a great variability which remarks the actual use of an even larger water supply other data from literature not included in the current analysis are particularly consistent with this latter possibility moreno jiménez et al 2014 supplied rice fields in a mediterranean area of spain with 2400mm while seasonal water use in lombardy region northern italy is estimated in 4020mm altobelli et al 2011 besides irri estimates the use of 1300 1500mm for irrigated rice in asian countries a reduced permanence of water depth i e intermittent flooding instead enables to save 33 of the resource whereas dry land cultivation implies the use of even lower water volumes compared to continuous flooding aerobic rice enables using up to 591mm with a water use reduction ranging from 51 to 59 our findings are further corroborated by other studies that refer to water saving techniques as regards awd it is reported to reduce irrigation by 15 30 lampayan et al 2014 while rice cultivation under dry land conditions potentially lowers water volumes up to 50 bouman et al 2005a b therefore in general terms decreasing irrigation water volumes can be ascribable to different irrigation modalities and managements this also determines higher productivities as by definition in fact an inversely proportional relationship links irrigation water amounts and iwp according to our results it is found out to be non linear fig 1 a the relationship shows a high r squared 0 81 which demonstrates statistical significance for the entire dataset iwp values concerning all the treatments vary between 0 09 and 8 10kgm 3 with mean and median values of 1 36 and 0 85kgm 3 respectively extreme values refer to different sets of experimentations conducted in japan in the former hayashi et al 2006 indicated that under continuous flooding irrespective of the water supply a lower planting density negatively affected iwp which followed a decreasing trend kato et al 2009 instead focussed on yield potential of direct seeded aerobic rice under sprinkler irrigation compared to transplanted rice in puddled fields with a permanent water depth additionally liu et al 2005 made a similar comparison by performing multiple mulched non flooded trials and finally attained two of the highest iwp 8 04 and 8 03kgm 3 moreover non linearity between iwp and i is peculiar of each water management option fig 1b e though the significance of each relationship largely depends on the number of observations consequently lower irrigation amounts are coupled with higher productivities which finally are significantly different one another table 5 the main reason of this may be traced back to a stronger reduction in water volumes rather than in yield these latter are in fact very similar within the same water regime continuous and intermittent flooding show average productions of 6 54tha 1 and 6 56tha 1 respectively non significantly different under a p value 0 05 whereas aerobic rice yields 5 30tha 1 in general terms higher levels of productivity are coupled with higher yields e g jiang et al 2016 kato et al 2009 or the reverse is true dwivedi et al 2012 ceesay 2011 3 3 results of the multivariate analysis prior to multivariate regression a correlation analysis was run to check for multicollinearity amongst explanatory variables in most cases correlation was found to be low between 0 01 and 0 4 table 6 in first instance it is noticeable the negative correlation between irrigation and rainfall the irrigation period is often dependent on the occurrence of rainy events this also supports that in arid and semi arid regions more supplemental irrigation is needed which balances the scarce rainfall amounts conversely either under a full water availability or in tropical and monsoon areas where rainfall during the rice growing season may be high irrigation water volumes may be scarcer finally despite the coefficient between flcont and flint i e 0 584 was over the cut off of 0 50 suggested by hair et al 2010 both the variables were included in the model to not exclude a priori any water management strategy table 7 shows the descriptive statistics relative to both the dependent and the explanatory variables a stepwise procedure based on ordinary least squares ols was then used to run the model thanks to the large number of observations it was considered robust enough as not to perform further bootstrap analyses as shown in table 8 the regression analysis identifies three significant drivers amongst all the explanatory variables included in the model a systematic relationship between dependent variable and significant predictors is demonstrated by the goodness of fit of the model f test significant under p value 0 01 the high adjusted r squared suggests that they jointly contribute for more than 83 to the variability of iwp without problems of multicollinearity as demonstrated by the variance inflation factors vif more in detail iwp mostly depends on water inputs with the role of irrigation largely prevalent over seasonal rainfall amounts in general terms it is further confirmed the relationship between iwp and irrigation as indicated by the respective negative coefficient linking them in this case a unit diminution in ln iwp β 2 1 006 can be observed for a unit augmentation in ln i yet results from the econometric approach go beyond the mere definition of iwp adopted which is irrespective of precipitation amounts the multivariate analysis instead points out its significant and positive relation with rainfall actually it is not the main driver of iwp rather the relationship suggests that under the same irrigation volume higher precipitations are coupled with a very slight increase in iwp β 3 0 062 this indicates the scarcer contribution of local climate conditions to productivity a role statistically significant but quantitatively irrelevant similarly we can hypothesize that a climate induced reduction of rainfall amounts would not markedly affect iwp besides neither water regimes nor irrigation methods are particularly incisive in driving the variability of iwp each variable concerning irrigation strategy was systematically excluded by the model when running as not respecting a significance threshold only the presence or not of aerobic rice specifically aeint is shown as a key driver of iwp in particular the coefficient of the relevant dummy variable β 6 0 305 indicates its diminution if aerobic cultivation is performed it must be pointed out that such relationship doesn t properly indicate the cause and effect nexus operated by the regressors on the dependent variable rather the effects of each independent variable arise all others being equal given the initial assumptions of this study iwp better depicts partial factor productivity barker et al 2003 rather than total factor productivity indeed paddy rice production relies upon multiple other inputs not explored here for this reason the regression equation returned by the model may be interpreted as a partial production function where only water related aspects explain grain yield 5 ln y n 8 273 0 062 ln r n 0 006 ln i n 0 305 a e o t h n ε n n in this case the main driver can be traced back to irrigation strategy followed by rainfall amounts i e climate conditions and locations and lastly by irrigation water volumes yield does not undergo any change following a unit variation in irrigation amounts since the respective elasticity coefficient is proximate to zero 0 006 at the same time all the determinants of yield and other stochastic effects can be summarized by the error term ε 4 discussion data collected from literature review have served as a characterization of production system in several rice producing areas and especially where africa americas and australia studies concerning productivity are scarcely addressed different studies focussing on water consumption and irrigation efficiency refer to very diverse agro systems in many areas of the world agronomic practices in rice cultivation provide the tillage of submerged soil before sowing to disrupt soil structure i e puddling these operations determine a more compact soil with lower percolation losses and increased irrigation efficiency and water productivity the situation is very different in southern europe where puddling is not practiced and data on water consumption irrigation efficiency and productivity are very scant in this regard sánchez llerena et al 2016 estimated that iwp in extremadura spain is around 0 61kgm 3 this shows some similarities with the evidences provided in this paper see the appendix which indicates iwp for northern italian rice ranging between 0 11 and 0 67kgm 3 nonetheless considerations about iwp overview are extremely indicative lower and upper bounds of iwp are still subject to variation given the possibility to widen the case record with further experimental data besides our analysis considered field experiments performed in the last 30 years therefore advanced practices in experimental conditions would strongly affect the possibility of a reasonable comparison within a vast set of data repeating a similar study in the next future taking into consideration either a shorter or a more recent time span will possibly lead to different results as another concern it must be recognized that field experiments are usually performed under optimal and controlled conditions which might not be ensured at farm or regional level a wide heterogeneity in agro climatic parameters and resource use as well as complex dynamics that operate at a larger scale makes difficultly feasible the adoption and the spreading of the same cultivation practices for this reason research should embark more efforts in deepening the possibility to scale up trials and their respective results the relationship between iwp and irrigation water shows how despite very dissimilar observations for experimental conditions and designs overall depicts a significant common trait where no outliers are evident likely the heterogeneity in locations and practices has a minor role in determining the general trend of iwp the identified trend can be considered explanatory of general behaviour also thanks to the large number of observations which enforces its robustness and makes considerations reasonable it founds confirmation in the neoclassical macroeconomic theory mitscherlich 1925 or similarly in the liebig s law of the minimum sprengel 1839 more popular among the agronomists consequently the more irrigation water is used the more marginal grain yield decreases until when it becomes negative and an additional unit of water input causes an output reduction in flooded paddy fields the large amount of water supplied is not used to sustain physiological crop needs but rather is due to agronomic reasons that exploit rice adaptability to submerged soils this is somehow confirmed by the alternative formulation of the regression model eq 5 which attests gross irrigation amounts to be a minor though significant driver of grain yield notwithstanding other conditions yield potentially remains constant at varying administered water volumes no remarkable quantitative differences are observed by shifting from continuous to alternate flooding by contrast yield of aerobic rice is significantly lower owing to higher environmental stresses the crop is subject to and other implications of dry land conditions in this perspective trade offs between reduced yields and increased iwp should be also economically accounted for instance by quantifying economic water productivity ben hassen et al 2016 pereira et al 2012 before recommending water saving strategies outputs from the regression model enable identifying the elements to be enforced and possibly how to do so if increasing iwp is the prime objective ceteris paribus irrigation amounts more affect iwp in this case we can hypothesize that a reduction in supplied water as well as incentives for a more rational use should be encouraged these could be quite easily achieved by charging farmers with a fixed fee per unit of water delivered e g garrido and llamas 2009 water supply tariff is largely proved to be a key factor in determining the amount of water to be used by irrigated agriculture bartolini et al 2007 dono et al 2006 gomez limon and riesgo 2004 favouring a more effective allocation driving the switch to cultivation of less water demanding crops or determining the exploitation of other water sources under the practice of water saving techniques farmers might benefit from a reduction of rice production costs and a possible increase of their revenues monaco et al 2016 on the other hand a strong reduction of water availability may lead to a profound modification of the production pattern actually one of the main objective of farmers is maintaining an adequate economic return which more often benefits from the application of a fixed fee per hectare of irrigated land e g as applied by water users associations in northern italy or in california and is thus conflicting with water saving a variable crop based charge may be a valid compromise solution between the two options the type and the amount of irrigation rate when applicable are elements that policy makers should handle carefully they in fact should not be implemented indiscriminately but rather adapted to each different context in addition though not always aligning with the achievement of a high agricultural productivity formal water markets palomo hierro et al 2015 show potentialities to counteract climate change induced negative impacts as well as improve the efficiency of water use easter et al 1999 like other policy and pricing options they however may lead to scarce environmental and equity benefits only a proper implementation ensures they role in supporting decisions at different levels it is of upmost importance to develop site specific actions in order to improve the intrinsic conditions of each production system for instance the comparison of the performance of italian rice farming with the similar production structures of california and australia calls for agronomic interventions to enhance production potential of available varieties in this perspective the re allocation of either water amongst conflicting uses or irrigation water amongst farmers should be carefully considered 5 conclusions this study contributes to fill the gap in exploring the variability of irrigation water productivity for rice it first explores its numerical variability based on an extensive collection of measured data from international literature accordingly the approach provides an overview of the iwp values such an indicator is not reliable enough to reflect a rational or effective management of water resource consequently iwp issue assumes the connotation of a typical wicked problem that allows to specify only if an experimental condition performs better or worse than others however drawing similar conclusions for data presented in this paper appears quite risky since they result from very different farming practices and site specific conditions in this sense factors related to water use and management confirmed i the inverse relationship between iwp and irrigation volumes and ii the non linear trend consistent with the economic theory of production function this trend characterizes both the whole set of data and the different paddy fields administrations with reference to this last point iwp values are statistically different owing to progressive water savings of the distributed resource repetitions of these calculations including further data are needed in order to confirm or not findings and evidences the regression analysis investigates the joint variability of iwp according to water supplies and their management on the field this approach although limited to a small array of inputs in crop production easily allows to draw some considerations on water policy and its potential effects on the production system as well as the connections with weather climatic and environmental conditions that are impacting at global level the effective availability of water for agriculture the model identified appears sufficiently robust to be also used in a predictive sense indicating the extent to which a modification in the explanatory variables may affect iwp it emerges therefore the possibility of interpreting the results obtained to drive either farm level decisions or decision makers interventions to this end it is valuable to consider the chance to run the same approach on smaller groups of data sets e g per country or per region to obtain more detailed and precise information accordingly to

11612,the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector are tremendous thus it is essential to determine its impacts on agricultural water resources and to minimize adverse effects on crop production the present study aims to simulate climate data based on sres a1b scenario from the outputs of three general circulation models gcms namely fgoal hadcm3 and ipcm4 and examine the design water requirement dwr of winter paddy using frequency analysis under climate change condition in bangladesh the average change rates of dwr in four climatic zones were compared to baseline and the results were 12 16 2020s 0 28 2055s and 1 25 2090s for the fgoal 4 44 2020s 0 57 2055s and 1 25 2090s for the hadcm3 and 1 12 2020s 2 22 2055s and 6 69 2090s for the ipcm4 the change rates of gross paddy water demand gpwd for three gcms ranged from 3 01 to 11 16 in both cases of the dwr and gpwd the change rates were above 3 indicating a warning signal to the future winter paddy water management the outcomes of this study can be used as basic data for the development of agricultural water resource management which will help to minimize the drought risk and to implement future agricultural water resource policies in bangladesh keywords crop production design water requirement climate change scenario gross paddy water demand drought risk 1 introduction nowadays climate change is one of the greatest threats that our planet faces climate change directly affects global and regional agriculture and irrigation systems puma and cook 2010 hong et al 2016 it is generally accepted that the agricultural sector of developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries mostly because of low capacity and infrastructure to adapt to changing climate being a developing country bangladesh is also facing tremendous challenges from climate change particularly for its agricultural based economy consequently irrigation water requirements in bangladesh will increase in the upcoming decades due to the rises in temperature changes in rainfall pattern and solar radiation in addition agricultural sector of bangladesh is expected to face rising competition for water resources from other sectors according to the ministry of water resources of bangladesh 86 of total water usage is attributed to the agricultural sector and 70 is consumed to paddy rice cultivation chowdhury 2010 the design water requirement of paddy rice is vital to the optimal design and operation of agricultural water resources systems however profound knowledge regarding the change rates of design rice water requirement at regional and national levels in bangladesh is still significant for the better understanding of climate change and its multidimensional impacts bangladesh has now become a self sufficient rice producing country because irrigation has intensified rice production winter rice is one of the main dry season crops of bangladesh which fully depends on irrigation the total amount of water used for winter rice has increased considerably over the last three decades because of intensive irrigated agriculture in bangladesh intensive irrigated agriculture is the outcome of water shortages during dry seasons from january to april shahid 2008 additionally groundwater is heavily used for irrigated agriculture due to shortage of surface water resources and this has led to decline of groundwater levels during the dry season any change of rice water requirement as affected by climate change and then needs to be thorough studied and the results require managing rice water requirement drought risk shahid and behrawan 2008 groundwater sustainability kirby et al 2015 and future climate change impacts mainuddin et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 are considered serious challenges for irrigation water management and they have recently received the significant attention in bangladesh hence irrigation water management in bangladesh has concentrated mainly on protecting the paddy rice areas from the possible risk of drought under climate change because sustaining food security and further increasing paddy rice production in bangladesh is considered a top priority the present study has focused solely on one of the most critical factors namely the effects of future climate change on design water requirement of paddy rice in order to be able to adapt to the changing climate a clear understanding of water requirement changes in response to the variations in the climate variables can help in the planning and management of agricultural water resources ipcc 2014 wang et al 2015 as the agricultural sector is a climate sensitive it is necessary to understand how climate change affects agricultural water resources for sustainable agriculture particularly paddy rice production in bangladesh future water security depends on climate change and water requirements for irrigation hong et al 2016 it is essential to know how much water is required for irrigation to help agricultural sustainability and food security under current and future climate change scenarios bangladesh is already recognized as one of the worst victims of climate change ipcc 2007 the ipcc 2007 predicts that climate patterns in bangladesh will change due to the rising global temperature the rainfall temperature and solar radiation vary with season to season and location wise each year bangladesh face mild to severe drought for instance northwestern area has been known as drought prone regions of the country islam et al 2017 drought is very sensitive to climate and varies in year to year one of the important problem in drought analysis deals with past record of an events in terms of future probabilities of occurrence the procedure for estimating frequency of occurrence of a drought event is usually done by frequency analysis though rainfall is erratic in nature temperature varies season with time and space it is possible to predict design water requirement dwr under climate change condition using frequency analysis in fact drought frequency analysis is a basic tool for safe and economic planning and design of future agricultural water management hosking and wallis 1997 reported that planning for water related management design of irrigation structure all rely on knowledge of the frequency of the extreme events such as drought storm and flood there is no widely accepted procedure to predict the dwr under climate change condition this is why the evaluation of design water requirement as embodied with probability distribution function pdf relationship has been a major focus of both theoretical and applied agricultural water resources management anticipating the effects of climate change and adapting to them is one of the ways to reduce vulnerability to the potential adverse impacts prodanovic and simonovic 2007 so a frequency analysis has an application for predicting the design water requirement on probability basis that is irreplaceable it is generally acknowledged that general circulation models gcms are the key tools to assess future climate change at large scale xu 1999 the main limitation of gcms is the coarse horizontal resolution which limits their capability to resolve processes at local scale wilby and wigley 1997 to resolve this problem it is of necessary to adjust the changes of large scale predictions of gcms to the changes of local scale climate variables the technique used to convert gcm outputs into local climate variables are generally done by downscaling methods there are various methods for downscaling gcms outputs which fall into two categories e g i dynamic and ii statistical downscaling fowler et al 2007 among several downscaling methods lars wg long ashton research station weather generator semenov et al 1998 model has the advantage of less data require and has been extensively used in the climate change impact studies islam et al 2017 kumar et al 2014 another advantage is that 15 gcms outputs with various scenarios have been included in the lars wg model to better dealing with gcms uncertainties several studies have been carried out on future water requirements of paddy rice affected by climate change at local and global scales which can be found in literature for example de silva et al 2007 assessed the paddy irrigation water requirement iwr in sri lanka and the iwr predicted by 13 23 increase under sresb2 and a2 scenarios using datasets from the hadcm3outputs rodriguez diaz et al 2007 studied in the guadalquivir basin in spain and found that the seasonal iwr would be increased between 15 and 20 by the 2050s undera2 and b2 scenarios elgaali et al 2007 modeled in the arkansas basin in colorado and projected irrigation water demand an increase of 5 2050s and 9 2090s when using the hadcm2 gcms outputs chung et al 2011 projected the total volumetric decreases of 4 2050s and 10 2080s of the iwr in south korea based on the hadcm3 outputs for the a2 and b2 scenarios yoo et al 2012 also projected the average change rates of the design water requirement dwr of wet season paddy below 3 under sres a1b a2 and b1 scenarios in south korea when using climate datasets from the cgcm 3 1 gcms outputs gondim et al 2012 in the jaguaribe river basin brazil and rehana and mujumdar 2013 in bhadra reservoir area in india found the impacts of climate change to be increased of paddy rice iwr and a change in crop evapotranspiration etc lee and huang 2014 predicted an increase of 7 2050s of iwr of paddy rice in taiwan hadinia et al 2016 studied climate change impacts on rice water requirement in iran and found that average rice water requirement will increase for the upcoming periods most of the previous studies predicted that rice water requirement will increase under climate change scenarios even though the effect of projected changes in rainfall on the iwr is offsetting by the effect of projected changes in other climate variables such as temperature solar radiation in bangladesh shahid 2011 predicted the changes of the iwr in the dry season boro rice field in northwest bangladesh under sres b2 scenario mainuddin et al 2015 estimated the impact of climate change on the iwr of dry season crops in bangladesh and confirmed to increase by a maximum of 3 of the boro paddy iwr for the 2050s dry condition using the a1b scenario based on the hadcm3 and fgoals gcm outputs recently acharjee et al 2017 investigated the future impacts of climate change on the iwr of dry season boro rice in north west bangladesh and found that net irrigation requirement of boro rice will decrease by 1 6 in 2050s and 7 4 in 2080s using the rcp 8 5 scenario based on five gcm models these earlier studies in bangladesh have focused on the changes of crop evapotranspiration etc and the net irrigation requirement nir however the study of design water requirement for paddy rice under climate change condition has not been undertaken in bangladesh therefore the research of climate change impacts on the dwr for winter paddy rice in bangladesh which accounts for a maximum agricultural water usage need to be introduced as a matter of concern motivated by the above mentioned facts the main objective of this study is to predict design water requirement and gross water demand for winter paddy rice in the major climatic zones of bangladesh under climate change we simulated a database of future climate data 2011 2099 using the three gcms outputs and downscaled by the lars wg model under sres a1bscanario this study focuses on changes in the spatial and temporal trends in the dwr of winter paddy in bangladesh however for the first time in bangladesh a study of climate change predicting design water requirement using frequency analysis for winter paddy rice has been carried out it is anticipated that this study will be guideline for regional water managers agriculturalists and decision makers in understanding the impacts of future climate change and also contributes to implement agricultural water resource polices in bangladesh for achieving sustainable food security 2 data and methods in this study the daily historical climate data e g minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and sunshine hours as well as solar radiation were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for a 30 year period 1984 2013 the procedures for calculating design water requirement dwr are displayed in fig 1 2 1 study area and climatic zones of paddy rice the study area is located between india and myanmar in southeast asia 20 34 26 38 n latitude and 88 01 92 41 e longitude bangladesh enjoys the subtropical monsoon climate and has four distinct seasons including winter spring summer and autumn islam et al 2017 about 80 of the country s annual rainfall occurs during the summer season and the annual average total rainfall is 2428mm the annual average temperature is 25 7 c where the lowest temperature is 7 2 c in january and the highest temperature is 31 1 c in august obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd three rice cropping patterns such as winter rice boro summer rice aus and monsoon rice aman are distributed widely in bangladesh according to climatic responses we considered only winter paddy rice rice grown from december to may because this rice variety covers about 86 of irrigated area and also supplying about 95 of the total water for irrigation however summer rice and monsoon rice may occasionally need supplementary irrigation only occupying about 3 of irrigated area for this reason we ignore those rice cropping patterns in the present study the total cultivated winter paddy rice area has increased from 1 6 million ha 1984 to 5 5 million ha 2013 winter rice produced about 58 of total production in 2013 and the paddy area has changed significantly during the last 30 years period bbs 2014 bangladesh meteorological department bmd has 34 weather stations although all stations do not have long term observed data record because some of them are newly established and few stations have missing data for long periods in this study 10 meteorological stations were selected which represent major climatic zones of winter paddy rice areas fig 2 and table 1 bangladesh has divided into seven climatic zones that are suggested by national encyclopedia of bangladesh banglapedia 2003 out of seven zones four climatic zones zone c d f and g were taken into consideration using 10 meteorological station climate data which account for the 73 6 share of winter rice area table 2 the highest paddy area ratio was found in south central region zone f and the lowest was observed in western region zone e of bangladesh table 2 this study mainly focused on the zone c d f and g which have relatively larger share of paddies in the present study four climatic zones were used to estimate the dwr for better illustration of spatial variations 2 2 climate datasets generation temperature is expected to increase in the ganges basin moors et al 2011 whereas the trend for rainfall is less certain in bangladesh although rainfall is projected to increase in some cases yu et al 2010 there is uncertainty in the magnitude of the increased climate variables that vary with gcms and with emission scenarios and also decreases are possible in bangladesh extreme temperature and rainfall are projected to increase in future period kumar et al 2006 in view of the uncertainty we chose to use three gcms hadcm3 fgoals g1 0 and ipcm4 for this study the main advantage of using three gcms is that these can be used to compare weather data for projecting crop simulation reddy and pachepsky 2000 these three gcms provide a valuable dataset for climate change impact application particularly agriculture water resource management they are considered to be the most mature and popular gcms among others toews and allen 2009 because they have been frequently used in agricultural crop risk assessment in many parts of the world including bangladesh bannayan and eyshi rezaei 2014 islam et al 2017 although gcms contain significant uncertainties but they are very useful for predicting future climate under different conditions wilby et al 1999 furthermore these gcms have been extensively used in statistical downscaling of climate variables over bangladesh shahid 2011 kumar et al 2014 mainuddin et al 2015 the new version of lars wg 5 5 is capable of incorporating into 15 gcms with different scenarios used in the ipcc ar4 among the 15 gcms three gcms were employed in the study based on sres a1b scenario that it sees the future world as balances one which is characterized by rapid economic growth and introducing new efficient technology the ipcc data distribution center provides the three gcms outputs based on the sres a1b scenario http www ipcc data org the gcms that provide an outcome of the a1b scenario applied for the ipcc ar4 were chosen fgoals g1 0 china hadcm3 uk and ipcm4 france the outputs from three gcms climate models are utilized in this study which are summarized in table 3 for this purpose daily rainfall minimum and maximum temperature and sunshine hour data for the study area for the time period 1984 2013 were utilized the predicted changes in climate and their impacts need to be assessed relative to the baseline the baseline climate 1984 2013 is significantly different from the climate in the past years for example 1961 1990 it is noted that the new version of lars wg 5 5 model is allowed to use different baseline period so the daily observed weather data have been and continue to be used as reference baseline period climate in some studies of climate change kumar et al 2014 hadinia et al 2016 2 3 lars wg model lars wg is a stochastic weather generator and is used as a statistical downscaling method for simulating weather data at a single site under both current and future conditions semenov et al 1998 the lars wg uses the observed daily weather data for a given site to compute a set of parameters for fitting probability distributions as well as correlations between them which are employed to generate synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length by randomly selecting values from the appropriate distributions the lars wg model was downloaded from department of computational and systems biology rothamsted research uk website www rothamsted ac uk the process of generating synthetic weather data using lars wg model is divided into three steps first the calibration of lars wg model is done by using site analysis function which analyzes observed historical data for the period of 1984 2013 e g rainfall temperature and radiation at each station to determine their statistical characteristics and stores this information in two parameter files second the parameter files derived from observed weather data during the model calibration process are used to generate synthetic weather data having the same statistical characteristics as the historical observed data the validation of lars wg model is to analyze and compare the statistical characteristics of the observed and synthetic weather data to assess the ability of model to simulate rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation at selected sites to determine whether or not it is suitable for use in the present study third the parameter files derived from observed weather data during the model calibration process are also used to generate synthetic data but differing on a day to day basis which is similar to a particular climate change scenario simulated by gcms to generate climate scenario at a given site for a certain future period and an emission scenario the lars wg baseline parameters which are calculated from observed weather for the site for a baseline period for instance 1984 2013 are adjusted by the δ changes for the future period and the emissions predicted by a gcm for each climatic variable for the grid covering the site in the study the local scale climate scenario based on the sres a1b scenario simulated by the selected three gcms are downscaled by the lars wg 5 5 for three time periods 2011 2030 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 to predict the future change of rainfall temperature and solar radiation and to examine the dwr of winter paddy rice more detailed description of the lars wg modeling procedure can be referred to semenov 2002 2 4 gross irrigation water requirement giwr is the sum of net irrigation water requirement niwr and canal system management water requirement cmw for paddy rice fields as given in eq1 1 giwr niwr cmw niwr 1 wlrc where niwr is net irrigation water requirement mm and wlrc is water loss ratio in canal system water management cmw includes conveyance losses delivery losses and maintenance water losses khan 1992 reported it in irrigation management system in bangladesh as from 20 to 25 of the net irrigation water requirement for earth lining canal network jang et al 2007 applied a constant water loss ratio 20 to predict gross water demand for the paddy rice fields in south korea in this study we assumed a water loss ratio of 20 for estimating the giwr of each zone in bangladesh then we calculated the volumetric gross paddy water demand gpwd for each climatic zone by multiplying the estimated the giwr mm by the paddy area ha for scenario analysis the areas are taken as the 2012 2013 winter paddy rice areas based on climatic zones bbs 2014 2 4 1 net irrigation water requirement we calculated the niwr of the paddy rice field of each zone using the fao 56 water balance model shahid 2011 was applied this model for calculating niwr in the paddy boro rice field in northwest bangladesh the water balance model of the paddy rice field can be expressed in the following eq2 2 niwr et p lp wd ps erf where etp is crop evapotranspiration mm lp is water requirement for land preparation mm wd is water depth to establish ponding water level mm ps is the percolation and seepage losses of water in paddy field mm and erf is the effective rainfall mm 2 4 1 1 crop evapotranspiration we estimated the reference evapotranspiration eto on a daily basis using the climate data and the penman monteith equation as recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 and as shown in eq3 etp is estimated by multiplying eto and the crop coefficient kc for the same day as shown in eq4 3 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 4 et p k c et o where eto is reference crop evapotranspiration mm day δ the slope

estimating daily eto it is very small compared to rn net radiation which ignores in this study for daily eto calculation allen et al 1998 in this study we computed two missing parameters such as relative humidity and wind speed following the recommendations of allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient values were taken from the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 due to unavailability of local crop coefficient values in bangladesh the transplanting days and total irrigation periods of winter rice are defined as the end of december and starting from january 01 to may 5 2 4 1 2 land preparation and standing water level land preparation requires for cultivation of the paddy rice fields in bangladesh generally land is prepared in the end of december for irrigating dry season winter rice at the beginning of january a land preparation water depth of 150mm to 200mm was recommended to use for paddy rice transplanting in bangladesh meharg and rahman 2003 thus we assumed a land preparation water level of 150mm for this study according to the national irrigation water design standards badc 2010 the standing water depth of 50mm to 70mm in the rice field is expected for better winter rice yield during irrigation period banglapedia 2003 we considered a water depth of 50mm to establish standing water depth for winter rice fields in bangladesh 2 4 1 3 percolation and seepage losses the most of the paddy rice irrigation systems are developed in clay soil that have low percolation rates in bangladesh various experiments results demonstrated that average percolation rate varied from 3 to 6mm day between 30 and 70mm standing water depth during crop growing period brri 1990 mainuddin et al 2015 applied 3 0mm day of water percolates into paddy clay loam soil for the boro rice field in bangladesh during irrigation season we assumed a 3 0mm day percolation rate of paddy rice field 2 4 1 4 effective rainfall several universal empirical methods have found in the literature for estimating effective rainfall kuo et al 2006 e g fixed percentage of rainfall dependable rainfall empirical formula and usda soil conservation service method usda scs in this study we estimated effective rainfall using the empirical usda scs method this method was applied for modeling paddy irrigation requirement in india mohan et al 1996 taiwan kuo et al 2006 and south korea chung et al 2011 as given below in eq 5 6 5 r eff r tot 125 0 2 r tot 125 for r tot 250 m m 6 r eff 125 0 1 r tot for r tot 250 m m where reff is the effective rainfall mm rtot the total rainfall of the paddy rice growing season mm 2 5 design water requirement 2 5 1 drought of a 5 year return period and drought reference year in the last 50 years irrigation systems in bangladesh are vulnerable to drought risk for sequential years these sequential droughts have occurred once in a period of 5 years 1965 1966 1972 1973 1978 1979 1983 1984 1989 1990 1994 1995 1999 2000 and 2006 2007 parvin and saleh 2013 showed that average frequency of drought is about once in a 5 year return period using probability analysis of rainfall and crop water requirements in northwestern bangladesh therefore we considered a 5 year return period of a drought as a benchmark for estimating dwr for the design of agricultural water resource systems in bangladesh 2 5 2 frequency analysis we performed frequency analysis considering a 5 year return period drought in the study yoo et al 2012 applied the generalized logistic glo probability distribution function pdf for frequency analysis in south korea and also similar procedure was adopted for this study the procedures involved for frequency analysis are as follows first we constructed a time series of yearly giwr for each zone for the three gcms with a1b scenario ranging from 1984 to 2013 and the time periods of 2011 2099 then the weibull wbu pdf parameters were calculated using by maximum likelihood method mlm as recommended by fema 2005 third we examined the goodness of fit using the kolmogorov smirnov k s and anderson darling a d tests with data of each zone finally we estimated the dwr of a 5 year return period drought using the chosen optimal distribution function pdfs and chow frequency factor method chow 1951 the frequency factor method is expressed in the following eq 7 7 x t x σ k t where xt is a variate x a mean σ a standard deviation k a frequency factor while t is a return period the frequency factor can be determined from k t relationship for a specific distribution and magnitude x for the return period can be formulated using eq 7 for a given return period using frequency factor and the computed statistical parameters the procedures involved in determining parameters of pdfs and a return period estimation using the maximum likelihood method mlm are briefly described by rao and hamed 2000 2 6 calibration and validation of lars wg model the daily observed data during the period of 1984 2013 were used to calibrate and validate the lars ws model for 10 selected stations of bangladesh which represent the four climatic zones to evaluate the ability of lars wg in addition to the graphical comparison several statistical tests are also carried out the kolmogorov smirnov k s goodness of fit test is done on testing equality of the seasonal distributions of wet and dry series wdseries distributions of daily rainfall raind and distributions of daily maximum tmaxd minimum tmind and daily radiation radd calculated from observed weather data and generated downscaled data the t test is done on testing equality of monthly mean rainfall rmm monthly mean of daily maximum temperature tmaxm monthly mean of daily minimum temperature tminm and monthly mean of daily radiation radm the f test is done on testing equality of monthly variances of rainfall rmv calculated from observed weather data and generated data a p value of 0 05 is the significance level used in this study the test results present in table 4 where the numbers show how many tests give significantly different results out of the total number of tests of 8 or 12 at the 5 significance level a small number indicates a good performance of the lars wg model it is seen from table 4 that the average number of significant different results for wdseries was 0 7 out of eight the average number of significant results for the raind is 1 8 out of 12 for the rmm is 1 5 out of 12 and for the rmv is 1 6 out of 12 respectively the average numbers of significant results for tmind tminm tmaxd tmaxm radd and radm are either zero or close to 0 2 from these numbers it can be said that the lars wg model is more capable of simulating the monthly means and the daily rainfall temperature and solar radiation distributions of each month compared to the monthly variances the comparison of monthly mean of the generated and observed rainfall is shown in fig 3 for 10 representative stations as an example fig 3 depicts that there are good matches between the monthly mean of the generated and observed rainfall therefore the new version of lars wg 5 5 has great capacity in simulating rainfall and also temperature 3 results and discussions 3 1 projected monthly weather variations under climate change mean temperature was calculated from the projected maximum and minimum temperatures the ipcm4 gcms of the 2090s showed the highest temperature increase of 27 19 c while the fgoal gcms of the 2090s exhibited the lowest temperature increase of 25 66 cin comparison to baseline temperature increased by 2 35 3 65 c 1 86 3 30 c 1 66 3 2 c 1 72 3 57 c 1 82 3 42 c and 1 85 3 29 cin the month of december january february march april and may respectively during paddy rice growing seasons of the 2090s periods see appendix a table a1 the study demonstrates that rises in temperature are the most noticeable in the season the etp values are anticipated to be high as well as increased water demand after the 2055s time period the highest total rainfall of 80 18mm was found by the hadcm3 gcms of the 2090s whereas the lowest total rainfall of 54 48mm was observed using the ipcm4 gcms of the 2090s during the paddy growing season average monthly rainfall changed by 2 67 to 7 17mm 5 26 to 10 03mm and 4 93 to 15 68mm respectively for the three gcms table a1 appendix a the hadcm3 gcms indicates the largest variation in rainfall change s in particular winter crop growing seasons the amounts of mean solar radiation changed slightly by 0 07 0 16mj m2 0 08 to 0 05mj m2 0 10 to 0 06mj m2 respectively for three gcms table a1 appendix a it indicates that the increasing rate of solar radiation is relatively lower than the increasing rate of temperature in the study sites fig 4 displays the projected changes in temperature vs rainfall vs solar radiation for the period of 2020s 2055s and 2090s based on the sres a1b from the outputs of the fgoal hadcm3 and ipcm4 gcms the effect of global climate change is clear indicating itself in an average increase in temperature of 0 48 c for 2020s 1 54 c for 2055s and 2 77 c for 2090s respectively in the study site of bangladesh in addition higher evapotranspiration eto demand is to be expected in this point the solar radiation change has shown in the plot with predicted the radiation change of 0 3 for 2020s 0 07 for 2055s and 0 04 for 2090s correspondingly regarding rainfall change it is well displayed in the plot with projected mean shows a 3 13 decrease in rainfall for 2020s a 1 09 decrease for 2055s and a 6 08 decrease in rainfall for 2090s besides bangladesh is predicted to increase in mean temperature overall by 1 1 c by 2030 and by 1 6 c by 2050 and by 2 7 c by 2070 ipcc 2007 while rainfall is projected to decrease by 1 2 1 7 and 3 0 respectively for the same years this conclusion is consistent with the results of ipcc 2007 and acharjee et al 2017 but difference with an earlier climate change studies in bangladesh shahid 2010 and also most likely due to the differences in data period and methodology 3 2 spatial and temporal variations under climate change 3 2 1 changes in the crop evapotranspiration table 5 displays the computed crop evapotranspiration etp in the winter rice producing seasons for major climatic zones in the baseline period and three gcms under a1b scenario average etp of four zones for the baseline in the winter rice fields were 454 29mm for winter rice growing season the highest etp was found in zone g 491 29mm while the lowest etp was observed in the zone c 415 60mm average etp were 459 11mm 2020s 474 98mm 2055s and 487 43mm 2090s in the three periods for the fgoal gcms with increases by 7 29 in the 2090s in comparison to the baseline average etp of the four zones were 456 11mm 2020s 494 09mm 2055s and 518 07mm 2090s in the three periods for the hadcm3 gcms with increases by 0 39 8 76 and 14 03 in the 2020s 2055s and 2090s respectively the average change rates for the etp were 5 08 2020s 7 92 2055s and 13 98 2090s in the corresponding periods for the ipcm3 gcms the change rate of etp increased in four zones in the 2020s 2090s with zone d 15 28 resulting the highest increase in etp in the 2090s period table 5 four climatic zones exhibit an increasing tendency of the etp values within paddy rice growing season in all time periods and three gcms this is strongly confirmed by the increasing projected temperature change rates from 0 24 c to 0 62 c for four zones in the 2020s which was discussed in the previous section of the paper in addition the etp displayed an increasing tendency in all zones in the 2090s this suggests that the increased in etp during the corresponding periods due to the increased rate of temperature is more dominant than that of solar radiation increase rate in all zones shahid 2011 predicted an increase of etp by 5 8 2050s and 8 2075s during winter boro rice in northwestern bangladesh using the b2 scenario this study has found to be 9 56 2055s and 14 77 2085s using hadcm3 gcms for the same area zone d during winter rice season under a1b scenario mainuddin et al 2015 also projected an increase of etp by 4 2030s and 6 8 2050s under a1b scenario for the fgoalgcms for boro rice in northern bangladesh but this study estimated an increase of etp by 1 09 2020s and 4 42 2055s using fgoal gcms under similar a1b scenario in the same area zone c this is consistent with the findings of kirby et al 2016 where they show that potential evapotranspiration is projected to increase similarly by the 2050 for bangladesh a study by acharjee et al 2017 predicted a decline of etp by 6 5 and 10 9 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively for the 2050s and by 8 3 and 17 6 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively for the 2080s using five climate models in north west region of bangladesh the findings differ from the results of our study the longer duration of growing period of paddy rice may be caused for increasing the crop evapotranspiration in future similarly islam et al 2017 showed that an increased potential evapotranspiration will exceed the rainfall loss and lead to increase water demand in future decades 3 2 2 changes in the effective rainfall table 6 presents the projected effective rainfall erf values during rice growing season for the baseline period and three gcms in the four climatic zones in bangladesh the average erfs of winter rice fields for the baseline period were 152 95mm the highest erf in the winter rice fields calculated for the zone f was 191 14mm whereas the lowest erf computed for the zone d was 119 26mm the average erfs were 151 01mm 2020s 152 41 2055s and 147 58mm 2090s based on fgoal gcms and these average were lower than that of the baseline for all period except for the 2020s the erf increased in four zones in the 2020s except for the zone d the average erfs of four zones were 177 27mm 2020s 168 99mm 2055s and 185 34mm 2090s based on hadcm3 and these were 10 48 to 21 17 higher than that of the baseline period the erf increased in all zones of winter rice field based on the hadcm3 gcms except zone c where average change rates of erf decreased by 2 89 hadcm3 2055s the average rates of erfs were 7 06 2020s 7 54 2055s and 21 61 2090s for the ipcm4 gcms during all periods in case of icpm3 gcms the erf decreased in four zones except for the zone c in the 2020s table 6 the erf of all zones showed a decreasing trend during most of the period for the ipcm4 gcms on the contrary the erf of four zones exhibited an increasing tendency except in the 2055s for the hadcm3 gcms although there were some differences between the gcms used on other words the northwestern region of bangladesh includes zone d manifested a decreasing erf and central and southwestern regions including zone f and zone g showed the opposite trend this study found that increased in change rates of erf under the hadcm3 gcms which is similar of previous study shahid 2011 this finding contradicts with the earlier results of acharjee et al 2017 where they showed a considerable decrease of erf in northwestern bangladesh under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the high variations of rainy days rainfall amount and intensity in the paddy rice growing season in bangladesh may be caused for the higher differences in the erf values between the three gcms and periods high variations see appendix a table a1 in projected rainfall amount during the winter paddy rice growing periods can be observed in three gcms estimates these high variations in predicted rainfall reveal a major challenge for anticipatory agricultural water management policies in bangladesh however a major challenge of climate change will be to cope with the rainfall variability in future water demand the exact quantity by which potential crop water requirement will change remains uncertain due to a large variability in predicted rainfall amounts intensities and distributions 3 2 3 changes in the design water requirement the design water requirement dwr was derived from the giwr model of a 5 year return period using frequency analysis fig 5 shows the dwr in the baseline and future periods 2020s 2055s and 2090s for the three gcms under a1b scenario which are used to assess the regional trends of dwrs using the ordinary kriging interpolation technique the average dwrs in the four climatic zones for winter rice field were 1189mm for the baseline period the highest and lowest dwrs were 1248 52mm in the zone g and 1131 27mm in the zone f respectively for the baseline period regarding winter rice growing season the average dwrs were 1044 30mm 2020s 1185 54mm 2055s and 1203 74mm 2090s for the fgoal gcms corresponding periods which shows that the average increased by 1 24 only in the 2090s in comparison to the baseline period the average dwrs of four zones were 1136 12mm 2020s 1195 74mm 2055s and 1203 76mm 2090s for the hadcm3 gcms indicating that the average decreased by 4 44 only in the 2020s and increased by 0 57 and 1 25 in the 2055s and 2090s respectively the average dwrs were 1175 55mm 2020s 1215 37mm 2055s and 1268 55mm 2090s for the ipcm4 gcms exhibiting that the average increased by 02 22 and 6 69 in the 2055s and 2090s respectively in comparison to baseline the zones with the most significantly increased dwrs were zone c zone d and zone f with 1 62 7 03 2 97 7 23 2 27 and 7 67 in the 2055s and 2090s respectively the regional trends of the dwr are illustrated in fig 5 a general decreasing trend was observed in the 2020s in all zones for three gcms the gentle increasing trend in northern northwestern regions of bangladesh around zone c and d in the 2055s however zone f and g indicated a little decrease compare to the baseline the dwr in the 2090s demonstrated a similar to the trend of the 2055s under the fgoal gcms although there was an increase trend of the dwr in the 2055s for the zone c and zone d for the hadcm3 gcms and the dwr showed a significant decreasing trend in the central and southern region including zone f and g in the same period in the 2090s the dwr illustrated a sharp increased trend in all regions of bangladesh under hadcm3 gcms except zone g in comparison to baseline in case of ipcm4 gcms the dwr trend was a gentle increase for northern and western part of bangladesh in zone c d f and g in the 2055s and 2090s respectively while marginal decreased trend was observed in all zones in the 2020s however there are significant differences between the gcms the dwr demonstrated a sharp increase tendency in northern and northwestern regions for the three gcms in the 2055s and 2090s while a marginal decreased trend was detected in all regions of bangladesh for the gcms in the 2020s period warmer temperature associated with increased solar radiation leads to high etp which might be the major reason for increasing trend of dwr in the upcoming periods this study suggests that spatial variation of the dwr should be considered in the future planning and management of agricultural water resource in bangladesh this study also reveals a large impact an increase of 4 31 for fgoals 3 53 for hadcm3 and 11 16 for ipcm4 by 2090s based on sres a1b scenario on the dwr as well as changes on individual components including eto etp and erf however those higher individual components impact cannot offset for each other and the overall combined impact is a relatively higher change in the dwr climate change will increase the future water requirements of winter rice and it might be negatively affected rice yields a study carried out by karim et al 2012 in bangladesh showed that the yield of winter rice cultivar under climate change will be reduced by 33 in the end of the century development of a new rice variety may be useful in this case if farmers recognize and use any late transplanting winter rice cultivars that guarantee higher yield in the climate change scenarios the dwr can increase as well as the duration of growth period will increase it is anticipated that this finding sends a warming signal to the future winter paddy water management in bangladesh although the shorter duration of growing stage of crops will provide some advantage to increase the cropping intensity by growing multiple crops on a land per year as the dwr will increase in the future period as projected from our study the agricultural water demand during the dry winter season may also increase due to the shorter boro season to cultivate a multiple crops this can cause an increase in future water demand each year for crop agriculture such an increase in future water requirement is mainly reasoned by crop phenological responses under climate change and related agricultural practice changes in the agro ecosystems therefore the future agricultural practice decisions regarding the number of crops such as the cropping intensity and the duration of growing periods are vital for the water resources management of these regions 4 changes in the gross paddy water demand gross paddy water demand gpwd is to be assumed that there will be no change in the paddy areas in bangladesh for four climatic zones for the future periods total gpwds for winter rice fields for each climatic zone were estimated to be 20 96 millionkm3 for the baseline period fig 6 gross water demand of winter paddy rice was projected to be increased the rates of change in the three gcms under a1b scenario by 11 16 ipcm4 gcms 2090s 6 27 ipcm4 gcms 2055s 4 31 fgoal gcms 2090s and 3 53 hadm3 gcms 2090s except decreased by 3 01 hadcm3 gcms 2020s from the baseline from the results it is clear that the highest increasing change rate of the gpwd will occur in the 2090s especially underipcm4 gcms from the baseline for winter paddy rice in bangladesh these increasing change rates of gross paddy water demand should be taken into consideration in the planning and management of future irrigation water resource the rates of change for both the gpwd and dwr were significant with values above 3 due to less compensating effects between the evapotranspiration and effective rainfall this finding is in disagreement with the recent study conducted in south korea where the average change rates of the pwd and dwr were not significant yoo et al 2012 5 conclusions our results showed that the etp increased from the baseline in most of the period due to temperature rises in all gcms and periods this is because the increasing rate of temperature is relatively higher than the increasing rate of solar radiation the erf values increasing decreasing rates are lesser than that of rainfall during the winter rice growing season except for the fgoal 2020s and 2055s and hadcm3 2020s gcms the dwrs revealed an increase in most of the gcms and periods the change rates of the gpwd for the three gcms ranged between 0 56 and 4 31 fgoal 3 01 and 3 53 hadcm3 and 2 98 and 11 16 ipcm4 the average change rates of the dwr of winter rice for four climatic zones were up to 6 compared to the baseline prediction revealed a significant decline in future winter rainfall with enhanced higher temperature might lead to high change rates of the dwr for winter rice it is assumed that climate change impacts on the dwr and gpwd will affect significantly in winter rice growing season at regional scale in bangladesh however the results demonstrated that southwestern region exhibited a decrease in dwr while it increased in northern and northwestern regions in bangladesh for future water management of these regions particularly to conserve groundwater resources as an alternative option only paddy water demand management will not be a better option so an integrated policy takes into consideration the dwr management the cropping patterns and conservation of recharge potential areas will be a good solution some future agricultural practices e g the preparation of a good crop calendar development of new rice varieties identification of optimal transplanting date can be implemented based on the outcomes of design water requirement and gross paddy water demand anticipatory water management planning at regional and national level coping with future climate change should include suitable measures related to future irrigation demand to deal with climatic uncertainties thus for future agricultural water management planning development of flexible adaptation strategies or pathways in relation to changes in dwr may be effective to adapt to future climate change condition in particular the spatial and temporal variations in the dwr of winter paddy rice for the upcoming periods should be taken into account in agricultural water resources management although this study has focused only on the dry season winter paddy rice it has some limitation for instance cropping practices such as transplanting date shorter or longer growing period and crop varieties may be affected by temperature and rainfall variations and hence affect the dwrs the three gcms outputs including climate data and uncertainty of downscaled lars wg model may have caused some setback in precision of our results in addition the gross irrigation water requirement giwr model used various assumptions such as land preparation water depth standing water level percolation and seepage and water loss ratio due to limited access to bangladesh s soil data and water management practices future studies concentrating on the following will be necessary comparing with multi gcms ensemble models with various scenarios improving the downscaling method changing the rates of water requirements at the local level and considering different cropping patterns though the applicability of this finding is limited this can be used as basic tools in the development of water resources management in terms of capacity and capability besides it is expected that the outcomes of this study will be applied in minimizing the drought risk countermeasure and implementing agriculture water resource policies in

11612,the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector are tremendous thus it is essential to determine its impacts on agricultural water resources and to minimize adverse effects on crop production the present study aims to simulate climate data based on sres a1b scenario from the outputs of three general circulation models gcms namely fgoal hadcm3 and ipcm4 and examine the design water requirement dwr of winter paddy using frequency analysis under climate change condition in bangladesh the average change rates of dwr in four climatic zones were compared to baseline and the results were 12 16 2020s 0 28 2055s and 1 25 2090s for the fgoal 4 44 2020s 0 57 2055s and 1 25 2090s for the hadcm3 and 1 12 2020s 2 22 2055s and 6 69 2090s for the ipcm4 the change rates of gross paddy water demand gpwd for three gcms ranged from 3 01 to 11 16 in both cases of the dwr and gpwd the change rates were above 3 indicating a warning signal to the future winter paddy water management the outcomes of this study can be used as basic data for the development of agricultural water resource management which will help to minimize the drought risk and to implement future agricultural water resource policies in bangladesh keywords crop production design water requirement climate change scenario gross paddy water demand drought risk 1 introduction nowadays climate change is one of the greatest threats that our planet faces climate change directly affects global and regional agriculture and irrigation systems puma and cook 2010 hong et al 2016 it is generally accepted that the agricultural sector of developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries mostly because of low capacity and infrastructure to adapt to changing climate being a developing country bangladesh is also facing tremendous challenges from climate change particularly for its agricultural based economy consequently irrigation water requirements in bangladesh will increase in the upcoming decades due to the rises in temperature changes in rainfall pattern and solar radiation in addition agricultural sector of bangladesh is expected to face rising competition for water resources from other sectors according to the ministry of water resources of bangladesh 86 of total water usage is attributed to the agricultural sector and 70 is consumed to paddy rice cultivation chowdhury 2010 the design water requirement of paddy rice is vital to the optimal design and operation of agricultural water resources systems however profound knowledge regarding the change rates of design rice water requirement at regional and national levels in bangladesh is still significant for the better understanding of climate change and its multidimensional impacts bangladesh has now become a self sufficient rice producing country because irrigation has intensified rice production winter rice is one of the main dry season crops of bangladesh which fully depends on irrigation the total amount of water used for winter rice has increased considerably over the last three decades because of intensive irrigated agriculture in bangladesh intensive irrigated agriculture is the outcome of water shortages during dry seasons from january to april shahid 2008 additionally groundwater is heavily used for irrigated agriculture due to shortage of surface water resources and this has led to decline of groundwater levels during the dry season any change of rice water requirement as affected by climate change and then needs to be thorough studied and the results require managing rice water requirement drought risk shahid and behrawan 2008 groundwater sustainability kirby et al 2015 and future climate change impacts mainuddin et al 2015 kirby et al 2016 are considered serious challenges for irrigation water management and they have recently received the significant attention in bangladesh hence irrigation water management in bangladesh has concentrated mainly on protecting the paddy rice areas from the possible risk of drought under climate change because sustaining food security and further increasing paddy rice production in bangladesh is considered a top priority the present study has focused solely on one of the most critical factors namely the effects of future climate change on design water requirement of paddy rice in order to be able to adapt to the changing climate a clear understanding of water requirement changes in response to the variations in the climate variables can help in the planning and management of agricultural water resources ipcc 2014 wang et al 2015 as the agricultural sector is a climate sensitive it is necessary to understand how climate change affects agricultural water resources for sustainable agriculture particularly paddy rice production in bangladesh future water security depends on climate change and water requirements for irrigation hong et al 2016 it is essential to know how much water is required for irrigation to help agricultural sustainability and food security under current and future climate change scenarios bangladesh is already recognized as one of the worst victims of climate change ipcc 2007 the ipcc 2007 predicts that climate patterns in bangladesh will change due to the rising global temperature the rainfall temperature and solar radiation vary with season to season and location wise each year bangladesh face mild to severe drought for instance northwestern area has been known as drought prone regions of the country islam et al 2017 drought is very sensitive to climate and varies in year to year one of the important problem in drought analysis deals with past record of an events in terms of future probabilities of occurrence the procedure for estimating frequency of occurrence of a drought event is usually done by frequency analysis though rainfall is erratic in nature temperature varies season with time and space it is possible to predict design water requirement dwr under climate change condition using frequency analysis in fact drought frequency analysis is a basic tool for safe and economic planning and design of future agricultural water management hosking and wallis 1997 reported that planning for water related management design of irrigation structure all rely on knowledge of the frequency of the extreme events such as drought storm and flood there is no widely accepted procedure to predict the dwr under climate change condition this is why the evaluation of design water requirement as embodied with probability distribution function pdf relationship has been a major focus of both theoretical and applied agricultural water resources management anticipating the effects of climate change and adapting to them is one of the ways to reduce vulnerability to the potential adverse impacts prodanovic and simonovic 2007 so a frequency analysis has an application for predicting the design water requirement on probability basis that is irreplaceable it is generally acknowledged that general circulation models gcms are the key tools to assess future climate change at large scale xu 1999 the main limitation of gcms is the coarse horizontal resolution which limits their capability to resolve processes at local scale wilby and wigley 1997 to resolve this problem it is of necessary to adjust the changes of large scale predictions of gcms to the changes of local scale climate variables the technique used to convert gcm outputs into local climate variables are generally done by downscaling methods there are various methods for downscaling gcms outputs which fall into two categories e g i dynamic and ii statistical downscaling fowler et al 2007 among several downscaling methods lars wg long ashton research station weather generator semenov et al 1998 model has the advantage of less data require and has been extensively used in the climate change impact studies islam et al 2017 kumar et al 2014 another advantage is that 15 gcms outputs with various scenarios have been included in the lars wg model to better dealing with gcms uncertainties several studies have been carried out on future water requirements of paddy rice affected by climate change at local and global scales which can be found in literature for example de silva et al 2007 assessed the paddy irrigation water requirement iwr in sri lanka and the iwr predicted by 13 23 increase under sresb2 and a2 scenarios using datasets from the hadcm3outputs rodriguez diaz et al 2007 studied in the guadalquivir basin in spain and found that the seasonal iwr would be increased between 15 and 20 by the 2050s undera2 and b2 scenarios elgaali et al 2007 modeled in the arkansas basin in colorado and projected irrigation water demand an increase of 5 2050s and 9 2090s when using the hadcm2 gcms outputs chung et al 2011 projected the total volumetric decreases of 4 2050s and 10 2080s of the iwr in south korea based on the hadcm3 outputs for the a2 and b2 scenarios yoo et al 2012 also projected the average change rates of the design water requirement dwr of wet season paddy below 3 under sres a1b a2 and b1 scenarios in south korea when using climate datasets from the cgcm 3 1 gcms outputs gondim et al 2012 in the jaguaribe river basin brazil and rehana and mujumdar 2013 in bhadra reservoir area in india found the impacts of climate change to be increased of paddy rice iwr and a change in crop evapotranspiration etc lee and huang 2014 predicted an increase of 7 2050s of iwr of paddy rice in taiwan hadinia et al 2016 studied climate change impacts on rice water requirement in iran and found that average rice water requirement will increase for the upcoming periods most of the previous studies predicted that rice water requirement will increase under climate change scenarios even though the effect of projected changes in rainfall on the iwr is offsetting by the effect of projected changes in other climate variables such as temperature solar radiation in bangladesh shahid 2011 predicted the changes of the iwr in the dry season boro rice field in northwest bangladesh under sres b2 scenario mainuddin et al 2015 estimated the impact of climate change on the iwr of dry season crops in bangladesh and confirmed to increase by a maximum of 3 of the boro paddy iwr for the 2050s dry condition using the a1b scenario based on the hadcm3 and fgoals gcm outputs recently acharjee et al 2017 investigated the future impacts of climate change on the iwr of dry season boro rice in north west bangladesh and found that net irrigation requirement of boro rice will decrease by 1 6 in 2050s and 7 4 in 2080s using the rcp 8 5 scenario based on five gcm models these earlier studies in bangladesh have focused on the changes of crop evapotranspiration etc and the net irrigation requirement nir however the study of design water requirement for paddy rice under climate change condition has not been undertaken in bangladesh therefore the research of climate change impacts on the dwr for winter paddy rice in bangladesh which accounts for a maximum agricultural water usage need to be introduced as a matter of concern motivated by the above mentioned facts the main objective of this study is to predict design water requirement and gross water demand for winter paddy rice in the major climatic zones of bangladesh under climate change we simulated a database of future climate data 2011 2099 using the three gcms outputs and downscaled by the lars wg model under sres a1bscanario this study focuses on changes in the spatial and temporal trends in the dwr of winter paddy in bangladesh however for the first time in bangladesh a study of climate change predicting design water requirement using frequency analysis for winter paddy rice has been carried out it is anticipated that this study will be guideline for regional water managers agriculturalists and decision makers in understanding the impacts of future climate change and also contributes to implement agricultural water resource polices in bangladesh for achieving sustainable food security 2 data and methods in this study the daily historical climate data e g minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and sunshine hours as well as solar radiation were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for a 30 year period 1984 2013 the procedures for calculating design water requirement dwr are displayed in fig 1 2 1 study area and climatic zones of paddy rice the study area is located between india and myanmar in southeast asia 20 34 26 38 n latitude and 88 01 92 41 e longitude bangladesh enjoys the subtropical monsoon climate and has four distinct seasons including winter spring summer and autumn islam et al 2017 about 80 of the country s annual rainfall occurs during the summer season and the annual average total rainfall is 2428mm the annual average temperature is 25 7 c where the lowest temperature is 7 2 c in january and the highest temperature is 31 1 c in august obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd three rice cropping patterns such as winter rice boro summer rice aus and monsoon rice aman are distributed widely in bangladesh according to climatic responses we considered only winter paddy rice rice grown from december to may because this rice variety covers about 86 of irrigated area and also supplying about 95 of the total water for irrigation however summer rice and monsoon rice may occasionally need supplementary irrigation only occupying about 3 of irrigated area for this reason we ignore those rice cropping patterns in the present study the total cultivated winter paddy rice area has increased from 1 6 million ha 1984 to 5 5 million ha 2013 winter rice produced about 58 of total production in 2013 and the paddy area has changed significantly during the last 30 years period bbs 2014 bangladesh meteorological department bmd has 34 weather stations although all stations do not have long term observed data record because some of them are newly established and few stations have missing data for long periods in this study 10 meteorological stations were selected which represent major climatic zones of winter paddy rice areas fig 2 and table 1 bangladesh has divided into seven climatic zones that are suggested by national encyclopedia of bangladesh banglapedia 2003 out of seven zones four climatic zones zone c d f and g were taken into consideration using 10 meteorological station climate data which account for the 73 6 share of winter rice area table 2 the highest paddy area ratio was found in south central region zone f and the lowest was observed in western region zone e of bangladesh table 2 this study mainly focused on the zone c d f and g which have relatively larger share of paddies in the present study four climatic zones were used to estimate the dwr for better illustration of spatial variations 2 2 climate datasets generation temperature is expected to increase in the ganges basin moors et al 2011 whereas the trend for rainfall is less certain in bangladesh although rainfall is projected to increase in some cases yu et al 2010 there is uncertainty in the magnitude of the increased climate variables that vary with gcms and with emission scenarios and also decreases are possible in bangladesh extreme temperature and rainfall are projected to increase in future period kumar et al 2006 in view of the uncertainty we chose to use three gcms hadcm3 fgoals g1 0 and ipcm4 for this study the main advantage of using three gcms is that these can be used to compare weather data for projecting crop simulation reddy and pachepsky 2000 these three gcms provide a valuable dataset for climate change impact application particularly agriculture water resource management they are considered to be the most mature and popular gcms among others toews and allen 2009 because they have been frequently used in agricultural crop risk assessment in many parts of the world including bangladesh bannayan and eyshi rezaei 2014 islam et al 2017 although gcms contain significant uncertainties but they are very useful for predicting future climate under different conditions wilby et al 1999 furthermore these gcms have been extensively used in statistical downscaling of climate variables over bangladesh shahid 2011 kumar et al 2014 mainuddin et al 2015 the new version of lars wg 5 5 is capable of incorporating into 15 gcms with different scenarios used in the ipcc ar4 among the 15 gcms three gcms were employed in the study based on sres a1b scenario that it sees the future world as balances one which is characterized by rapid economic growth and introducing new efficient technology the ipcc data distribution center provides the three gcms outputs based on the sres a1b scenario http www ipcc data org the gcms that provide an outcome of the a1b scenario applied for the ipcc ar4 were chosen fgoals g1 0 china hadcm3 uk and ipcm4 france the outputs from three gcms climate models are utilized in this study which are summarized in table 3 for this purpose daily rainfall minimum and maximum temperature and sunshine hour data for the study area for the time period 1984 2013 were utilized the predicted changes in climate and their impacts need to be assessed relative to the baseline the baseline climate 1984 2013 is significantly different from the climate in the past years for example 1961 1990 it is noted that the new version of lars wg 5 5 model is allowed to use different baseline period so the daily observed weather data have been and continue to be used as reference baseline period climate in some studies of climate change kumar et al 2014 hadinia et al 2016 2 3 lars wg model lars wg is a stochastic weather generator and is used as a statistical downscaling method for simulating weather data at a single site under both current and future conditions semenov et al 1998 the lars wg uses the observed daily weather data for a given site to compute a set of parameters for fitting probability distributions as well as correlations between them which are employed to generate synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length by randomly selecting values from the appropriate distributions the lars wg model was downloaded from department of computational and systems biology rothamsted research uk website www rothamsted ac uk the process of generating synthetic weather data using lars wg model is divided into three steps first the calibration of lars wg model is done by using site analysis function which analyzes observed historical data for the period of 1984 2013 e g rainfall temperature and radiation at each station to determine their statistical characteristics and stores this information in two parameter files second the parameter files derived from observed weather data during the model calibration process are used to generate synthetic weather data having the same statistical characteristics as the historical observed data the validation of lars wg model is to analyze and compare the statistical characteristics of the observed and synthetic weather data to assess the ability of model to simulate rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation at selected sites to determine whether or not it is suitable for use in the present study third the parameter files derived from observed weather data during the model calibration process are also used to generate synthetic data but differing on a day to day basis which is similar to a particular climate change scenario simulated by gcms to generate climate scenario at a given site for a certain future period and an emission scenario the lars wg baseline parameters which are calculated from observed weather for the site for a baseline period for instance 1984 2013 are adjusted by the δ changes for the future period and the emissions predicted by a gcm for each climatic variable for the grid covering the site in the study the local scale climate scenario based on the sres a1b scenario simulated by the selected three gcms are downscaled by the lars wg 5 5 for three time periods 2011 2030 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 to predict the future change of rainfall temperature and solar radiation and to examine the dwr of winter paddy rice more detailed description of the lars wg modeling procedure can be referred to semenov 2002 2 4 gross irrigation water requirement giwr is the sum of net irrigation water requirement niwr and canal system management water requirement cmw for paddy rice fields as given in eq1 1 giwr niwr cmw niwr 1 wlrc where niwr is net irrigation water requirement mm and wlrc is water loss ratio in canal system water management cmw includes conveyance losses delivery losses and maintenance water losses khan 1992 reported it in irrigation management system in bangladesh as from 20 to 25 of the net irrigation water requirement for earth lining canal network jang et al 2007 applied a constant water loss ratio 20 to predict gross water demand for the paddy rice fields in south korea in this study we assumed a water loss ratio of 20 for estimating the giwr of each zone in bangladesh then we calculated the volumetric gross paddy water demand gpwd for each climatic zone by multiplying the estimated the giwr mm by the paddy area ha for scenario analysis the areas are taken as the 2012 2013 winter paddy rice areas based on climatic zones bbs 2014 2 4 1 net irrigation water requirement we calculated the niwr of the paddy rice field of each zone using the fao 56 water balance model shahid 2011 was applied this model for calculating niwr in the paddy boro rice field in northwest bangladesh the water balance model of the paddy rice field can be expressed in the following eq2 2 niwr et p lp wd ps erf where etp is crop evapotranspiration mm lp is water requirement for land preparation mm wd is water depth to establish ponding water level mm ps is the percolation and seepage losses of water in paddy field mm and erf is the effective rainfall mm 2 4 1 1 crop evapotranspiration we estimated the reference evapotranspiration eto on a daily basis using the climate data and the penman monteith equation as recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 and as shown in eq3 etp is estimated by multiplying eto and the crop coefficient kc for the same day as shown in eq4 3 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 4 et p k c et o where eto is reference crop evapotranspiration mm day δ the slope

t the mean daily air temperature at 2m height c es the saturation vapor pressure kp a and ea the actual vapor pressure kp a in general the daily g soil heat flux density value is nearly zero for estimating daily eto it is very small compared to rn net radiation which ignores in this study for daily eto calculation allen et al 1998 in this study we computed two missing parameters such as relative humidity and wind speed following the recommendations of allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient values were taken from the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 due to unavailability of local crop coefficient values in bangladesh the transplanting days and total irrigation periods of winter rice are defined as the end of december and starting from january 01 to may 5 2 4 1 2 land preparation and standing water level land preparation requires for cultivation of the paddy rice fields in bangladesh generally land is prepared in the end of december for irrigating dry season winter rice at the beginning of january a land preparation water depth of 150mm to 200mm was recommended to use for paddy rice transplanting in bangladesh meharg and rahman 2003 thus we assumed a land preparation water level of 150mm for this study according to the national irrigation water design standards badc 2010 the standing water depth of 50mm to 70mm in the rice field is expected for better winter rice yield during irrigation period banglapedia 2003 we considered a water depth of 50mm to establish standing water depth for winter rice fields in bangladesh 2 4 1 3 percolation and seepage losses the most of the paddy rice irrigation systems are developed in clay soil that have low percolation rates in bangladesh various experiments results demonstrated that average percolation rate varied from 3 to 6mm day between 30 and 70mm standing water depth during crop growing period brri 1990 mainuddin et al 2015 applied 3 0mm day of water percolates into paddy clay loam soil for the boro rice field in bangladesh during irrigation season we assumed a 3 0mm day percolation rate of paddy rice field 2 4 1 4 effective rainfall several universal empirical methods have found in the literature for estimating effective rainfall kuo et al 2006 e g fixed percentage of rainfall dependable rainfall empirical formula and usda soil conservation service method usda scs in this study we estimated effective rainfall using the empirical usda scs method this method was applied for modeling paddy irrigation requirement in india mohan et al 1996 taiwan kuo et al 2006 and south korea chung et al 2011 as given below in eq 5 6 5 r eff r tot 125 0 2 r tot 125 for r tot 250 m m 6 r eff 125 0 1 r tot for r tot 250 m m where reff is the effective rainfall mm rtot the total rainfall of the paddy rice growing season mm 2 5 design water requirement 2 5 1 drought of a 5 year return period and drought reference year in the last 50 years irrigation systems in bangladesh are vulnerable to drought risk for sequential years these sequential droughts have occurred once in a period of 5 years 1965 1966 1972 1973 1978 1979 1983 1984 1989 1990 1994 1995 1999 2000 and 2006 2007 parvin and saleh 2013 showed that average frequency of drought is about once in a 5 year return period using probability analysis of rainfall and crop water requirements in northwestern bangladesh therefore we considered a 5 year return period of a drought as a benchmark for estimating dwr for the design of agricultural water resource systems in bangladesh 2 5 2 frequency analysis we performed frequency analysis considering a 5 year return period drought in the study yoo et al 2012 applied the generalized logistic glo probability distribution function pdf for frequency analysis in south korea and also similar procedure was adopted for this study the procedures involved for frequency analysis are as follows first we constructed a time series of yearly giwr for each zone for the three gcms with a1b scenario ranging from 1984 to 2013 and the time periods of 2011 2099 then the weibull wbu pdf parameters were calculated using by maximum likelihood method mlm as recommended by fema 2005 third we examined the goodness of fit using the kolmogorov smirnov k s and anderson darling a d tests with data of each zone finally we estimated the dwr of a 5 year return period drought using the chosen optimal distribution function pdfs and chow frequency factor method chow 1951 the frequency factor method is expressed in the following eq 7 7 x t x σ k t where xt is a variate x a mean σ a standard deviation k a frequency factor while t is a return period the frequency factor can be determined from k t relationship for a specific distribution and magnitude x for the return period can be formulated using eq 7 for a given return period using frequency factor and the computed statistical parameters the procedures involved in determining parameters of pdfs and a return period estimation using the maximum likelihood method mlm are briefly described by rao and hamed 2000 2 6 calibration and validation of lars wg model the daily observed data during the period of 1984 2013 were used to calibrate and validate the lars ws model for 10 selected stations of bangladesh which represent the four climatic zones to evaluate the ability of lars wg in addition to the graphical comparison several statistical tests are also carried out the kolmogorov smirnov k s goodness of fit test is done on testing equality of the seasonal distributions of wet and dry series wdseries distributions of daily rainfall raind and distributions of daily maximum tmaxd minimum tmind and daily radiation radd calculated from observed weather data and generated downscaled data the t test is done on testing equality of monthly mean rainfall rmm monthly mean of daily maximum temperature tmaxm monthly mean of daily minimum temperature tminm and monthly mean of daily radiation radm the f test is done on testing equality of monthly variances of rainfall rmv calculated from observed weather data and generated data a p value of 0 05 is the significance level used in this study the test results present in table 4 where the numbers show how many tests give significantly different results out of the total number of tests of 8 or 12 at the 5 significance level a small number indicates a good performance of the lars wg model it is seen from table 4 that the average number of significant different results for wdseries was 0 7 out of eight the average number of significant results for the raind is 1 8 out of 12 for the rmm is 1 5 out of 12 and for the rmv is 1 6 out of 12 respectively the average numbers of significant results for tmind tminm tmaxd tmaxm radd and radm are either zero or close to 0 2 from these numbers it can be said that the lars wg model is more capable of simulating the monthly means and the daily rainfall temperature and solar radiation distributions of each month compared to the monthly variances the comparison of monthly mean of the generated and observed rainfall is shown in fig 3 for 10 representative stations as an example fig 3 depicts that there are good matches between the monthly mean of the generated and observed rainfall therefore the new version of lars wg 5 5 has great capacity in simulating rainfall and also temperature 3 results and discussions 3 1 projected monthly weather variations under climate change mean temperature was calculated from the projected maximum and minimum temperatures the ipcm4 gcms of the 2090s showed the highest temperature increase of 27 19 c while the fgoal gcms of the 2090s exhibited the lowest temperature increase of 25 66 cin comparison to baseline temperature increased by 2 35 3 65 c 1 86 3 30 c 1 66 3 2 c 1 72 3 57 c 1 82 3 42 c and 1 85 3 29 cin the month of december january february march april and may respectively during paddy rice growing seasons of the 2090s periods see appendix a table a1 the study demonstrates that rises in temperature are the most noticeable in the season the etp values are anticipated to be high as well as increased water demand after the 2055s time period the highest total rainfall of 80 18mm was found by the hadcm3 gcms of the 2090s whereas the lowest total rainfall of 54 48mm was observed using the ipcm4 gcms of the 2090s during the paddy growing season average monthly rainfall changed by 2 67 to 7 17mm 5 26 to 10 03mm and 4 93 to 15 68mm respectively for the three gcms table a1 appendix a the hadcm3 gcms indicates the largest variation in rainfall change s in particular winter crop growing seasons the amounts of mean solar radiation changed slightly by 0 07 0 16mj m2 0 08 to 0 05mj m2 0 10 to 0 06mj m2 respectively for three gcms table a1 appendix a it indicates that the increasing rate of solar radiation is relatively lower than the increasing rate of temperature in the study sites fig 4 displays the projected changes in temperature vs rainfall vs solar radiation for the period of 2020s 2055s and 2090s based on the sres a1b from the outputs of the fgoal hadcm3 and ipcm4 gcms the effect of global climate change is clear indicating itself in an average increase in temperature of 0 48 c for 2020s 1 54 c for 2055s and 2 77 c for 2090s respectively in the study site of bangladesh in addition higher evapotranspiration eto demand is to be expected in this point the solar radiation change has shown in the plot with predicted the radiation change of 0 3 for 2020s 0 07 for 2055s and 0 04 for 2090s correspondingly regarding rainfall change it is well displayed in the plot with projected mean shows a 3 13 decrease in rainfall for 2020s a 1 09 decrease for 2055s and a 6 08 decrease in rainfall for 2090s besides bangladesh is predicted to increase in mean temperature overall by 1 1 c by 2030 and by 1 6 c by 2050 and by 2 7 c by 2070 ipcc 2007 while rainfall is projected to decrease by 1 2 1 7 and 3 0 respectively for the same years this conclusion is consistent with the results of ipcc 2007 and acharjee et al 2017 but difference with an earlier climate change studies in bangladesh shahid 2010 and also most likely due to the differences in data period and methodology 3 2 spatial and temporal variations under climate change 3 2 1 changes in the crop evapotranspiration table 5 displays the computed crop evapotranspiration etp in the winter rice producing seasons for major climatic zones in the baseline period and three gcms under a1b scenario average etp of four zones for the baseline in the winter rice fields were 454 29mm for winter rice growing season the highest etp was found in zone g 491 29mm while the lowest etp was observed in the zone c 415 60mm average etp were 459 11mm 2020s 474 98mm 2055s and 487 43mm 2090s in the three periods for the fgoal gcms with increases by 7 29 in the 2090s in comparison to the baseline average etp of the four zones were 456 11mm 2020s 494 09mm 2055s and 518 07mm 2090s in the three periods for the hadcm3 gcms with increases by 0 39 8 76 and 14 03 in the 2020s 2055s and 2090s respectively the average change rates for the etp were 5 08 2020s 7 92 2055s and 13 98 2090s in the corresponding periods for the ipcm3 gcms the change rate of etp increased in four zones in the 2020s 2090s with zone d 15 28 resulting the highest increase in etp in the 2090s period table 5 four climatic zones exhibit an increasing tendency of the etp values within paddy rice growing season in all time periods and three gcms this is strongly confirmed by the increasing projected temperature change rates from 0 24 c to 0 62 c for four zones in the 2020s which was discussed in the previous section of the paper in addition the etp displayed an increasing tendency in all zones in the 2090s this suggests that the increased in etp during the corresponding periods due to the increased rate of temperature is more dominant than that of solar radiation increase rate in all zones shahid 2011 predicted an increase of etp by 5 8 2050s and 8 2075s during winter boro rice in northwestern bangladesh using the b2 scenario this study has found to be 9 56 2055s and 14 77 2085s using hadcm3 gcms for the same area zone d during winter rice season under a1b scenario mainuddin et al 2015 also projected an increase of etp by 4 2030s and 6 8 2050s under a1b scenario for the fgoalgcms for boro rice in northern bangladesh but this study estimated an increase of etp by 1 09 2020s and 4 42 2055s using fgoal gcms under similar a1b scenario in the same area zone c this is consistent with the findings of kirby et al 2016 where they show that potential evapotranspiration is projected to increase similarly by the 2050 for bangladesh a study by acharjee et al 2017 predicted a decline of etp by 6 5 and 10 9 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively for the 2050s and by 8 3 and 17 6 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively for the 2080s using five climate models in north west region of bangladesh the findings differ from the results of our study the longer duration of growing period of paddy rice may be caused for increasing the crop evapotranspiration in future similarly islam et al 2017 showed that an increased potential evapotranspiration will exceed the rainfall loss and lead to increase water demand in future decades 3 2 2 changes in the effective rainfall table 6 presents the projected effective rainfall erf values during rice growing season for the baseline period and three gcms in the four climatic zones in bangladesh the average erfs of winter rice fields for the baseline period were 152 95mm the highest erf in the winter rice fields calculated for the zone f was 191 14mm whereas the lowest erf computed for the zone d was 119 26mm the average erfs were 151 01mm 2020s 152 41 2055s and 147 58mm 2090s based on fgoal gcms and these average were lower than that of the baseline for all period except for the 2020s the erf increased in four zones in the 2020s except for the zone d the average erfs of four zones were 177 27mm 2020s 168 99mm 2055s and 185 34mm 2090s based on hadcm3 and these were 10 48 to 21 17 higher than that of the baseline period the erf increased in all zones of winter rice field based on the hadcm3 gcms except zone c where average change rates of erf decreased by 2 89 hadcm3 2055s the average rates of erfs were 7 06 2020s 7 54 2055s and 21 61 2090s for the ipcm4 gcms during all periods in case of icpm3 gcms the erf decreased in four zones except for the zone c in the 2020s table 6 the erf of all zones showed a decreasing trend during most of the period for the ipcm4 gcms on the contrary the erf of four zones exhibited an increasing tendency except in the 2055s for the hadcm3 gcms although there were some differences between the gcms used on other words the northwestern region of bangladesh includes zone d manifested a decreasing erf and central and southwestern regions including zone f and zone g showed the opposite trend this study found that increased in change rates of erf under the hadcm3 gcms which is similar of previous study shahid 2011 this finding contradicts with the earlier results of acharjee et al 2017 where they showed a considerable decrease of erf in northwestern bangladesh under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the high variations of rainy days rainfall amount and intensity in the paddy rice growing season in bangladesh may be caused for the higher differences in the erf values between the three gcms and periods high variations see appendix a table a1 in projected rainfall amount during the winter paddy rice growing periods can be observed in three gcms estimates these high variations in predicted rainfall reveal a major challenge for anticipatory agricultural water management policies in bangladesh however a major challenge of climate change will be to cope with the rainfall variability in future water demand the exact quantity by which potential crop water requirement will change remains uncertain due to a large variability in predicted rainfall amounts intensities and distributions 3 2 3 changes in the design water requirement the design water requirement dwr was derived from the giwr model of a 5 year return period using frequency analysis fig 5 shows the dwr in the baseline and future periods 2020s 2055s and 2090s for the three gcms under a1b scenario which are used to assess the regional trends of dwrs using the ordinary kriging interpolation technique the average dwrs in the four climatic zones for winter rice field were 1189mm for the baseline period the highest and lowest dwrs were 1248 52mm in the zone g and 1131 27mm in the zone f respectively for the baseline period regarding winter rice growing season the average dwrs were 1044 30mm 2020s 1185 54mm 2055s and 1203 74mm 2090s for the fgoal gcms corresponding periods which shows that the average increased by 1 24 only in the 2090s in comparison to the baseline period the average dwrs of four zones were 1136 12mm 2020s 1195 74mm 2055s and 1203 76mm 2090s for the hadcm3 gcms indicating that the average decreased by 4 44 only in the 2020s and increased by 0 57 and 1 25 in the 2055s and 2090s respectively the average dwrs were 1175 55mm 2020s 1215 37mm 2055s and 1268 55mm 2090s for the ipcm4 gcms exhibiting that the average increased by 02 22 and 6 69 in the 2055s and 2090s respectively in comparison to baseline the zones with the most significantly increased dwrs were zone c zone d and zone f with 1 62 7 03 2 97 7 23 2 27 and 7 67 in the 2055s and 2090s respectively the regional trends of the dwr are illustrated in fig 5 a general decreasing trend was observed in the 2020s in all zones for three gcms the gentle increasing trend in northern northwestern regions of bangladesh around zone c and d in the 2055s however zone f and g indicated a little decrease compare to the baseline the dwr in the 2090s demonstrated a similar to the trend of the 2055s under the fgoal gcms although there was an increase trend of the dwr in the 2055s for the zone c and zone d for the hadcm3 gcms and the dwr showed a significant decreasing trend in the central and southern region including zone f and g in the same period in the 2090s the dwr illustrated a sharp increased trend in all regions of bangladesh under hadcm3 gcms except zone g in comparison to baseline in case of ipcm4 gcms the dwr trend was a gentle increase for northern and western part of bangladesh in zone c d f and g in the 2055s and 2090s respectively while marginal decreased trend was observed in all zones in the 2020s however there are significant differences between the gcms the dwr demonstrated a sharp increase tendency in northern and northwestern regions for the three gcms in the 2055s and 2090s while a marginal decreased trend was detected in all regions of bangladesh for the gcms in the 2020s period warmer temperature associated with increased solar radiation leads to high etp which might be the major reason for increasing trend of dwr in the upcoming periods this study suggests that spatial variation of the dwr should be considered in the future planning and management of agricultural water resource in bangladesh this study also reveals a large impact an increase of 4 31 for fgoals 3 53 for hadcm3 and 11 16 for ipcm4 by 2090s based on sres a1b scenario on the dwr as well as changes on individual components including eto etp and erf however those higher individual components impact cannot offset for each other and the overall combined impact is a relatively higher change in the dwr climate change will increase the future water requirements of winter rice and it might be negatively affected rice yields a study carried out by karim et al 2012 in bangladesh showed that the yield of winter rice cultivar under climate change will be reduced by 33 in the end of the century development of a new rice variety may be useful in this case if farmers recognize and use any late transplanting winter rice cultivars that guarantee higher yield in the climate change scenarios the dwr can increase as well as the duration of growth period will increase it is anticipated that this finding sends a warming signal to the future winter paddy water management in bangladesh although the shorter duration of growing stage of crops will provide some advantage to increase the cropping intensity by growing multiple crops on a land per year as the dwr will increase in the future period as projected from our study the agricultural water demand during the dry winter season may also increase due to the shorter boro season to cultivate a multiple crops this can cause an increase in future water demand each year for crop agriculture such an increase in future water requirement is mainly reasoned by crop phenological responses under climate change and related agricultural practice changes in the agro ecosystems therefore the future agricultural practice decisions regarding the number of crops such as the cropping intensity and the duration of growing periods are vital for the water resources management of these regions 4 changes in the gross paddy water demand gross paddy water demand gpwd is to be assumed that there will be no change in the paddy areas in bangladesh for four climatic zones for the future periods total gpwds for winter rice fields for each climatic zone were estimated to be 20 96 millionkm3 for the baseline period fig 6 gross water demand of winter paddy rice was projected to be increased the rates of change in the three gcms under a1b scenario by 11 16 ipcm4 gcms 2090s 6 27 ipcm4 gcms 2055s 4 31 fgoal gcms 2090s and 3 53 hadm3 gcms 2090s except decreased by 3 01 hadcm3 gcms 2020s from the baseline from the results it is clear that the highest increasing change rate of the gpwd will occur in the 2090s especially underipcm4 gcms from the baseline for winter paddy rice in bangladesh these increasing change rates of gross paddy water demand should be taken into consideration in the planning and management of future irrigation water resource the rates of change for both the gpwd and dwr were significant with values above 3 due to less compensating effects between the evapotranspiration and effective rainfall this finding is in disagreement with the recent study conducted in south korea where the average change rates of the pwd and dwr were not significant yoo et al 2012 5 conclusions our results showed that the etp increased from the baseline in most of the period due to temperature rises in all gcms and periods this is because the increasing rate of temperature is relatively higher than the increasing rate of solar radiation the erf values increasing decreasing rates are lesser than that of rainfall during the winter rice growing season except for the fgoal 2020s and 2055s and hadcm3 2020s gcms the dwrs revealed an increase in most of the gcms and periods the change rates of the gpwd for the three gcms ranged between 0 56 and 4 31 fgoal 3 01 and 3 53 hadcm3 and 2 98 and 11 16 ipcm4 the average change rates of the dwr of winter rice for four climatic zones were up to 6 compared to the baseline prediction revealed a significant decline in future winter rainfall with enhanced higher temperature might lead to high change rates of the dwr for winter rice it is assumed that climate change impacts on the dwr and gpwd will affect significantly in winter rice growing season at regional scale in bangladesh however the results demonstrated that southwestern region exhibited a decrease in dwr while it increased in northern and northwestern regions in bangladesh for future water management of these regions particularly to conserve groundwater resources as an alternative option only paddy water demand management will not be a better option so an integrated policy takes into consideration the dwr management the cropping patterns and conservation of recharge potential areas will be a good solution some future agricultural practices e g the preparation of a good crop calendar development of new rice varieties identification of optimal transplanting date can be implemented based on the outcomes of design water requirement and gross paddy water demand anticipatory water management planning at regional and national level coping with future climate change should include suitable measures related to future irrigation demand to deal with climatic uncertainties thus for future agricultural water management planning development of flexible adaptation strategies or pathways in relation to changes in dwr may be effective to adapt to future climate change condition in particular the spatial and temporal variations in the dwr of winter paddy rice for the upcoming periods should be taken into account in agricultural water resources management although this study has focused only on the dry season winter paddy rice it has some limitation for instance cropping practices such as transplanting date shorter or longer growing period and crop varieties may be affected by temperature and rainfall variations and hence affect the dwrs the three gcms outputs including climate data and uncertainty of downscaled lars wg model may have caused some setback in precision of our results in addition the gross irrigation water requirement giwr model used various assumptions such as land preparation water depth standing water level percolation and seepage and water loss ratio due to limited access to bangladesh s soil data and water management practices future studies concentrating on the following will be necessary comparing with multi gcms ensemble models with various scenarios improving the downscaling method changing the rates of water requirements at the local level and considering different cropping patterns though the applicability of this finding is limited this can be used as basic tools in the development of water resources management in terms of capacity and capability besides it is expected that the outcomes of this study will be applied in minimizing the drought risk countermeasure and implementing agriculture water resource policies in

11613,it is very significant to study the impact of deficit irrigation on crop growth and water use under the future scenarios with elevated co2 concentrations and reduced water availability this study investigated the growth and yield differences of maize grown in a phytotron in response to elevated co2 concentrations under different irrigation treatments two irrigation treatments were carried out regular irrigation ri and deficit irrigation di in which the irrigation amounts were respectively 100 and 70 of evapotranspiration et with four co2 concentrations 400 550 700 and 900μmolmol 1 thus eight treatments i e ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 di400 di550 di700 and di900 were included in this study results show that the relative reductions of stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr in response to elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than ri thus causing leaf temperature tleaf rose higher under di due to the transpiration cooling effect as photosynthetic rate pn and its physiological process were positively correlated with tleaf the relative increases of pn and the resulting maximum leaf area index laimax total dry matter weight tdw and grain yield gy react to elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than ri as well as the leaf water use efficiency wuel and water productivity wp the di900 treatment in which the irrigation amount was reduced by 30 only decreased the tdw and gy by 7 and 5 when compared with ri900 the variation of gy was consistent with the variation of kernels per ear kpe but was not directly related to hundred grain weight hgw the above results show that when atmospheric co2 concentrations rise in the future deficit irrigation would be an effective way of saving water and would not only have a mitigating effect on water crises but would also contribute to improving wp which is more important in terms of actual production keywords co2 concentration deficit irrigation photosynthesis growth yield water productivity 1 introduction it is estimated that by the end of the 21st century atmospheric co2 concentration will have reached 936μmolmol 1 if we do not take measures to reduce emissions ipcc 2013 there have been researches about elevated co2 concentration effects on crops and vegetables since 1970s gifford 1977 1979 ludlow and wilson 1971 the experimental equipment was mainly including enclosed chambers kang et al 1996 open top chambers meng et al 2014 and free air co2 enrichment technology leakey et al 2006 the elevation of atmospheric co2 concentration would have a significant impact on crop growth oliver et al 2009 because it increases net photosynthetic rate pn which would likely increase plant height h leaf area index lai total dry weight tdw and grain yield gy ainsworth and rogers 2007 kang et al 1996 meng et al 2014 it would also reduce stomatal conductance gs leading to a smaller than proportional decrease in transpiration rate tr and total evapotranspiration et allen et al 2003 bernacchi et al 2007 bunce 2004 vanuytrecht et al 2012 this would ultimately mean that there would be a significant increase in the importance of water productivity wp idso et al 1987 kang et al 2002 li et al 2003 vanuytrecht et al 2012 together with co2 concentration the controlled variables also covered water kang et al 2002 nitrogen li et al 2003 temperature cai et al 2016 ozone ainsworth 2008 transplanting density lai et al 2014 etc among which water stress was the top factor that considered a number of current studies have emphasized the effects of the interaction of elevated co2 concentration and water stress on crop growth water consumption and yield islam et al 2012 qiao et al 2010 saadi et al 2015 samarakoon and gifford 1996 wall et al 2011 the data of pn gy irrigation amounts and wue in these references showed that elevated co2 concentration benefit crops more under drought conditions than well watered conditions a number of previous studies have also shown that elevated co2 concentration only affect photosynthesis and grain yield of maize a c4 crop under drought conditions kim et al 2007 kimball 2016 leakey et al 2006 manderscheid et al 2014 rogers et al 1983 while several other co2 enrichment studies with maize grown under controlled environment conditions showed an increase of c4 photosynthesis and biomass production under sufficient water supply driscoll et al 2006 kang et al 2002 king and greer 1986 loomis and lafitte 1987 morison and gifford 1984 ziska and bunce 1997 the different results among these literatures may be due to the experimental equipments and some other experimental conditions that need further investigation the elevated co2 concentration will result in the intensity and frequency of climate extremes such as heat waves heavy precipitation and drought oliver et al 2009 and the availability of water will rapidly decrease ipcc 2014 water shortage is already a serious problem in northwest china kang et al 2002 wang et al 2012 and water availability will almost certainly decrease even further under climate change ipcc 2007 zhao et al 2010 posing a huge challenge for food

demand of evapotranspiration may lead to some drought before re irrigation according to the above literatures it may benefit crops to some extent with elevated co2 concentrations in the future but how about the deficit irrigation the interactive impacts of elevated co2 concentrations such as the projected concentration of 900μmolmol 1 under rcp 8 5 by the end of this century ipcc 2013 and deficit irrigation on growth and yield of c4 plants like maize are not yet completely unraveled and deserve further investigation despite there are many researches about the interactive effects of co2 concentration and water stress on crops there is still a lack of experimental studies addressing the response of crops to elevated co2 concentrations and irrigation methods whether deficit irrigation still makes positive effect along with elevated co2 concentration or not is needed to contribute to an in depth understanding of the changing environment and therefore of great significance in arid and semi arid areas aljazairi et al 2015 vu and allen 2009 a commonly used cultivar of maize zea mays l cultivar qiangsheng 51 in northwest china has been planted for this study two irrigation treatments and four co2 concentrations have been designed in order to analyze the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on stomatal response growth characteristics yield evapotranspiration water use efficiency and water productivity under regular and deficit irrigation our objective is to explore whether the deficit irrigation method would save water and at the same time benefit maize more than regular irrigation thus providing a fundamental research and a reference point for irrigation management decision in agriculture in semi arid areas under elevated co2 concentrations in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the experiment was conducted from may to september 2015 in the climate phytotron at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province in northwest china n 37 52 e 102 50 altitude 1581m fig 1 the climate phytotron consisted of four separate chambers of 3 m length by 4 m width by 2 5 m height and was supplied with natural light each chamber had the same indoor equipments the different parameters set in the phytotron and their range of variation are shown in table 1 air temperature relative humidity and co2 concentration were set automatically through a digital program timer at different time periods in a closed control cabinet fig 2 a indoor temperature was controlled by an electric heating warming and a compressor cooling relative humidity was adjusted by an ultrasonic humidifier humidifying and a heat transfer valve dehumidifying both were controlled within the accuracy range table 1 a co2 sensor was used to measure indoor co2 concentration and co2 gas was provided by a co2 gas cylinder through a pipe fig 2a when the co2 concentration target was set a control system automatically calculated aeration time according to the flow rate of the co2 gas cylinder and the difference between the target and current co2 concentrations with the consumption of co2 in the chamber the above control method was repeated to maintain the target co2 level fresh air was inhaled from outside the chamber by a blower evenly distributed throughout the chamber from the bottom and then extracted through the upper wall to circulate the air the indoor wind speed was less than 0 5ms 1 2 2 experimental design the maize zea mays l cultivar qiangsheng 51 used in the experiment was planted in plastic pots of 26 5cm height 21cm and 33cm bottom and top diameter respectively three seeds were sown in each plastic pot initially and one seedling retained after emergence the experiment was conducted in climatic chambers during the whole growth period from the date of sowing may 7 to harvest september 16 the pots were filled with local sandy loam soil after being air dried crushed and sieved each pot had 18kg of soil with a dry bulk density of 1 38gcm 3 and a field water capacity of 0 27cm3 cm 3 little stones were spread over the bottom of each pot with fine sand acting as a filtration layer the surface of the soil was then covered with fine sand and nutritive soil to reduce the impact of irrigation on the topsoil structure the same fertilization scheme was applied in each pot which was 1 5g urea and 1 5g diammonium phosphate on may 29 june 19 july 10 july 29 and august 27 in addition a foliar spray of 250ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution was used at a concentration of 2 on may 29 june 19 july 20 and august 5 experimental meteorological conditions were set according to the 10 day averages of observed meteorological data from may to september of the previous six years at the experimental station their adjustment frequencies are shown in table 1 natural light was utilized the experiment consisted of two irrigation treatments namely regular irrigation ri which was similar to the local water management and deficit irrigation di in which the irrigation amounts were 100 and 70 of evapotranspiration et and four co2 concentrations of 400 current atmospheric co2 concentration 550 700 and 900μmolmol 1 both regular and deficit irrigation were carried out at the same time and with the same frequency in the four chambers the crops and the corresponding co2 concentrations were interchanged once randomly within the four chambers in the later half maize period there were eight treatments altogether ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 di400 di550 di700 and di900 each treatment had six pot replicates placed in a row fig 2b and the two rows were switched position after each weighing to ensure the regular emergence and growth of maize there was no water deficit during the seedling stage after which the deficit treatment was implemented the experimental pots were weighed every three to four days by high precision weighing scales for the basis of the irrigation amount and measuring cylinders were used for measuring the irrigation water manually the irrigation amount of each growth stage is shown in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 co2 concentrations co2 concentrations in the chambers were monitored and recorded at 1s intervals using the co2 gas sensors in the phytotron the daily variations of the average values of four co2 concentrations from 8 00 to 20 00 are shown in fig 3 a 2 3 2 meteorological data conventional meteorological data in each chamber including photosynthetic active radiation par air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed u were continuously observed by a portable automatic weather station hobo u30 onset computer corp usa and a multi functional automatic anemometer velocicalc 9565 tsi inc usa the data were sampled every 5s interval and 15min averages were calculated and recorded using a data logger the daily average meteorological data in the chamber during the experimental period are shown in fig 3b 2 3 3 photosynthetic parameters stomatal conductance of water vapor diffusion gs transpiration rate tr leaf temperature tleaf and net photosynthetic rate pn of maize leaves were measured using a li 6400 type photosynthesis system li cor inc usa the second leaves of three representative plants undergoing the same treatment were randomly selected for measurement the daily variations of the photosynthetic parameters of each treatment were recorded at two hourly intervals from 8 00 to 18 00 on july 10 july 17 and august 15 2 3 4 crop growth and yield parameters three plants representative of each treatment were randomly selected to measure leaf length maximum leaf width and plant height using steel tapes every seven to ten days after the emergence of maize the leaf area was calculated by summing the leaf length multiplied by the maximum leaf width and then multiplied by a conversion factor of 0 74 li et al 2008 the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was defined as the ratio of leaf area to the soil surface area in the plastic pots the stem dry weight sdw leaf dry weight ldw root dry weight rdw hundred grain weight hgw kernels per ear kpe and grain yield gy of maize were measured using the oven drying method on september 16 when harvesting and four plants representative of each treatment were selected specific leaf area sla cm2 g 1 was defined as the ratio of lai to ldw the harvest index hi was defined as the ratio of gy to total dry weight tdw 2 3 5 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was calculated using the following water balance method and the average of three replications 1 e t i p w d r δ s where et is the crop evapotranspiration mm i the irrigation amount mm p the precipitation mm w the capillary rise to the root zone mm d the drainage from the root zone mm r the surface runoff mm and δs the change in soil water storage mm since the maize was grown in pots and irrigation was applied carefully there was no surface runoff and groundwater supply a tray was put below every pot to collect drainage or water leakage however there was no overly saturated water and leakage observed from the trays because the water supplements were controlled by the et between two irrigations and there was no rain in the chambers either therefore eq 1 can be simplified as follows 2 e t i δ s 2 3 6 leaf water use efficiency leaf water use

and the significant test of the average values of each parameter under different treatments although there was only one chamber of each co2 concentration and the pots of the same treatment were placed in a row we interchanged the chambers at the later growth stage and switched the crop rows after each weighing and also the observation parameters were measured randomly so the variables can be treated as random factors the significance level was set at 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on photosynthetic parameters of maize under deficit irrigation the effects of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on the stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr of maize are shown in fig 4 a d the figure shows that gs and tr decreased with the enrichment of co2 concentrations under both ri and di compared with ri400 gs and tr were 27 and 23 lower under di400 for the elevated co2 concentrations gs and tr were 22 36 and 25 26 lower under di when compared with ri relative reductions in gs and tr due to the di treatment were therefore more pronounced along with elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 decreased gs by 13 22 and 33 and tr by 12 23 and 38 respectively compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 decreased gs by 8 27 and 41 and tr by 16 27 and 41 respectively therefore the relative reductions in gs and tr caused by elevated co2 concentrations were mostly higher under di than under ri this was because under di the crop suffered from water stress which affected the leaves and roots so the guard cells reduced the solute in the cells by regulating their own metabolic processes to increase water potential thus causing stomata closure stalfelt 1959 yu and wang 2010 water deficit was also able to change the intracellular co2 concentrations ci by affecting photosynthesis plant hormones and ph etc which also caused stomata closure schulze 1986 1993 sharkey 1984 yu and wang 2010 the stomata reduction was therefore aggravated by the combined effect of deficit irrigation and elevated co2 concentrations so the elevated co2 concentration effect on stomatal closure was higher under di since stomata control is the most important way to regulate tr yu and wang 2010 tr had the same variation patterns as gs the effect of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on the leaf temperature tleaf is shown in table 3 it shows that tleaf was increased along with the elevated co2 concentrations but it was only significant under di compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased tleaf by 1 9 3 5 and 5 0 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased tleaf by 2 4 4 0 and 5 7 respectively hence the relative increase in tleaf caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri leaf temperature was highly correlated with tr under most conditions pallas et al 1967 and it was obvious to see that the higher tr was shown in the markedly lower tleaf and vice versa namely the so called transpiration cooling effect pallas et al 1967 so when the elevated co2 concentration reduced tr the tleaf increased also with the decrease in soil water in di condition tr was decreasing meanwhile tleaf rose more remarkable than that only under elevated co2 conditions as tr cannot be ignored in the changes of tleaf cook et al 1964 gates 1964 and tr changes were more pronounced under di so as to the changes of tleaf fig 4e and f show the effect of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on net photosynthetic rate pn net photosynthetic rate increased with the enrichment of co2 concentration compared with ri400 pn was 24 lower under di400 for the elevated co2 concentrations pn was 15 20 lower under di when compared with ri relative reductions in pn due to the di treatment were therefore weakened along with elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased pn by 30 45 and 59 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased pn by 37 51 and 77 respectively therefore the increased percentage of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri the result was the same with those in many studies kang et al 2002 robredo et al 2007 van der kooi et al 2016 this was because both water deficit and elevated co2 concentrations reduced the rubisco enzyme content and activity vu et al 1998 thus weakening the calvin cycle and increasing the ci in bundle sheath cells at the same time the reduced gs caused by the two factors also increased ci by 86 di400 94 di550 75 di700 and 15 di900 μmolmol 1 when compared with that under ri condition with the same co2 concentrations data were measured in our experiment but not shown in the tables on the other hand the leaf temperature rose higher under di it was 0 10 di400 0 26 di550 0 25 di700 and 0 31 di900 c higher than under ri when co2 concentrations were the same table 3 since pn was positive correlated with ci robredo et al 2007 and within the optimum temperature ranges for photosynthesis at 30 40 c berry and björkman 1980 long 1999 ludlow and wilson 1971 mjwara and botha 1993 wardlaw 1979 a slight increase in leaf temperature resulted in a substantial increase in the pn of maize due to the positive effect on the photosynthetic biochemical reactions and physical processes ghannoum et al 2000 yu and wang 2010 the relative increase of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri 3 2 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on the growth and yield of maize under deficit irrigation the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on the maximum leaf area index laimax maximum height h max maximum stem diameter sdmax and specific leaf area sla under different irrigation treatments are shown in table 4 di400 decreased laimax h max and sd max by 18 21 and 5 respectively but increased sla by 4 when compared with ri400 for elevated co2 concentrations di decreased laimax h max and sd max by 0 13 7 8 and 1 4 but increased sla by 6 16 when compared with ri relative reductions in laimax h max and sd max caused by di were therefore weakened while relative increases in sla caused by di were enhanced along with elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased lai max by 1 2 and 6 h max by 5 7 and 10 and sd max by 1 1 and 11 respectively compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased lai max by 8 17 and 29 h max by 22 26 and 29 and sd max by 2 4 and 16 respectively hence the relative increases in laimax h max and sd max caused by elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than under ri this was because the increased percentages of pn and tleaf caused by elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than under ri see section 3 1 since the photosynthesis can form 90 95 of biomass zelitch 1982 and a slight increase in leaf temperature between 30 35 c was good for crop growth wardlaw 1979 watts 1971 the relative increases in laimax h max and sd max were higher under di compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 decreased sla by 9 19 and 36 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 decreased sla by 2 15 and 34 respectively the reduced percentage of sla caused by elevated co2 concentrations was therefore lower under di than under ri elevated co2 concentrations reduced sla which was the leaf area per leaf weight possibly because they increased pn so that dry matter accumulation was first stored in the leaves rather than in the leaf extension within per unit leaf weight mamatha et al 2014 yelle et al 1990 moreover the redistribution of excess carbohydrates into older leaves under high co2 concentrations contributes more to leaf weight than to leaf area thus reducing sla kimball et al 2002 the reduced percentage of sla caused by elevated co2 concentrations was lower under di than under ri this might have been because the absolute pn dry matter accumulation and leaf area were small under di conditions and photosynthate was used for leaf expansion first of all rather than for storage in the per unit leaf weight to receive more light by increasing the leaf area which was good for increasing photosynthate under disadvantage conditions that maybe the crop ability to survive from a bad soil water environment and gain the drought tolerance so that the reduced percentage of sla caused by elevated co2 concentrations was lower under di the effects of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on the dry matter in different plant parts and the grain yield of maize are shown in table 5 the leaf dry weight ldw stem dry weight sdw root dry weight rdw grain yield per plant gy and total dry weight tdw at harvest time increased under elevated co2 concentrations the dry matter under di was lower than under ri compared with ri400 the ldw sdw rdw gy and tdw under di400 was 16 34 25 21 and 26 lower respectively while under elevated co2 concentrations the ldw sdw rdw gy and tdw under di was 6 9 10 20 8 15 5 20 and 7 19 lower respectively when compared with ri therefore the reduced percentages of gy and tdw caused by di were weakened along with the elevated co2 concentrations that was because the increased percentage of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di and the fertilization effect of co2 concentration was more significant under di leakey et al 2006 which offset the negative effect of di the interesting thing was that under the co2 concentration of 900μmolmol 1 the reduced percentages of gy and tdw caused by di were at their lowest and not significantly different at 5 and 7 respectively that may because the higher the co2 concentration the greater the fertilization effect was under di conditions so when the irrigation amount was reduced by 30 the di did not significantly affect the growth of maize under elevated co2 concentrations recent studies have suggested that in the future as co2 concentrations and temperatures increase extreme rainfall events will be more frequent in spring in northwest china but in summer and autumn the precipitation frequency will be reduced gao et al 2015 guo et al 2016 changes in precipitation patterns could lead to a mismatch between natural precipitation and the demand for water of crops causing frequent seasonal droughts and seriously restricting the improvement of productivity wang et al 2015 in this case applying moderate deficit irrigation to crops during the planting season could save irrigation water and decrease gy slightly this could mitigate food reduction and water crises as co2 concentrations increase in the future table 5 also shows that compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased ldw by 5 21 and 40 sdw by 9 19 and 38 rdw by 25 36 and 65 gy by 23 31 and 44 and tdw by 18 33 and 46 respectively however compared with di400 di550 di700 di90 increased ldw by 31 67 and 71 sdw by 18 31 and 55 rdw by 42 64 and 137 gy by 25 44 and 74 and tdw by 30 57 and 82 respectively accordingly the increased percentage of dry matter caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri this was due to the fact that the increased percentage of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was greater under di than under ri resulting in a greater increase in the percentage of dry matter accumulation in this study elevated co2 concentrations increased gy and tdw by 24 59 and 24 64 respectively which was close to the results obtained with the same or similar co2 concentrations cure and acock 1986 guo 2003 long et al 2006 meng et al 2014 the changed percentages of gy and tdw were similar in the reports compiled by many researchers ainsworth et al 2008 van der kooi et al 2016 however the increased effects on gy and tdw caused by co2 enrichment differ slightly in this study when compared with the results obtained in some of the other literature on the subject for example the results obtained by ziska and bunce 1997 and samarakoon and gifford 1996 show that elevated co2 concentrations can increase the total biomass of maize in wet soil but the effect was not significant which differed from our conclusions however in a dry soil environment tdw increased by 54 due to elevated co2 levels which was a similar result to that given in this study the response of tdw to elevated co2 concentrations in a dry environment or under di treatment was very clear the reasons for the different results in a wet environment may include the followings 1 our regular irrigation ri was conducted every three to four day according to the et that consumed by the crops it was not an absolute non drought soil environment when compared with other literature the crops may suffer from some slight drought periods before renewed access to irrigation which may cause the significant results 2 the irrigation frequency for the crops was performed more or less on a daily basis in previous studies which was more frequent than in our study where it was carried out every three to four days and studies have shown that gy and tdw decrease significantly with increased irrigation frequency tian et al 2016 3 this study was conducted in arid and semi arid areas where the crop was highly dependent on water which led to a more sensitive response to increased co2 concentrations 4 most previous studies set two constant temperatures day and night but we set a sine curve for the temperature during the daytime and a natural temperature at night according to the average temperature calculated at the experimental station over many years according to the study of hu 1963 increasing the temperature differential between day and night is beneficial to the growth and development of maize 5 the experimental period in previous studies was short about 30 60days but in this study it covered the entire growth season about 133days which also resulted in a difference in biomass or yield at the final harvest all the above explanations may cause the different result from other studies in a wet soil environment but the increased percentages of gy and tdw caused by co2 enrichment under di or drought are higher than under ri or wet is beyond doubt the effects of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on hundred grain weight hgw kernels per ear kpe and harvest index hi are shown in table 6 in which elevated co2 concentrations had no significant effects on hgw and hi but kpe increased with a rise in co2 concentrations there was no significant difference in terms of hgw between di and ri under the same co2 concentration di400 di550 di700 and di900 decreased kpe by 21 20 13 and 5 respectively however when compared with ri under the same co2 concentration the higher the co2 concentration the lower the reduced percentage of kpe caused by di compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased kpe by 23 31 and 44 respectively but compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased it by 25 44 and 74 the increased percentage of kpe caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri this accorded with the variation in gy which would indicate that the variety in terms of gy was mainly determined by the variety in kpe under different irrigation and co2 concentration treatments but that there was no direct relation to variations in hgw there were no significant effects in terms of elevated co2 concentrations on the hi but di increased hi by 5 15 when compared with ri which means that di can improve hi this is consistent with many previous studies kang et al 2000 zhang et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 although other studies have shown that hi decreases with increasing water stress bolaños and edmeades 1993 farré and faci 2006 muchow 1989 the different results may be due to the fact that in our experiment the level of di did not reach a level that could significantly reduce hi this might also be due to the different dependence of hi on irrigation levels in different studies where the experimental areas have different climate conditions drought or wet further research is therefore needed on this 3 3 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on maize evapotranspiration under deficit irrigation the effects of co2 concentrations on maize evapotranspiration et under ri and di are shown in fig 5 it shows that when the amount of irrigation was reduced by 30 under di et was 30 lower than that under ri under both ri and di et decreased first to a minimum value at 700μmolmol 1 and then increased with an elevation in co2 concentrations this was because although elevated co2 concentrations reduced gs and tr they increased lai offsetting the reduction in canopy conductance caused by reduced gs and tr hileman et al 1994 kang et al 1996 wullschleger et al 2002 also reported that the canopy conductance only decreased by 14 when gs decreased by 44 due to the elevation of co2 concentration from 394μmolmol 1 to 538μmolmol 1 the impact of an elevated co2 concentration on et was therefore small and even when the co2 concentration reached a certain high value et increased oliver et al 2009 also note that the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on et are wide ranging and can remain at a reduced level cech et al 2003 owensby et al 1997 or remain unchanged ellsworth 1999 qiao et al 2010 or even increase tricker et al 2009 uddling et al 2008 compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 decreased et by 15 18 and 13 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 decreased et by 10 14 and 10 respectively accordingly the reduced percentage of et caused by elevated co2 concentrations was less under di than under ri the result was similar to the findings of samarakoon and gifford 1996 and kang et al 2002 as mentioned previously although the decrease in tr caused by elevated co2 concentrations was 2 4 higher under di than under ri the increased percentage of lai was higher 7 23 so the offset effect of the increased lai on the decreased tr was more obvious thus the impact of elevated co2 concentrations on et was smaller under di than under ri 3 4 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on water use efficiency and water productivity of maize under deficit irrigation the effects of different irrigation treatments and elevated co2 concentrations on leaf water use efficiency wuel and water productivity wp are shown in table 7 it shows that wuel and wp increased with the elevation of co2 concentrations in both irrigation treatments so that the results were the same as the results obtained in previous studies idso et al 1987 kang et al 2002 leakey et al 2006 li et al 2003 meng et al 2014 oliver et al 2009 compared with ri400 wuel was 8 lower with di400 but wp was 10 higher as far as the elevated co2 concentrations were concerned di increased wuel and wp by 4 12 and 10 15 therefore the increased percentages of wuel and wp caused by di grew along with the elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased wuel by 52 91 and 185 and wp by 48 64 and 88 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased wuel by 72 120 and 251 and wp by 50 74 and 102 respectively accordingly the increased percentages of wuel and wp caused by elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than under ri that was because at the leaf level according to eq 3 when the numerator pn increased and the denominator tr decreased the result wuel came out to increase and since the increased percentage of pn and the reduced percentage of tr were both higher under di than under ri see section 3 1 the increased percentage of wuel caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri at the canopy level there was a similar situation of wp to wuel i e when the numerator tdw increased and the denominator et decreased the result wp came out to increase according to eq 4 the increased percentage of tdw 11 36 was much higher than the decreased percentage of et 3 5 under di than under ri thus the increased percentage of wp caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri this was the same as the result obtained by allen et al 2011 using a similar co2 concentration the improvement of water use efficiency and water productivity was more significant than the improvement of pn and yield chaves and pereira 1992 especially in the case of water deficit conditions water deficit reduced crop production while increased co2 concentrations not only reduced water consumption but also increased yield the results of this study show that the increased proportion of wp caused by co2 enrichment was more under di this would provide a strong theoretical basis for conducting irrigation water management under elevated co2 concentrations in the future 4 conclusions in this study we explored the different effects of elevated co2 concentration on stomatal conductance transpiration rate leaf temperature photosynthetic rate evapotranspiration crop growth biomass parameters yield parameters leaf water use efficiency and water productivity among which the effect on leaf temperature was only discussed in this study under two different irrigation methods and the results show that the elevated co2 concentration would benefit maize crops more under deficit irrigation which can save a lot of water than regular irrigation method which was similar to the local water management although the elevated co2 concentration and deficit irrigation decreased the absolute value of stomatal conductance and transpiration rate but the leaf temperature increased more due to the transpiration cooling effect then promoted the photosynthetic rate the crop growth and the yield weakening the disadvantages of deficit irrigation on maize plants some of our results under regular irrigation were different from those of other literature in wet soil conditions that was because the maize grown in regular irrigation conditions may suffer from slight drought before re irrigation and the environment was not absolutely non water stressed also the irrigation frequency was quite different from other references which may cause different results and need to be considered in the future whatever our study revealed that under future climate change deficit irrigation is not only an efficient water saving method but also can benefit crops more with lowest yield reduction and highest water productivity however the irrigation amount of this study only considered two gradients i e the regular irrigation and deficit irrigation in which the irrigation amounts were 100 and 70 of evapotranspiration respectively which would create some limitations of the research also there were no irrigation frequency planting density and nitrogen treatments taking into account which are also very important factors in the crop growth periods and may cause different results when considering the co2 concentration effect more consideration is needed in the future s research acknowledgement we are grateful for the support from the national natural science

11613,it is very significant to study the impact of deficit irrigation on crop growth and water use under the future scenarios with elevated co2 concentrations and reduced water availability this study investigated the growth and yield differences of maize grown in a phytotron in response to elevated co2 concentrations under different irrigation treatments two irrigation treatments were carried out regular irrigation ri and deficit irrigation di in which the irrigation amounts were respectively 100 and 70 of evapotranspiration et with four co2 concentrations 400 550 700 and 900μmolmol 1 thus eight treatments i e ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 di400 di550 di700 and di900 were included in this study results show that the relative reductions of stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr in response to elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than ri thus causing leaf temperature tleaf rose higher under di due to the transpiration cooling effect as photosynthetic rate pn and its physiological process were positively correlated with tleaf the relative increases of pn and the resulting maximum leaf area index laimax total dry matter weight tdw and grain yield gy react to elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than ri as well as the leaf water use efficiency wuel and water productivity wp the di900 treatment in which the irrigation amount was reduced by 30 only decreased the tdw and gy by 7 and 5 when compared with ri900 the variation of gy was consistent with the variation of kernels per ear kpe but was not directly related to hundred grain weight hgw the above results show that when atmospheric co2 concentrations rise in the future deficit irrigation would be an effective way of saving water and would not only have a mitigating effect on water crises but would also contribute to improving wp which is more important in terms of actual production keywords co2 concentration deficit irrigation photosynthesis growth yield water productivity 1 introduction it is estimated that by the end of the 21st century atmospheric co2 concentration will have reached 936μmolmol 1 if we do not take measures to reduce emissions ipcc 2013 there have been researches about elevated co2 concentration effects on crops and vegetables since 1970s gifford 1977 1979 ludlow and wilson 1971 the experimental equipment was mainly including enclosed chambers kang et al 1996 open top chambers meng et al 2014 and free air co2 enrichment technology leakey et al 2006 the elevation of atmospheric co2 concentration would have a significant impact on crop growth oliver et al 2009 because it increases net photosynthetic rate pn which would likely increase plant height h leaf area index lai total dry weight tdw and grain yield gy ainsworth and rogers 2007 kang et al 1996 meng et al 2014 it would also reduce stomatal conductance gs leading to a smaller than proportional decrease in transpiration rate tr and total evapotranspiration et allen et al 2003 bernacchi et al 2007 bunce 2004 vanuytrecht et al 2012 this would ultimately mean that there would be a significant increase in the importance of water productivity wp idso et al 1987 kang et al 2002 li et al 2003 vanuytrecht et al 2012 together with co2 concentration the controlled variables also covered water kang et al 2002 nitrogen li et al 2003 temperature cai et al 2016 ozone ainsworth 2008 transplanting density lai et al 2014 etc among which water stress was the top factor that considered a number of current studies have emphasized the effects of the interaction of elevated co2 concentration and water stress on crop growth water consumption and yield islam et al 2012 qiao et al 2010 saadi et al 2015 samarakoon and gifford 1996 wall et al 2011 the data of pn gy irrigation amounts and wue in these references showed that elevated co2 concentration benefit crops more under drought conditions than well watered conditions a number of previous studies have also shown that elevated co2 concentration only affect photosynthesis and grain yield of maize a c4 crop under drought conditions kim et al 2007 kimball 2016 leakey et al 2006 manderscheid et al 2014 rogers et al 1983 while several other co2 enrichment studies with maize grown under controlled environment conditions showed an increase of c4 photosynthesis and biomass production under sufficient water supply driscoll et al 2006 kang et al 2002 king and greer 1986 loomis and lafitte 1987 morison and gifford 1984 ziska and bunce 1997 the different results among these literatures may be due to the experimental equipments and some other experimental conditions that need further investigation the elevated co2 concentration will result in the intensity and frequency of climate extremes such as heat waves heavy precipitation and drought oliver et al 2009 and the availability of water will rapidly decrease ipcc 2014 water shortage is already a serious problem in northwest china kang et al 2002 wang et al 2012 and water availability will almost certainly decrease even further under climate change ipcc 2007 zhao et al 2010 posing a huge challenge for food security in the region kang et al 2017 so applying water saving irrigation method e g deficit irrigation or insufficient water supply into that region is in urgent need in the future deficit irrigation di is an effective water saving method by which to reduce water consumption used in irrigation while maintaining yield levels acceptable dorjia et al 2005 geerts and raes 2009 kang et al 2017 although di may reduce crop yield and total dry weight badr et al 2012 dorjia et al 2005 geerts and raes 2009 rop et al 2016 it also improves economic yield and fruit quality cantore et al 2016 dorjia et al 2005 saves water and increases wue and wp badr et al 2012 geerts and raes 2009 mitchell et al 1991 rop et al 2016 the local regular irrigation method i e sufficient irrigation with 100 demand of evapotranspiration may lead to some drought before re irrigation according to the above literatures it may benefit crops to some extent with elevated co2 concentrations in the future but how about the deficit irrigation the interactive impacts of elevated co2 concentrations such as the projected concentration of 900μmolmol 1 under rcp 8 5 by the end of this century ipcc 2013 and deficit irrigation on growth and yield of c4 plants like maize are not yet completely unraveled and deserve further investigation despite there are many researches about the interactive effects of co2 concentration and water stress on crops there is still a lack of experimental studies addressing the response of crops to elevated co2 concentrations and irrigation methods whether deficit irrigation still makes positive effect along with elevated co2 concentration or not is needed to contribute to an in depth understanding of the changing environment and therefore of great significance in arid and semi arid areas aljazairi et al 2015 vu and allen 2009 a commonly used cultivar of maize zea mays l cultivar qiangsheng 51 in northwest china has been planted for this study two irrigation treatments and four co2 concentrations have been designed in order to analyze the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on stomatal response growth characteristics yield evapotranspiration water use efficiency and water productivity under regular and deficit irrigation our objective is to explore whether the deficit irrigation method would save water and at the same time benefit maize more than regular irrigation thus providing a fundamental research and a reference point for irrigation management decision in agriculture in semi arid areas under elevated co2 concentrations in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the experiment was conducted from may to september 2015 in the climate phytotron at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province in northwest china n 37 52 e 102 50 altitude 1581m fig 1 the climate phytotron consisted of four separate chambers of 3 m length by 4 m width by 2 5 m height and was supplied with natural light each chamber had the same indoor equipments the different parameters set in the phytotron and their range of variation are shown in table 1 air temperature relative humidity and co2 concentration were set automatically through a digital program timer at different time periods in a closed control cabinet fig 2 a indoor temperature was controlled by an electric heating warming and a compressor cooling relative humidity was adjusted by an ultrasonic humidifier humidifying and a heat transfer valve dehumidifying both were controlled within the accuracy range table 1 a co2 sensor was used to measure indoor co2 concentration and co2 gas was provided by a co2 gas cylinder through a pipe fig 2a when the co2 concentration target was set a control system automatically calculated aeration time according to the flow rate of the co2 gas cylinder and the difference between the target and current co2 concentrations with the consumption of co2 in the chamber the above control method was repeated to maintain the target co2 level fresh air was inhaled from outside the chamber by a blower evenly distributed throughout the chamber from the bottom and then extracted through the upper wall to circulate the air the indoor wind speed was less than 0 5ms 1 2 2 experimental design the maize zea mays l cultivar qiangsheng 51 used in the experiment was planted in plastic pots of 26 5cm height 21cm and 33cm bottom and top diameter respectively three seeds were sown in each plastic pot initially and one seedling retained after emergence the experiment was conducted in climatic chambers during the whole growth period from the date of sowing may 7 to harvest september 16 the pots were filled with local sandy loam soil after being air dried crushed and sieved each pot had 18kg of soil with a dry bulk density of 1 38gcm 3 and a field water capacity of 0 27cm3 cm 3 little stones were spread over the bottom of each pot with fine sand acting as a filtration layer the surface of the soil was then covered with fine sand and nutritive soil to reduce the impact of irrigation on the topsoil structure the same fertilization scheme was applied in each pot which was 1 5g urea and 1 5g diammonium phosphate on may 29 june 19 july 10 july 29 and august 27 in addition a foliar spray of 250ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution was used at a concentration of 2 on may 29 june 19 july 20 and august 5 experimental meteorological conditions were set according to the 10 day averages of observed meteorological data from may to september of the previous six years at the experimental station their adjustment frequencies are shown in table 1 natural light was utilized the experiment consisted of two irrigation treatments namely regular irrigation ri which was similar to the local water management and deficit irrigation di in which the irrigation amounts were 100 and 70 of evapotranspiration et and four co2 concentrations of 400 current atmospheric co2 concentration 550 700 and 900μmolmol 1 both regular and deficit irrigation were carried out at the same time and with the same frequency in the four chambers the crops and the corresponding co2 concentrations were interchanged once randomly within the four chambers in the later half maize period there were eight treatments altogether ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 di400 di550 di700 and di900 each treatment had six pot replicates placed in a row fig 2b and the two rows were switched position after each weighing to ensure the regular emergence and growth of maize there was no water deficit during the seedling stage after which the deficit treatment was implemented the experimental pots were weighed every three to four days by high precision weighing scales for the basis of the irrigation amount and measuring cylinders were used for measuring the irrigation water manually the irrigation amount of each growth stage is shown in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 co2 concentrations co2 concentrations in the chambers were monitored and recorded at 1s intervals using the co2 gas sensors in the phytotron the daily variations of the average values of four co2 concentrations from 8 00 to 20 00 are shown in fig 3 a 2 3 2 meteorological data conventional meteorological data in each chamber including photosynthetic active radiation par air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed u were continuously observed by a portable automatic weather station hobo u30 onset computer corp usa and a multi functional automatic anemometer velocicalc 9565

period are shown in fig 3b 2 3 3 photosynthetic parameters stomatal conductance of water vapor diffusion gs transpiration rate tr leaf temperature tleaf and net photosynthetic rate pn of maize leaves were measured using a li 6400 type photosynthesis system li cor inc usa the second leaves of three representative plants undergoing the same treatment were randomly selected for measurement the daily variations of the photosynthetic parameters of each treatment were recorded at two hourly intervals from 8 00 to 18 00 on july 10 july 17 and august 15 2 3 4 crop growth and yield parameters three plants representative of each treatment were randomly selected to measure leaf length maximum leaf width and plant height using steel tapes every seven to ten days after the emergence of maize the leaf area was calculated by summing the leaf length multiplied by the maximum leaf width and then multiplied by a conversion factor of 0 74 li et al 2008 the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was defined as the ratio of leaf area to the soil surface area in the plastic pots the stem dry weight sdw leaf dry weight ldw root dry weight rdw hundred grain weight hgw kernels per ear kpe and grain yield gy of maize were measured using the oven drying method on september 16 when harvesting and four plants representative of each treatment were selected specific leaf area sla cm2 g 1 was defined as the ratio of lai to ldw the harvest index hi was defined as the ratio of gy to total dry weight tdw 2 3 5 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was calculated using the following water balance method and the average of three replications 1 e t i p w d r δ s where et is the crop evapotranspiration mm i the irrigation amount mm p the precipitation mm w the capillary rise to the root zone mm d the drainage from the root zone mm r the surface runoff mm and δs the change in soil water storage mm since the maize was grown in pots and irrigation was applied carefully there was no surface runoff and groundwater supply a tray was put below every pot to collect drainage or water leakage however there was no overly saturated water and leakage observed from the trays because the water supplements were controlled by the et between two irrigations and there was no rain in the chambers either therefore eq 1 can be simplified as follows 2 e t i δ s 2 3 6 leaf water use efficiency leaf water use

and the significant test of the average values of each parameter under different treatments although there was only one chamber of each co2 concentration and the pots of the same treatment were placed in a row we interchanged the chambers at the later growth stage and switched the crop rows after each weighing and also the observation parameters were measured randomly so the variables can be treated as random factors the significance level was set at 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on photosynthetic parameters of maize under deficit irrigation the effects of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on the stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr of maize are shown in fig 4 a d the figure shows that gs and tr decreased with the enrichment of co2 concentrations under both ri and di compared with ri400 gs and tr were 27 and 23 lower under di400 for the elevated co2 concentrations gs and tr were 22 36 and 25 26 lower under di when compared with ri relative reductions in gs and tr due to the di treatment were therefore more pronounced along with elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 decreased gs by 13 22 and 33 and tr by 12 23 and 38 respectively compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 decreased gs by 8 27 and 41 and tr by 16 27 and 41 respectively therefore the relative reductions in gs and tr caused by elevated co2 concentrations were mostly higher under di than under ri this was because under di the crop suffered from water stress which affected the leaves and roots so the guard cells reduced the solute in the cells by regulating their own metabolic processes to increase water potential thus causing stomata closure stalfelt 1959 yu and wang 2010 water deficit was also able to change the intracellular co2 concentrations ci by affecting photosynthesis plant hormones and ph etc which also caused stomata closure schulze 1986 1993 sharkey 1984 yu and wang 2010 the stomata reduction was therefore aggravated by the combined effect of deficit irrigation and elevated co2 concentrations so the elevated co2 concentration effect on stomatal closure was higher under di since stomata control is the most important way to regulate tr yu and wang 2010 tr had the same variation patterns as gs the effect of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on the leaf temperature tleaf is shown in table 3 it shows that tleaf was increased along with the elevated co2 concentrations but it was only significant under di compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased tleaf by 1 9 3 5 and 5 0 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased tleaf by 2 4 4 0 and 5 7 respectively hence the relative increase in tleaf caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri leaf temperature was highly correlated with tr under most conditions pallas et al 1967 and it was obvious to see that the higher tr was shown in the markedly lower tleaf and vice versa namely the so called transpiration cooling effect pallas et al 1967 so when the elevated co2 concentration reduced tr the tleaf increased also with the decrease in soil water in di condition tr was decreasing meanwhile tleaf rose more remarkable than that only under elevated co2 conditions as tr cannot be ignored in the changes of tleaf cook et al 1964 gates 1964 and tr changes were more pronounced under di so as to the changes of tleaf fig 4e and f show the effect of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on net photosynthetic rate pn net photosynthetic rate increased with the enrichment of co2 concentration compared with ri400 pn was 24 lower under di400 for the elevated co2 concentrations pn was 15 20 lower under di when compared with ri relative reductions in pn due to the di treatment were therefore weakened along with elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased pn by 30 45 and 59 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased pn by 37 51 and 77 respectively therefore the increased percentage of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri the result was the same with those in many studies kang et al 2002 robredo et al 2007 van der kooi et al 2016 this was because both water deficit and elevated co2 concentrations reduced the rubisco enzyme content and activity vu et al 1998 thus weakening the calvin cycle and increasing the ci in bundle sheath cells at the same time the reduced gs caused by the two factors also increased ci by 86 di400 94 di550 75 di700 and 15 di900 μmolmol 1 when compared with that under ri condition with the same co2 concentrations data were measured in our experiment but not shown in the tables on the other hand the leaf temperature rose higher under di it was 0 10 di400 0 26 di550 0 25 di700 and 0 31 di900 c higher than under ri when co2 concentrations were the same table 3 since pn was positive correlated with ci robredo et al 2007 and within the optimum temperature ranges for photosynthesis at 30 40 c berry and björkman 1980 long 1999 ludlow and wilson 1971 mjwara and botha 1993 wardlaw 1979 a slight increase in leaf temperature resulted in a substantial increase in the pn of maize due to the positive effect on the photosynthetic biochemical reactions and physical processes ghannoum et al 2000 yu and wang 2010 the relative increase of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri 3 2 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on the growth and yield of maize under deficit irrigation the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on the maximum leaf area index laimax maximum height h max maximum stem diameter sdmax and specific leaf area sla under different irrigation treatments are shown in table 4 di400 decreased laimax h max and sd max by 18 21 and 5 respectively but increased sla by 4 when compared with ri400 for elevated co2 concentrations di decreased laimax h max and sd max by 0 13 7 8 and 1 4 but increased sla by 6 16 when compared with ri relative reductions in laimax h max and sd max caused by di were therefore weakened while relative increases in sla caused by di were enhanced along with elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased lai max by 1 2 and 6 h max by 5 7 and 10 and sd max by 1 1 and 11 respectively compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased lai max by 8 17 and 29 h max by 22 26 and 29 and sd max by 2 4 and 16 respectively hence the relative increases in laimax h max and sd max caused by elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than under ri this was because the increased percentages of pn and tleaf caused by elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than under ri see section 3 1 since the photosynthesis can form 90 95 of biomass zelitch 1982 and a slight increase in leaf temperature between 30 35 c was good for crop growth wardlaw 1979 watts 1971 the relative increases in laimax h max and sd max were higher under di compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 decreased sla by 9 19 and 36 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 decreased sla by 2 15 and 34 respectively the reduced percentage of sla caused by elevated co2 concentrations was therefore lower under di than under ri elevated co2 concentrations reduced sla which was the leaf area per leaf weight possibly because they increased pn so that dry matter accumulation was first stored in the leaves rather than in the leaf extension within per unit leaf weight mamatha et al 2014 yelle et al 1990 moreover the redistribution of excess carbohydrates into older leaves under high co2 concentrations contributes more to leaf weight than to leaf area thus reducing sla kimball et al 2002 the reduced percentage of sla caused by elevated co2 concentrations was lower under di than under ri this might have been because the absolute pn dry matter accumulation and leaf area were small under di conditions and photosynthate was used for leaf expansion first of all rather than for storage in the per unit leaf weight to receive more light by increasing the leaf area which was good for increasing photosynthate under disadvantage conditions that maybe the crop ability to survive from a bad soil water environment and gain the drought tolerance so that the reduced percentage of sla caused by elevated co2 concentrations was lower under di the effects of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on the dry matter in different plant parts and the grain yield of maize are shown in table 5 the leaf dry weight ldw stem dry weight sdw root dry weight rdw grain yield per plant gy and total dry weight tdw at harvest time increased under elevated co2 concentrations the dry matter under di was lower than under ri compared with ri400 the ldw sdw rdw gy and tdw under di400 was 16 34 25 21 and 26 lower respectively while under elevated co2 concentrations the ldw sdw rdw gy and tdw under di was 6 9 10 20 8 15 5 20 and 7 19 lower respectively when compared with ri therefore the reduced percentages of gy and tdw caused by di were weakened along with the elevated co2 concentrations that was because the increased percentage of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di and the fertilization effect of co2 concentration was more significant under di leakey et al 2006 which offset the negative effect of di the interesting thing was that under the co2 concentration of 900μmolmol 1 the reduced percentages of gy and tdw caused by di were at their lowest and not significantly different at 5 and 7 respectively that may because the higher the co2 concentration the greater the fertilization effect was under di conditions so when the irrigation amount was reduced by 30 the di did not significantly affect the growth of maize under elevated co2 concentrations recent studies have suggested that in the future as co2 concentrations and temperatures increase extreme rainfall events will be more frequent in spring in northwest china but in summer and autumn the precipitation frequency will be reduced gao et al 2015 guo et al 2016 changes in precipitation patterns could lead to a mismatch between natural precipitation and the demand for water of crops causing frequent seasonal droughts and seriously restricting the improvement of productivity wang et al 2015 in this case applying moderate deficit irrigation to crops during the planting season could save irrigation water and decrease gy slightly this could mitigate food reduction and water crises as co2 concentrations increase in the future table 5 also shows that compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased ldw by 5 21 and 40 sdw by 9 19 and 38 rdw by 25 36 and 65 gy by 23 31 and 44 and tdw by 18 33 and 46 respectively however compared with di400 di550 di700 di90 increased ldw by 31 67 and 71 sdw by 18 31 and 55 rdw by 42 64 and 137 gy by 25 44 and 74 and tdw by 30 57 and 82 respectively accordingly the increased percentage of dry matter caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri this was due to the fact that the increased percentage of pn caused by elevated co2 concentrations was greater under di than under ri resulting in a greater increase in the percentage of dry matter accumulation in this study elevated co2 concentrations increased gy and tdw by 24 59 and 24 64 respectively which was close to the results obtained with the same or similar co2 concentrations cure and acock 1986 guo 2003 long et al 2006 meng et al 2014 the changed percentages of gy and tdw were similar in the reports compiled by many researchers ainsworth et al 2008 van der kooi et al 2016 however the increased effects on gy and tdw caused by co2 enrichment differ slightly in this study when compared with the results obtained in some of the other literature on the subject for example the results obtained by ziska and bunce 1997 and samarakoon and gifford 1996 show that elevated co2 concentrations can increase the total biomass of maize in wet soil but the effect was not significant which differed from our conclusions however in a dry soil environment tdw increased by 54 due to elevated co2 levels which was a similar result to that given in this study the response of tdw to elevated co2 concentrations in a dry environment or under di treatment was very clear the reasons for the different results in a wet environment may include the followings 1 our regular irrigation ri was conducted every three to four day according to the et that consumed by the crops it was not an absolute non drought soil environment when compared with other literature the crops may suffer from some slight drought periods before renewed access to irrigation which may cause the significant results 2 the irrigation frequency for the crops was performed more or less on a daily basis in previous studies which was more frequent than in our study where it was carried out every three to four days and studies have shown that gy and tdw decrease significantly with increased irrigation frequency tian et al 2016 3 this study was conducted in arid and semi arid areas where the crop was highly dependent on water which led to a more sensitive response to increased co2 concentrations 4 most previous studies set two constant temperatures day and night but we set a sine curve for the temperature during the daytime and a natural temperature at night according to the average temperature calculated at the experimental station over many years according to the study of hu 1963 increasing the temperature differential between day and night is beneficial to the growth and development of maize 5 the experimental period in previous studies was short about 30 60days but in this study it covered the entire growth season about 133days which also resulted in a difference in biomass or yield at the final harvest all the above explanations may cause the different result from other studies in a wet soil environment but the increased percentages of gy and tdw caused by co2 enrichment under di or drought are higher than under ri or wet is beyond doubt the effects of different irrigation treatments and co2 concentrations on hundred grain weight hgw kernels per ear kpe and harvest index hi are shown in table 6 in which elevated co2 concentrations had no significant effects on hgw and hi but kpe increased with a rise in co2 concentrations there was no significant difference in terms of hgw between di and ri under the same co2 concentration di400 di550 di700 and di900 decreased kpe by 21 20 13 and 5 respectively however when compared with ri under the same co2 concentration the higher the co2 concentration the lower the reduced percentage of kpe caused by di compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased kpe by 23 31 and 44 respectively but compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased it by 25 44 and 74 the increased percentage of kpe caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri this accorded with the variation in gy which would indicate that the variety in terms of gy was mainly determined by the variety in kpe under different irrigation and co2 concentration treatments but that there was no direct relation to variations in hgw there were no significant effects in terms of elevated co2 concentrations on the hi but di increased hi by 5 15 when compared with ri which means that di can improve hi this is consistent with many previous studies kang et al 2000 zhang et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 although other studies have shown that hi decreases with increasing water stress bolaños and edmeades 1993 farré and faci 2006 muchow 1989 the different results may be due to the fact that in our experiment the level of di did not reach a level that could significantly reduce hi this might also be due to the different dependence of hi on irrigation levels in different studies where the experimental areas have different climate conditions drought or wet further research is therefore needed on this 3 3 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on maize evapotranspiration under deficit irrigation the effects of co2 concentrations on maize evapotranspiration et under ri and di are shown in fig 5 it shows that when the amount of irrigation was reduced by 30 under di et was 30 lower than that under ri under both ri and di et decreased first to a minimum value at 700μmolmol 1 and then increased with an elevation in co2 concentrations this was because although elevated co2 concentrations reduced gs and tr they increased lai offsetting the reduction in canopy conductance caused by reduced gs and tr hileman et al 1994 kang et al 1996 wullschleger et al 2002 also reported that the canopy conductance only decreased by 14 when gs decreased by 44 due to the elevation of co2 concentration from 394μmolmol 1 to 538μmolmol 1 the impact of an elevated co2 concentration on et was therefore small and even when the co2 concentration reached a certain high value et increased oliver et al 2009 also note that the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on et are wide ranging and can remain at a reduced level cech et al 2003 owensby et al 1997 or remain unchanged ellsworth 1999 qiao et al 2010 or even increase tricker et al 2009 uddling et al 2008 compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 decreased et by 15 18 and 13 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 decreased et by 10 14 and 10 respectively accordingly the reduced percentage of et caused by elevated co2 concentrations was less under di than under ri the result was similar to the findings of samarakoon and gifford 1996 and kang et al 2002 as mentioned previously although the decrease in tr caused by elevated co2 concentrations was 2 4 higher under di than under ri the increased percentage of lai was higher 7 23 so the offset effect of the increased lai on the decreased tr was more obvious thus the impact of elevated co2 concentrations on et was smaller under di than under ri 3 4 more pronounced effects of elevated co2 concentrations on water use efficiency and water productivity of maize under deficit irrigation the effects of different irrigation treatments and elevated co2 concentrations on leaf water use efficiency wuel and water productivity wp are shown in table 7 it shows that wuel and wp increased with the elevation of co2 concentrations in both irrigation treatments so that the results were the same as the results obtained in previous studies idso et al 1987 kang et al 2002 leakey et al 2006 li et al 2003 meng et al 2014 oliver et al 2009 compared with ri400 wuel was 8 lower with di400 but wp was 10 higher as far as the elevated co2 concentrations were concerned di increased wuel and wp by 4 12 and 10 15 therefore the increased percentages of wuel and wp caused by di grew along with the elevated co2 concentrations compared with ri400 ri550 ri700 ri900 increased wuel by 52 91 and 185 and wp by 48 64 and 88 respectively while compared with di400 di550 di700 di900 increased wuel by 72 120 and 251 and wp by 50 74 and 102 respectively accordingly the increased percentages of wuel and wp caused by elevated co2 concentrations were higher under di than under ri that was because at the leaf level according to eq 3 when the numerator pn increased and the denominator tr decreased the result wuel came out to increase and since the increased percentage of pn and the reduced percentage of tr were both higher under di than under ri see section 3 1 the increased percentage of wuel caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri at the canopy level there was a similar situation of wp to wuel i e when the numerator tdw increased and the denominator et decreased the result wp came out to increase according to eq 4 the increased percentage of tdw 11 36 was much higher than the decreased percentage of et 3 5 under di than under ri thus the increased percentage of wp caused by elevated co2 concentrations was higher under di than under ri this was the same as the result obtained by allen et al 2011 using a similar co2 concentration the improvement of water use efficiency and water productivity was more significant than the improvement of pn and yield chaves and pereira 1992 especially in the case of water deficit conditions water deficit reduced crop production while increased co2 concentrations not only reduced water consumption but also increased yield the results of this study show that the increased proportion of wp caused by co2 enrichment was more under di this would provide a strong theoretical basis for conducting irrigation water management under elevated co2 concentrations in the future 4 conclusions in this study we explored the different effects of elevated co2 concentration on stomatal conductance transpiration rate leaf temperature photosynthetic rate evapotranspiration crop growth biomass parameters yield parameters leaf water use efficiency and water productivity among which the effect on leaf temperature was only discussed in this study under two different irrigation methods and the results show that the elevated co2 concentration would benefit maize crops more under deficit irrigation which can save a lot of water than regular irrigation method which was similar to the local water management although the elevated co2 concentration and deficit irrigation decreased the absolute value of stomatal conductance and transpiration rate but the leaf temperature increased more due to the transpiration cooling effect then promoted the photosynthetic rate the crop growth and the yield weakening the disadvantages of deficit irrigation on maize plants some of our results under regular irrigation were different from those of other literature in wet soil conditions that was because the maize grown in regular irrigation conditions may suffer from slight drought before re irrigation and the environment was not absolutely non water stressed also the irrigation frequency was quite different from other references which may cause different results and need to be considered in the future whatever our study revealed that under future climate change deficit irrigation is not only an efficient water saving method but also can benefit crops more with lowest yield reduction and highest water productivity however the irrigation amount of this study only considered two gradients i e the regular irrigation and deficit irrigation in which the irrigation amounts were 100 and 70 of evapotranspiration respectively which would create some limitations of the research also there were no irrigation frequency planting density and nitrogen treatments taking into account which are also very important factors in the crop growth periods and may cause different results when considering the co2 concentration effect more consideration is needed in the future s research acknowledgement we are grateful for the support from the national natural science

11614,recently planted intensive almond plantations may have access to limited water supply due to water scarcity thus information on almond water use under limited irrigation is needed here the soil water balance was used to assess the consumptive use et of full irrigated moderately stressed and severely stressed almond trees over a three year study as well as the relation between applied water and et sap flow measurements in eight experimental trees were used to obtain independent transpiration t measurements evaporation from soil es was modelled to estimate tree t from the water balance relative consumptive use in the deficit irrigation di treatments largely exceeded the relative applied water highlighting the need to measure et in stressed treatments for hydrologic purposes the moderately stressed treatments irrigated at 65 5 of full irrigation consumed 79 0 of maximum evapotranspiration et of 897mm while the severely stressed treatment consumed 63 6 of etc et of 722mm when applied water was only 39 6 of control on average almond etc approached 1200mm seasonal evolution of the transpiration coefficient yielded maximum peak values ranging from 0 99 to 1 08 and minimum peak values of 0 33 attained with a severe deficit irrigation strategy transpiration measured by compensated heat pulse calibrated average gradient sap flow x was compared to water balance t estimates y and yielded a very good relation over the three years of study y 0 90x 4 23 r2 0 81 the sap flow measurements proved to be useful to overcome the limitations of the soil water balance technique revealing that almond trees were able to extract water from below the monitored depths and suggesting that deep percolation event must have occurred in spring and autumn keywords guara actual evapotranspiration water balance deficit irrigation sap flow compensation heat pulse 1 introduction almond is one of the major tree crops in spain in terms of cultivated area 619 915ha according to esyrce 2016 mapama 2016 although it has been grown traditionally in marginal lands under rainfed conditions recently irrigation has been introduced with concomitant changes for intensification of production however due to chronic water scarcity spanish water basin authorities of most areas are unable to allocate irrigation water for almond production to meet its potential requirements thus deficit irrigation di strategies for almonds must be applied in order to reduce water consumption with a minimum impact on crop productivity fereres and soriano 2007 in order to design successful di strategies and to assess consumptive use at the hydrologic basin scale both the maximum crop evapotranspiration etc and the actual evapotranspiration eta under different conditions of climate soil water availability and plantation typology must be known potential crop evapotranspiration etc can be measured by mass transfer or energy balance methods and can also be estimated using models such as the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 in the case of well watered almond trees there have been recent studies measuring etc with eddy covariance stevens et al 2012 or with a large weighing lysimeter espadafor et al 2015 there are many more difficulties in determining eta of tree crops under field conditions one option is to use the water balance approach to compute eta when et is limited by water deficits in the case of almond trees girona et al 2005 egea et al 2010 and egea et al 2013 have dealt with the responses to variable irrigation but the eta of stressed treatments was not measured nor calculated as all the results were expressed in terms of applied water aw that is irrigation ir plus effective precipitation peff the extrapolation of these responses beyond the soil and climatic conditions where they were obtained is questionable recently spinelli et al 2016 measured eta of deficit irrigated almond trees with eddy covariance but surprisingly they found that eta was the same as the etc of well watered trees the goodness of a soil water balance depends on the accurate estimation of soil water depletion swd by the root system for this purpose volumetric soil water content measured with the neutron probe method is considered to be advantageous over the use of other instrumentation such as tensiometers fdr or tdr evett and steiner 1995 however in all cases the spatial variability of soil water properties nielsen et al 1973 makes it necessary to seek a compromise between accuracy and practicality regarding the number of measuring points in a drip irrigated tree crop the variability coming from unevenly wetted soil surface is another issue requiring additional spatial variations in soil moisture observations andreu et al 1997 described the soil moisture variability and dynamics around a single irrigated almond tree they showed that regardless of the depths of measurement there is often significant uncertainty in the magnitude of the deep percolation component dp nevertheless there are a number of studies that have used the water balance approach in irrigated tree crops fereres et al 1982 and franco et al 2000 in young almond trees garnier et al 1986 girona et al 2002 and ayars et al 2003 in peach klaij and vachaud 1992 and kang et al 2003 in pear de azevedo et al 2003 and da silva et al 2009 in mango and iniesta et al 2008 in pistachio besides the soil water balance approach has been incorporated into most crop simulation models for an array of conditions belmans et al 1983 brisson et al 1992 campos et al 2016 choudhury et al 2013 eitzinger et al 2003 phogat et al 2017 for determining et from the soil water balance one needs to quantify the water fluxes entering namely precipitation p and irrigation ir and leaving runoff ro and deep percolation dp the soil profile under study during a period spanning two soil water content swc measurements once all the fluxes are measured or estimated et can be determined from the balance of inputs minus outputs additionally if evaporation from soil es can be measured or estimated bonachela et al 1999 2001 ritchie 1972 transpiration t can also be known sap flow probes allow the direct estimation of tree transpiration by integrating sap flow velocity deduced from measurements of heat diffusion within the available sap flow measuring methods the compensated heat pulse chp has been proposed by fernández et al 2001 as a tool for irrigation scheduling this technique is able to detect water stress as measured by the fall in tree transpiration relative to eto or when a reference t value is obtained fernández et al 2001 tognetti et al 2004 2005 however the azimuthal variations in sap velocity within a probed tree trunk makes calibration of sap flow sensors highly recommended lópez bernal et al 2010 lópez bernal et al 2015 nortes et al 2008 there are only a few reports that combine the water balance technique with sap flow measurements for calculating et such as in pines in usa oren et al 1998 pear trees kang et al 2002 and apple trees in north china gong et al 2007 in the context of almond production intensification under limited water supply the objectives of this research were a to determine the eta of almond trees undergoing different deficit irrigation regimes b to relate the eta to the level of aw in order to assess the relevance of soil water extraction under deficit irrigation and c to compare the soil water balance method for estimating t against sap flow measurements of t in almond trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and field management the three year experiment was conducted between 2014 and 2016 in a 5 5 ha almond cv guara orchard planted in 2009 trees were grafted on g 677 rootstock and planted in a 6 7m grid the field is located at the research centre of ifapa alameda del obispo in cordoba spain 37 8 n 4 8 w trees were pruned the two first years for scaffold formation and only again in january 2016 to ease machinery traffic there is an automated weather station about 300m apart from the orchard from which climate data were collected along the study in the centre of the orchard there is one large weighing lysimeter with one almond tree lorite et al 2012 which is representative of the rest of the orchard cordoba climate is typical mediterranean hot and dry summers and mild winters annual rainfall averages around 600mm the experimental soil of alluvial origin is deep of sandy loam texture in the first 150cm depth and lighter texture in the deeper layers the typical upper field capacity and lower wilting point limits of soil water storage are 0 23 and 0 08cm3 cm3 respectively the experimental trees were irrigated to satisfy their full water requirements since planting until the onset of the differential irrigation treatments in 2013 the control treatment and the rest of the trees outside the experimental area were fully irrigated trees were daily irrigated with 12 pressure compensating drippers 4l h with 1m distance between drippers per tree using two drip laterals each about 80 100cm away from the tree rows in 2014 there was one water meter per treatment in 2015 individual water meters ws15170 dn 15 3 4 abering madrid spain were installed in every experimental plot water meter readings were collected every two weeks in the new meters while the old ones were used for daily irrigation monitoring and management soil was kept free of weeds by both mower passes and herbicide applications and pests and diseases were controlled following a treatment calendar which was adjustable according to each season conditions mineral fertilization was calculated according to university of california recommendations http apps cdfa ca gov frep docs almonds html and its application followed the recommendations by muncharaz 2003 2 2 experimental design irrigation treatments started in spring 2013 by applying different limited irrigation levels with full irrigation supply as the control to induce a moderate stress level both sustained deficit irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation strategies were tested while severe water stress was induced by a more limited rdi regime thus irrigation treatments were thus planned as follows table 1 2 2 1 fully irrigated control fi these trees received the water requirements etc calculated as in fereres et al 2012 from 2015 on the relation between ground cover gc and a transpiration coefficient kt t eto proposed by espadafor et al 2015 that is kt gc 1 2 was used with an added 15 to account for the evaporation from emitters wet surfaces the addition of 15 was calculated using bonachela et al 2001 model assuming tree intercepted radiation of 60 and a wetted area by emitters of 25 by delaying the onset of irrigation some swc depletion by the trees was allowed early in the season to avoid deep percolation which would be significant if applying water to the soil at field capacity after winter rains 2 2 2 moderate sustained deficit irrigation sdim this treatment received 75 of fi 75 of etc throughout the irrigation season 2 2 3 moderate regulated deficit irrigation rdim this treatment received the same amount as fi in spring and after harvest but only 40 of fi during the kernel filling stage pre harvest period the aim was that the total seasonal amount would be the same as that of sdim 2 2 4 severe regulated deficit irrigation rdis in 2014 this treatment received the same as fi in spring and after harvest and only 15 of fi during the kernel filling stage however in the other two seasons the total irrigation amount was modified to apply 60 of fi during spring and in post harvest and 20 of fi during kernel filling each experimental plot consisted of 16 4 4 trees of which the central four were considered as experimental trees while the remaining 12 served as border treatments were repeated four times in a randomized complete block design in addition a single plot of 20 trees in the same 5 5ha orchard was left rainfed to observe the response to extreme stress 2 3 canopy architecture and radiation interception three to four measurements of canopy diameters and tree height were taken during each season with the help of a measuring tape and a marked pole ground cover percentage gc was calculated as the area of a circle of average tree diameter divided by the tree spacing canopy volume volc was approached as an ellipsoid vertical transmissivity was measured close to canopy architecture measurement dates with a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor biosciences linconln nebraska usa in the trees bearing sap flow probes one reference and up to seven depending on tree size radiation measurements were taken every 50cm in four orthogonal transects afterwards reference values were interpolated in time and transmissivity was calculated as the measured below canopy radiation divided by its reference value only the first ring vertical of the plant canopy analyzer was considered according to lang 1987 plant area for each transect pat can be calculated as 1 p a t i 1 n p a i π x 2 g 0 i 1 n 2 i 1 ln τ i where n is the number or measurement points x is the distance between them 50cm g0 is a cultivar dependent parameter for leaf insertion angle and τ is transmissivity the value of g0 used was 0 492 according to crespillo 2016 each transect was assigned a 90 sector of the whole canopy plant area density pad was finally calculated as pa volc and assumed not to vary between trees within the irrigation treatment intercepted radiation qe was calculated by adapting a simplified model developed for olive trees mariscal et al 2000 2 q e 1 exp k r v u 3 k r 0 52 0 00079 p d 0 76 exp 1 25 p a d 4 v u v 0 p d 10000 where qe is percentage of intercepted

evapotranspiration assessment by water balance 2 4 1 change in soil water content δswc soil water content in the first 210cm of soil profile was measured with a neutron probe campbell pacific nuclear scientific model 503 monitoring started at budburst and ended in october prior to leaf fall with an average interval between measurements of three to four weeks the neutron probe was calibrated for the experimental soil by taking soil samples for volumetric moisture content θ cm3 of water cm3 of soil at the time of access tube installation two separate calibration equations were used one for the first 15cm of soil and another for the rest of the profile down to the 2 10m depth readings were taken at 30cm intervals but for the first two readings near the surface which were taken between 0 and 15cm and 15 30cm depths the experimental plots of all treatments in replicate 1 were equipped with eight neutron probe tubes installed in the area between the four central trees while the plots of the other three replicates were equipped only with three neutron probe access tubes swc was calculated as a weighted average according to the area represented by each tube the three tubes were installed one near the irrigation lateral one almost in the middle of the lane and a third one in between as shown by the black open circles of fig 1 we compared the soil water measurements averaged over the eight tubes in rep 1 against those determined with the three tubes in the other three replicates as shown in the results section the rainfed plot was monitored with nine access tubes seasonal change in swc was calculated by addition of the swc changes between measurement dates 2 4 2 effective precipitation peff due to the relatively high soil infiltration rate and the flat field 100 of the rainfall over 0 2mm was considered as effective precipitation villalobos and fereres 2017 2 4 3 evaporation from soil es daily es was calculated following bonachela et al 2001 which divides orchard evaporation into two terms one from emitters wetted surface and another from the rest of the soil surface the percentage of emitter wetted soil surface ranged from 5 in the rdis during the severe deficit period to 25 35 40 in the fi in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the microadvective coefficient kw 1 0 was taken throughout spring and after harvest against 1 2 during summer bonachela et al 2001 in the rdis treatment fallen leaves created a mulch above the surface wetted by the emitters so a 50 reduction coefficient was used allen et al 1998 ritchie s model 1972 was used to calculate evaporation from the rest of the soil which required intercepted radiation values 2 4 4 evapotranspiration etwb and transpiration twb etwb was calculated from water balance between swc readings twb came from subtracting es from etwb seasonal et and t resulted from adding partial calculations the dp component could not be measured or estimated by water balance so it was not considered in our calculations 5 e t w b p e f f i r δ s w c d p 6 t w b e t w b e s calculated twb for all the treatments in replicate 1 was compared to the one measured with sap flow both seasonally and between swc measurements 2 5 transpiration measurements with chp sap flow tsf two sap flow probes were installed in a single tree per treatment in replicate 1 plus a second tree in rdis as well as in two rainfed trees and in the lysimeter tree the method used was the compensation heat pulse chp plus the calibrated average gradient cag for the hours of the day when the sap flow is very low testi and villalobos 2009 the probes designed and produced at the ias csic laboratory in cordoba spain are made of a 4 8w 2mm diameter stainless steel needle which emits heat pulses and two temperature sensors protected by stainless steel the upper temperature probe was 10mm above the heater while the lower was 5mm below the latter each temperature probe has four thermocouple junctions along it so heat pulse velocities can be known at different depths temperature difference dt between thermocouple junctions at the same depth was measured with less than 0 01k error every 8 probes were connected to a multiplexer am16 32 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa controlled by a datalogger cr10x or cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa at given intervals the multiplexer triggers a measurement cycle along which dt is measured at 1 s intervals for 10s a 2 s heat beat 0 12w mm is released and dt is measured again at 1 s intervals for 3min dt readings are collected in the datalogger the heat pulse velocities had then to be checked for wounding effects green et al 2003 sap flow measurements were calibrated with transpiration data from the lysimeter by covering the surface of the lysimeter with black plastic a thin layer of straw was placed over the plastic not to change the albedo thus avoiding soil evaporation in several 3 10days periods along the year the rest of probes were calibrated assuming a constant relation between their t and their gc at the start of the season before any stress had taken place the seasonal evolution of the calibration coefficient for every probe was assumed to follow the same pattern as the lysimeter probes sap flow measured transpiration of only one out of four trees which were taken into account in the water balance of each experimental plot to compare the two methods we needed to estimate from the water balance the transpiration twb of the probed tree for that purpose we used a weighing factor that corrected for the specific canopy volume volc of the probed tree 3 results 3 1 canopy volume and radiation interception fig 2 shows the time course of canopy volume volc and percentage of intercepted radiation qe in the different treatments along the study anova and subsequent lsd test conducted for the indicated dates showed that fi trees were always significantly larger and intercepted more radiation than severely stressed ones although 2016 winter pruning evened tree sizes somewhat regarding moderately stressed treatments both sdim and rdim were smaller than fi at budburst but did not differ significantly from fi trees later on in the seasons of 2015 and 2016 average fi volc achieved at the end of 2016 was 85 7m3 whereas rdis averaged 60 0m3 qe exceeded 60 of incoming radiation in fi rdim and sdim from 2015 onward on the contrary in the most stressed treatment qe remained below 60 in 2015 and under 55 in 2016 respectively 3 2 soil water dynamics fig 3 presents the comparison between the 3 tubes weighed average swc and the 8 tubes average swc taken at the same time in the four treatment plots of replicate 1 the excellent correlation obtained y 0 949 x r2 0 97 indicates that swc could be measured practically with three as well as with eight tubes therefore swc in replicates 2 4 could be well measured with just three tubes even though the regression equation of fig 3 was reversely applied to the replicates 2 4 swc measurements to correct the 3 tubes swc data fig 4 presents the time course of swc for the three seasons soil under fi trees had significantly higher soil moisture than in the other treatments at the end of 2014 and 2016 while no differences among treatments were found at the end of 2015 due to rainfall in october 2016 a lsd test could also segregate rdim from rdis and placed sdim in an intermediate group regarding the rainfed plot it can be observed that trees depleted the first 2 10m of soil by early july 2014 fig 5 depicts representative examples of volumetric soil moisture θ cm3 water cm3 soil along 2016 at different depths in fi and rdis to illustrate the differences in soil water patterns data from two tubes per treatment are shown one inside the drip wetted area and the other in the middle of the lane from the soil water content measurements we presume that deep percolation may have occurred from 4th march to early august under the emitters in the fi treatment fig 5a water extraction can also be seen at upper layers in fi and soil water outside the influence of the dripper was consumed by the time of harvest fig 5b in the case of rdis those treatments had depleted the monitored swc inside and outside the influence of the emitters fig 5c and d and transpired just what was applied as irrigation fig 6 displays the time course of the average θ for the four treatments summing up fi profile remained wetter than the rest throughout the season sdim depleted more soil water than rdim by the end of the season winter rains recharged the soil below 150cm in rdis and spring rainfall was consumed completely by the end of the irrigation season in early autumn a rainy spring in 2016 see table 2 filled all the treatments profile from budburst to the start of rdi treatments 3 3 crop evapotranspiration and transpiration coefficient table 2 displays eto calculated etc for irrigation scheduling peff and actual irrigation and the actual et calculated from the water balance for the four treatments average eto and peff throughout the study were 1071mm and 243mm respectively average three years etc was 1134mm for fi of which 800mm were contributed as irrigation moderate di strategies averaged seasonal eta of 897mm 79 0 of fi with 524mm irrigation 65 5 there were no significant differences in eta between sdim and rdim besides rdis treatment reduced eta to 722mm 63 6 with 317mm irrigation 39 6 for each season data are presented as seasonal values and divided into three periods spring pre harvest period where the deficits are applied in rdi and post harvest randomized complete block anova conducted on calculated et showed no significant differences amidst treatments from budburst to the start of pre harvest period in the first two years in pre harvest fi had the highest et values the two moderately stressed treatments presented significantly lower values than fi and higher than the severely stressed one after harvest lsd test segregated fi from all deficit treatments in 2014 whereas in 2015 rdis et values were significantly lower than those of the other treatments finally in 2016 means were separated in three groups fi both sdim and rdim and rdis on a seasonal scale fi consumed more water than the rest and the moderately stressed treatments consumed more than the severely stressed one no differences were found between sdim and rdim fig 7 represents the calculated seasonal et against aw ir peff for the four treatments and the three study years the 1 1 line represents a situation where all applied water is consumed by the crop et and no sw depletion takes place the vertical distance between the 1 1 line and the points above it represents the swd points below the 1 1 line in fig 7 indicate that some deep percolation took place as it must have happened in some fi replicates in 2016 from fig 7 it can be estimated that the maximum seasonal swd was about 200mm under the experimental conditions the time course of the transpiration coefficient kt calculated with water balance in the first and the last study years is shown in fig 8 maximum kt values for fi were 0 87 and 1 16 in 2014 and 2016 respectively in the rdis treatment kt dropped to minimum values of 0 14 and 0 33 in 2014 and 2016 respectively regarding the moderate deficit treatments the kt of rdim was lower than in sdim during summer but recovered after harvest and both treatments showed similar values at the end of the season around 0 46 in 2014 and 0 59 in 2016 3 4 a comparison of water balance estimates of ta against sap flow ta measurements fig 9 presents the comparison between the two methods of determining ta for every period between two swc measurements generally both methods agreed in the estimates of ta for rdis whereas there were some discrepancies in the other treatments in 2014 fig 9a the sap flow measurements of ta were lower than those obtained with the wb method in the period when irrigation was resumed after harvest in both rdim and fi during summer tsf was greater than twb in rdim whereas in 2015 fig 9b the same happened in sdim again fi showed tsf lower than twb after harvest in 2016 fig 9c some points over the 1 1 line can be seen in fi and rdim obtained during spring and autumn while before harvest tsf of rdim was greater than twb fig 9d shows data of the four treatments and three years overall the correlation was very good with a linear regression y 0 90x 4 23 r2 0 81 4 discussion in our three year study a di regime that applied 39 6 of fi irrigation rdis resulted in a much higher relative consumptive use equivalent to 63 6 of etc eta of 722mm our results contrast with those of spinelli et al 2016 that measured eta of a deficit irrigated almond orchard with eddy covariance and found no decrease in comparison with the well irrigated treatment other di works on almonds egea et al 2013 2010 girona et al 2005 reduced irrigation to 40 and 28 of their control treatments in their most severely stressed treatment however they did not take into account either precipitation or changes in swc when establishing relations between irrigation regimes and crop response if we consider the large climatic and soil variability throughout the almond growing areas it would be difficult to extrapolate tree responses to irrigation amounts to conditions other than those where they were obtained in fig 7 it can be seen that the intersection point between almond et and aw was around 1200mm and maximum seasonal swd observed in the rainfed plot in 2014 as well as in deficit irrigated trees was near 200mm which is 27 7 of the three year average eta of rdis in the experimental conditions this is particularly important if mild stressed or over irrigated treatments are chosen to analyse the effects of irrigation on crop response since different irrigation regimes could result in the same eta this is because the mild stressed tress would extract more water from the soil while the over irrigated treatments would have percolation losses below the root zone along with canopy size and etwb t and kt increased from the first to the last study year too on the one hand fi kt pattern reveals some sustained stress in 2014 possibly because of insufficient irrigation on the other the highest average kt obtained 1 16 can be overestimated due to percolation but experimental plots without percolation gave kt values between 0 99 and 1 08 along the summer leading to corresponding kc values from 1 10 to 1 27 which is in accordance with recently published kc values for almond espadafor et al 2015 garcía tejero et al 2015 goldhamer and fereres 2016 stevens et al 2012 the rdis made kt drop to 0 14 in 2014 and 0 33 in 2016 during the pre harvest period stress was too severe in 2014 and this treatment was increased in the deficit period from 280mm up to 370mm to avoid too severe stress when comparing sdim with rdim both reduced transpiration along summer but kt of sdim remained higher until full irrigation was resumed in rdim after harvest thus sdim got minimum values of 0 31 and 0 48 by early august 2014 and 2016 respectively while rdim reached minimum values of 0 38 and 0 42 by late july 2014 and mid july 2016 respectively nonetheless there were no differences in etwb smaller drip wetted surface in rdim made es relatively lower during the months of highest eto both treatments had recovered transpiration by mid september in table 2 and in fig 7 we can appreciate that et of fi treatment increased noticeably from 2014 to 2015 there are a couple of possible explanations for this firstly volc and qe increased from 2014 to 2015 fig 2 so growth had not finished yet secondly predicted etc for irrigation scheduling was lower than actual etwb so the kc used in 2014 may have been underestimated as well red leaf blotch was not under total control in 2014 and it reduced leaf area density and hence qe trees were much healthier the following seasons on the other hand percolation events due to the rainy spring together with the need to irrigate for fertilizing rose 2016 et values of fi therefore the shape of the regression line in fig 7 should be blunter at the upper extreme we can observe that the 2016 rainy spring after a dry winter brought points corresponding to the rest of the treatments under the regression line as well there was not so much swc available at the beginning of this season fig 4 and subsequent rainfall was already computed as aw instead of swd if we think of carryover effects of di on swc the most severe treatment kept similar values of total swc throughout the three years fig 4 however no recharge of the deepest layers was observed after winter and spring rains fig 5c and d as in moderately stressed treatments and fi figs 6 5a and b which may entail a change in the relation between aw and et on a longer term by reducing sw reservoir or after particularly dry winters regarding water balance limitations such as soil variability within an irrigated tree orchard our swc estimation with 3 neutron probe access tubes one nearby the irrigation lateral one almost in the middle of the lane and a third one in between resulted a good representative of the swc fig 3 however the water balance method overestimated et when dp is significant and underestimates it when swd occurs outside the monitored soil volume in this case below the 2 1m depth we delayed irrigation until late spring to prevent applying water to the soil at field capacity after the winter rains and thus have the trees consumed part of the sw reservoir however we cannot rule out the possibility that dp events may have occurred in the fi treatment which received the highest irrigation depths this would make the et of the fi treatment overestimated in the case of di treatments the dryness of the soil consequently with very low hydraulic conductivity should have prevented dp leading to more precise estimates of almond eta values the use of the chp cag sap flow technique allowed to detect these events in one of the replicates thus in 2014 fig 9a rdim must have extracted water below 2 10m since the sap flow measurements led to ta values greater than those of the wb method on the contrary there must have been some deep percolation in the period when irrigation was resumed after harvest in both rdim and fi in 2015 fig 9b it is sdim which seemed to have extracted water beyond 2 10m deep again fi showed deep percolation after harvest that year in 2016 fig 9c it seems that deep percolation occurred in spring and autumn in fi and rdim while extraction below 2 10m took place during the deficit period in the latter this all seems consistent with the irrigation schedule and the treatments applied we found other three works in which water balance and sap flow methodologies were combined gong et al 2007 kang et al 2003 oren et al 1998 but not contrasted because es was not estimated independently as in our case the comparison presented in this work is therefore the first that presents three years of data and different levels of water status and time periods fig 9d and demonstrates a robust correlation between the two methodologies nonetheless there were also limitations in the sap flow technique one is the gum exudation in almond due to needle wounds that altered the calibration coefficient during the season which was corrected just in the fi tree when it was compared to the lysimeter tree in the case of the di treatments a different calibration approach would be required for greater accuracy finally as in other studies where deficit irrigation was applied to almond trees water shortage resulted in reduced canopy size egea et al 2010 goldhamer and viveros 2000 hutmacher et al 1994 romero et al 2004 although this could have negative effects on production goldhamer et al 2006 pointed it as a chance to increase yield via increased plantation density while consuming less water more years of study may be needed to assess the performance of di throughout the functional duration of a commercial almond plantation 5 conclusions moderate deficit irrigation strategies averaged a seasonal eta of 897mm 79 0 of fi with 524mm of irrigation 65 5 of fi there were no significant differences in eta between sustained deficit irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation strategies by contrast a more severe regulated deficit irrigation treatment reduced eta to 722mm 63 6 with 317mm of irrigation 39 6 as a consequence of the reduced water application the swc in the di treatments was much less than in fi at the end of the season with the risk of incomplete soil profile recharge particularly in dry winters the intersection point between almond et and applied water was somewhat lower than 1200mm and maximum seasonal swd was near 200mm in our soil and climate conditions furthermore sap flow measurements revealed that almond trees of some treatments extracted water from depths below the lowest measuring depth of 2 1m therefore depending on rainfall distribution and soil water holding capacity both precipitation and sw extraction may play an important role in seasonal crop water consumption and should be considered when analysing the effects of watering regimes on other crop features such as vegetative growth and yield both techniques chp cag sap flow and water balance presented limitations for the accurate estimation of eta and ta however the combination of both methods reduced the uncertainty in the determination of orchard et caused either by an unknown deep percolation and or by soil water depletion outside the monitored soil volume improvements in the calibration of the sap flow technique should enhance the accuracy of the determination of ta in almond trees under

11614,recently planted intensive almond plantations may have access to limited water supply due to water scarcity thus information on almond water use under limited irrigation is needed here the soil water balance was used to assess the consumptive use et of full irrigated moderately stressed and severely stressed almond trees over a three year study as well as the relation between applied water and et sap flow measurements in eight experimental trees were used to obtain independent transpiration t measurements evaporation from soil es was modelled to estimate tree t from the water balance relative consumptive use in the deficit irrigation di treatments largely exceeded the relative applied water highlighting the need to measure et in stressed treatments for hydrologic purposes the moderately stressed treatments irrigated at 65 5 of full irrigation consumed 79 0 of maximum evapotranspiration et of 897mm while the severely stressed treatment consumed 63 6 of etc et of 722mm when applied water was only 39 6 of control on average almond etc approached 1200mm seasonal evolution of the transpiration coefficient yielded maximum peak values ranging from 0 99 to 1 08 and minimum peak values of 0 33 attained with a severe deficit irrigation strategy transpiration measured by compensated heat pulse calibrated average gradient sap flow x was compared to water balance t estimates y and yielded a very good relation over the three years of study y 0 90x 4 23 r2 0 81 the sap flow measurements proved to be useful to overcome the limitations of the soil water balance technique revealing that almond trees were able to extract water from below the monitored depths and suggesting that deep percolation event must have occurred in spring and autumn keywords guara actual evapotranspiration water balance deficit irrigation sap flow compensation heat pulse 1 introduction almond is one of the major tree crops in spain in terms of cultivated area 619 915ha according to esyrce 2016 mapama 2016 although it has been grown traditionally in marginal lands under rainfed conditions recently irrigation has been introduced with concomitant changes for intensification of production however due to chronic water scarcity spanish water basin authorities of most areas are unable to allocate irrigation water for almond production to meet its potential requirements thus deficit irrigation di strategies for almonds must be applied in order to reduce water consumption with a minimum impact on crop productivity fereres and soriano 2007 in order to design successful di strategies and to assess consumptive use at the hydrologic basin scale both the maximum crop evapotranspiration etc and the actual evapotranspiration eta under different conditions of climate soil water availability and plantation typology must be known potential crop evapotranspiration etc can be measured by mass transfer or energy balance methods and can also be estimated using models such as the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 in the case of well watered almond trees there have been recent studies measuring etc with eddy covariance stevens et al 2012 or with a large weighing lysimeter espadafor et al 2015 there are many more difficulties in determining eta of tree crops under field conditions one option is to use the water balance approach to compute eta when et is limited by water deficits in the case of almond trees girona et al 2005 egea et al 2010 and egea et al 2013 have dealt with the responses to variable irrigation but the eta of stressed treatments was not measured nor calculated as all the results were expressed in terms of applied water aw that is irrigation ir plus effective precipitation peff the extrapolation of these responses beyond the soil and climatic conditions where they were obtained is questionable recently spinelli et al 2016 measured eta of deficit irrigated almond trees with eddy covariance but surprisingly they found that eta was the same as the etc of well watered trees the goodness of a soil water balance depends on the accurate estimation of soil water depletion swd by the root system for this purpose volumetric soil water content measured with the neutron probe method is considered to be advantageous over the use of other instrumentation such as tensiometers fdr or tdr evett and steiner 1995 however in all cases the spatial variability of soil water properties nielsen et al 1973 makes it necessary to seek a compromise between accuracy and practicality regarding the number of measuring points in a drip irrigated tree crop the variability coming from unevenly wetted soil surface is another issue requiring additional spatial variations in soil moisture observations andreu et al 1997 described the soil moisture variability and dynamics around a single irrigated almond tree they showed that regardless of the depths of measurement there is often significant uncertainty in the magnitude of the deep percolation component dp nevertheless there are a number of studies that have used the water balance approach in irrigated tree crops fereres et al 1982 and franco et al 2000 in young almond trees garnier et al 1986 girona et al 2002 and ayars et al 2003 in peach klaij and vachaud 1992 and kang et al 2003 in pear de azevedo et al 2003 and da silva et al 2009 in mango and iniesta et al 2008 in pistachio besides the soil water balance approach has been incorporated into most crop simulation models for an array of conditions belmans et al 1983 brisson et al 1992 campos et al 2016 choudhury et al 2013 eitzinger et al 2003 phogat et al 2017 for determining et from the soil water balance one needs to quantify the water fluxes entering namely precipitation p and irrigation ir and leaving runoff ro and deep percolation dp the soil profile under study during a period spanning two soil water content swc measurements once all the fluxes are measured or estimated et can be determined from the balance of inputs minus outputs additionally if evaporation from soil es can be measured or estimated bonachela et al 1999 2001 ritchie 1972 transpiration t can also be known sap flow probes allow the direct estimation of tree transpiration by integrating sap flow velocity deduced from measurements of heat diffusion within the available sap flow measuring methods the compensated heat pulse chp has been proposed by fernández et al 2001 as a tool for irrigation scheduling this technique is able to detect water stress as measured by the fall in tree transpiration relative to eto or when a reference t value is obtained fernández et al 2001 tognetti et al 2004 2005 however the azimuthal variations in sap velocity within a probed tree trunk makes calibration of sap flow sensors highly recommended lópez bernal et al 2010 lópez bernal et al 2015 nortes et al 2008 there are only a few reports that combine the water balance technique with sap flow measurements for calculating et such as in pines in usa oren et al 1998 pear trees kang et al 2002 and apple trees in north china gong et al 2007 in the context of almond production intensification under limited water supply the objectives of this research were a to determine the eta of almond trees undergoing different deficit irrigation regimes b to relate the eta to the level of aw in order to assess the relevance of soil water extraction under deficit irrigation and c to compare the soil water balance method for estimating t against sap flow measurements of t in almond trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and field management the three year experiment was conducted between 2014 and 2016 in a 5 5 ha almond cv guara orchard planted in 2009 trees were grafted on g 677 rootstock and planted in a 6 7m grid the field is located at the research centre of ifapa alameda del obispo in cordoba spain 37 8 n 4 8 w trees were pruned the two first years for scaffold formation and only again in january 2016 to ease machinery traffic there is an automated weather station about 300m apart from the orchard from which climate data were collected along the study in the centre of the orchard there is one large weighing lysimeter with one almond tree lorite et al 2012 which is representative of the rest of the orchard cordoba climate is typical mediterranean hot and dry summers and mild winters annual rainfall averages around 600mm the experimental soil of alluvial origin is deep of sandy loam texture in the first 150cm depth and lighter texture in the deeper layers the typical upper field capacity and lower wilting point limits of soil water storage are 0 23 and 0 08cm3 cm3 respectively the experimental trees were irrigated to satisfy their full water requirements since planting until the onset of the differential irrigation treatments in 2013 the control treatment and the rest of the trees outside the experimental area were fully irrigated trees were daily irrigated with 12 pressure compensating drippers 4l h with 1m distance between drippers per tree using two drip laterals each about 80 100cm away from the tree rows in 2014 there was one water meter per treatment in 2015 individual water meters ws15170 dn 15 3 4 abering madrid spain were installed in every experimental plot water meter readings were collected every two weeks in the new meters while the old ones were used for daily irrigation monitoring and management soil was kept free of weeds by both mower passes and herbicide applications and pests and diseases were controlled following a treatment calendar which was adjustable according to each season conditions mineral fertilization was calculated according to university of california recommendations http apps cdfa ca gov frep docs almonds html and its application followed the recommendations by muncharaz 2003 2 2 experimental design irrigation treatments started in spring 2013 by applying different limited irrigation levels with full irrigation supply as the control to induce a moderate stress level both sustained deficit irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation strategies were tested while severe water stress was induced by a more limited rdi regime thus irrigation treatments were thus planned as follows table 1 2 2 1 fully irrigated control fi these trees received the water requirements etc calculated as in fereres et al 2012 from 2015 on the relation between ground cover gc and a transpiration coefficient kt t eto proposed by espadafor et al 2015 that is kt gc 1 2 was used with an added 15 to account for the evaporation from emitters wet surfaces the addition of 15 was calculated using bonachela et al 2001 model assuming tree intercepted radiation of 60 and a wetted area by emitters of 25 by delaying the onset of irrigation some swc depletion by the trees was allowed early in the season to avoid deep percolation which would be significant if applying water to the soil at field capacity after winter rains 2 2 2 moderate sustained deficit irrigation sdim this treatment received 75 of fi 75 of etc throughout the irrigation season 2 2 3 moderate regulated deficit irrigation rdim this treatment received the same amount as fi in spring and after harvest but only 40 of fi during the kernel filling stage pre harvest period the aim was that the total seasonal amount would be the same as that of sdim 2 2 4 severe regulated deficit irrigation rdis in 2014 this treatment received the same as fi in spring and after harvest and only 15 of fi during the kernel filling stage however in the other two seasons the total irrigation amount was modified to apply 60 of fi during spring and in post harvest and 20 of fi during kernel filling each experimental plot consisted of 16 4 4 trees of which the central four were considered as experimental trees while the remaining 12 served as border treatments were repeated four times in a randomized complete block design in addition a single plot of 20 trees in the same 5 5ha orchard was left rainfed to observe the response to extreme stress 2 3 canopy architecture and radiation interception three to four measurements of canopy diameters and tree height were taken during each season with the help of a measuring tape and a marked pole ground cover percentage gc was calculated as the area of a circle of average tree diameter divided by the tree spacing canopy volume volc was approached as an ellipsoid vertical transmissivity was measured close to canopy architecture measurement dates with a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor biosciences linconln nebraska usa in the trees bearing sap flow probes one reference and up to seven depending on tree size radiation measurements were taken every 50cm in four orthogonal transects afterwards reference values were interpolated in time and transmissivity was calculated as the measured below canopy radiation divided by its reference value only the first ring vertical of the plant canopy analyzer was considered according to lang 1987 plant area for each transect pat can be calculated as 1 p a t i 1 n p a i π x 2 g 0 i 1 n 2 i 1 ln τ i where n is the number or measurement points x is the distance between them 50cm g0 is a cultivar dependent parameter for leaf insertion angle and τ is transmissivity the value of g0 used was 0 492 according to crespillo 2016 each transect was assigned a 90 sector of the whole canopy plant area density pad was finally calculated as pa volc and assumed not to vary between trees within the irrigation treatment intercepted radiation qe was calculated by adapting a simplified model developed for olive trees mariscal et al 2000 2 q e 1 exp k r v u 3 k r 0 52 0 00079 p d 0 76 exp 1 25 p a d 4 v u v 0 p d 10000 where qe is percentage of intercepted

evapotranspiration assessment by water balance 2 4 1 change in soil water content δswc soil water content in the first 210cm of soil profile was measured with a neutron probe campbell pacific nuclear scientific model 503 monitoring started at budburst and ended in october prior to leaf fall with an average interval between measurements of three to four weeks the neutron probe was calibrated for the experimental soil by taking soil samples for volumetric moisture content θ cm3 of water cm3 of soil at the time of access tube installation two separate calibration equations were used one for the first 15cm of soil and another for the rest of the profile down to the 2 10m depth readings were taken at 30cm intervals but for the first two readings near the surface which were taken between 0 and 15cm and 15 30cm depths the experimental plots of all treatments in replicate 1 were equipped with eight neutron probe tubes installed in the area between the four central trees while the plots of the other three replicates were equipped only with three neutron probe access tubes swc was calculated as a weighted average according to the area represented by each tube the three tubes were installed one near the irrigation lateral one almost in the middle of the lane and a third one in between as shown by the black open circles of fig 1 we compared the soil water measurements averaged over the eight tubes in rep 1 against those determined with the three tubes in the other three replicates as shown in the results section the rainfed plot was monitored with nine access tubes seasonal change in swc was calculated by addition of the swc changes between measurement dates 2 4 2 effective precipitation peff due to the relatively high soil infiltration rate and the flat field 100 of the rainfall over 0 2mm was considered as effective precipitation villalobos and fereres 2017 2 4 3 evaporation from soil es daily es was calculated following bonachela et al 2001 which divides orchard evaporation into two terms one from emitters wetted surface and another from the rest of the soil surface the percentage of emitter wetted soil surface ranged from 5 in the rdis during the severe deficit period to 25 35 40 in the fi in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the microadvective coefficient kw 1 0 was taken throughout spring and after harvest against 1 2 during summer bonachela et al 2001 in the rdis treatment fallen leaves created a mulch above the surface wetted by the emitters so a 50 reduction coefficient was used allen et al 1998 ritchie s model 1972 was used to calculate evaporation from the rest of the soil which required intercepted radiation values 2 4 4 evapotranspiration etwb and transpiration twb etwb was calculated from water balance between swc readings twb came from subtracting es from etwb seasonal et and t resulted from adding partial calculations the dp component could not be measured or estimated by water balance so it was not considered in our

measurements 2 5 transpiration measurements with chp sap flow tsf two sap flow probes were installed in a single tree per treatment in replicate 1 plus a second tree in rdis as well as in two rainfed trees and in the lysimeter tree the method used was the compensation heat pulse chp plus the calibrated average gradient cag for the hours of the day when the sap flow is very low testi and villalobos 2009 the probes designed and produced at the ias csic laboratory in cordoba spain are made of a 4 8w 2mm diameter stainless steel needle which emits heat pulses and two temperature sensors protected by stainless steel the upper temperature probe was 10mm above the heater while the lower was 5mm below the latter each temperature probe has four thermocouple junctions along it so heat pulse velocities can be known at different depths temperature difference dt between thermocouple junctions at the same depth was measured with less than 0 01k error every 8 probes were connected to a multiplexer am16 32 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa controlled by a datalogger cr10x or cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa at given intervals the multiplexer triggers a measurement cycle along which dt is measured at 1 s intervals for 10s a 2 s heat beat 0 12w mm is released and dt is measured again at 1 s intervals for 3min dt readings are collected in the datalogger the heat pulse velocities had then to be checked for wounding effects green et al 2003 sap flow measurements were calibrated with transpiration data from the lysimeter by covering the surface of the lysimeter with black plastic a thin layer of straw was placed over the plastic not to change the albedo thus avoiding soil evaporation in several 3 10days periods along the year the rest of probes were calibrated assuming a constant relation between their t and their gc at the start of the season before any stress had taken place the seasonal evolution of the calibration coefficient for every probe was assumed to follow the same pattern as the lysimeter probes sap flow measured transpiration of only one out of four trees which were taken into account in the water balance of each experimental plot to compare the two methods we needed to estimate from the water balance the transpiration twb of the probed tree for that purpose we used a weighing factor that corrected for the specific canopy volume volc of the probed tree 3 results 3 1 canopy volume and radiation interception fig 2 shows the time course of canopy volume volc and percentage of intercepted radiation qe in the different treatments along the study anova and subsequent lsd test conducted for the indicated dates showed that fi trees were always significantly larger and intercepted more radiation than severely stressed ones although 2016 winter pruning evened tree sizes somewhat regarding moderately stressed treatments both sdim and rdim were smaller than fi at budburst but did not differ significantly from fi trees later on in the seasons of 2015 and 2016 average fi volc achieved at the end of 2016 was 85 7m3 whereas rdis averaged 60 0m3 qe exceeded 60 of incoming radiation in fi rdim and sdim from 2015 onward on the contrary in the most stressed treatment qe remained below 60 in 2015 and under 55 in 2016 respectively 3 2 soil water dynamics fig 3 presents the comparison between the 3 tubes weighed average swc and the 8 tubes average swc taken at the same time in the four treatment plots of replicate 1 the excellent correlation obtained y 0 949 x r2 0 97 indicates that swc could be measured practically with three as well as with eight tubes therefore swc in replicates 2 4 could be well measured with just three tubes even though the regression equation of fig 3 was reversely applied to the replicates 2 4 swc measurements to correct the 3 tubes swc data fig 4 presents the time course of swc for the three seasons soil under fi trees had significantly higher soil moisture than in the other treatments at the end of 2014 and 2016 while no differences among treatments were found at the end of 2015 due to rainfall in october 2016 a lsd test could also segregate rdim from rdis and placed sdim in an intermediate group regarding the rainfed plot it can be observed that trees depleted the first 2 10m of soil by early july 2014 fig 5 depicts representative examples of volumetric soil moisture θ cm3 water cm3 soil along 2016 at different depths in fi and rdis to illustrate the differences in soil water patterns data from two tubes per treatment are shown one inside the drip wetted area and the other in the middle of the lane from the soil water content measurements we presume that deep percolation may have occurred from 4th march to early august under the emitters in the fi treatment fig 5a water extraction can also be seen at upper layers in fi and soil water outside the influence of the dripper was consumed by the time of harvest fig 5b in the case of rdis those treatments had depleted the monitored swc inside and outside the influence of the emitters fig 5c and d and transpired just what was applied as irrigation fig 6 displays the time course of the average θ for the four treatments summing up fi profile remained wetter than the rest throughout the season sdim depleted more soil water than rdim by the end of the season winter rains recharged the soil below 150cm in rdis and spring rainfall was consumed completely by the end of the irrigation season in early autumn a rainy spring in 2016 see table 2 filled all the treatments profile from budburst to the start of rdi treatments 3 3 crop evapotranspiration and transpiration coefficient table 2 displays eto calculated etc for irrigation scheduling peff and actual irrigation and the actual et calculated from the water balance for the four treatments average eto and peff throughout the study were 1071mm and 243mm respectively average three years etc was 1134mm for fi of which 800mm were contributed as irrigation moderate di strategies averaged seasonal eta of 897mm 79 0 of fi with 524mm irrigation 65 5 there were no significant differences in eta between sdim and rdim besides rdis treatment reduced eta to 722mm 63 6 with 317mm irrigation 39 6 for each season data are presented as seasonal values and divided into three periods spring pre harvest period where the deficits are applied in rdi and post harvest randomized complete block anova conducted on calculated et showed no significant differences amidst treatments from budburst to the start of pre harvest period in the first two years in pre harvest fi had the highest et values the two moderately stressed treatments presented significantly lower values than fi and higher than the severely stressed one after harvest lsd test segregated fi from all deficit treatments in 2014 whereas in 2015 rdis et values were significantly lower than those of the other treatments finally in 2016 means were separated in three groups fi both sdim and rdim and rdis on a seasonal scale fi consumed more water than the rest and the moderately stressed treatments consumed more than the severely stressed one no differences were found between sdim and rdim fig 7 represents the calculated seasonal et against aw ir peff for the four treatments and the three study years the 1 1 line represents a situation where all applied water is consumed by the crop et and no sw depletion takes place the vertical distance between the 1 1 line and the points above it represents the swd points below the 1 1 line in fig 7 indicate that some deep percolation took place as it must have happened in some fi replicates in 2016 from fig 7 it can be estimated that the maximum seasonal swd was about 200mm under the experimental conditions the time course of the transpiration coefficient kt calculated with water balance in the first and the last study years is shown in fig 8 maximum kt values for fi were 0 87 and 1 16 in 2014 and 2016 respectively in the rdis treatment kt dropped to minimum values of 0 14 and 0 33 in 2014 and 2016 respectively regarding the moderate deficit treatments the kt of rdim was lower than in sdim during summer but recovered after harvest and both treatments showed similar values at the end of the season around 0 46 in 2014 and 0 59 in 2016 3 4 a comparison of water balance estimates of ta against sap flow ta measurements fig 9 presents the comparison between the two methods of determining ta for every period between two swc measurements generally both methods agreed in the estimates of ta for rdis whereas there were some discrepancies in the other treatments in 2014 fig 9a the sap flow measurements of ta were lower than those obtained with the wb method in the period when irrigation was resumed after harvest in both rdim and fi during summer tsf was greater than twb in rdim whereas in 2015 fig 9b the same happened in sdim again fi showed tsf lower than twb after harvest in 2016 fig 9c some points over the 1 1 line can be seen in fi and rdim obtained during spring and autumn while before harvest tsf of rdim was greater than twb fig 9d shows data of the four treatments and three years overall the correlation was very good with a linear regression y 0 90x 4 23 r2 0 81 4 discussion in our three year study a di regime that applied 39 6 of fi irrigation rdis resulted in a much higher relative consumptive use equivalent to 63 6 of etc eta of 722mm our results contrast with those of spinelli et al 2016 that measured eta of a deficit irrigated almond orchard with eddy covariance and found no decrease in comparison with the well irrigated treatment other di works on almonds egea et al 2013 2010 girona et al 2005 reduced irrigation to 40 and 28 of their control treatments in their most severely stressed treatment however they did not take into account either precipitation or changes in swc when establishing relations between irrigation regimes and crop response if we consider the large climatic and soil variability throughout the almond growing areas it would be difficult to extrapolate tree responses to irrigation amounts to conditions other than those where they were obtained in fig 7 it can be seen that the intersection point between almond et and aw was around 1200mm and maximum seasonal swd observed in the rainfed plot in 2014 as well as in deficit irrigated trees was near 200mm which is 27 7 of the three year average eta of rdis in the experimental conditions this is particularly important if mild stressed or over irrigated treatments are chosen to analyse the effects of irrigation on crop response since different irrigation regimes could result in the same eta this is because the mild stressed tress would extract more water from the soil while the over irrigated treatments would have percolation losses below the root zone along with canopy size and etwb t and kt increased from the first to the last study year too on the one hand fi kt pattern reveals some sustained stress in 2014 possibly because of insufficient irrigation on the other the highest average kt obtained 1 16 can be overestimated due to percolation but experimental plots without percolation gave kt values between 0 99 and 1 08 along the summer leading to corresponding kc values from 1 10 to 1 27 which is in accordance with recently published kc values for almond espadafor et al 2015 garcía tejero et al 2015 goldhamer and fereres 2016 stevens et al 2012 the rdis made kt drop to 0 14 in 2014 and 0 33 in 2016 during the pre harvest period stress was too severe in 2014 and this treatment was increased in the deficit period from 280mm up to 370mm to avoid too severe stress when comparing sdim with rdim both reduced transpiration along summer but kt of sdim remained higher until full irrigation was resumed in rdim after harvest thus sdim got minimum values of 0 31 and 0 48 by early august 2014 and 2016 respectively while rdim reached minimum values of 0 38 and 0 42 by late july 2014 and mid july 2016 respectively nonetheless there were no differences in etwb smaller drip wetted surface in rdim made es relatively lower during the months of highest eto both treatments had recovered transpiration by mid september in table 2 and in fig 7 we can appreciate that et of fi treatment increased noticeably from 2014 to 2015 there are a couple of possible explanations for this firstly volc and qe increased from 2014 to 2015 fig 2 so growth had not finished yet secondly predicted etc for irrigation scheduling was lower than actual etwb so the kc used in 2014 may have been underestimated as well red leaf blotch was not under total control in 2014 and it reduced leaf area density and hence qe trees were much healthier the following seasons on the other hand percolation events due to the rainy spring together with the need to irrigate for fertilizing rose 2016 et values of fi therefore the shape of the regression line in fig 7 should be blunter at the upper extreme we can observe that the 2016 rainy spring after a dry winter brought points corresponding to the rest of the treatments under the regression line as well there was not so much swc available at the beginning of this season fig 4 and subsequent rainfall was already computed as aw instead of swd if we think of carryover effects of di on swc the most severe treatment kept similar values of total swc throughout the three years fig 4 however no recharge of the deepest layers was observed after winter and spring rains fig 5c and d as in moderately stressed treatments and fi figs 6 5a and b which may entail a change in the relation between aw and et on a longer term by reducing sw reservoir or after particularly dry winters regarding water balance limitations such as soil variability within an irrigated tree orchard our swc estimation with 3 neutron probe access tubes one nearby the irrigation lateral one almost in the middle of the lane and a third one in between resulted a good representative of the swc fig 3 however the water balance method overestimated et when dp is significant and underestimates it when swd occurs outside the monitored soil volume in this case below the 2 1m depth we delayed irrigation until late spring to prevent applying water to the soil at field capacity after the winter rains and thus have the trees consumed part of the sw reservoir however we cannot rule out the possibility that dp events may have occurred in the fi treatment which received the highest irrigation depths this would make the et of the fi treatment overestimated in the case of di treatments the dryness of the soil consequently with very low hydraulic conductivity should have prevented dp leading to more precise estimates of almond eta values the use of the chp cag sap flow technique allowed to detect these events in one of the replicates thus in 2014 fig 9a rdim must have extracted water below 2 10m since the sap flow measurements led to ta values greater than those of the wb method on the contrary there must have been some deep percolation in the period when irrigation was resumed after harvest in both rdim and fi in 2015 fig 9b it is sdim which seemed to have extracted water beyond 2 10m deep again fi showed deep percolation after harvest that year in 2016 fig 9c it seems that deep percolation occurred in spring and autumn in fi and rdim while extraction below 2 10m took place during the deficit period in the latter this all seems consistent with the irrigation schedule and the treatments applied we found other three works in which water balance and sap flow methodologies were combined gong et al 2007 kang et al 2003 oren et al 1998 but not contrasted because es was not estimated independently as in our case the comparison presented in this work is therefore the first that presents three years of data and different levels of water status and time periods fig 9d and demonstrates a robust correlation between the two methodologies nonetheless there were also limitations in the sap flow technique one is the gum exudation in almond due to needle wounds that altered the calibration coefficient during the season which was corrected just in the fi tree when it was compared to the lysimeter tree in the case of the di treatments a different calibration approach would be required for greater accuracy finally as in other studies where deficit irrigation was applied to almond trees water shortage resulted in reduced canopy size egea et al 2010 goldhamer and viveros 2000 hutmacher et al 1994 romero et al 2004 although this could have negative effects on production goldhamer et al 2006 pointed it as a chance to increase yield via increased plantation density while consuming less water more years of study may be needed to assess the performance of di throughout the functional duration of a commercial almond plantation 5 conclusions moderate deficit irrigation strategies averaged a seasonal eta of 897mm 79 0 of fi with 524mm of irrigation 65 5 of fi there were no significant differences in eta between sustained deficit irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation strategies by contrast a more severe regulated deficit irrigation treatment reduced eta to 722mm 63 6 with 317mm of irrigation 39 6 as a consequence of the reduced water application the swc in the di treatments was much less than in fi at the end of the season with the risk of incomplete soil profile recharge particularly in dry winters the intersection point between almond et and applied water was somewhat lower than 1200mm and maximum seasonal swd was near 200mm in our soil and climate conditions furthermore sap flow measurements revealed that almond trees of some treatments extracted water from depths below the lowest measuring depth of 2 1m therefore depending on rainfall distribution and soil water holding capacity both precipitation and sw extraction may play an important role in seasonal crop water consumption and should be considered when analysing the effects of watering regimes on other crop features such as vegetative growth and yield both techniques chp cag sap flow and water balance presented limitations for the accurate estimation of eta and ta however the combination of both methods reduced the uncertainty in the determination of orchard et caused either by an unknown deep percolation and or by soil water depletion outside the monitored soil volume improvements in the calibration of the sap flow technique should enhance the accuracy of the determination of ta in almond trees under
