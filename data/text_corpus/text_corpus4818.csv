24090,we present a new surface atmospheric dataset for driving ocean sea ice models based on japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 referred to here as jra55 do the jra55 do dataset aims to replace the core interannual forcing version 2 hereafter called the core dataset which is currently used in the framework of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments cores and the ocean model intercomparison project omip a major improvement in jra55 do is the refined horizontal grid spacing 55 km and temporal interval 3 hr the data production method for jra55 do essentially follows that of the core dataset whereby the surface fields from an atmospheric reanalysis are adjusted relative to reference datasets to improve the adjustment method we use high quality products derived from satellites and from several other atmospheric reanalysis projects as well as feedback on the core dataset from the ocean modelling community notably the surface air temperature and specific humidity are adjusted using multi reanalysis ensemble means in jra55 do the downwelling radiative fluxes and precipitation which are affected by an ambiguous cloud parameterisation employed in the atmospheric model used for the reanalysis are based on the reanalysis products this approach represents a notable change from the core dataset which imported independent observational products consequently the jra55 do dataset is more self contained than the core dataset and thus can be continually updated in near real time the jra55 do dataset extends from 1958 to the present with updates expected at least annually this paper details the adjustments to the original jra 55 fields the scientific rationale for these adjustments and the evaluation of jra55 do the adjustments successfully corrected the biases in the original jra 55 fields the globally averaged features are similar between the jra55 do and core datasets implying that jra55 do can suitably replace the core dataset for use in driving global ocean sea ice models keywords ocean model forcing surface fluxes cores omip jra55 do 1 introduction the framework of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments cores griffies et al 2009 danabasoglu et al 2014 and the subsequent ocean model intercomparison project omip griffies et al 2016 provides ocean and climate modellers with a common facility for performing coupled global ocean sea ice simulations this framework defines protocols for running coupled ocean sea ice models with boundary forcing derived from common atmospheric datasets its most essential element is the forcing dataset developed by large and yeager 2004 2009 hereafter referred to as the core dataset which is largely based on the surface atmospheric fields derived from ncep ncar atmospheric reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 to reduce biases and uncertainties in the reanalysis fields surface atmospheric fields such as winds air temperature and specific humidity are adjusted with respect to available observations the reanalysis products also contain downward surface fluxes such as the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes and precipitation rain and snow but these data are replaced by estimates that are more directly based on observational data such as from satellites although the core framework has become increasingly visible and successfully distributed no significant developments or maintenance of the dataset or protocol have occurred since 2009 for the core dataset the discontinuity in the source data for radiation fields is the main reason for prohibiting updates given that the scientific success of cores has only recently been demonstrated to the broader community this situation might be expected however the foundation of core omip cannot remain frozen indefinitely furthermore although the present core dataset and protocol have become widely used there are various shortcomings revealed through many recent studies based on the core protocol griffies et al 2009 danabasoglu et al 2014 griffies et al 2014 downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 wang et al 2016a 2016b ilicak et al 2016 danabasoglu et al 2016 tseng et al 2016 hence there is an urgent need to advance the scientific and engineering foundation of the core omip framework this advance must proceed in a timely manner to benefit ocean modelling communities around the world the ocean modelling community requires the following features of a forcing dataset all forcing datasets must be up to date currently the core dataset is available only through 2009 the datasets must not be tuned and adjusted to improve simulation results of a particular ocean sea ice model or to conform to a particular choice of a set of numerical schemes and parameters for ocean interior processes in coupled ocean sea ice models the heat and water budgets of forcing datasets must be balanced with respect to the applied surface flux bulk formulae the spatial and temporal resolutions of the datasets must be as sufficient as possible for forcing high resolution e g eddying coastal ocean and sea ice models the horizontal resolution of the core dataset is approximately 200 km t62 grids all available datasets such as other reanalysis products and radiation datasets should be considered the datasets should be extended to include pre 1948 data the core dataset satisfied only the second no model based tuning and third global balance items in the above list the following scientific and engineering backgrounds of forcing datasets also warrant revisiting the assumptions and corrections made in large and yeager 2009 who created the core dataset incorporation of new corrections based on new different observational data forcing over regions covered by sea ice surface ocean wave fields river runoff field including runoff from ice sheet melting diurnal cycling of wind and solar radiation by referring to new datasets that resolve some of the above issues ocean modellers hope to better simulate recent extreme climate events such as sea ice reduction in the arctic and the on going el niño la niña cycle and to understand these events in the context of long term variability the present developmental study is an international collaborative effort to produce a new atmospheric dataset for driving coupled ocean sea ice models based on the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 project conducted by the japan meteorological agency jma it aims to complement and eventually replace the existing forcing dataset from large and yeager 2009 jra 55 is among the more recent long term reanalysis projects it adopts a relatively high resolution 55 km atmospheric model and uses state of the art assimilation techniques the dataset extends from 1958 to the present and will be updated in forthcoming years as part of the jma operational climate services all atmospheric variables necessary for computing surface fluxes are taken from the forecast phase of jra 55 the temporal interval is 3 h data are originally provided on the reduced tl319 55 km grid but as a forcing dataset for ocean modelling we interpolate the data onto the normal tl319 grid see appendix a 1 for details the necessary variables are the downward shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes precipitation separated into rain and snow 10 m wind vector sea level pressure and the air temperature and specific humidity at 10 m shifted from their original 2 m height our preliminary evaluation indicated that the surface fields of jra 55 must be adjusted bias corrected locally and modified globally to impose flux balances similarly to the ncep ncar reanalysis in the core dataset and the ecmwf reanalysis in the drakkar forcing set brodeau et al 2010 see also fig 1 we adjust all variables except the sea level pressure we also consider time dependent adjustments to correct the abrupt shifts in the data quality of jra 55 these shifts are introduced by changes in the observing systems however to provide data in near real time the adjustment factors for the most recent decades will be continually used for future updates the jra55 do forcing dataset also includes the daily river runoff produced by operationally running a global river hydrodynamic model forced by an adjusted runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 suzuki et al 2017 however river runoff from greenland and antarctica is derived from observational climatology based on independent estimates that account for the discharge and melting of ice sheets and ice shelves the jra55 do dataset does not satisfy all the above listed items specifically future development is required to extend the data to pre 1948 to incorporate surface ocean wave effects and to improve atmospheric fields over regions covered by sea ice in this paper we introduce the new forcing dataset jra55 do based on jra 55 designed for driving ocean sea ice models as part of this presentation we describe general features of jra55 do the adjustment methods used in its construction and overall assessments of its quality because at least in the foreseeable future jra55 do is intended mainly for global modelling in the core omip framework our assessments focus on large scale features and global balances of the surface fluxes in a companion paper taboada et al 2018 we assess the wind patterns regionally including the eastern boundary upwelling zones in section 2 of the present paper we define the variables needed for forcing ocean sea ice models section 3 explains the method and rationale for adjusting the surface atmospheric variables of jra 55 section 4 details the river runoff fields and section 5 discusses the final adjustment procedure for global flux balance the large scale features of the dataset are evaluated in section 6 finally in section 7 we present a summary and concluding remarks we offer a suite of appendices that present the many technical details relevant for jra55 do appendix a explains the processing of the raw jra 55 data appendix b presents formulas to compute properties of moist air that we advocate as a replacement to those used by the current core omip framework appendix c gives details of the dataset appendix d introduces the sea surface temperature dataset cobesst ishii et al 2005 which was used extensively in jra 55 and the present study appendix e explains the evaluation and adjustment of the surface radiative fluxes of ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 kato et al 2013 which we adopted as the reference data to adjust the radiative fluxes of jra 55 appendix f presents a detailed comparison of surface meteorological variables with buoy observations appendix g shows an atlas of annual mean surface fluxes of jra55 do and their comparison with the core dataset 2 variables necessary for forcing ocean sea ice models in this section we briefly review the sea surface flux calculations and then derive the necessary surface atmospheric variables for forcing the ocean sea ice system although given in section 2 of large and yeager 2009 we provide the expressions here in support of the adjustment methods encountered later in this paper the ocean is forced at the sea surface by the fluxes of momentum τ heat q and freshwater f the ocean surface is covered by either atmosphere or sea ice and the fluxes are computed separately by different formulas when computing the surface flux in an ocean grid cell we assume that a normalised fraction fo of the cell is exposed to the atmosphere the momentum heat and freshwater fluxes are respectively expressed as follows 1 τ f o τ ao 1 f o τ io 2 q f o q ao 1 f o q io q r 3 f f o f ao 1 f o f io r where the subscripts ao and io denote the fluxes at the air ocean and ice ocean interfaces respectively in eqs 2 and 3 r denotes the total continental runoff the river runoff is treated as part of the surface freshwater flux in eq 3 and qr represents the heat transport due to runoff at present it is difficult to compute the ice ocean fluxes from observational data moreover the computations are strongly affected by the imperfect representation of the thermodynamic and dynamic processes in sea ice models therefore we do not try to adjust local ice ocean fluxes in this study however we use their global ocean averaged values for the purpose of closing the global ocean averaged heat and freshwater flux budget in a multi decadal time scale see section 3 2 3 we use approximate global mean ice ocean fluxes derived from a global ocean sea ice model simulation in a global ocean sea ice simulation under the core dataset conducted at the meteorological research institute mri e g tsujino et al 2011 the annual mean global ocean averaged cooling due to 1 f o q io is roughly 1 4 w m 2 for the freshwater flux we close the budget of the ocean sea ice system therefore instead of fio we consider the freshwater flux due to sublimation s over the sea ice or snow 4 f ocean ice f o f ao 1 f o p s r where p represents precipitation based on a global ocean sea ice simulation the global ocean integrated long term mean sublimation is taken as 0 05 10 9 kg s 1 upward we should revise this value in a future version when an observational estimate for this quantity becomes available in general a global balance of the surface momentum fluxes is not required the air ocean heat and freshwater fluxes are the sums of their components 5 q ao q sw q lw q la q se q p e 6 f ao p e where the positive direction of all fluxes is downward the shortwave radiation flux qsw is computed by 7 q sw 1 α q dsw where qdsw is the downward shortwave radiation flux and the albedo α a function of latitude is taken from large and yeager 2009 the longwave radiation flux qlw is computed by 8 q lw q dlw ϵ σ θ o 4 where qdlw is the downward longwave radiation flux ϵ is the emissivity here assumed as 1 0 to account for the small fraction of qdlw that is reflected lind and katsaros 1986 σ 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 is the stefan boltzmann constant and θo is the sea surface temperature the latent heat flux qla is equivalent to the evaporation e as follows 9 e ρ a c e q a q sat θ o δ u 10 q la l e where ρa and qa respectively denote the density and the specific humidity of air ce is the bulk transfer coefficient for water vapor q sat θo is the saturation specific humidity at the sea surface temperature and δ u is the surface wind relative to the sea surface current δ u u a u o l is the latent heat of vaporisation the sensible heat flux qse is computed by 11 q se ρ a c pa c h θ a θ o δ u where cpa is the specific heat of air ch denotes the bulk transfer coefficient of heat and θa is the surface air temperature the properties of moist air such as ρa cpa l and q sat are calculated by the formulas presented in appendix b we advocate using a set of formulas given by gill 1982 for computing the properties of moist air which is thought to be more accurate than the simple and cost effective set of formulas used for the current core omip framework as given by large and yeager 2004 because ρa and q sat are also a function of sea level pressure slp we need sea level pressure for computing fluxes precipitation occurs in the liquid rain or solid snow phase the temperature of surface freshwater fluxes in the liquid phase is assumed to equal the local sea surface temperature 12 q p e c po p e θ o where c po 3 99 10 3 j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of sea water in the above mentioned global ocean sea ice simulation conducted at mri the global ocean averaged long term mean f o q p e q r was approximated as 0 4 w m 2 the negative sign implies ocean cooling in the mri simulation all precipitation evaporation and runoff were assumed to be in the liquid phase the cooling results since evaporation dominates in low latitudes removing warm water from the ocean and precipitation dominates in high latitudes adding cold water to the ocean note that this argument only holds for ocean models that treat the surface freshwater flux explicitly for more details on the water heat flux readers are referred to griffies et al 2014 see their appendix a 4 the bulk transfer coefficients ce and ch parameterise the turbulent fluxes in terms of the surface atmospheric state they are usually computed along with the bulk transfer coefficient of momentum cd from which the surface stress is calculated as follows 13 τ ao ρ a c d δ u δ u note that in a more precise analysis part of τ ao is received by the surface ocean wave fields and the momentum is redistributed before reaching the large scale ocean circulation fields e g mitsuyasu 1985 scully et al 2016 however to our knowledge a global mapping of such momentum redistribution has not been attempted among the several propositions of bulk formulas we adopt the bulk formulas by large and yeager 2009 that have been used in the suite of core omip projects at both the air ocean and the air ice interfaces note that the use of a set of formulas given by gill 1982 to compute properties of moist air appendix b which we recommend here slightly deviates from the set of core bulk formulas in summary the ocean sea ice models are driven by seven atmospheric variables qdsw qdlw p separated into rain and snow θa q a slp u a which are sourced from the forecast phase of jra 55 and the river runoff r which is produced by running a global river hydrodynamic model forced by an adjusted runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 these variables are adjusted to minimise biases and to achieve a globally closed heat and freshwater flux in a multi decadal time scale besides these external data we need two ocean variables the sea surface temperature θo and surface current vector u o in most ocean sea ice models the values of these variables at the first vertical level are used as those of the sea surface although the first level in ocean models typically represents an average over a few meters rather than the sea surface itself necessary variables are summarised in tables 1 and 2 we provide full details of the dataset in appendix c 3 adjusting the surface atmospheric variables of jra 55 this section describes how we have adjusted the seven surface atmospheric variables of jra 55 that are necessary as explained in the previous section for computing surface fluxes we first describe the general adjustment strategy in sections 3 1 and 3 2 and then give more details on the adjustment processes for individual variables in sections 3 3 3 6 3 1 jra 55 and its subsets jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 harada et al 2016 is the first comprehensive reanalysis covering the last half century since the european center for medium range weather forecast s 45 year reanalysis era 40 uppala et al 2005 moreover the long term reanalysis was performed by a four dimensional variational method which has not been attempted before the coverage begins from 1958 and is planned to continue until approximately 2022 as part of the jma operational climate services the jra 55 system is based on jma s operational global data assimilation forecast system as of december 2009 jma 2007 2013 the assimilation window of the base system 6 hours is unchanged for jra 55 to derive the atmospheric fields for driving the ocean sea ice models we obtained 3 hourly outputs from the forecast phase the 3rd and 6th hours after initialisation rather than the initial analysis state meteorological variables such as temperature humidity wind vectors and sea level pressure were obtained from instantaneous data while fluxes such as radiation and precipitation were determined from three hour mean data here fluxes should be averaged quantities for any budget analyses using this dataset to be done consistently separately from the main atmospheric four dimensional variational analysis the jra 55 system also performs a two dimensional optimal interpolation analysis for the surface temperature and specific humidity at 2 m height and the surface wind vector at 10 m height kobayashi et al 2015 hereafter this analysis is called jra 55anl this analysis takes the forecast fields of the four dimensional analysis of jra 55 as the first guess the same correlation scales as the four dimensional analysis are used for the error of the first guess thus the analysis fields of jra 55anl are not significantly smoothed relative to the four dimensional analysis fields of jra 55 however the analysis fields of jra 55anl do not constitute the initial state for the forecast phase of the four dimensional analysis for developing jra55 do this separate surface analysis was extensively used as a reference dataset for adjusting the surface marine meteorological variables as explained in the following sections a subset of jra 55 jra 55 conventional jra 55c kobayashi et al 2014 uses the jra 55 data assimilation system but excludes satellite observations as a result it assimilates only the conventional surface and upper air observations the jra 55c project aims to improve the inhomogeneity of long term datasets by removing the historical changes in satellite observing systems for this purpose jra 55c was branched off from jra 55 in november of 1972 just before a vertical temperature profile radiometer vtpr was installed in 1973 from the jra 55c data we can assess the biases in the pre satellite pre 1973 period assuming that these biases have persisted into the recent period where they can be quantified by referencing to satellite data for reference the acronyms containing jra 55 or jra55 are listed in table 3 3 2 adjustment strategy 3 2 1 main adjustment fields derived from the forecast phase of jra 55 hereafter referred to as jra55 raw were adjusted to match their long term means with those of reference fields specifically the long term means of the jra55 raw fields and reference fields were calculated for an overlapping period and compared to determine adjustment factors the adjustment factors are spatially varying and no smoothness constraints were applied to the factors we used a multiplicative factor or offset depending on the nature of the variable offset factors were used for variables that can be positive or negative such as air temperature and wind direction however offset factors are awkward for strictly positive variables because the treatment of values around zero may not be uniquely determined for example simply applying a positive offset to precipitation will result in a situation that there is always a small amount of precipitation an offset is also awkward for downwelling shortwave radiation which is generally zero during the night thus to simplify the processing we used multiplicative factors for strictly positive variables in principle however it should be noted that we may modify the variance in an unconstrained manner by using multiplicative factors to adjust the long term mean actually based on the assessments on the older versions we used an offset to adjust wind speed which is a strictly positive variable in the latest version so as to retain the variance contained in the original jra 55 wind fields see also appendix c 3 1 in an advanced adjustment method we could constrain both mean and variance using both multiplicative factor and offset however adjusting the variance would require a large amount of work first the time scale of the variance to be adjusted such as stochastic seasonal or interannual would need to be chosen then it would be necessary to reconstruct a time series for both jra55 raw and the reference dataset to constrain the variance for the chosen time scale the choice of the time scale might be limited by the availability of the reference data it would also be necessary to confirm that the adjustment on the variance for a particular time scale would do no harm to variability in other time scales this approach might be taken for a future version after consideration of results from ocean model simulations that use jra55 do for this study we focussed on adjusting the mean state using a single factor either multiplicative or offsetting table 4 summarises the approaches for finding the adjustment factors to ensure that we can update the jra55 do dataset in near real time all variables including the radiation and precipitation are based on jra55 raw unlike large and yeager 2009 who sourced the radiation and precipitation from independent observation based data we adjust the radiation and precipitation data in a reanalysis dataset jra55 raw the adjustments were performed on reduced tl319 grid points where the jra 55 fields were originally provided the reference fields for most variables have been updated relative to those used for the core dataset large and yeager 2009 the rationale for this change will be presented in later subsections devoted to the adjustment method of each variable after making the main adjustments we zonally interpolated the fields on the reduced tl319 grid points onto the normal tl319 grid see also appendix a 1 we then made additional adjustments as explained in the next subsection the adjusted atmospheric fields are designated as jra55 adj to distinguish them from the final product jra55 do jra55 do was obtained after the global balance adjustment of jra55 adj see section 5 note that we did not adjust the sea level pressure because there is not good data to be used as a reference field therefore when applying the dataset to for example storm surge modelling the user should be aware of the possible inconsistencies between the surface pressure and the adjusted wind fields the atmospheric fields in jra 55 were sometimes shifted by changes in the observation systems kobayashi et al 2015 to accommodate these shifts we divided the dataset into several phases and separately adjusted each phase fig 12 of kobayashi et al 2015 shows the 2 day forecast scores at the geopotential height of 500 hpa the authors stated that the forecast scores of jra 55 show relatively large variations that correspond to the introduction of vtpr vertical temperature profile radiometer in 1973 the advent of satellite observing system in the late 1970s atovs advanced television and infrared observation satellite operational vertical sounder in 1998 and gnss ro global navigation satellite system radio occultation in 2006 the forecast score markedly improved in 1998 indicating improvement in the overall quality of reanalysis at that time discernible transitions also appeared from the late 1970s through the early 1980s especially in the southern hemisphere however we note that partitioning at the late 1970s will leave the period of 1973 1978 very difficult to correct adjust owing to the shortness of the period and the limited availability of observations on the other hand the year 1973 marks the inclusion of vtpr and the separation of jra 55c from jra 55 fig 1 compares the time series of the downward shortwave radiation and precipitation in the jra 55 jra 55c and core datasets from 1973 the shortwave radiation was clearly lower in jra 55 than jra 55c after 1998 the precipitation was clearly increased which was not seen in the core dataset and the shortwave radiation further lowered in jra 55 relative to jra 55c in jra 55 amsu a included in aug 1998 corrected the warm bias in the upper troposphere over the ocean whereas amsu b included in oct 2000 corrected the dry bias in the upper and middle troposphere over the ocean see figs 9 and 10 of kobayashi et al 2015 both corrections increased the overall precipitation over the ocean and possibly influenced the shortwave radiation the precipitation increase occurred mainly in the tropical regions kobayashi et al 2015 it should also be noted that from may 1997 jra 55 included the scatterometer winds ers from may 1997 to jan 2001 quikscat from jul 1999 to nov 2009 and ascat from jan 2008 thus the 1997 98 period is also a suitable transition point for wind field adjustment we also note that in fig 1 the long term mean global ocean averaged downward shortwave radiation and precipitation were biased high relative to those of the core dataset which warrants adjustment on jra 55 fluxes based on these assessments we divided the dataset period of jra 55 into three phases 1958 1972 phase i 1973 1997 phase ii and 1998 present phase iii we then applied different adjustment factors in each phase during phase i 1958 1972 only the conventional observations were available because reference fields for adjusting the reanalysis fields could not be constructed from these insufficient data we utilised jra 55c since it only uses conventional observations assuming that the biases in the pre satellite pre 1973 period have persisted into the recent period in jra 55c we assessed the general biases for phase i by using the jra 55c data in recent years when satellite data are available to construct reference fields a regime shift in the jra 55c data occurred around 1997 in the equatorial indian ocean specifically the intensification of westerly winds in the maritime continent region and over the equatorial indian ocean and the increase of divergence in the tropical region of the african continent occurred after 1997 results not shown such regime shifts were not found in observations or other reanalysis products and were considered to be an erroneous response of the atmosphere land surface system in jra 55c details of which have not been clarified yet consequently the general biases in the 1958 1972 period were evaluated using pre 1997 jra 55c data for the assessment of biases an appropriate period was selected for each variable from 1973 1996 based on the availability of the reference data see later sections for details when evaluating the biases in phases ii and iii we excluded the large el niño years 1997 and 1998 from the climatology computation the adjustment factors changed from 01 oct to 30 nov in 1972 between phases i and ii and from 01 jan 1997 to 31 dec 1998 between phases ii and iii the adjustment factors in the transition periods were linearly interpolated in time between the factors of the two adjacent phases 3 2 2 additional adjustments after the main adjustment the systematic biases introduced by native settings of jra 55 were corrected by the following secondary adjustments with motivation and details presented later in this section the temperature and specific humidity were smoothed around the marginal sea ice zones the extremely low air temperature around antarctica was cut off by introducing a floor function see section 3 3 4 for details during the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the monthly anomaly in core relative to jra55 adj was added to the temperature and specific humidity in high latitude regions the precipitation over the mediterranean sea was reduced during the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the first second and third corrections compensate for the lack of partial sea ice cover in the grid cells of the atmospheric model used by jra 55 the third correction is because ncep r1 on which the air temperature and specific humidity of the core dataset are based shows plausible sea ice distributions in comparison with jra 55 in the pre satellite period as shown later the fourth correction is to reduce the excessive precipitation around the european continent during the 1960s and 1970s due to processing errors on some radiosonde data used in jra 55 3 2 3 closing the budgets the adjusted atmospheric dataset jra55 adj was tested to see whether it could satisfy well recognised constraints as discussed below on the global surface heat and freshwater flux budgets when a realistic surface condition was applied section 5 when calculating the global ocean surface flux budget excluding the sea ice region we applied cobesst ishii et al 2005 as the lower boundary condition sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution appendix d briefly introduces cobesst the latitude dependent albedo and the bulk formulae including the saturation of the transfer coefficients in the high wind regime were taken from large and yeager 2009 the air properties were computed as described in appendix b cobesst is analysed on a 1 1 grid and its sst structure is smooth although a high resolution sst product can give more detailed and presumably more accurate structure of fluxes a low resolution product cobesst has been selected for this study because it is anticipated that the majority of ocean climate models that participate in cmip6 omip will adopt a nominal 1 degree horizontal resolution a model integration for about 300 years is required for the physical omip in the biogeochemical omip many tracers are added to the model and much longer integrations will be required for the spin up fulfilling these requirements with a mesoscale eddy permitting model is too computationally challenging for many modelling centres the sst structure of low resolution products is what a nominal 1 degree ocean climate model ideally reproduces thus as a forcing dataset to be used in the framework of omip jra55 do was evaluated and adjusted in terms of the global ocean averaged surface flux budget by using a low resolution sst product cobesst a use of higher resolution sst products should be considered in the future evaluation and development efforts as the computational resources to perform the omip experiments with mesoscale eddy permitting models become available for the majority of modelling centres as a constraint on the global surface heat and freshwater flux budgets we continue to adopt the constraint used by large and yeager 2009 that the long term mean globally averaged heat flux and globally integrated freshwater flux into the ocean sea ice system are both nearly zero or slightly positive 0 1 w m 2 for heat and 1 10 7 kg s 1 for freshwater fluxes levitus et al 2012 estimated that the global ocean heat uptake was 0 39 w m 2 for 1955 2010 and loeb et al 2012 gave 0 50 0 43 w m 2 for 2001 2010 these figures are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the major components of the surface heat budget such as shortwave radiation longwave radiation latent heat and sensible heat fluxes o 10 o 10 2 w m 2 church et al 2011 estimated that the global ocean mass change was 0 98 mm y 1 for 1972 2008 largely contributed by the melting of glaciers and ice caps this corresponds to a global ocean integrated mass flux of 1 1 10 7 kg s 1 which is again about two orders of magnitude smaller than the major components of the surface freshwater budget such as evaporation precipitation and river runoff o 10 9 o 10 10 kg s 1 here global oceanic area is taken as 3 654 1014 m2 it is desirable that the global flux budgets are nearly closed and comparable to the above estimates on a multi decadal time scale after the main and additional adjustments on local atmospheric variables and fluxes explained in the previous subsections have been applied unfortunately this closure is not necessarily the case as will be shown in section 5 an absence of closure implies that biases still remain in all flux components and that they may also vary regionally to assess and correct those regional biases a sufficient amount of local observational data would be necessary because such data are unavailable we do not attempt further local adjustment but instead attempt to exactly close the global surface flux budget specifically we applied a globally uniform time invariant adjustment factor on downwelling radiations and precipitation the adjustment factor for downwelling radiations was determined by requiring exact closure 0 w m 2 on a global ocean heat budget for a multi decadal time period 1988 2007 in the satellite era the adjustment factor is then applied for the entire dataset period details will be explained in section 5 the precipitation p was similarly readjusted after adjustment the global freshwater input to the ocean sea ice system formally balances with the evaporation e river runoff r and sublimation over the sea ice s i e e s p r 0 during the same multi decadal time period as used for the heat flux here the use of e instead of e implies an integration over a global ocean as well as an averaging over a multi decadal time scale in jra55 do the runoff is imported from other sources provided that the adjustment is minor any river runoff dataset that is optionally added to jra55 do will be adjusted to match its long term 1988 2007 mean with that of the first version 1 26 sv where 1 sv 10 6 m 3 s 1 see section 4 the final adjusted fields comprise the jra55 do dataset note that the long term closure adopted here will still allow for the study of interannual variability in the ocean sea ice system however it may preclude investigation of long term trends although a trend may be imposed by a user by slightly modifying the globally uniform factors applied to the downward fluxes on the other hand the exact closure may be suited for simulations run for multiple cycles of the nearly 60 year forcing in the omip experiments griffies et al 2016 because a long term trend will not be imposed a priori on the simulations 3 3 temperature and specific humidity 3 3 1 reference dataset a reliable long term dataset for adjusting the surface air temperature and specific humidity with consistently high data quality could not be found consequently we computed the reference values for these variables from reanalysis data using an ensemble mean approach for this purpose we selected seven atmospheric reanalysis products ncep r1 ncep r2 20crv2 era interim merra2 ncep cfsr and jra 55anl data were first mapped onto the reduced tl319 grid of jra 55 before the ensemble mean was computed when computing the ensemble mean we weighted the modern high resolution reanalysis products era interim merra2 ncep cfsr and jra 55anl higher than the old low resolution reanalysis products ncep r1 ncep r2 and 20crv2 the weighting factors for the modern and older products were 1 0 and 0 5 respectively at each grid point the contributions from the outliers the minimum 1st and the maximum 7th members were reduced to half the default weights this approach is designed to avoid isolated large or small adjustment factors that may appear around buoys e g tao arrays in the equatorial pacific ocean when considering individual reanalysis products as reported by josey et al 2014 furthermore the contributions from the old low resolution reanalysis products are excluded from the ensemble mean in semi enclosed seas and narrow bays by applying an additional weight shown in fig 2 the additional weight is first set to zero for the japan yellow east china mediterranean baltic black caspian and red seas persian gulf and california bay and unity in other regions then 50 passes of a 5 point smoothing filter is applied to moderate the transition from zero to unity because the atmospheric fields over the ocean in those regions are represented by only a few grid points in the low resolution products we decided that they do not have sufficient accuracy to be used as a reference for adjusting higher resolution reanalysis products surface air temperature over sea ice can differ widely between the different reanalysis products e g lindsay et al 2014 and so the ensemble mean air temperature is a dubious reference for data above sea ice therefore data over ice covered regions is referenced to the jra 55anl data because jra 55anl uses the jra 55 forecast as a first guess we can expect modest differences between them that is adjustment factors will be small relative to other possible reference datasets before jra 55anl is applied as a reference over sea ice the surface air temperatures in the arctic region of jra 55anl were adjusted with respect to the international arctic buoy programme iabp polar exchange at the sea surface poles iabp npoles rigor et al 2000 specifically the monthly climatological difference between jra 55anl and iabp npoles for the period 1979 1998 which is the period covered by iabp npoles were used to adjust jra 55anl for the entire dataset period see also footnotes of table 5 the general effect of the adjustment was to lower the air temperature of jra 55anl in the arctic ocean in the southern hemisphere jra 55anl was used as a reference field over sea ice without modification 3 3 2 adjustment of air temperature table 5 summarises the adjustment method the jra 55 surface air temperature was adjusted by the linear interpolation in time of monthly offsetting factors obtained by comparing the monthly climatology of jra 55 with the reference data the ensemble mean over the sea water and jra 55anl adjusted relative to iabp npoles over the sea ice see above the base time periods used for computing climatologies were 1980 1996 jra 55c 1980 1996 and 1999 2014 respectively for the three phases fig 3 shows the annual means of the offsetting factors applied in the three phases the offsetting factors for the three phases are qualitatively similar although there are some discrepancies among them in the indian ocean the northern north pacific and around antarctica they are generally positive over open water and negative over sea ice implying that the surface air temperature of jra 55 has a cold bias over open water and a warm bias over sea ice relative to the reference datasets 3 3 3 adjustment of specific humidity during the temperature adjustment the relative humidity of the original field is unchanged so the specific humidity should be modified accordingly given a relative humidity γ and a saturation specific humidity q s1 for the adjusted temperature the specific humidity q 1 after the temperature adjustment is given by 14 q 1 q s 1 γ 1 q s 1 1 γ the computation of the air properties is detailed in appendix b table 5 summarises the adjustment method in each phase the multiplicative factor for the specific humidity is determined by comparing the monthly climatology obtained from the ensemble mean with the recalculated specific humidity for computing the ensemble mean the same regional weighting was used as for surface air temperature the climatology obtained from the ensemble mean was used to adjust the specific humidity over sea ice since the specific humidity over sea ice did not differ widely between reanalysis products they were very low the same base time periods as air temperature were used for computing climatologies fig 4 compares the multiplicative factors for the three phases again the factors are qualitatively similar for the different phases in general the adjustment reduces the specific humidity implying a moist bias in the jra 55 data a moist bias was also reported by kobayashi et al 2015 the reduction is especially strong 10 in the high precipitation region in the tropics and the stronger reduction is required for phase ii than other phases 3 3 4 additional adjustments to correct errors introduced by various aspects of the jra 55 configuration detailed below we further adjusted the air temperature and specific humidity as follows we explain these adjustments in the order of their implementation note that because the temperature and specific humidity of the core dataset which are given at 10 m height are used as the reference fields for the additional adjustments explained below the height of the temperature and specific humidity data was shifted from 2 m to 10 m prior to the additional adjustments as described in appendix a 2 also the data on the reduced tl319 grid were interpolated onto the normal tl319 grid as explained in appendix a 1 the 10 m values were computed using the sea surface temperature from cobesst the ice surface temperature from the brightness temperature of jra 55 the adjusted equivalent neutral 10 m wind field explained in section 3 4 and the bulk formula of large and yeager 2009 with properties of moist air calculated by the formulas given in appendix b smooth transition of temperature and specific humidity around the marginal sea ice zones because the atmospheric model of jra 55 does not allow partial sea ice cover the air temperature can change abruptly in the marginal sea ice zones therefore to improve the representation of warmer air over partial sea ice cover the air temperature over the marginal sea ice zones was smoothed by applying 20 passes of a 9 point filter fig 5 a shows a schematic of the 9 point filter in this operation the temperature was left unchanged in regions of open water as well as in regions of almost total sea ice cover where the daily area fraction of sea ice exceeds 0 99 using the daily sea ice distribution from cobesst the number of passes 20 was determined rather subjectively the response function shown in fig 5b shows that small scale features less than 500 km are removed implying that the air temperatures over open water and almost total sea ice cover are linearly connected by this adjustment if the width of the marginal sea ice zone is less than 500 km as in the main adjustment the specific humidity was modified along with the temperature fig 6 shows the changes in air temperature in the winter of each hemisphere which result from this additional adjustment the filter smoothed the step like discontinuity of air temperature at the boundary between open water and sea ice by raising temperature on the sea ice side thus only positive differences appear in the marginal sea ice zones cut off of extremely low air temperature around antarctica the air temperature around antarctica was adjusted as described by large and yeager 2004 2009 for the core datasets in the core datasets the extremely low temperatures were cut off by applying an annual cycle of the minimum temperature based on weather station and drifting buoy bryan personal communication 2002 for jra55 do we used the same formula for the annual cycle of the minimum temperature specifically t min ϕ t is defined as a function of latitude ϕ south of 60 s obtained by fitting sinusoidal curves to the observed monthly minimum temperature 15 t min ϕ t b 0 b 1 ϕ c 0 t a 0 a 1 ϕ with a 0 21 841 c a 1 0 477 c degree 1 b 0 61 846 c b 1 1 107 c degree 1 and 16 c 0 t cos 2 π t t 1 year ψ 0 where ψ 0 0 298 radian 17 january where t represents the time since the beginning of a year whose total time is t 1year at 70 s the maximum and minimum of t min is 4 095 c and 27 193 c respectively to smooth the transition the cut off was extended northward toward 50 s using the time dependent minima at 60 s t min 60 t to summarise 17 t λ ϕ t max t λ ϕ t t min ϕ t for ϕ 60 18 t λ ϕ t max t λ ϕ t t min 60 t for 60 ϕ 50 where λ denotes longitude again the temperature and specific humidity were modified together fig 7 shows the resulting changes to air temperature and specific humidity during winter in the southern hemisphere the air temperature is warmed by 5 10 kelvin in the marginal sea ice zone the specific humidity is raised accordingly adding the monthly anomaly of core to the temperature and specific humidity of the high latitude regions during the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the sea ice distribution of jra 55 is based on cobesst in the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the sea ice distribution of cobesst in the southern hemisphere is largely based on climatology so the inter annual variabilities of the air temperature and specific humidity in the high latitude southern hemisphere are unreliable in the northern hemisphere the sea ice distribution of cobesst is based on walsh and chapman 2001 in the pre satellite period but the sea ice extent of cobesst tends to be higher than the original data in the marginal sea ice zones identifying the reason for this is beyond the scope of this paper we simply consider how to remedy the discrepancy in ncep r1 which is used as the basis for air temperature and specific humidity in the core dataset sea ice does not show such extensive distributions furthermore ncep r1 uses various sea ice analyses in addition to walsh and chapman 2001 prior to 1978 when available kalnay et al 1996 in fig 8 a regions of extensive sea ice distributions in the labrador sea in jra 55 for the pre satellite period 1958 1978 are marked as x and y relative to the less extensive sea ice in ncep r1 for the same period fig 8b the latter exhibits better agreement with the labrador sea sea ice fraction in both jra 55 and ncep r1 for the satellite period fig 8c and d suggesting that the jra 55 sea ice fraction in the pre satellite period is probably too high as a result the air temperature and specific humidity of jra 55 tend to be suspiciously low in the marginal sea ice zones specifically in the labrador sea in the pre satellite period which can result in unrealistically strong deep water formation in ocean models thus at latitudes poleward of 40 n or 50 s we added the time series of the difference of the temperature and specific humidity between the adjusted jra 55 and core core minus the adjusted jra 55 to the adjusted jra 55 fields for 1958 1978 the time series was constructed by the linear interpolation in time of the monthly differences the monthly differences were smoothed with 50 passes of a horizontal 9 point filter over the ice free ocean whose response function is shown in fig 5b the smoothing removed the high wave number wave length less than 1000 km ripples in the air temperature field of core which are traceable to ncep r1 see also appendix g 1 fig 9 shows the resulting changes in air temperature in the winter of each hemisphere the air temperature is warmed in the labrador sea whereas it is cooled in the arctic ocean and around antarctica this operation was not applied to the western north pacific region 40 65 n and 125 160 e because the difference was large warming in the southern part of the okhotsk sea which was due to a low sea ice extent in the okhotsk sea used by ncep r1 in the pre satellite period this is marked as z in fig 8b in this region the sea ice distribution in the pre satellite period of jra 55 shows a better match with that in the satellite period than ncep r1 3 4 wind vector 3 4 1 reference dataset the main reference dataset for the surface wind vectors is the remote sensing systems quikscat ku 2011 daily ocean vector wind on 0 25 grid version 4 ricciardulli et al 2011 ricciardulli and wentz 2015 hereafter referred to as quikscat we first computed the time series of the monthly scalar wind speeds and the zonal and meridional components of the wind vectors from daily data on the original 0 25 grid at each grid point the monthly data are used if available on more than one third of the total number of days in that month the time series data were then mapped onto the reduced tl319 grid of jra 55 the data gaps are caused by the shifting satellite orbits rain contaminations and the presence of sea ice in grid cells where the monthly data were not available jra 55anl wind data was used this treatment should smooth the transition of the adjustment factors in the marginal sea ice zones from the derived monthly dataset we generated time series of the annual mean and its climatology on the reduced tl319 grid quikscat wind is available from aug 1999 to oct 2009 sufficiently long for referencing phase iii this is an improvement relative to the core dataset for which only 5 years of reference data was available for adjustment in phases i and ii the wind speed was adjusted using an ssm i based wind speed product wentz 2013 because this product extends from 1988 to the present the ssm i wind speeds over the entire period were adjusted relative to the quikscat wind speed during the nov 1999 to oct 2009 period the adjusted speed then provided the reference for adjusting the jra 55 wind speed because the wind vector components are not available from ssm i the adjustment factor for the wind direction used for phase iii were applied to phases i and ii because quikscat and ssm i measure equivalent neutral wind at 10 m height the adjustment procedures are performed in terms of equivalent neutral wind accordingly before filling the gaps in the satellite data we converted the jra 55anl wind to the equivalent neutral wind using the meteorological variables from jra 55anl similarly the jra55 raw actual winds were converted to equivalent neutral winds before computing the adjustment factor using the surface air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m after the main adjustment explained in sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 but as ocean sea ice models assume input of actual 10 m winds the final step is to convert the adjusted jra 55 equivalent neutral winds back to actual winds this was done using the adjusted surface meteorological variables in these conversions we used the sea surface temperature from cobesst the ice surface temperature from the brightness temperature of jra 55 and the bulk formula of large and yeager 2009 with properties of moist air calculated by the formulas given in appendix b 3 4 2 adjustment table 6 summarises the adjustment method for the wind vectors the adjustment method is a slight modification of that described in large and yeager 2009 see also appendix c 3 1 the magnitude and direction of the wind vector were adjusted by an offsetting factor δw λ ϕ and a counter clockwise rotating factor χ λ ϕ respectively where λ and ϕ respectively denote longitude and latitude these adjustment factors are constant in time specifically the wind vector of jra55 raw u jra55 v jra55 at λ ϕ was adjusted as follows 19 u adj v adj w jra 55 c δ w w jra 55 cos χ sin χ sin χ cos χ u jra 55 v jra 55 where 20 w jra 55 max u jra 55 2 v jra 55 2 0 3 m s 1 and 21 c tanh d d max w jra 55 0 3 m s 1 0 δ w in 19 the offsetting factor for the wind speed δw was computed by subtracting the long term average of jra55 raw wind speed w jra 55 from that of the reference wind speed w ref 22 δ w w ref w jra 55 in 20 a 0 3 m s 1 floor on the equivalent neutral wind speed of jra55 raw was introduced to avoid the zero division in 19 the factor c defined by 21 tapers the adjustment to ensure that wind speed is not modified for the minimum wind speed w jra 55 0 3 m s 1 adjustment is not applied c 0 for the minimum wind speed and gets closer to the full adjustment c 1 as the wind gets higher for wind direction large and yeager 2009 computed the rotating factor as the angle difference between the long term means of the reference and the ncep ncar reanalysis because the angle differences could be very large 180 in low wind regions especially around the transitions between easterly and westerly large and yeager 2009 introduced a tapering as a function of the magnitude of the vector average wind for jra55 do we apply an analysis method used in the works of kundu and allen 1976 and yoshikawa et al 2007 who analysed low frequency current fluctuations near the oregon coast and the relation between the surface wind vector and the vertical profile of the oceanic ekman current respectively specifically we computed the rotating factor χ not from the angle differences but using a complex empirical orthogonal function ceof analysis the ceof can estimate the rotating factor in low wind regions without requiring special treatment first we prepared time series of the monthly mean wind vectors from the reference data and jra55 raw during the nov 1999 oct 2009 period a wind vector is expressed as a complex variable w u i v we then construct a complex matrix w whose two columns contain the 10 year time series of the monthly reference data and jra55 raw next we computed the 2 2 covariance matrix r w w where w is the hermitian transpose of w the eigenvectors of r are ceof modes of the time series if jra55 raw largely reproduces the reference data the first mode with a positive eigenvalue is the co varying correlated mode from the co varying mode we obtained the rotating factor for jra55 raw as the angle between the components of the corresponding complex eigenvector preliminary analysis showed that the magnitude of the rotating factor tended to be large 45 if the total energy accounted for by the first mode was small thus a reduction factor ξ as a function of the total energy accounted for by the first mode γ 1 λ 1 λ 1 λ 2 where λ 1 and λ 2 are the eigen values of the 1st and 2nd mode respectively was introduced to taper the rotating factor 23 ξ 1 2 1 tanh 2 γ 1 0 9 the transition of ξ occurs approximately from γ 1 0 95 ξ 1 to γ 1 0 85 ξ 0 fig 10 shows the offsetting factor for the wind speed in the three phases in all phases the wind speed in the intertropical convergence zones is enhanced and that in the middle and high latitudes is reduced the offsetting factor is generally smaller in phase iii than other phases because scatterometer winds were assimilated for the period corresponding to phase iii in jra55 raw fig 11 a shows the rotating factor for the wind direction over the entire period mid latitude westerly winds are rotated equatorward in both hemispheres trade winds in the intertropical convergence zones are made more divergent the first ceof modes explain more than 95 of the total energy in most regions specifically around the transitions between easterly and westerly 30 n s exceptions are found in several coastal regions fig 11b the eastern tropical north pacific off the coast of central america is one of those regions where the wind direction is strongly affected by orography simulation results should be interpreted with some care in those regions users interested in detailed exploration of the regions of problematic wind direction could modify the rotation scripts which are freely available see appendix c choosing perhaps to eliminate the rotation correction in these regions fig 12 compares the equivalent neutral wind speeds at 10 m height zonally averaged over the ocean the wind speeds are generally stronger in core than in quikscat and jra55 do because the actual winds in core are directly adjusted relative to the equivalent neutral winds in quikscat indeed when zonally averaged the actual wind speed of core compares well with the equivalent neutral wind speed of quikscat results not shown for further discussions on the comparisons across wind products readers are referred to taboada et al 2018 3 4 3 comments on the adjustment of wind vector relative to satellite products because the microwave scatterometer quikscat and radiometer ssm i primarily infer the wind stress from surface wave fields they essentially detect the surface wind speeds relative to the oceanic current at the sea surface δ u in eq 13 because the direction and speed of the surface wind usually influences the surface ekman current adjusting the wind speed by the above method slightly weakens and rotates the true wind vector moreover the quasi steady surface current can reach 1 m s 1 in the western boundary current and in the equatorial regions and the surface current may reach several tens of cm s 1 within mesoscale eddies in these cases the difference between the absolute and relative wind vectors is non negligible users of the present dataset should be aware of this limitation and its possible impact on their simulated fields e g abel et al 2017 in future work the absolute wind vector u a could be estimated from the surface current u o derived in an oceanic reanalysis or state estimation e g rio et al 2014 for this version we provide a climatological mean surface current u o clim computed from the dataset of rio et al 2014 the climatology is based on the period used to construct the reference wind field from quikscat nov1999 oct2009 this climatological surface current could be added to the time series of the wind vector of this dataset to approximate the time series of the absolute wind vector 3 5 shortwave and longwave radiation 3 5 1 reference dataset we used the ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 data kato et al 2013 as the reference dataset for the downward radiative fluxes ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 consists of surface irradiance fluxes as well as other variables derived from the clouds and earth s radiant energy system ceres satellite measurements of top of atmosphere toa radiation loeb et al 2012 ebaf energy balanced and filled refers to adjustments made to ceres data within its uncertainty to make it consistent with the estimated global average heat storage in the ocean of 0 50 w m 2 loeb et al 2012 the estimates of surface fluxes derived from radiative transfer theory using data on clouds atmosphere surface and aerosol properties are constrained to give toa radiances that match ceres ebaf in turn kato et al 2013 ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 hereafter referred to as ceres is considered a state of the science product replacing the earlier isccp fd dataset zhang et al 2004 used in core as the latest dataset of its kind ceres has been widely used as a reference in verification studies ceres data now cover 15 years sufficiently long for comparisons with other data following large and yeager 2004 2009 who produced the core data using isccp fd radiation we compared the ceres data with buoy observations and evaluated the necessity of adjusting them before their application to the reference fields accordingly the shortwave radiation was reduced at low latitudes and over sea ice by up to 4 and 10 respectively fig 13 however the longwave radiation was left unadjusted see appendix e for details on the adjustments applied to ceres 3 5 2 adjustment table 7 summarises the adjustment procedure the monthly multiplicative factors were identical in phases ii and iii and were based on the 15 year mar 2000 feb 2015 monthly climatologies of the adjusted ceres and jra55 raw the reference field in phase i was the adjusted jra 55 jra55 adj downward radiation acquired from 1979 to 1996 the monthly climatologies of jra55 adj and jra 55c were compared over this period and the adjustment factors over the 1958 72 period were then determined fig 14 shows a comparison of the annual mean multiplicative factors in the two periods generally the shortwave radiation is enhanced at low latitudes and reduced at high latitudes the exception at low latitudes is the eastern part of subtropical oceanic basins where the shortwave radiation is above the reference value and is reduced by the adjustment the biases in the downwelling shortwave radiation are generally related to precipitation as will be shown in the next subsection notably about a 30 reduction is required for shortwave radiation in the southern ocean which implies insufficient clouds there in jra 55 this is consistent with the analysis on the top of atmosphere presented by kobayashi et al 2015 see figs 19 and 20 of kobayashi et al 2015 the longwave radiation is adjusted in the opposite sense of the shortwave radiation reflecting the compensatory nature of shortwave and longwave radiations in the radiative transfer models when the climatological value in a grid point was below 5 w m 2 as occurred for shortwave radiation in the polar night region the multiplicative factor for that month was set to unity fig 15 compares the zonally averaged downward shortwave and longwave radiations over the ocean overall the large bias found in jra55 raw was successfully corrected in jra55 do the jra55 do and core datasets are comparable 3 6 precipitation 3 6 1 reference dataset the precipitation adjustment was referenced to the core dataset the precipitation field of the core dataset is comprised of several data sources the global ocean is separated into several latitude bands and an appropriate dataset is chosen for each from the south the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 for poleward of 65 s cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap xie and arkin 1996 for 65 s 30 s gpcp for 30 s 30 n cmap for 30 n 70 n and a combined serreze and hurst 2000 and yang 1999 climatology for the arctic poleward of 70 n the data with interannual variability is only available after 1979 in the earlier version of the dataset the global ocean averaged precipitation showed a rapid increase during the most recent decade which was not found in the gpcp v2 3 dataset adler et al 2003 see also appendix c 3 2 this is thought to be caused by the introduction of gnss ro global navigation satellite system radio occultation in 2006 as well as the increase in the number of radiance observations from satellite water vapor channels because it is not desired that the enhanced precipitation remains in the updated data in the future phase iii is further divided at 2006 and different adjustment factors are computed for the first and second halves phase iiia and phase iiib respectively we used the core dataset for the first half in the second half we used a product based on the gpcp v2 3 dataset because the core dataset is only available until 2009 because gpcp v2 3 extends from 1979 to the present the gpvp v2 3 precipitation over the entire period were first adjusted relative to the core dataset during the 1979 to 2009 period thus the adjusted precipitation provides the reference for adjusting the jra 55 precipitation for phase iiib 3 6 2 adjustment table 8 summarises the adjustment method the monthly multiplicative factors f λ ϕ t with thresholds 1 3 f 3 were determined from the monthly climatologies of jra55 raw and the adjusted gpcp v2 3 in phase iiib during the 2006 2015 period jra55 raw and core during the 1999 2006 period in phase iiia and the 1979 1996 period in phase ii the adjustment factor in phase i was determined by comparing the monthly climatology between jra 55c and core from 1979 to 1996 the purpose of thresholds f was to avoid excessive correction such as extreme rainfall events f 3 and the overall removal of moderate rainfall events f 1 3 the choice of the specific factors of 1 3 and 3 is subjective fig 16 compares the multiplicative factors for the four phases the factors are qualitatively similar precipitation must be reduced in the intertropical convergence zones and enhanced toward the west of the continents at low latitudes fig 16 also implies that the areas affected by the thresholds on the multiplicative factors are very small justifying the present choice fig 17 compares the zonally averaged precipitation over the ocean precipitation in the intertropical convergence zones is exaggerated in jra55 raw but is comparable with the core data in jra55 do the reason for the excessive precipitation in jra55 raw was discussed by kobayashi et al 2015 according to the authors large moistening increments occur in the region near the intertropical convergence zones in order to correct the dry bias in the upper and middle troposphere tending to appear in the first guess this results in the large precipitation seen near the intertropical convergence zones in jra 55 3 6 3 additional adjustment in the mediterranean after the first adjustment the precipitation remained exaggerated in the mediterranean during the 1958 1978 period fig 18 this is due to processing errors on some of the radiosonde data used in jra 55 in 1960s to 1970s the impact of this error on oceanic precipitation was limited except for the mediterranean this excessive precipitation which might affect transport at the strait of gibraltar was corrected by estimating the annual precipitation over the mediterranean from 1958 to 1978 the estimation is described below the precipitation on the land around the mediterranean was first calculated using global precipitation climatology center gpcc schneider et al 2011 data from 1958 to the present additionally the precipitation over the mediterranean was calculated from core for the 1979 2009 period when the inter annual variability of precipitation was available in this dataset to estimate the annual mean precipitation in the mediterranean from the precipitation over the land we computed the ratio of the long term 1979 2009 mean ocean core precipitation to the land gpcc precipitation and applied it to the time series of the annual mean land precipitation from gpcc the estimated annual mean correlates well with the ocean precipitation from core c f the black and green lines in fig 18 thus the adjusted jra 55 precipitation on the mediterranean was calibrated by the estimated annual ocean precipitation over the 1958 1978 period the annual mean precipitation integrated over the mediterranean in the adjusted jra 55 was compared with the yearly precipitation estimated from gpcc the ratio of the two values defines the calibration factor for the given year the annual calibration factors were linearly interpolated in time and applied to the instantaneous mediterranean precipitation values in the adjusted jra 55 the result jra55 do is depicted as the red line in fig 18 4 runoff the main part of the river runoff freshwater discharge at river mouths was taken from a dataset presented in suzuki et al 2017 in this dataset the river discharge to the ocean was calculated by the global river routing model cama flood yamazaki et al 2011 yamazaki et al 2013 the input runoff from the jra 55 land surface model is then routed to oceans along the river network map which is fitted to the land surface model the longitudinal and latitudinal resolution of the model is 0 25 the input runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 contains biases that were corrected by the multiplicative factors as explained by suzuki et al 2017 in this correction the input runoff was adjusted so that cama flood gives the river discharge into the ocean that fits with that reported by dai et al 2009 the river discharge data of dai et al 2009 were extended to 2015 by a linear regression using the annual total precipitation of gpcp v2 3 adler et al 2003 on the drainage basins the multiplicative factor applied to the input runoff is estimated as the ratio of the river discharge by dai et al 2009 to the total input runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 in each drainage basin before this estimation a low pass filter a 5 year lanczos window was applied to both input runoff and river discharge the factors were fixed before 1962 and after 2011 at the values for 1963 and 2010 respectively the choice of 1963 is to exclude the first 3 years 1958 1960 from the computation of the adjustment factor during 1958 1960 precipitation over land showed significant variability that resulted in the large variation of the river discharge fig 19 the choice of 2010 is because after 2010 no distinctive time dependent biases were seen in jra 55 and the assimilation method of jra 55 was frozen to moderate the correction the multiplicative factor was confined to 0 2 5 0 these procedures were applied to 38 major continental rivers with large river discharge and to seven rivers with a large drainage basin area see suzuki et al 2017 for the list of these rivers these rivers were selected because they are well resolved by the model with the 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the river discharge from the remaining small rivers was separated into 12 divided ocean basins the western and eastern part of the three major atlantic pacific and indian oceans the arctic ocean the mediterranean black baltic and red seas and the hudson bay in the above adjustment procedure the total input runoff into the small rivers was adjusted to match the sum of the river discharges from the divided basins excluding the discharges of the 45 major rivers the depths and widths of the 38 major continental rivers in cama flood were tuned ad hoc to fit the climatology of the seasonal cycle with that of dai et al 2009 fig 19 compares the time series of the annual mean global ocean integrated river discharges into the oceans in the core dataset dai et al 2009 and the cama flood simulation of suzuki et al 2017 the simulated annual mean river discharges vary similarly to the discharges from the major continental rivers reported by dai et al 2009 partly because the long term input was adjusted to dai et al s 2009 data by the time dependent multiplicative factor the excessive river discharge in 1958 of jra55 do occurred because the high runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 of that year could not be appropriately corrected by the present adjustment method that uses the multiplicative factor for 1963 during the period 1958 1962 the river model used by suzuki et al 2017 is suitable only for liquid water thus in basins with significant runoff in the solid phase such as greenland and antarctica we used climatologies of existing datasets namely the climatologies of bamber et al 2012 for greenland and depoorter et al 2013 for antarctica we provide them as the total i e liquid plus solid river runoff in the main dataset the separate components are also provided if available appendix c we used a monthly climatology of greenland runoff for jra55 do because the interannually varying dataset is available only until 2010 this will be modified when an update to bamber et al 2012 which extends the seasonally varying time series to 2016 and will be imminently available bamber et al 2018 appendix c the climatology is based on the period 1961 1990 after which the total river runoff started to increase rapidly bamber et al 2012 during the 1961 1990 period the annual mean total river runoff from greenland is 0 0278 sv in jra55 do and 0 002 sv in core that is the total river runoff from greenland is an order of magnitude higher in jra55 do than that in core fig 20 compares the monthly climatology of the total river runoff from greenland in the two datasets the seasonal variability of the total river runoff also differs between jra55 do and core bamber et al 2012 utilises a high resolution regional climate model validated with in situ observations alongside observations of solid ice discharge however there was no gauges along the coastal greenland in the runoff dataset of dai et al 2009 on which core is based consequently jra55 do is considered to be more realistic than core for greenland for antarctica the annual mean runoff of the liquid and solid phases was represented by ice shelf basal melt and calving flux respectively as provided by depoorter et al 2013 prior to this study it was believed that iceberg calving was by far the dominant runoff mechanism but it is now evident that ice shelf bottom melting is of equal magnitude and importance depoorter et al 2013 provides a snapshot of the fluxes for the year 2009 for parts of west antarctica both bottom melting and calving have increased over at least the last 15 years paolo et al 2015 in east antarctica however the fluxes have been relatively stable during the satellite era and the 2009 value is a reasonable estimate of the long term value for west antarctica this is a less valid assumption even though the difference is only on the order of 9 msv paolo et al 2015 in depoorter et al 2013 the average annual mean of the liquid plus solid runoff from antarctica is 0 0876 sv versus 0 073 sv in core in contrast to core jra55 do provides a spatially variable antarctic runoff based on observations in fig 21 the runoff from antarctica is divided into longitudinal bins at 10 intervals note that the non uniform distribution of the 10 bins in core reflects the different numbers of coastal grid cells contained in each bin the runoff is generally higher in jra55 do than in core except the region 30 w 70 e including the eastern part of the weddell sea 0 30 e and the region 130 170 e including the eastern part of the eastern indian ocean sector where it is higher in core for the 1998 2007 period the global ocean integrated annual mean runoff in jra55 do totals 1 2566 sv approximately 0 03 sv larger than in core 1 2229 sv the difference is mainly sourced from the different runoffs of greenland and antarctica in the two datasets the original intent was that any new river runoff dataset incorporated into this project would be adjusted to match its long term mean 1988 2007 with that of core 1 22 sv however we have now decided to refer to new datasets to the total runoff of the present dataset 1 26 sv taking the oceanic area as 3 654 1014 m2 this runoff is equivalent to a global ocean averaged freshwater flux of 3 44 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 5 final adjustment for achieving global balance after making the main and additional adjustments described in the previous sections we computed the heat and freshwater fluxes using cobesst ishii et al 2005 the albedo and bulk formulas of large and yeager 2009 and a set of formulas to compute properties of moist air presented in appendix b the fluxes for evaluating the global ocean heat and freshwater balances were calculated on the 1 1 grid of cobesst as explained in section 3 2 3 we impose exact closure on long term mean global ocean averaged heat and freshwater fluxes in the satellite era to achieve this we adjusted the downward fluxes i e the shortwave and longwave radiation and precipitation fluxes by globally and temporally constant factors these factors are applied for the entire dataset period after the main and additional adjustments the long term mean global ocean averaged surface heat flux 2 retains some residuals res 24 q sw q dlw q ulw q la q se q p e r q io res where q x denotes the global ocean average for qx in 24 25 q sw ocean f o q dsw 1 α d s ocean d s is the long term mean global ocean averaged net shortwave radiation flux determined by the downwelling shortwave radiation flux qdsw and albedo α where means a long term average whose period will be determined shortly similarly q

the heat flux due to the incoming and outgoing freshwater fluxes of precipitation evaporation and runoff all assumed to have the local sea surface temperature and q io ocean 1 f o q io d s ocean d s 1

observational estimate or an ensemble mean of multi model outputs becomes available the heat budget is closed by applying a common factor a to the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes 26 a q sw q dlw q ulw q la q se q p e r q io 0 combining eqs 26 and 24 the factor a is calculated as 27 a q sw q dlw res q sw q dlw the period to impose exact closure of the global ocean averaged surface fluxes is determined using an assessment of their time series note that we will use common closure periods for heat and freshwater fluxes looking at the total heat flux of jra55 do in advance fig 22 e implies that a minor regime shift remains in the total heat flux in the late 1990s even after the main and additional adjustments this is largely caused by the shift in the latent heat flux or evaporation as seen in figs 22c and 23a details are discussed in the next section to constrain a long term budget it is desirable to choose an interval that includes equal periods both before and after the regime shift therefore we decided to take the period of 1988 2007 which covers the last and first 10 years of the adjustment phases ii 1973 1997 and iii 1998 present respectively the choice of 10 years is because there was an increasing trend of precipitation in the latter part of phase iii that was presumably caused by the introduction of gnss ro into jra 55 in 2006 as well as the increase in the number of radiance observations from satellite water vapor channels though the trend was mitigated by further dividing the adjustment phase iii in the latest version we still refrained from including this period for the computation of the exact closure the residual heat flux res was 5 8 w m 2 during the 1988 2007 period for this period q sw and q dlw were 167 9 w m 2 and 345 7 w m 2 respectively giving a 0 98863 an approximate reduction of 1 1 to close the budget of the long term mean global ocean averaged freshwater flux we multiply the precipitation p by a factor b 28 b p e r s 0 where s is the long term mean global ocean averaged sublimation over sea ice s ocean 1 f o s d s ocean d s 1 3 10 7 kg m 2 s 1 here s is determined in a simulation forced by a preliminary version of the jra55 do dataset and should be revised when an observational estimate or an ensemble mean of multi model outputs becomes available e and r represent the long term mean global ocean averaged evaporation and runoff respectively the factor b is calculated as 29 b e r s p given the evaporation e 3 971 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 precipitation p 3 565 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 and river runoff r 3 44 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 over the 1988 2007 period b was computed as 1 02118 denoting an approximate enhancement of 2 1 6 evaluation this section compares the atmospheric fields and surface fluxes derived from the jra55 do core and jra55 raw datasets and aims to motivate the replacement of core by jra55 do in the omip framework for this purpose we focus on the large scale features and global balances of the surface fluxes we first interpolated the atmospheric fields on the 1 1 grid of cobesst then calculated the heat and freshwater fluxes as described in the previous section note that cobesst is commonly used as the lower boundary condition for all of the three datasets in order to compare only the set of atmospheric variables the wind speed and surface wind stress cannot be suitably computed using this approach because any temporal or spatial interpolation of the wind vector slightly weakens both variables complicating the comparison with observations therefore the equivalent neutral wind speeds and surface wind stresses in jra55 do and jra55 raw were computed on their original normal tl319 grid points using their surface atmospheric variables and jra 55 brightness temperature which is based on cobesst as a reference a detailed comparison of surface meteorological variables with buoy observations is given in appendix f jra55 do showed reduced rms misfits and increased correlations in comparison with jra55 raw and core an atlas of annual mean surface fluxes of jra55 do and their comparison with the core dataset is given in appendix g several notable features have also been described there 6 1 time series of the global mean the downward shortwave and longwave radiations fig 24 precipitation fig 23b and the surface marine meteorological variables air temperature specific humidity and wind speed fig 25 for the three sets of surface atmospheric data were averaged over the global ocean over 60 s 60 n for wind speed and are depicted as time series the time dependent adjustment applied to jra55 raw caused no apparent spurious behaviour in the time series of global means in jra55 do but it did correct the abrupt reduction of shortwave radiation in the 1973 data of jra55 raw fig 24a after 2000 the radiation fields of jra55 raw and jra55 do well reproduced the inter annual or year to year variability of adjusted ceres shortwave and unadjusted ceres longwave radiation fig 24 although there is an offset between jra55 do radiation and ceres due to the global balance adjustment explained in section 5 the increased precipitation in jra55 raw during the late 1990s fig 1b is suppressed in jra55 do fig 23b however the inter annual precipitation variability in jra55 do somewhat deviates from that in gpcp the abrupt increase of the surface winds around the late 1990s in jra55 raw is alleviated in jra55 do fig 25a the inter annual variation of air temperature and specific humidity largely follows that of core fig 25b and c although the specific humidity is lower in jra55 do than in core implying that the majority of reanalysis products have lower relative humidity than core 6 2 global heat and freshwater flux figs 22 and 23 plot the time series of the annual mean global ocean averaged heat fluxes and the annual mean global ocean integrated freshwater fluxes respectively in general the heat flux components of jra55 do better resemble the core components than those of jra55 raw specifically the total heat flux in jra55 raw was considerably decreased by 5 w m 2 during the late 1990s at that time the increased wind speed and the suppression of the increasing specific humidity trend fig 25a and c artificially enhanced the evaporation this effect was mitigated in jra55 do specifically the overall wind speed increase from the 1990s to the 2000s is much less in jra55 do which would reduce the evaporation change meanwhile the humidity increase between these periods is slightly larger in jra55 do than in jra55 raw which would also act to reduce the evaporation and latent heat flux change there are some notable differences between the jra55 do and core analyses the time series of longwave radiation and sensible heat fluxes are steadier in jra55 raw and jra55 do than in core the large decadal variations in latent and sensible heat fluxes seen in core during the 1970s and 1980s are not seen in jra55 do the lower boundary condition is cobesst in jra 55 but another sst dataset is used in the ncep ncar reanalysis and the isccp fd longwave radiation calculation in general the surface air temperature is strongly influenced by the sst used as the lower boundary condition therefore we may expect less variability in the difference between surface air temperature and sst in jra 55 than core in the present flux computation which commonly uses cobesst as the lower boundary condition our assessment on the jra 55 downward longwave radiation at the sea surface implies that the interannual variation of the downward longwave radiation correlated well with that of the surface air temperature which is influenced by the sst i e cobesst therefore we may generally expect less variability in the difference between upward and downward longwave radiation fluxes in jra 55 than in core if cobesst is used as the lower boundary condition however the use of another sst dataset hurrell et al 2008 as the lower boundary condition only slightly enhanced variability grey lines in fig 22 this would imply that the surface air temperature of jra 55 follows more closely the variation of the sst than that of core a detailed analysis on the boundary layer scheme of the atmospheric model used by jra 55 would be required to resolve this issue which is beyond the scope of this paper it should also be noted that the effects of the pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991 represented as the decline of the downward shortwave radiation flux in core are missing from the radiative fluxes of jra 55 fig 24a however the simulated fields forced by jra55 do might be cooled by the reduced air temperature assimilated into jra 55 in the 1991 92 period see fig 25b the long term 1988 2007 averages of the three datasets are summarised in table 9 in jra55 do the net fluxes of shortwave radiation 166 0 w m 2 longwave radiation 53 4 w m 2 latent heat 97 2 w m 2 and sensible heat 13 6 w m 2 sum to 1 8 w m 2 which exactly compensates the sum of q p e r and q io 1 8 w m 2 implying that the closure in section 5 worked as intended the long term 1988 2007 average of the difference between evaporation 14 51 10 9 kg s 1 and precipitation 13 30 10 9 kg s 1 is 1 21 10 9 kg s 1 which can account for the difference between the river runoff 1 26 10 9 kg s 1 and sublimation 0 05 10 9 kg s 1 table 9 also lists the averages of heat and fresh water flux components for the overlapping period 1958 2009 of core and jra 55 the differences for jra55 do between 1958 2009 and 1988 2007 are less than 1 w m 2 for heat fluxes and 0 1 10 9 kg s 1 for fresh water fluxes these differences are less than or equal to those between datasets jra55 do and core as a result it can be concluded that the constraints imposed on the surface heat and freshwater flux specifically that the long term mean globally averaged heat flux and globally integrated freshwater flux into the ocean sea ice system are both nearly zero or slightly positive approximately hold for the entire dataset period for jra55 do within the accuracy range of the major components of surface heat 0 1 w m 2 and freshwater 0 1 10 8 kg s 1 flux budgets 6 3 regional comparison of flux components following large and yeager 2009 we divided the oceanic domain into almost identical regions the components of the heat and freshwater fluxes are regionally compared for the period 1988 2007 in figs 26 and 27 respectively and their values in jra55 do and core are presented in table 10 in general the heat flux components differ by less than 5 w m 2 and the freshwater flux components are consistent within a few mg m 2 s 1 jra55 do is more consistent with core than jra55 raw specifically in the low latitude downwelling shortwave radiation and precipitation this implies that the adjustments are successful overall it should be noted that jra55 do tends to put more freshwater into the northern north atlantic regions 2 and 3 than core this is contributed by the smaller evaporation and the larger runoff from greenland in jra55 do impact of this feature on the north atlantic meridional overturning in simulations should be investigated in future works figs 28 and 29 compare the basin wide zonal means of the wind stress components in jra55 do jra55 raw and core in general the wind stress of jra55 do best matches the scatterometer oceanic wind stress product scow provided by risien and chelton 2008 the exception is the slightly weak eastward wind stress in the latitude band of the mid latitude westerly wind of the north atlantic fig 28b this weakening presumably arises from the low resolution sst cobesst which is adopted as the lower boundary condition in the wind stress computation of jra55 do at mid latitudes the atmospheric stability and bulk transfer coefficients are strongly sensitive to the location and strength of the oceanic fronts and eddies the strength of the sst fronts measured by the sst gradient is stronger in the north atlantic than that of the north pacific this makes the resolution issue more critical for the north atlantic see also fig 36 additionally the horizontal interpolation of the quikscat wind vector onto the tl319 grid of jra 55 in the suite of the adjustment operations may lead to the reduction of jra55 do wind stresses regarding the meridional wind stress jra55 do shows improvement relative to both jra55 raw and core but there still remains differences from scow 6 4 implied meridional heat and freshwater transports the implied oceanic meridional heat transport is typically calculated as follows 30 mht ϕ π 2 ϕ 0 2 π δ λ ϕ q λ ϕ r cos ϕ d λ r d ϕ where δ λ ϕ is a digital mask that includes only the target basin q is defined by 2 and is positive into the ocean r is the radius of the earth and λ and ϕ are the longitude and latitude respectively expressed in radians the implied meridional freshwater transport in the ocean sea ice system is calculated as follows 31 mft ϕ π 2 ϕ 0 2 π δ λ ϕ f ocean ice λ ϕ r cos ϕ d λ r d ϕ where f ocean ice is defined by 4 the transports in core and jra55 do were computed by slightly different methods in core the implied meridional heat transport was computed with zero ice ocean flux qio and zero material transport by the freshwater fluxes q p e and qr we instead applied the corrections described by large and yeager 2009 following their computation of the meridional heat transport fig 10a of large and yeager 2009 the global heat flux imbalance of 0 6 w m 2 in core table 9 was assumed to be uniformly distributed except in the atlantic ocean the exclusion of the atlantic ocean was based on the assumption that there was no bias and oceanic heat storage in the atlantic basin which gave the most consistent results with the estimated oceanic heat transports for the core datasets as explained by large and yeager 2009 thus we subtracted 0 8 w m 2 0 6 w m 2 a global ocean a global ocean a atlantic ocean where a represents horizontal area from the total heat flux q in 30 in all oceanic regions except the atlantic ocean to compute the meridional heat transport in jra55 do we added the 2d distributions of both the ice ocean heat flux 1 f o q io and the heat flux due to precipitation evaporation and runoff assumed to have the local sst f o q p e q r to the total heat flux the values are taken from a previous interannual core simulation conducted at mri when computing the implied meridional freshwater transport in jra55 do we considered the 2d distribution of the sublimation over sea ice 1 f o s in the total freshwater flux the values were obtained by simulating with a preliminary version of the jra55 do dataset which is also used to compute the precipitation adjustment factor for achieving global balance in section 5 the core computation of the implied meridional freshwater transport ignored the sublimation effects instead the global imbalance of the core dataset p e r 6 4 10 7 kg m 2 s 1 where p 3 547 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 e 3 946 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 and r 3 35 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 taking the oceanic area as 3 654 1014 m2 is compensated uniformly over the oceans including the atlantic ocean the mht and mft are depicted in figs 30 and 31 respectively the meridional heat and freshwater transports are comparable in core and jra55 do and largely fit within the error bars of the observational estimates macdonald and baringer 2013 wijffels 2001 talley 2008 mcdonagh et al 2015 a notable difference is the peaks of poleward heat transport appearing at low latitudes these peaks are smaller in jra55 do than in core because the net heat loss in jra55 do is reduced in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere and enhanced denoting lower heat gain in the tropics relative to core fig 32 in jra55 do less latent heat is lost to the atmosphere in the mid to high latitude north atlantic ocean while more latent heat and net longwave fluxes are lost to the atmosphere in the tropical indian and pacific oceans for confirmation see the regional comparison in fig 26 and also appendix g 7 summary and conclusions in this paper we revisited the scientific and engineering foundations required to produce surface forcing datasets for driving coupled ocean sea ice models and in so doing we produced the jra55 do dataset of use within the core omip framework when generating the jra55 do forcing dataset we followed the methods of large and yeager 2009 and advanced several aspects of their methods by utilising newly available datasets and considering feedback from the ocean modelling community in the core dataset provided by large and yeager 2009 the surface atmospheric variables e g air temperature and specific humidity wind vectors and sea level pressure are based on the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 whereas the downward fluxes affected by clouds e g radiative fluxes and precipitation are based on other sources such as satellite data and direct observations our new jra55 do dataset is based on a recent long term more than 50 years reanalysis projects the jra 55 project which uses an atmospheric model with refined horizontal resolution 55 km and state of the art data assimilation techniques such as 4d var kobayashi et al 2015 the atmospheric variables are based on the forecast phase of jra 55 and the temporal interval 3 h can marginally resolve the diurnal cycle further advancing jra55 do over the core dataset besides applying the jra 55 reanalysis product we made several updates to the data production process we retained quikscat as the reference dataset for the wind field adjustment and used the full ten years available we also used the ssm i wind speed product to cover the pre quikscat period 1988 1998 the air temperature and specific humidity were adjusted using the ensemble means of 7 atmospheric products this averaging suppresses the appearance of isolated adjustment factors caused by the impact of locally over constrained analysis fields on the reference data josey et al 2014 such effects could appear around isolated field observations such as tropical arrays and other station data even on land by the ensemble mean approach we also mitigated the impact of the locally confined systematic biases in the individual products for cloud affected fluxes such as the downward radiative fluxes and precipitation we use the reanalysis outputs and adjust them relative to the reference fields thus facilitating data updates in near real time moreover the synoptic variabilities of the surface atmospheric variables are more self contained and mutually consistent than the earlier dataset we also possess the inter annual variations in the pre satellite era before the 1980s which are absent in the core dataset as references we adopt ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 for the shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes and core for the precipitation the ceres shortwave radiation data were slightly reduced in the tropics as well as over sea ice before being applied as the reference field a state of the art atmospheric reanalysis product still necessitates the introduction of adjustment factors specifically changes in the observing system and the input data density and quality cause transitions in the quality of the assimilation product which manifest as abrupt shifts in the jra 55 data quality to remove these shifts requires time dependent adjustments fortunately these adjustments can be calculated with some fidelity because the jra 55c dataset was acquired by the same data assimilation system as jra 55 but contains only the conventional surface and upper air observations i e contains no satellite observations therefore the biases in the pre satellite period can be estimated from jra 55c data in recent years although the inter annual variability of the adjusted fields raises concern the adjustment factors used in the pre satellite and satellite periods are qualitatively similar furthermore the time dependent adjustments introduce no artificial transitions in the time series of the global means figs 24 and 25 these findings guarantee consistency in the quality of large scale climatological features over the entire dataset period to complete the dataset we imported independent river runoff datasets the river runoff is determined by a river routing model cama flood forced by input runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 suzuki et al 2017 the input is adjusted to ensure similar long term variabilities in jra55 do and the core dataset based on dai et al 2009 the river runoffs from greenland and antarctica which involve ice sheets are taken from bamber et al 2012 and depoorter et al 2013 respectively the dataset details are summarised in appendix c we plan to regularly update the jra55 do dataset thus facilitating real time numerical experiments other global surface datasets with similar features are based either on satellite data hoaps andersson et al 2010 and j ofuro tomita et al 2010 or the synthesis of several sources oaflux yu and weller 2007 it is important to understand that the purposes and merits of these datasets differ from those of the datasets customised for driving ocean sea ice models the former datasets tend to provide realistic fluxes yet omit regions of large uncertainty or non availability of observations the area covered by sea ice is a typical example of such regions this treatment is unsuitable for driving global ocean sea ice models when compiling a dataset for ocean sea ice models an atmospheric reanalysis which omits no region is a suitable starting point however by adopting this approach we inevitably compromise the data accuracy which in turn requires careful assessments and corrections the jra 55 project uses a relatively low resolution sst dataset cobesst as the lower boundary condition this approach causes concerns that the jra 55 based products are not appropriate for forcing mesoscale eddy permitting models a number of groups are currently investigating the topic of how to force ocean models in a mesoscale resolving regime and it is not obvious that we should use atmospheric reanalysis fields based on a high resolution sst product one issue concerns the potential for double counting or mismatching of fluxes if the reanalysis product already contains the response to observed ocean eddies such as the response of wind speed or air temperature but in a different location to the ocean model another point of concern is that if a high resolution ocean model feeds sst and surface ocean currents into the bulk fluxes as is usual then the air sea fluxes will show detailed structure e g in western boundary currents for these reasons there is some justification for using a smooth sst product until we better understand how to use high resolution products for ocean models after adjusting local atmospheric variables and fluxes the global flux budgets based on a specified sst the cobesst product were positively biased on a multi decadal time scale this result implies that biases still remain in all flux components and they can vary regionally in a forced ocean sea ice model a balanced heat budget can be achieved by developing globally high ssts allowing additional surface heat losses through upward longwave sensible and latent heat fluxes to compensate for the excessive downwelling radiation fluxes e g brodeau et al 2010 an enhanced evaporation will affect the freshwater balance but there is no feedback process to restore a balance thus a global adjustment on freshwater fluxes is always warranted in a global ocean sea ice model simulation if the freshwater fluxes are treated explicitly this is not necessary if the freshwater fluxes are converted to the corresponding virtual salt fluxes to minimise these false adjustments in forced ocean sea ice models the global flux budgets based on a realistic sst should preferably be balanced in the present study we took a relatively simple approach to close a long term 1988 2007 surface flux budget by applying a globally and temporally constant multiplicative factor on downwelling radiations and precipitation the factors are applied for the entire dataset period these adjustment factors can be revised if major regional biases in any variables of the present version are identified after assessing the large scale features and global balances of the fluxes we confirmed that jra55 do is a valid alternative to the core dataset for driving global ocean sea ice models we hypothesise that the technical advances incorporated into jra55 do will improve many aspects of ocean modelling studies however the production processes will be continually reviewed and revised based on experience from the wide suite of anticipated studies specifically the downward fluxes affected by clouds radiation and precipitation fluxes were derived from a reanalysis product the validity of this choice should be carefully checked and reviewed in future studies also the adjustment methods of all variables require large improvements near the coast e g taboada et al 2018 the horizontal resolution of jra 55 55 km is still insufficient for capturing the meteorological features affected by orography in the coastal regions and the reference datasets in the present adjustment methods except for the scatterometer wind products are even less well resolved our group is planning to write several papers related to the present study for the simulation paper a number of international groups will conduct long term inter annual simulations forced by both core and jra55 do and compare their mean states and variabilities the normal or repeat year forcing paper will propose typical years that represent the present climate and display the results of model integrations forced by repeated use of each of those years additionally we expect various studies will arise from the cmip6 omip process griffies et al 2016 which makes use of both

point or closer to the ocean grid its value is then computed as the weighted average of the values of the ocean grid points among six candidate points the candidate points are the three pairs of the two points flanking the target longitude or residing on the two adjacent latitudinal circles the weighting factor is the inverse of the distance from the target point if the target grid point is determined as a land point its value is found by linear interpolation a2 shifting the temperature and specific humidity of jra 55 from 2 m to 10 m jra 55 provides the surface air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m above the surface as in the core dataset the temperature and specific humidity in the final dataset are provided at 10 m above the surface where the wind vectors are measured in jra55 do the air temperature and specific humidity of the jra 55 forecast fields are adjusted at 2 m height because the reference fields of both variables iabp npoles and the atmospheric reanalysis products for computing the ensemble mean are available at this height the main adjustments to the forecast fields are made on the original reduced tl319 grid points of jra 55 after the main adjustment on the surface air temperature and specific humidity sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 the following steps are taken to produce the final product of the surface meteorological variables the equivalent neutral wind at 10 m height of jra55 raw is estimated based on the adjusted air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m the equivalent neutral wind field is adjusted section 3 4 the adjusted air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m are shifted upwards to 10 m and the adjusted wind vector is converted from neutral to actual stability additional adjustments are performed on the air temperature and specific humidity at 10 m section 3 3 4 in the suite of operations we use the bulk formula of large and yeager 2009 and a set of formulas to compute the properties of moist air based on gill 1982 appendix b the surface temperatures of the ocean grids with and without sea ice are taken from the surface brightness temperatures of jra 55 and from cobesst respectively the surface temperatures of land grids are taken from the brightness temperature of jra 55 the computation of the bulk transfer coefficient is iterated five times at most appendix b computation of properties of moist air in producing the jra55 do dataset a set of formulas given by gill 1982 is used to compute properties of moist air which is thought to be more accurate than that used for producing the core dataset we recommend using these formulas for driving ocean sea ice models formulas used for producing the core dataset and in the current framework of core omip are given by large and yeager 2004 which is replicated here for comparison b1 saturation specific humidity we consider computing saturation specific humidity in an environment with the sea surface temperature t c and pressure p hpa the relation between the vapor pressure e hpa and specific humidity q is given by b 1 e p q ω 1 ω q where ω is the molecular weight ratio between water vapor and air b 2 ω m w m a 18 016 28 966 0 62197 this is solved for the specific humidity as b 3 q ω e p 1 ω e the relative humidity γ is the mixing ratio of the mass of vapor to the mass of dry air divided by that of the saturated one the mixing ratio r of the mass of vapor to the mass of dry air is given by b 4 r q 1 q thus the relative humidity is computed using the specific humidity q and the saturation specific humidity q sat as b 5 γ q 1 q sat q

pressure e sw of water vapor at saturation is not exactly esw but is given by b 7 e sw f w e sw the value of fw is given by b 8 f w 1 10 6 p 4 5 0 0006 t 2 where p is the pressure units in hpa the saturation vapor pressure over a salt solution is less than over freshwater for sea water the reduction is about 2 a factor of 0 98 should be applied to e sw the saturation vapor pressure esi of pure water vapor over ice is given by b 9 log 10 e si t log 10 e sw t 0 00422 t the saturation partial pressure e si in moist air is fi times esi values of fi are given correct to 1 part in 104 by b 8 thus b 10 e si f w e s i b1 2 core following large and yeager 2004 over sea water b 11 q s ρ a 1 a 1 e a 2 t 273 15 where a 1 0 98 640380 kg m 3 and a 2 5107 4 k the factor 0 98 applies only over sea water ρa is the density of air over sea ice the formula of the same form is used but now a 1 11637800 kg m 3 and a 2 5897 8 k in summary we advocate replacing the core computation of saturation specific humidity b 11 with the more accurate formulation given by b 3 together with b 7 and b 10 b2 specific heat the specific heat of air cpa is given as follows b2 1 gill 1982 b 12 c pa 7 2 r 1 q 8 q 7 ω

data freshwater discharge at river mouths resulting from several sources table 1 all surface atmospheric fields are derived from the forecast phase of jra 55 the temporal coverage is 3 hourly from the 1st of january 1958 to the present to be updated at least annually the downward surface fluxes the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes and precipitation rain and snow are averaged over three hours the first datum of each year is averaged from 00 00 to 03 00 gmt on the 1st of january other surface atmospheric fields namely the air temperature specific humidity wind vectors all at 10 m height see appendix a 2 for the height shift of temperature and specific humidity and sea level pressure are 3 hourly instantaneous values starting at 00 00 gmt on the 1st of january of each year all variables except the sea level pressure are modified from their original fields by multiplicative or offsetting factors to fit the reference fields derived from observations or other datasets the modification and adjustment procedures are explained in sections 3 and 5 jra 55 does not directly provide the river runoff from rivers and glaciers at river mouths the liquid runoff fields are obtained from a river routing model forced by runoffs from the land surface component of jra 55 suzuki et al 2017 the runoffs from greenland and antarctica which contain a significant solid runoff component are taken from independent estimates that combine satellite observations of solid discharge with high resolution climate models of runoff and surface processes bamber et al 2012 and depoorter et al 2013 respectively the river runoff data are explained in section 4 the daily runoff from greenland is based on the monthly climatology 1961 1990 and the liquid plus solid runoff for time interpolation from monthly to daily data a method to preserve monthly mean values introduced by killworth 1996 is used the runoff from antarctica is constant in time and the liquid plus solid runoff besides the merged runoff data we provide the solid water discharge from antarctica represented as the calving flux derived from depoorter et al 2013 table 2 c2 supplementary data the dataset also includes the following supplementary data summarised in table 2 c2 1 variables at the sea surface the variables at the sea surface are necessary for computing surface fluxes in most ocean sea ice models these variables are taken from their own solution thus including a set of sea surface variables is not prerequisite to a dataset for driving ocean sea ice models however to assist computation of surface fluxes without using ocean sea ice models the observation based data for the sea surface variables are provided as part of the dataset we included surface temperature derived from brightness temperature of jra 55 sea surface temperature from cobesst ishii et al 2005 sea ice area fraction from both jra 55 and cobesst and surface oceanic current from the globcurrent dataset rio et al 2014 as discussed in section 3 4 the surface oceanic current may be added to the time series of the wind vector of this dataset to approximately construct a time series of the absolute wind vector in most ocean sea ice model simulations uncoupled with atmospheric models sea surface salinity is restored to observational data to prevent model drifts for this purpose we provide monthly climatology of sea surface salinity derived from the world ocean atlas 2013 version 2 zweng et al 2013 boyer et al 2015 this is computed as an average in the upper 10 m thus it should be more appropriately understood as salinity at 5 m depth c2 2 land sea mask the land sea mask for the atmospheric data on a tl319 grid is based on the original land sea mask of jra 55 the original land sea mask land 1 sea 0 on the reduced tl319 grid is linearly interpolated in the zonal direction onto the normal latitude longitude tl319 grid a grid point valued at 0 5 or less is designated as a sea point otherwise it is assigned to land then inland seas and lakes such as the caspian sea and lake victoria are manually buried and designated as land in the data provided land and sea grids are set to zero and unity respectively c2 3 grid information the earth s sphere is occupied by grid cells centred at the latitudes and longitudes provided in the data file for each variable cell boundaries are given by lat bnds and lon bnds variables contained in each file note that the grid spacing is different depending on the variable atmospheric variables derived from jra 55 are put on a tl319 grid 0 5625 river runoff data are equally spaced by 0 25 starting at 0 125 longitude and 89 875 latitude therefore the longitude and latitude bounds are also equally spaced starting at 0 longitude and 90 latitude the areas of the cells are provided for the atmospheric grid tl319 and the river runoff grid 0 25 0 25 c3 planned updates and older versions the latest version of jra55 do as of april 2018 is 1 3 the plan is to continually update this version using near real time updates to the raw jra 55 reanalysis the version number will advance accompanied by a detailed document whenever new datasets or adjustment methods are incorporated we will soon upgrade in version 1 4 the greenland runoff to include interannualy varying forcing from 1958 to 2016 incorporating an update to bamber et al 2012 that extends the seasonally varying time series to 2016 bamber et al 2018 the updated time series will also include runoff from arctic glaciers and ice caps which have also started to rapidly lose mass since the early 2000s bamber et al 2018 in addition to those over greenland as reported by bamber et al 2012 the cumulative runoff anomaly in the new time series will be about twice that of bamber et al 2012 because of the inclusion of in particular canadian arctic glaciers and the extension of the time series to 2016 separate components of runoff liquid and solid as well as the total runoff will be provided there are several older versions that deserve mention because there are many users of versions 1 1 and 1 2 we list in the following the fixes and upgrades included in versions 1 3 and 1 2 relative to their immediate predecessors as a convenient reference c3 1 difference between versions 1 3 and 1 2 in version 1 2 the magnitude of the wind vector was adjusted by a multiplicative factor r s λ ϕ whereas an offsetting factor was used for version 1 3 section 3 4 2 the adjustment of the wind direction was the same as that described in the main text the wind vector of jra55 raw u jra55 v jra55 at λ ϕ was adjusted as follows cf 19 c 1 u adj v adj r s λ ϕ cos χ sin χ sin χ cos χ u jra 55 v jra 55 where c 2 r s w ref w jra 55 in this adjustment method high winds are selectively modified by a large amount to produce a mean wind speed that matches that of the reference field this treatment may significantly modify the variance of the wind speed and hence the magnitude of the wind stress which is a quadratic function of the wind speed figs 33 and 34 show the comparison of the basin wide zonal mean wind stress as expected the zonal wind stress fig 33 is enhanced in version 1 3 in the mid latitude westerly region compared to the scatterometer oceanic wind stress scow product risien and chelton 2008 the zonal wind stress in version 1 3 in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere is reasonable but the stress is too strong in the southern hemisphere however the southern ocean westerlies in version 1 3 still exhibit improvements relative to jra55 raw fig 28 the meridional wind stress is similar between versions 1 2 and 1 3 fig 34 as shown in fig 29 version 1 3 is closer to scow than core and jra55 raw for these reasons we made a shift to version 1 3 c3 2 difference between versions 1 2 and 1 1 version 1 2 includes the following updates relative to version 1 1 bug fix an error in computing the annual mean climatology of wind speed for jra 55 and jra 55c was corrected this resulted in minor less than 0 5 changes in the adjustment factors for wind speed bug fix the temperature and specific humidity anomalies of core relative to jra 55 were not added to jra 55 in inland seas and lakes poleward of 40 n section 3 3 4 upgrade the phase iii precipitation adjustment was further divided into 1999 2006 and 2006 2015 to suppress the recent positive trend section 3 6 upgrade the contributions to the ensemble mean temperature and specific humidity reference data from ncep r1 ncep r2 and 20crv2 were reduced around semi enclosed seas section 3 3 1 fig 2 upgrade the region of full ice cover fraction 0 99 used for smoothing temperature and specific humidity was determined based on daily instead of monthly cobesst data to facilitate quicker updating in the future section 3 3 4 upgrade when calculating surface fluxes using the bulk formula to determine the globally uniform constant adjustment factors applied to downward fluxes scalar wind speed is first calculated on the original grid of the dataset and then interpolated onto the cobesst 1 1 grid in the older version the wind vector components were first interpolated onto the cobesst grid before computing the scalar wind speed sections 5 and 6 fig 35 shows the comparison of surface fresh water fluxes between versions 1 1 and 1 2 the global ocean integrated evaporation flux from versions 1 1 and 1 2 lie on top of each other but the flux in version 1 1 is reduced by about 1 when the older wind treatment is used the last item in the above list this is reflected in slightly reduced precipitation in version 1 1 before 1996 phases i and ii when the common spatially dependent adjustment factors are used in version 1 1 the precipitation shows an increasing trend in the most recent decade this motivated us to divide the phase iii at 2006 corresponding to the time period when gnss ro as well as an increased number of radiance observations from satellite water vapor channels were introduced in the reanalysis appendix d cobesst this appendix briefly introduces cobesst ishii et al 2005 where cobe is an acronym for centennial in situ observation based estimates of the variability of ssts and marine meteorological variables cobesst is a daily objective analysis of sea surface temperature on a 1 1 grid spanning the global oceans for the period from 1870 to present the objective analysis is based on optimal interpolation and reconstruction with empirical orthogonal functions only conventional observed datasets are used for the analysis the cobesst dataset also contains sea ice concentration sic data derived from walsh and chapman 2001 in the pre satellite period before october 1978 and from satellites afterwards sst and sic of cobesst were used as the lower boundary condition of jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 for more details on the analysis method and the evaluation of the cobesst dataset readers are referred to ishii et al 2005 fig 36 shows a long term mean 1981 2010 sst from cobesst and the difference to hurrell et al 2008 which was used by large and yeager 2009 for evaluating surface fluxes based on the core dataset cobesst exhibits features typical to low resolution sst analyses the weak sst fronts and the lack of explicit representation of mesoscale eddies this would result in smooth surface flux distribution in the western boundary current regions appendix g the difference from the sst product of hurrell et al 2008 which is also a low resolution 1 1 product is less than 0 5 c in most regions except for the mid latitude frontal zones of the north and south atlantic and the southern ocean cobesst shows ssts lower than the product of hurrell et al 2008 in the mid latitude north and south atlantic frontal zones in a long term average this difference resulted in about 20 w m 2 less heat loss to the atmosphere due to latent plus sensible heat fluxes when cobesst was used as the lower boundary condition not shown fig 37 shows a long term 1981 2010 root mean square difference from the monthly climatology and the comparison with the same quantity computed from the product of hurrell et al 2008 cobesst exhibits less variability than hurrell et al 2008 specifically in the sst frontal zones this may have resulted in the reduced variability in the surface flux components when cobesst was used as the lower boundary condition however the difference in the long term mean global ocean averaged heat fluxes is less than 0 5 w m 2 table 9 and is within the uncertainty 0 5 w m 2 loeb et al 2012 furthermore the difference in the flux variability arising from the two different sst products is considerably smaller than the difference arising from the two different atmospheric fields fig 22 appendix e evaluation and adjustment to ceres ebaf as a reference dataset e1 shortwave adjustment fig 38 shows the biases relative to the buoy observations expressed as percentages relative to the annual mean climatology of the ceres downward shortwave radiation to adjust the ceres radiation toward the buoy observations this fraction is subtracted from if positive or added to if negative the annual mean values of the ceres radiation the buoy observations were mainly available at low latitudes the biases revealed that ceres is positively biased in the tropics except right at the equator the positive tropical biases in ceres are larger in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere observations are limited at latitudes above 30 n s those available imply that the biases are generally small to evaluate the high latitude radiation we compared the ceres data with observations at land stations around the arctic ocean and the coastal zone of antarctica fig 39 shows the percentage biases from the land data in the monthly climatology of the ceres downward shortwave radiation the bias typically reached 10 in the summer season of both hemispheres the exceptions are stations gvn and nya where the areal fractions of sea ice are small in summer result not shown in conclusion the downward shortwave radiation of ceres was reduced in the low latitude regions as a function of latitude in the mid latitude regions the downward shortwave radiation was unchanged at high latitudes the downward shortwave radiation was reduced by up to 10 over sea ice depending on the area fraction of the sea ice 0 reduction for no ice coverage and 10 reduction for total ice coverage fig 13a compares the downward shortwave radiations zonally averaged over the ocean among core the raw ceres and the adjusted ceres the adjusted ceres generally gets close to core the somewhat noisy structures of ceres at high latitudes are presumably because only polar orbit satellites are available poleward of around 60 fig 13b shows the ratio of the adjusted ceres to the raw ceres which represents the adjustment factor applied to the raw ceres as explained above then the adjusted downward shortwave radiation was applied as a reference field for adjusting the jra 55 downward shortwave radiation e2 longwave adjustment fig 40 shows the percentage biases relative to the buoy observations in the annual mean climatology of the ceres downward longwave radiation note that the biases in the longwave radiation tend to offset those of the shortwave fig 38 but the fractional differences are generally below 1 fig 41 shows the percentage biases in the monthly climatology of the ceres longwave radiation relative to the observations at land stations around the sea ice zones at high latitudes generally the biases were less than 5 and their signs were not coordinated in conclusion the downward longwave radiation of ceres is used as a reference field without adjustment note that in the second adjustment step both the downward shortwave and longwave radiations are adjusted by a globally uniform time invariant factor that closes the surface heat flux budget section 5 appendix f comparison of marine meteorological variables with buoy data comparison of air temperature specific humidity and wind speed with buoy observations are presented in figs 42 47 for core jra55 raw and jra55 do it is acknowledged that the buoy stations presented here do not represent the full array it is hoped that more regionally focussed comparison studies by interested users will complement the present incomplete evaluation as the dataset is widely distributed we understand the following features from the bias maps the general cold bias of air temperature of jra55 raw is corrected successfully in jra55 do fig 42 the specific humidity of jra55 do has smaller bias than jra55 raw and core in the middle and high latitudes but it is lower than buoys in the tropics fig 44 recalling that the specific humidity of jra55 raw was adjusted toward an ensemble of reanalyses in jra55 do the majority of reanalysis products have a low humidity bias in the tropics the wind speed of core is generally higher than buoys fig 46 as discussed in the main text this is because the actual wind speed of ncep r1 was directly adjusted toward the equivalent neutral wind of quikscat in core from the scatter diagrams and the statistical values figs 43 45 and 47 we understand that jra55 do gives the smallest root mean square errors and the highest correlation coefficients relative to buoys for all variables the mean bias of jra55 do is smallest for the air temperature and the wind speed the mean bias of the specific humidity of jra55 do is smaller than that of jra55 raw but it is larger than that of core this is due to the low bias of the specific humidity of jra55 do in the tropics as shown in the bias map fig 44 appendix g atlas of surface flux distribution g1 heat flux figs 48 fig 52 give the global map of the mean 1988 2007 total surface heat flux and components of jra55 do as well as the difference from those of core the total surface heat flux into the ocean of jra55 do tends to be smaller in the tropics and larger in mid latitudes specifically in the north atlantic than that of core this feature is dominated by the latent heat flux fig 51 the differences of shortwave and longwave radiation flux from core figs 49 and 50 respectively are oppositely signed in the high latitudes reflecting the compensatory natures of shortwave and longwave radiations in the radiative transfer models in the tropics only the shortwave radiation of ceres was reduced before it was used as the reference data to adjust the shortwave radiation of jra55 raw based on the comparison with buoy observations appendix e and fig 13b the wavy structures with 5 10 wave lengths in the difference of the sensible heat flux the lower panel of fig 52 are due to those of the air temperature field of core which are traceable to ncep r1 g2 fresh water flux figs 53 fig 55 give the global map of the mean 1988 2007 precipitation minus evaporation evaporation and precipitation of jra55 do as well as the difference from those of core the difference of precipitation minus evaporation of jra55 do relative to core tends to be negative fresh water leaving the ocean in the tropics and positive in mid latitudes specifically in the north atlantic this feature is dominated by the evaporation fig 54 because we applied an approximate enhancement of 2 1 to the precipitation in the final adjustment to impose an exact closure section 5 the precipitation of jra55 do is slightly larger than that of core in most regions g3 wind stress figs 56 and 57 give the global map of the mean 1988 2007 surface zonal and meridional wind stress of jra55 do as well as the difference from those of core the wind stress of jra55 do is weaker than core this is because the equivalent neutral wind from quikscat was directly used to adjust the actual ncep r1 wind to produce core fig 58 gives the mean nov 1999 oct 2009 wind stress curl of jra55 do and scatterometer oceanic wind stress product scow of risien and chelton 2008 jra55 do reproduces scow well implying that the adjustment on the wind direction was successful at least in the offshore regions a more dedicated assessment of the features around the coastal regions is presented in the companion paper taboada et al 2018 
24090,we present a new surface atmospheric dataset for driving ocean sea ice models based on japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 referred to here as jra55 do the jra55 do dataset aims to replace the core interannual forcing version 2 hereafter called the core dataset which is currently used in the framework of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments cores and the ocean model intercomparison project omip a major improvement in jra55 do is the refined horizontal grid spacing 55 km and temporal interval 3 hr the data production method for jra55 do essentially follows that of the core dataset whereby the surface fields from an atmospheric reanalysis are adjusted relative to reference datasets to improve the adjustment method we use high quality products derived from satellites and from several other atmospheric reanalysis projects as well as feedback on the core dataset from the ocean modelling community notably the surface air temperature and specific humidity are adjusted using multi reanalysis ensemble means in jra55 do the downwelling radiative fluxes and precipitation which are affected by an ambiguous cloud parameterisation employed in the atmospheric model used for the reanalysis are based on the reanalysis products this approach represents a notable change from the core dataset which imported independent observational products consequently the jra55 do dataset is more self contained than the core dataset and thus can be continually updated in near real time the jra55 do dataset extends from 1958 to the present with updates expected at least annually this paper details the adjustments to the original jra 55 fields the scientific rationale for these adjustments and the evaluation of jra55 do the adjustments successfully corrected the biases in the original jra 55 fields the globally averaged features are similar between the jra55 do and core datasets implying that jra55 do can suitably replace the core dataset for use in driving global ocean sea ice models keywords ocean model forcing surface fluxes cores omip jra55 do 1 introduction the framework of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments cores griffies et al 2009 danabasoglu et al 2014 and the subsequent ocean model intercomparison project omip griffies et al 2016 provides ocean and climate modellers with a common facility for performing coupled global ocean sea ice simulations this framework defines protocols for running coupled ocean sea ice models with boundary forcing derived from common atmospheric datasets its most essential element is the forcing dataset developed by large and yeager 2004 2009 hereafter referred to as the core dataset which is largely based on the surface atmospheric fields derived from ncep ncar atmospheric reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 to reduce biases and uncertainties in the reanalysis fields surface atmospheric fields such as winds air temperature and specific humidity are adjusted with respect to available observations the reanalysis products also contain downward surface fluxes such as the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes and precipitation rain and snow but these data are replaced by estimates that are more directly based on observational data such as from satellites although the core framework has become increasingly visible and successfully distributed no significant developments or maintenance of the dataset or protocol have occurred since 2009 for the core dataset the discontinuity in the source data for radiation fields is the main reason for prohibiting updates given that the scientific success of cores has only recently been demonstrated to the broader community this situation might be expected however the foundation of core omip cannot remain frozen indefinitely furthermore although the present core dataset and protocol have become widely used there are various shortcomings revealed through many recent studies based on the core protocol griffies et al 2009 danabasoglu et al 2014 griffies et al 2014 downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 wang et al 2016a 2016b ilicak et al 2016 danabasoglu et al 2016 tseng et al 2016 hence there is an urgent need to advance the scientific and engineering foundation of the core omip framework this advance must proceed in a timely manner to benefit ocean modelling communities around the world the ocean modelling community requires the following features of a forcing dataset all forcing datasets must be up to date currently the core dataset is available only through 2009 the datasets must not be tuned and adjusted to improve simulation results of a particular ocean sea ice model or to conform to a particular choice of a set of numerical schemes and parameters for ocean interior processes in coupled ocean sea ice models the heat and water budgets of forcing datasets must be balanced with respect to the applied surface flux bulk formulae the spatial and temporal resolutions of the datasets must be as sufficient as possible for forcing high resolution e g eddying coastal ocean and sea ice models the horizontal resolution of the core dataset is approximately 200 km t62 grids all available datasets such as other reanalysis products and radiation datasets should be considered the datasets should be extended to include pre 1948 data the core dataset satisfied only the second no model based tuning and third global balance items in the above list the following scientific and engineering backgrounds of forcing datasets also warrant revisiting the assumptions and corrections made in large and yeager 2009 who created the core dataset incorporation of new corrections based on new different observational data forcing over regions covered by sea ice surface ocean wave fields river runoff field including runoff from ice sheet melting diurnal cycling of wind and solar radiation by referring to new datasets that resolve some of the above issues ocean modellers hope to better simulate recent extreme climate events such as sea ice reduction in the arctic and the on going el niño la niña cycle and to understand these events in the context of long term variability the present developmental study is an international collaborative effort to produce a new atmospheric dataset for driving coupled ocean sea ice models based on the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 project conducted by the japan meteorological agency jma it aims to complement and eventually replace the existing forcing dataset from large and yeager 2009 jra 55 is among the more recent long term reanalysis projects it adopts a relatively high resolution 55 km atmospheric model and uses state of the art assimilation techniques the dataset extends from 1958 to the present and will be updated in forthcoming years as part of the jma operational climate services all atmospheric variables necessary for computing surface fluxes are taken from the forecast phase of jra 55 the temporal interval is 3 h data are originally provided on the reduced tl319 55 km grid but as a forcing dataset for ocean modelling we interpolate the data onto the normal tl319 grid see appendix a 1 for details the necessary variables are the downward shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes precipitation separated into rain and snow 10 m wind vector sea level pressure and the air temperature and specific humidity at 10 m shifted from their original 2 m height our preliminary evaluation indicated that the surface fields of jra 55 must be adjusted bias corrected locally and modified globally to impose flux balances similarly to the ncep ncar reanalysis in the core dataset and the ecmwf reanalysis in the drakkar forcing set brodeau et al 2010 see also fig 1 we adjust all variables except the sea level pressure we also consider time dependent adjustments to correct the abrupt shifts in the data quality of jra 55 these shifts are introduced by changes in the observing systems however to provide data in near real time the adjustment factors for the most recent decades will be continually used for future updates the jra55 do forcing dataset also includes the daily river runoff produced by operationally running a global river hydrodynamic model forced by an adjusted runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 suzuki et al 2017 however river runoff from greenland and antarctica is derived from observational climatology based on independent estimates that account for the discharge and melting of ice sheets and ice shelves the jra55 do dataset does not satisfy all the above listed items specifically future development is required to extend the data to pre 1948 to incorporate surface ocean wave effects and to improve atmospheric fields over regions covered by sea ice in this paper we introduce the new forcing dataset jra55 do based on jra 55 designed for driving ocean sea ice models as part of this presentation we describe general features of jra55 do the adjustment methods used in its construction and overall assessments of its quality because at least in the foreseeable future jra55 do is intended mainly for global modelling in the core omip framework our assessments focus on large scale features and global balances of the surface fluxes in a companion paper taboada et al 2018 we assess the wind patterns regionally including the eastern boundary upwelling zones in section 2 of the present paper we define the variables needed for forcing ocean sea ice models section 3 explains the method and rationale for adjusting the surface atmospheric variables of jra 55 section 4 details the river runoff fields and section 5 discusses the final adjustment procedure for global flux balance the large scale features of the dataset are evaluated in section 6 finally in section 7 we present a summary and concluding remarks we offer a suite of appendices that present the many technical details relevant for jra55 do appendix a explains the processing of the raw jra 55 data appendix b presents formulas to compute properties of moist air that we advocate as a replacement to those used by the current core omip framework appendix c gives details of the dataset appendix d introduces the sea surface temperature dataset cobesst ishii et al 2005 which was used extensively in jra 55 and the present study appendix e explains the evaluation and adjustment of the surface radiative fluxes of ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 kato et al 2013 which we adopted as the reference data to adjust the radiative fluxes of jra 55 appendix f presents a detailed comparison of surface meteorological variables with buoy observations appendix g shows an atlas of annual mean surface fluxes of jra55 do and their comparison with the core dataset 2 variables necessary for forcing ocean sea ice models in this section we briefly review the sea surface flux calculations and then derive the necessary surface atmospheric variables for forcing the ocean sea ice system although given in section 2 of large and yeager 2009 we provide the expressions here in support of the adjustment methods encountered later in this paper the ocean is forced at the sea surface by the fluxes of momentum τ heat q and freshwater f the ocean surface is covered by either atmosphere or sea ice and the fluxes are computed separately by different formulas when computing the surface flux in an ocean grid cell we assume that a normalised fraction fo of the cell is exposed to the atmosphere the momentum heat and freshwater fluxes are respectively expressed as follows 1 τ f o τ ao 1 f o τ io 2 q f o q ao 1 f o q io q r 3 f f o f ao 1 f o f io r where the subscripts ao and io denote the fluxes at the air ocean and ice ocean interfaces respectively in eqs 2 and 3 r denotes the total continental runoff the river runoff is treated as part of the surface freshwater flux in eq 3 and qr represents the heat transport due to runoff at present it is difficult to compute the ice ocean fluxes from observational data moreover the computations are strongly affected by the imperfect representation of the thermodynamic and dynamic processes in sea ice models therefore we do not try to adjust local ice ocean fluxes in this study however we use their global ocean averaged values for the purpose of closing the global ocean averaged heat and freshwater flux budget in a multi decadal time scale see section 3 2 3 we use approximate global mean ice ocean fluxes derived from a global ocean sea ice model simulation in a global ocean sea ice simulation under the core dataset conducted at the meteorological research institute mri e g tsujino et al 2011 the annual mean global ocean averaged cooling due to 1 f o q io is roughly 1 4 w m 2 for the freshwater flux we close the budget of the ocean sea ice system therefore instead of fio we consider the freshwater flux due to sublimation s over the sea ice or snow 4 f ocean ice f o f ao 1 f o p s r where p represents precipitation based on a global ocean sea ice simulation the global ocean integrated long term mean sublimation is taken as 0 05 10 9 kg s 1 upward we should revise this value in a future version when an observational estimate for this quantity becomes available in general a global balance of the surface momentum fluxes is not required the air ocean heat and freshwater fluxes are the sums of their components 5 q ao q sw q lw q la q se q p e 6 f ao p e where the positive direction of all fluxes is downward the shortwave radiation flux qsw is computed by 7 q sw 1 α q dsw where qdsw is the downward shortwave radiation flux and the albedo α a function of latitude is taken from large and yeager 2009 the longwave radiation flux qlw is computed by 8 q lw q dlw ϵ σ θ o 4 where qdlw is the downward longwave radiation flux ϵ is the emissivity here assumed as 1 0 to account for the small fraction of qdlw that is reflected lind and katsaros 1986 σ 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 is the stefan boltzmann constant and θo is the sea surface temperature the latent heat flux qla is equivalent to the evaporation e as follows 9 e ρ a c e q a q sat θ o δ u 10 q la l e where ρa and qa respectively denote the density and the specific humidity of air ce is the bulk transfer coefficient for water vapor q sat θo is the saturation specific humidity at the sea surface temperature and δ u is the surface wind relative to the sea surface current δ u u a u o l is the latent heat of vaporisation the sensible heat flux qse is computed by 11 q se ρ a c pa c h θ a θ o δ u where cpa is the specific heat of air ch denotes the bulk transfer coefficient of heat and θa is the surface air temperature the properties of moist air such as ρa cpa l and q sat are calculated by the formulas presented in appendix b we advocate using a set of formulas given by gill 1982 for computing the properties of moist air which is thought to be more accurate than the simple and cost effective set of formulas used for the current core omip framework as given by large and yeager 2004 because ρa and q sat are also a function of sea level pressure slp we need sea level pressure for computing fluxes precipitation occurs in the liquid rain or solid snow phase the temperature of surface freshwater fluxes in the liquid phase is assumed to equal the local sea surface temperature 12 q p e c po p e θ o where c po 3 99 10 3 j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of sea water in the above mentioned global ocean sea ice simulation conducted at mri the global ocean averaged long term mean f o q p e q r was approximated as 0 4 w m 2 the negative sign implies ocean cooling in the mri simulation all precipitation evaporation and runoff were assumed to be in the liquid phase the cooling results since evaporation dominates in low latitudes removing warm water from the ocean and precipitation dominates in high latitudes adding cold water to the ocean note that this argument only holds for ocean models that treat the surface freshwater flux explicitly for more details on the water heat flux readers are referred to griffies et al 2014 see their appendix a 4 the bulk transfer coefficients ce and ch parameterise the turbulent fluxes in terms of the surface atmospheric state they are usually computed along with the bulk transfer coefficient of momentum cd from which the surface stress is calculated as follows 13 τ ao ρ a c d δ u δ u note that in a more precise analysis part of τ ao is received by the surface ocean wave fields and the momentum is redistributed before reaching the large scale ocean circulation fields e g mitsuyasu 1985 scully et al 2016 however to our knowledge a global mapping of such momentum redistribution has not been attempted among the several propositions of bulk formulas we adopt the bulk formulas by large and yeager 2009 that have been used in the suite of core omip projects at both the air ocean and the air ice interfaces note that the use of a set of formulas given by gill 1982 to compute properties of moist air appendix b which we recommend here slightly deviates from the set of core bulk formulas in summary the ocean sea ice models are driven by seven atmospheric variables qdsw qdlw p separated into rain and snow θa q a slp u a which are sourced from the forecast phase of jra 55 and the river runoff r which is produced by running a global river hydrodynamic model forced by an adjusted runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 these variables are adjusted to minimise biases and to achieve a globally closed heat and freshwater flux in a multi decadal time scale besides these external data we need two ocean variables the sea surface temperature θo and surface current vector u o in most ocean sea ice models the values of these variables at the first vertical level are used as those of the sea surface although the first level in ocean models typically represents an average over a few meters rather than the sea surface itself necessary variables are summarised in tables 1 and 2 we provide full details of the dataset in appendix c 3 adjusting the surface atmospheric variables of jra 55 this section describes how we have adjusted the seven surface atmospheric variables of jra 55 that are necessary as explained in the previous section for computing surface fluxes we first describe the general adjustment strategy in sections 3 1 and 3 2 and then give more details on the adjustment processes for individual variables in sections 3 3 3 6 3 1 jra 55 and its subsets jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 harada et al 2016 is the first comprehensive reanalysis covering the last half century since the european center for medium range weather forecast s 45 year reanalysis era 40 uppala et al 2005 moreover the long term reanalysis was performed by a four dimensional variational method which has not been attempted before the coverage begins from 1958 and is planned to continue until approximately 2022 as part of the jma operational climate services the jra 55 system is based on jma s operational global data assimilation forecast system as of december 2009 jma 2007 2013 the assimilation window of the base system 6 hours is unchanged for jra 55 to derive the atmospheric fields for driving the ocean sea ice models we obtained 3 hourly outputs from the forecast phase the 3rd and 6th hours after initialisation rather than the initial analysis state meteorological variables such as temperature humidity wind vectors and sea level pressure were obtained from instantaneous data while fluxes such as radiation and precipitation were determined from three hour mean data here fluxes should be averaged quantities for any budget analyses using this dataset to be done consistently separately from the main atmospheric four dimensional variational analysis the jra 55 system also performs a two dimensional optimal interpolation analysis for the surface temperature and specific humidity at 2 m height and the surface wind vector at 10 m height kobayashi et al 2015 hereafter this analysis is called jra 55anl this analysis takes the forecast fields of the four dimensional analysis of jra 55 as the first guess the same correlation scales as the four dimensional analysis are used for the error of the first guess thus the analysis fields of jra 55anl are not significantly smoothed relative to the four dimensional analysis fields of jra 55 however the analysis fields of jra 55anl do not constitute the initial state for the forecast phase of the four dimensional analysis for developing jra55 do this separate surface analysis was extensively used as a reference dataset for adjusting the surface marine meteorological variables as explained in the following sections a subset of jra 55 jra 55 conventional jra 55c kobayashi et al 2014 uses the jra 55 data assimilation system but excludes satellite observations as a result it assimilates only the conventional surface and upper air observations the jra 55c project aims to improve the inhomogeneity of long term datasets by removing the historical changes in satellite observing systems for this purpose jra 55c was branched off from jra 55 in november of 1972 just before a vertical temperature profile radiometer vtpr was installed in 1973 from the jra 55c data we can assess the biases in the pre satellite pre 1973 period assuming that these biases have persisted into the recent period where they can be quantified by referencing to satellite data for reference the acronyms containing jra 55 or jra55 are listed in table 3 3 2 adjustment strategy 3 2 1 main adjustment fields derived from the forecast phase of jra 55 hereafter referred to as jra55 raw were adjusted to match their long term means with those of reference fields specifically the long term means of the jra55 raw fields and reference fields were calculated for an overlapping period and compared to determine adjustment factors the adjustment factors are spatially varying and no smoothness constraints were applied to the factors we used a multiplicative factor or offset depending on the nature of the variable offset factors were used for variables that can be positive or negative such as air temperature and wind direction however offset factors are awkward for strictly positive variables because the treatment of values around zero may not be uniquely determined for example simply applying a positive offset to precipitation will result in a situation that there is always a small amount of precipitation an offset is also awkward for downwelling shortwave radiation which is generally zero during the night thus to simplify the processing we used multiplicative factors for strictly positive variables in principle however it should be noted that we may modify the variance in an unconstrained manner by using multiplicative factors to adjust the long term mean actually based on the assessments on the older versions we used an offset to adjust wind speed which is a strictly positive variable in the latest version so as to retain the variance contained in the original jra 55 wind fields see also appendix c 3 1 in an advanced adjustment method we could constrain both mean and variance using both multiplicative factor and offset however adjusting the variance would require a large amount of work first the time scale of the variance to be adjusted such as stochastic seasonal or interannual would need to be chosen then it would be necessary to reconstruct a time series for both jra55 raw and the reference dataset to constrain the variance for the chosen time scale the choice of the time scale might be limited by the availability of the reference data it would also be necessary to confirm that the adjustment on the variance for a particular time scale would do no harm to variability in other time scales this approach might be taken for a future version after consideration of results from ocean model simulations that use jra55 do for this study we focussed on adjusting the mean state using a single factor either multiplicative or offsetting table 4 summarises the approaches for finding the adjustment factors to ensure that we can update the jra55 do dataset in near real time all variables including the radiation and precipitation are based on jra55 raw unlike large and yeager 2009 who sourced the radiation and precipitation from independent observation based data we adjust the radiation and precipitation data in a reanalysis dataset jra55 raw the adjustments were performed on reduced tl319 grid points where the jra 55 fields were originally provided the reference fields for most variables have been updated relative to those used for the core dataset large and yeager 2009 the rationale for this change will be presented in later subsections devoted to the adjustment method of each variable after making the main adjustments we zonally interpolated the fields on the reduced tl319 grid points onto the normal tl319 grid see also appendix a 1 we then made additional adjustments as explained in the next subsection the adjusted atmospheric fields are designated as jra55 adj to distinguish them from the final product jra55 do jra55 do was obtained after the global balance adjustment of jra55 adj see section 5 note that we did not adjust the sea level pressure because there is not good data to be used as a reference field therefore when applying the dataset to for example storm surge modelling the user should be aware of the possible inconsistencies between the surface pressure and the adjusted wind fields the atmospheric fields in jra 55 were sometimes shifted by changes in the observation systems kobayashi et al 2015 to accommodate these shifts we divided the dataset into several phases and separately adjusted each phase fig 12 of kobayashi et al 2015 shows the 2 day forecast scores at the geopotential height of 500 hpa the authors stated that the forecast scores of jra 55 show relatively large variations that correspond to the introduction of vtpr vertical temperature profile radiometer in 1973 the advent of satellite observing system in the late 1970s atovs advanced television and infrared observation satellite operational vertical sounder in 1998 and gnss ro global navigation satellite system radio occultation in 2006 the forecast score markedly improved in 1998 indicating improvement in the overall quality of reanalysis at that time discernible transitions also appeared from the late 1970s through the early 1980s especially in the southern hemisphere however we note that partitioning at the late 1970s will leave the period of 1973 1978 very difficult to correct adjust owing to the shortness of the period and the limited availability of observations on the other hand the year 1973 marks the inclusion of vtpr and the separation of jra 55c from jra 55 fig 1 compares the time series of the downward shortwave radiation and precipitation in the jra 55 jra 55c and core datasets from 1973 the shortwave radiation was clearly lower in jra 55 than jra 55c after 1998 the precipitation was clearly increased which was not seen in the core dataset and the shortwave radiation further lowered in jra 55 relative to jra 55c in jra 55 amsu a included in aug 1998 corrected the warm bias in the upper troposphere over the ocean whereas amsu b included in oct 2000 corrected the dry bias in the upper and middle troposphere over the ocean see figs 9 and 10 of kobayashi et al 2015 both corrections increased the overall precipitation over the ocean and possibly influenced the shortwave radiation the precipitation increase occurred mainly in the tropical regions kobayashi et al 2015 it should also be noted that from may 1997 jra 55 included the scatterometer winds ers from may 1997 to jan 2001 quikscat from jul 1999 to nov 2009 and ascat from jan 2008 thus the 1997 98 period is also a suitable transition point for wind field adjustment we also note that in fig 1 the long term mean global ocean averaged downward shortwave radiation and precipitation were biased high relative to those of the core dataset which warrants adjustment on jra 55 fluxes based on these assessments we divided the dataset period of jra 55 into three phases 1958 1972 phase i 1973 1997 phase ii and 1998 present phase iii we then applied different adjustment factors in each phase during phase i 1958 1972 only the conventional observations were available because reference fields for adjusting the reanalysis fields could not be constructed from these insufficient data we utilised jra 55c since it only uses conventional observations assuming that the biases in the pre satellite pre 1973 period have persisted into the recent period in jra 55c we assessed the general biases for phase i by using the jra 55c data in recent years when satellite data are available to construct reference fields a regime shift in the jra 55c data occurred around 1997 in the equatorial indian ocean specifically the intensification of westerly winds in the maritime continent region and over the equatorial indian ocean and the increase of divergence in the tropical region of the african continent occurred after 1997 results not shown such regime shifts were not found in observations or other reanalysis products and were considered to be an erroneous response of the atmosphere land surface system in jra 55c details of which have not been clarified yet consequently the general biases in the 1958 1972 period were evaluated using pre 1997 jra 55c data for the assessment of biases an appropriate period was selected for each variable from 1973 1996 based on the availability of the reference data see later sections for details when evaluating the biases in phases ii and iii we excluded the large el niño years 1997 and 1998 from the climatology computation the adjustment factors changed from 01 oct to 30 nov in 1972 between phases i and ii and from 01 jan 1997 to 31 dec 1998 between phases ii and iii the adjustment factors in the transition periods were linearly interpolated in time between the factors of the two adjacent phases 3 2 2 additional adjustments after the main adjustment the systematic biases introduced by native settings of jra 55 were corrected by the following secondary adjustments with motivation and details presented later in this section the temperature and specific humidity were smoothed around the marginal sea ice zones the extremely low air temperature around antarctica was cut off by introducing a floor function see section 3 3 4 for details during the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the monthly anomaly in core relative to jra55 adj was added to the temperature and specific humidity in high latitude regions the precipitation over the mediterranean sea was reduced during the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the first second and third corrections compensate for the lack of partial sea ice cover in the grid cells of the atmospheric model used by jra 55 the third correction is because ncep r1 on which the air temperature and specific humidity of the core dataset are based shows plausible sea ice distributions in comparison with jra 55 in the pre satellite period as shown later the fourth correction is to reduce the excessive precipitation around the european continent during the 1960s and 1970s due to processing errors on some radiosonde data used in jra 55 3 2 3 closing the budgets the adjusted atmospheric dataset jra55 adj was tested to see whether it could satisfy well recognised constraints as discussed below on the global surface heat and freshwater flux budgets when a realistic surface condition was applied section 5 when calculating the global ocean surface flux budget excluding the sea ice region we applied cobesst ishii et al 2005 as the lower boundary condition sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution appendix d briefly introduces cobesst the latitude dependent albedo and the bulk formulae including the saturation of the transfer coefficients in the high wind regime were taken from large and yeager 2009 the air properties were computed as described in appendix b cobesst is analysed on a 1 1 grid and its sst structure is smooth although a high resolution sst product can give more detailed and presumably more accurate structure of fluxes a low resolution product cobesst has been selected for this study because it is anticipated that the majority of ocean climate models that participate in cmip6 omip will adopt a nominal 1 degree horizontal resolution a model integration for about 300 years is required for the physical omip in the biogeochemical omip many tracers are added to the model and much longer integrations will be required for the spin up fulfilling these requirements with a mesoscale eddy permitting model is too computationally challenging for many modelling centres the sst structure of low resolution products is what a nominal 1 degree ocean climate model ideally reproduces thus as a forcing dataset to be used in the framework of omip jra55 do was evaluated and adjusted in terms of the global ocean averaged surface flux budget by using a low resolution sst product cobesst a use of higher resolution sst products should be considered in the future evaluation and development efforts as the computational resources to perform the omip experiments with mesoscale eddy permitting models become available for the majority of modelling centres as a constraint on the global surface heat and freshwater flux budgets we continue to adopt the constraint used by large and yeager 2009 that the long term mean globally averaged heat flux and globally integrated freshwater flux into the ocean sea ice system are both nearly zero or slightly positive 0 1 w m 2 for heat and 1 10 7 kg s 1 for freshwater fluxes levitus et al 2012 estimated that the global ocean heat uptake was 0 39 w m 2 for 1955 2010 and loeb et al 2012 gave 0 50 0 43 w m 2 for 2001 2010 these figures are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the major components of the surface heat budget such as shortwave radiation longwave radiation latent heat and sensible heat fluxes o 10 o 10 2 w m 2 church et al 2011 estimated that the global ocean mass change was 0 98 mm y 1 for 1972 2008 largely contributed by the melting of glaciers and ice caps this corresponds to a global ocean integrated mass flux of 1 1 10 7 kg s 1 which is again about two orders of magnitude smaller than the major components of the surface freshwater budget such as evaporation precipitation and river runoff o 10 9 o 10 10 kg s 1 here global oceanic area is taken as 3 654 1014 m2 it is desirable that the global flux budgets are nearly closed and comparable to the above estimates on a multi decadal time scale after the main and additional adjustments on local atmospheric variables and fluxes explained in the previous subsections have been applied unfortunately this closure is not necessarily the case as will be shown in section 5 an absence of closure implies that biases still remain in all flux components and that they may also vary regionally to assess and correct those regional biases a sufficient amount of local observational data would be necessary because such data are unavailable we do not attempt further local adjustment but instead attempt to exactly close the global surface flux budget specifically we applied a globally uniform time invariant adjustment factor on downwelling radiations and precipitation the adjustment factor for downwelling radiations was determined by requiring exact closure 0 w m 2 on a global ocean heat budget for a multi decadal time period 1988 2007 in the satellite era the adjustment factor is then applied for the entire dataset period details will be explained in section 5 the precipitation p was similarly readjusted after adjustment the global freshwater input to the ocean sea ice system formally balances with the evaporation e river runoff r and sublimation over the sea ice s i e e s p r 0 during the same multi decadal time period as used for the heat flux here the use of e instead of e implies an integration over a global ocean as well as an averaging over a multi decadal time scale in jra55 do the runoff is imported from other sources provided that the adjustment is minor any river runoff dataset that is optionally added to jra55 do will be adjusted to match its long term 1988 2007 mean with that of the first version 1 26 sv where 1 sv 10 6 m 3 s 1 see section 4 the final adjusted fields comprise the jra55 do dataset note that the long term closure adopted here will still allow for the study of interannual variability in the ocean sea ice system however it may preclude investigation of long term trends although a trend may be imposed by a user by slightly modifying the globally uniform factors applied to the downward fluxes on the other hand the exact closure may be suited for simulations run for multiple cycles of the nearly 60 year forcing in the omip experiments griffies et al 2016 because a long term trend will not be imposed a priori on the simulations 3 3 temperature and specific humidity 3 3 1 reference dataset a reliable long term dataset for adjusting the surface air temperature and specific humidity with consistently high data quality could not be found consequently we computed the reference values for these variables from reanalysis data using an ensemble mean approach for this purpose we selected seven atmospheric reanalysis products ncep r1 ncep r2 20crv2 era interim merra2 ncep cfsr and jra 55anl data were first mapped onto the reduced tl319 grid of jra 55 before the ensemble mean was computed when computing the ensemble mean we weighted the modern high resolution reanalysis products era interim merra2 ncep cfsr and jra 55anl higher than the old low resolution reanalysis products ncep r1 ncep r2 and 20crv2 the weighting factors for the modern and older products were 1 0 and 0 5 respectively at each grid point the contributions from the outliers the minimum 1st and the maximum 7th members were reduced to half the default weights this approach is designed to avoid isolated large or small adjustment factors that may appear around buoys e g tao arrays in the equatorial pacific ocean when considering individual reanalysis products as reported by josey et al 2014 furthermore the contributions from the old low resolution reanalysis products are excluded from the ensemble mean in semi enclosed seas and narrow bays by applying an additional weight shown in fig 2 the additional weight is first set to zero for the japan yellow east china mediterranean baltic black caspian and red seas persian gulf and california bay and unity in other regions then 50 passes of a 5 point smoothing filter is applied to moderate the transition from zero to unity because the atmospheric fields over the ocean in those regions are represented by only a few grid points in the low resolution products we decided that they do not have sufficient accuracy to be used as a reference for adjusting higher resolution reanalysis products surface air temperature over sea ice can differ widely between the different reanalysis products e g lindsay et al 2014 and so the ensemble mean air temperature is a dubious reference for data above sea ice therefore data over ice covered regions is referenced to the jra 55anl data because jra 55anl uses the jra 55 forecast as a first guess we can expect modest differences between them that is adjustment factors will be small relative to other possible reference datasets before jra 55anl is applied as a reference over sea ice the surface air temperatures in the arctic region of jra 55anl were adjusted with respect to the international arctic buoy programme iabp polar exchange at the sea surface poles iabp npoles rigor et al 2000 specifically the monthly climatological difference between jra 55anl and iabp npoles for the period 1979 1998 which is the period covered by iabp npoles were used to adjust jra 55anl for the entire dataset period see also footnotes of table 5 the general effect of the adjustment was to lower the air temperature of jra 55anl in the arctic ocean in the southern hemisphere jra 55anl was used as a reference field over sea ice without modification 3 3 2 adjustment of air temperature table 5 summarises the adjustment method the jra 55 surface air temperature was adjusted by the linear interpolation in time of monthly offsetting factors obtained by comparing the monthly climatology of jra 55 with the reference data the ensemble mean over the sea water and jra 55anl adjusted relative to iabp npoles over the sea ice see above the base time periods used for computing climatologies were 1980 1996 jra 55c 1980 1996 and 1999 2014 respectively for the three phases fig 3 shows the annual means of the offsetting factors applied in the three phases the offsetting factors for the three phases are qualitatively similar although there are some discrepancies among them in the indian ocean the northern north pacific and around antarctica they are generally positive over open water and negative over sea ice implying that the surface air temperature of jra 55 has a cold bias over open water and a warm bias over sea ice relative to the reference datasets 3 3 3 adjustment of specific humidity during the temperature adjustment the relative humidity of the original field is unchanged so the specific humidity should be modified accordingly given a relative humidity γ and a saturation specific humidity q s1 for the adjusted temperature the specific humidity q 1 after the temperature adjustment is given by 14 q 1 q s 1 γ 1 q s 1 1 γ the computation of the air properties is detailed in appendix b table 5 summarises the adjustment method in each phase the multiplicative factor for the specific humidity is determined by comparing the monthly climatology obtained from the ensemble mean with the recalculated specific humidity for computing the ensemble mean the same regional weighting was used as for surface air temperature the climatology obtained from the ensemble mean was used to adjust the specific humidity over sea ice since the specific humidity over sea ice did not differ widely between reanalysis products they were very low the same base time periods as air temperature were used for computing climatologies fig 4 compares the multiplicative factors for the three phases again the factors are qualitatively similar for the different phases in general the adjustment reduces the specific humidity implying a moist bias in the jra 55 data a moist bias was also reported by kobayashi et al 2015 the reduction is especially strong 10 in the high precipitation region in the tropics and the stronger reduction is required for phase ii than other phases 3 3 4 additional adjustments to correct errors introduced by various aspects of the jra 55 configuration detailed below we further adjusted the air temperature and specific humidity as follows we explain these adjustments in the order of their implementation note that because the temperature and specific humidity of the core dataset which are given at 10 m height are used as the reference fields for the additional adjustments explained below the height of the temperature and specific humidity data was shifted from 2 m to 10 m prior to the additional adjustments as described in appendix a 2 also the data on the reduced tl319 grid were interpolated onto the normal tl319 grid as explained in appendix a 1 the 10 m values were computed using the sea surface temperature from cobesst the ice surface temperature from the brightness temperature of jra 55 the adjusted equivalent neutral 10 m wind field explained in section 3 4 and the bulk formula of large and yeager 2009 with properties of moist air calculated by the formulas given in appendix b smooth transition of temperature and specific humidity around the marginal sea ice zones because the atmospheric model of jra 55 does not allow partial sea ice cover the air temperature can change abruptly in the marginal sea ice zones therefore to improve the representation of warmer air over partial sea ice cover the air temperature over the marginal sea ice zones was smoothed by applying 20 passes of a 9 point filter fig 5 a shows a schematic of the 9 point filter in this operation the temperature was left unchanged in regions of open water as well as in regions of almost total sea ice cover where the daily area fraction of sea ice exceeds 0 99 using the daily sea ice distribution from cobesst the number of passes 20 was determined rather subjectively the response function shown in fig 5b shows that small scale features less than 500 km are removed implying that the air temperatures over open water and almost total sea ice cover are linearly connected by this adjustment if the width of the marginal sea ice zone is less than 500 km as in the main adjustment the specific humidity was modified along with the temperature fig 6 shows the changes in air temperature in the winter of each hemisphere which result from this additional adjustment the filter smoothed the step like discontinuity of air temperature at the boundary between open water and sea ice by raising temperature on the sea ice side thus only positive differences appear in the marginal sea ice zones cut off of extremely low air temperature around antarctica the air temperature around antarctica was adjusted as described by large and yeager 2004 2009 for the core datasets in the core datasets the extremely low temperatures were cut off by applying an annual cycle of the minimum temperature based on weather station and drifting buoy bryan personal communication 2002 for jra55 do we used the same formula for the annual cycle of the minimum temperature specifically t min ϕ t is defined as a function of latitude ϕ south of 60 s obtained by fitting sinusoidal curves to the observed monthly minimum temperature 15 t min ϕ t b 0 b 1 ϕ c 0 t a 0 a 1 ϕ with a 0 21 841 c a 1 0 477 c degree 1 b 0 61 846 c b 1 1 107 c degree 1 and 16 c 0 t cos 2 π t t 1 year ψ 0 where ψ 0 0 298 radian 17 january where t represents the time since the beginning of a year whose total time is t 1year at 70 s the maximum and minimum of t min is 4 095 c and 27 193 c respectively to smooth the transition the cut off was extended northward toward 50 s

and specific humidity were modified together fig 7 shows the resulting changes to air temperature and specific humidity during winter in the southern hemisphere the air temperature is warmed by 5 10 kelvin in the marginal sea ice zone the specific humidity is raised accordingly adding the monthly anomaly of core to the temperature and specific humidity of the high latitude regions during the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the sea ice distribution of jra 55 is based on cobesst in the pre satellite period 1958 1978 the sea ice distribution of cobesst in the southern hemisphere is largely based on climatology so the inter annual variabilities of the air temperature and specific humidity in the high latitude southern hemisphere are unreliable in the northern hemisphere the sea ice distribution of cobesst is based on walsh and chapman 2001 in the pre satellite period but the sea ice extent of cobesst tends to be higher than the original data in the marginal sea ice zones identifying the reason for this is beyond the scope of this paper we simply consider how to remedy the discrepancy in ncep r1 which is used as the basis for air temperature and specific humidity in the core dataset sea ice does not show such extensive distributions furthermore ncep r1 uses various sea ice analyses in addition to walsh and chapman 2001 prior to 1978 when available kalnay et al 1996 in fig 8 a regions of extensive sea ice distributions in the labrador sea in jra 55 for the pre satellite period 1958 1978 are marked as x and y relative to the less extensive sea ice in ncep r1 for the same period fig 8b the latter exhibits better agreement with the labrador sea sea ice fraction in both jra 55 and ncep r1 for the satellite period fig 8c and d suggesting that the jra 55 sea ice fraction in the pre satellite period is probably too high as a result the air temperature and specific humidity of jra 55 tend to be suspiciously low in the marginal sea ice zones specifically in the labrador sea in the pre satellite period which can result in unrealistically strong deep water formation in ocean models thus at latitudes poleward of 40 n or 50 s we added the time series of the difference of the temperature and specific humidity between the adjusted jra 55 and core core minus the adjusted jra 55 to the adjusted jra 55 fields for 1958 1978 the time series was constructed by the linear interpolation in time of the monthly differences the monthly differences were smoothed with 50 passes of a horizontal 9 point filter over the ice free ocean whose response function is shown in fig 5b the smoothing removed the high wave number wave length less than 1000 km ripples in the air temperature field of core which are traceable to ncep r1 see also appendix g 1 fig 9 shows the resulting changes in air temperature in the winter of each hemisphere the air temperature is warmed in the labrador sea whereas it is cooled in the arctic ocean and around antarctica this operation was not applied to the western north pacific region 40 65 n and 125 160 e because the difference was large warming in the southern part of the okhotsk sea which was due to a low sea ice extent in the okhotsk sea used by ncep r1 in the pre satellite period this is marked as z in fig 8b in this region the sea ice distribution in the pre satellite period of jra 55 shows a better match with that in the satellite period than ncep r1 3 4 wind vector 3 4 1 reference dataset the main reference dataset for the surface wind vectors is the remote sensing systems quikscat ku 2011 daily ocean vector wind on 0 25 grid version 4 ricciardulli et al 2011 ricciardulli and wentz 2015 hereafter referred to as quikscat we first computed the time series of the monthly scalar wind speeds and the zonal and meridional components of the wind vectors from daily data on the original 0 25 grid at each grid point the monthly data are used if available on more than one third of the total number of days in that month the time series data were then mapped onto the reduced tl319 grid of jra 55 the data gaps are caused by the shifting satellite orbits rain contaminations and the presence of sea ice in grid cells where the monthly data were not available jra 55anl wind data was used this treatment should smooth the transition of the adjustment factors in the marginal sea ice zones from the derived monthly dataset we generated time series of the annual mean and its climatology on the reduced tl319 grid quikscat wind is available from aug 1999 to oct 2009 sufficiently long for referencing phase iii this is an improvement relative to the core dataset for which only 5 years of reference data was available for adjustment in phases i and ii the wind speed was adjusted using an ssm i based wind speed product wentz 2013 because this product extends from 1988 to the present the ssm i wind speeds over the entire period were adjusted relative to the quikscat wind speed during the nov 1999 to oct 2009 period the adjusted speed then provided the reference for adjusting the jra 55 wind speed because the wind vector components are not available from ssm i the adjustment factor for the wind direction used for phase iii were applied to phases i and ii because quikscat and ssm i measure equivalent neutral wind at 10 m height the adjustment procedures are performed in terms of equivalent neutral wind accordingly before filling the gaps in the satellite data we converted the jra 55anl wind to the equivalent neutral wind using the meteorological variables from jra 55anl similarly the jra55 raw actual winds were converted to equivalent neutral winds before computing the adjustment factor using the surface air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m after the main adjustment explained in sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 but as ocean sea ice models assume input of actual 10 m winds the final step is to convert the adjusted jra 55 equivalent neutral winds back to actual winds this was done using the adjusted surface meteorological variables in these conversions we used the sea surface temperature from cobesst the ice surface temperature from the brightness temperature of jra 55 and the bulk formula of large and yeager 2009 with properties of moist air calculated by the formulas given in appendix b 3 4 2 adjustment table 6 summarises the adjustment method for the wind vectors the adjustment method is a slight modification of that described in large and yeager 2009 see also appendix c 3 1 the magnitude and direction of the wind vector were adjusted by an offsetting factor δw λ ϕ and a counter clockwise rotating factor χ λ ϕ respectively where λ and ϕ respectively denote longitude and latitude these adjustment factors are constant in time specifically the wind vector of jra55 raw u jra55 v jra55 at λ ϕ was adjusted as follows 19 u adj v adj w jra 55 c δ w w jra 55 cos χ sin χ sin χ cos χ u jra 55 v jra 55 where 20 w jra 55 max u jra 55 2 v jra 55 2 0 3 m s 1 and 21 c tanh d d max w jra 55 0 3 m s 1 0 δ w in 19 the offsetting factor for the wind speed δw was computed by subtracting the long term average of jra55 raw wind speed w jra 55 from that of the reference wind speed w ref 22 δ w w ref w jra 55 in 20 a 0 3 m s 1 floor on the equivalent neutral wind speed of jra55 raw was introduced to avoid the zero division in 19 the factor c defined by 21 tapers the adjustment to ensure that wind speed is not modified for the minimum wind speed w jra 55 0 3 m s 1 adjustment is not applied c 0 for the minimum wind speed and gets closer to the full adjustment c 1 as the wind gets higher for wind direction large and yeager 2009 computed the rotating factor as the angle difference between the long term means of the reference and the ncep ncar reanalysis because the angle differences could be very large 180 in low wind regions especially around the transitions between easterly and westerly large and yeager 2009 introduced a tapering as a function of the magnitude of the vector average wind for jra55 do we apply an analysis method used in the works of kundu and allen 1976 and yoshikawa et al 2007 who analysed low frequency current fluctuations near the oregon coast and the relation between the surface wind vector and the vertical profile of the oceanic ekman current respectively specifically we computed the rotating factor χ not from the angle differences but using a complex empirical orthogonal function ceof analysis the ceof can estimate the rotating factor in low wind regions without requiring special treatment first we prepared time series of the monthly mean wind vectors from the reference data and jra55 raw during the nov 1999 oct 2009 period a wind vector is expressed as a complex variable w u i v we then construct a complex matrix w whose two columns contain the 10 year time series of the monthly reference data and jra55 raw next we computed the 2 2 covariance matrix r w w where w is the hermitian transpose of w the eigenvectors of r are ceof modes of the time series if jra55 raw largely reproduces the reference data the first mode with a positive eigenvalue is the co varying correlated mode from the co varying mode we obtained the rotating factor for jra55 raw as the angle between the components of the corresponding complex eigenvector preliminary analysis showed that the magnitude of the rotating factor tended to be large 45 if the total energy accounted for by the first mode was small thus a reduction factor ξ as a function of the total energy accounted for by the first mode γ 1 λ 1 λ 1 λ 2 where λ 1 and λ 2 are the eigen values of the 1st and 2nd mode respectively was introduced to taper the rotating factor 23 ξ 1 2 1 tanh 2 γ 1 0 9 the transition of ξ occurs approximately from γ 1 0 95 ξ 1 to γ 1 0 85 ξ 0 fig 10 shows the offsetting factor for the wind speed in the three phases in all phases the wind speed in the intertropical convergence zones is enhanced and that in the middle and high latitudes is reduced the offsetting factor is generally smaller in phase iii than other phases because scatterometer winds were assimilated for the period corresponding to phase iii in jra55 raw fig 11 a shows the rotating factor for the wind direction over the entire period mid latitude westerly winds are rotated equatorward in both hemispheres trade winds in the intertropical convergence zones are made more divergent the first ceof modes explain more than 95 of the total energy in most regions specifically around the transitions between easterly and westerly 30 n s exceptions are found in several coastal regions fig 11b the eastern tropical north pacific off the coast of central america is one of those regions where the wind direction is strongly affected by orography simulation results should be interpreted with some care in those regions users interested in detailed exploration of the regions of problematic wind direction could modify the rotation scripts which are freely available see appendix c choosing perhaps to eliminate the rotation correction in these regions fig 12 compares the equivalent neutral wind speeds at 10 m height zonally averaged over the ocean the wind speeds are generally stronger in core than in quikscat and jra55 do because the actual winds in core are directly adjusted relative to the equivalent neutral winds in quikscat indeed when zonally averaged the actual wind speed of core compares well with the equivalent neutral wind speed of quikscat results not shown for further discussions on the comparisons across wind products readers are referred to taboada et al 2018 3 4 3 comments on the adjustment of wind vector relative to satellite products because the microwave scatterometer quikscat and radiometer ssm i primarily infer the wind stress from surface wave fields they essentially detect the surface wind speeds relative to the oceanic current at the sea surface δ u in eq 13 because the direction and speed of the surface wind usually influences the surface ekman current adjusting the wind speed by the above method slightly weakens and rotates the true wind vector moreover the quasi steady surface current can reach 1 m s 1 in the western boundary current and in the equatorial regions and the surface current may reach several tens of cm s 1 within mesoscale eddies in these cases the difference between the absolute and relative wind vectors is non negligible users of the present dataset should be aware of this limitation and its possible impact on their simulated fields e g abel et al 2017 in future work the absolute wind vector u a could be estimated from the surface current u o derived in an oceanic reanalysis or state estimation e g rio et al 2014 for this version we provide a climatological mean surface current u o clim computed from the dataset of rio et al 2014 the climatology is based on the period used to construct the reference wind field from quikscat nov1999 oct2009 this climatological surface current could be added to the time series of the wind vector of this dataset to approximate the time series of the absolute wind vector 3 5 shortwave and longwave radiation 3 5 1 reference dataset we used the ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 data kato et al 2013 as the reference dataset for the downward radiative fluxes ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 consists of surface irradiance fluxes as well as other variables derived from the clouds and earth s radiant energy system ceres satellite measurements of top of atmosphere toa radiation loeb et al 2012 ebaf energy balanced and filled refers to adjustments made to ceres data within its uncertainty to make it consistent with the estimated global average heat storage in the ocean of 0 50 w m 2 loeb et al 2012 the estimates of surface fluxes derived from radiative transfer theory using data on clouds atmosphere surface and aerosol properties are constrained to give toa radiances that match ceres ebaf in turn kato et al 2013 ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 hereafter referred to as ceres is considered a state of the science product replacing the earlier isccp fd dataset zhang et al 2004 used in core as the latest dataset of its kind ceres has been widely used as a reference in verification studies ceres data now cover 15 years sufficiently long for comparisons with other data following large and yeager 2004 2009 who produced the core data using isccp fd radiation we compared the ceres data with buoy observations and evaluated the necessity of adjusting them before their application to the reference fields accordingly the shortwave radiation was reduced at low latitudes and over sea ice by up to 4 and 10 respectively fig 13 however the longwave radiation was left unadjusted see appendix e for details on the adjustments applied to ceres 3 5 2 adjustment table 7 summarises the adjustment procedure the monthly multiplicative factors were identical in phases ii and iii and were based on the 15 year mar 2000 feb 2015 monthly climatologies of the adjusted ceres and jra55 raw the reference field in phase i was the adjusted jra 55 jra55 adj downward radiation acquired from 1979 to 1996 the monthly climatologies of jra55 adj and jra 55c were compared over this period and the adjustment factors over the 1958 72 period were then determined fig 14 shows a comparison of the annual mean multiplicative factors in the two periods generally the shortwave radiation is enhanced at low latitudes and reduced at high latitudes the exception at low latitudes is the eastern part of subtropical oceanic basins where the shortwave radiation is above the reference value and is reduced by the adjustment the biases in the downwelling shortwave radiation are generally related to precipitation as will be shown in the next subsection notably about a 30 reduction is required for shortwave radiation in the southern ocean which implies insufficient clouds there in jra 55 this is consistent with the analysis on the top of atmosphere presented by kobayashi et al 2015 see figs 19 and 20 of kobayashi et al 2015 the longwave radiation is adjusted in the opposite sense of the shortwave radiation reflecting the compensatory nature of shortwave and longwave radiations in the radiative transfer models when the climatological value in a grid point was below 5 w m 2 as occurred for shortwave radiation in the polar night region the multiplicative factor for that month was set to unity fig 15 compares the zonally averaged downward shortwave and longwave radiations over the ocean overall the large bias found in jra55 raw was successfully corrected in jra55 do the jra55 do and core datasets are comparable 3 6 precipitation 3 6 1 reference dataset the precipitation adjustment was referenced to the core dataset the precipitation field of the core dataset is comprised of several data sources the global ocean is separated into several latitude bands and an appropriate dataset is chosen for each from the south the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 for poleward of 65 s cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap xie and arkin 1996 for 65 s 30 s gpcp for 30 s 30 n cmap for 30 n 70 n and a combined serreze and hurst 2000 and yang 1999 climatology for the arctic poleward of 70 n the data with interannual variability is only available after 1979 in the earlier version of the dataset the global ocean averaged precipitation showed a rapid increase during the most recent decade which was not found in the gpcp v2 3 dataset adler et al 2003 see also appendix c 3 2 this is thought to be caused by the introduction of gnss ro global navigation satellite system radio occultation in 2006 as well as the increase in the number of radiance observations from satellite water vapor channels because it is not desired that the enhanced precipitation remains in the updated data in the future phase iii is further divided at 2006 and different adjustment factors are computed for the first and second halves phase iiia and phase iiib respectively we used the core dataset for the first half in the second half we used a product based on the gpcp v2 3 dataset because the core dataset is only available until 2009 because gpcp v2 3 extends from 1979 to the present the gpvp v2 3 precipitation over the entire period were first adjusted relative to the core dataset during the 1979 to 2009 period thus the adjusted precipitation provides the reference for adjusting the jra 55 precipitation for phase iiib 3 6 2 adjustment table 8 summarises the adjustment method the monthly multiplicative factors f λ ϕ t with thresholds 1 3 f 3 were determined from the monthly climatologies of jra55 raw and the adjusted gpcp v2 3 in phase iiib during the 2006 2015 period jra55 raw and core during the 1999 2006 period in phase iiia and the 1979 1996 period in phase ii the adjustment factor in phase i was determined by comparing the monthly climatology between jra 55c and core from 1979 to 1996 the purpose of thresholds f was to avoid excessive correction such as extreme rainfall events f 3 and the overall removal of moderate rainfall events f 1 3 the choice of the specific factors of 1 3 and 3 is subjective fig 16 compares the multiplicative factors for the four phases the factors are qualitatively similar precipitation must be reduced in the intertropical convergence zones and enhanced toward the west of the continents at low latitudes fig 16 also implies that the areas affected by the thresholds on the multiplicative factors are very small justifying the present choice fig 17 compares the zonally averaged precipitation over the ocean precipitation in the intertropical convergence zones is exaggerated in jra55 raw but is comparable with the core data in jra55 do the reason for the excessive precipitation in jra55 raw was discussed by kobayashi et al 2015 according to the authors large moistening increments occur in the region near the intertropical convergence zones in order to correct the dry bias in the upper and middle troposphere tending to appear in the first guess this results in the large precipitation seen near the intertropical convergence zones in jra 55 3 6 3 additional adjustment in the mediterranean after the first adjustment the precipitation remained exaggerated in the mediterranean during the 1958 1978 period fig 18 this is due to processing errors on some of the radiosonde data used in jra 55 in 1960s to 1970s the impact of this error on oceanic precipitation was limited except for the mediterranean this excessive precipitation which might affect transport at the strait of gibraltar was corrected by estimating the annual precipitation over the mediterranean from 1958 to 1978 the estimation is described below the precipitation on the land around the mediterranean was first calculated using global precipitation climatology center gpcc schneider et al 2011 data from 1958 to the present additionally the precipitation over the mediterranean was calculated from core for the 1979 2009 period when the inter annual variability of precipitation was available in this dataset to estimate the annual mean precipitation in the mediterranean from the precipitation over the land we computed the ratio of the long term 1979 2009 mean ocean core precipitation to the land gpcc precipitation and applied it to the time series of the annual mean land precipitation from gpcc the estimated annual mean correlates well with the ocean precipitation from core c f the black and green lines in fig 18 thus the adjusted jra 55 precipitation on the mediterranean was calibrated by the estimated annual ocean precipitation over the 1958 1978 period the annual mean precipitation integrated over the mediterranean in the adjusted jra 55 was compared with the yearly precipitation estimated from gpcc the ratio of the two values defines the calibration factor for the given year the annual calibration factors were linearly interpolated in time and applied to the instantaneous mediterranean precipitation values in the adjusted jra 55 the result jra55 do is depicted as the red line in fig 18 4 runoff the main part of the river runoff freshwater discharge at river mouths was taken from a dataset presented in suzuki et al 2017 in this dataset the river discharge to the ocean was calculated by the global river routing model cama flood yamazaki et al 2011 yamazaki et al 2013 the input runoff from the jra 55 land surface model is then routed to oceans along the river network map which is fitted to the land surface model the longitudinal and latitudinal resolution of the model is 0 25 the input runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 contains biases that were corrected by the multiplicative factors as explained by suzuki et al 2017 in this correction the input runoff was adjusted so that cama flood gives the river discharge into the ocean that fits with that reported by dai et al 2009 the river discharge data of dai et al 2009 were extended to 2015 by a linear regression using the annual total precipitation of gpcp v2 3 adler et al 2003 on the drainage basins the multiplicative factor applied to the input runoff is estimated as the ratio of the river discharge by dai et al 2009 to the total input runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 in each drainage basin before this estimation a low pass filter a 5 year lanczos window was applied to both input runoff and river discharge the factors were fixed before 1962 and after 2011 at the values for 1963 and 2010 respectively the choice of 1963 is to exclude the first 3 years 1958 1960 from the computation of the adjustment factor during 1958 1960 precipitation over land showed significant variability that resulted in the large variation of the river discharge fig 19 the choice of 2010 is because after 2010 no distinctive time dependent biases were seen in jra 55 and the assimilation method of jra 55 was frozen to moderate the correction the multiplicative factor was confined to 0 2 5 0 these procedures were applied to 38 major continental rivers with large river discharge and to seven rivers with a large drainage basin area see suzuki et al 2017 for the list of these rivers these rivers were selected because they are well resolved by the model with the 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the river discharge from the remaining small rivers was separated into 12 divided ocean basins the western and eastern part of the three major atlantic pacific and indian oceans the arctic ocean the mediterranean black baltic and red seas and the hudson bay in the above adjustment procedure the total input runoff into the small rivers was adjusted to match the sum of the river discharges from the divided basins excluding the discharges of the 45 major rivers the depths and widths of the 38 major continental rivers in cama flood were tuned ad hoc to fit the climatology of the seasonal cycle with that of dai et al 2009 fig 19 compares the time series of the annual mean global ocean integrated river discharges into the oceans in the core dataset dai et al 2009 and the cama flood simulation of suzuki et al 2017 the simulated annual mean river discharges vary similarly to the discharges from the major continental rivers reported by dai et al 2009 partly because the long term input was adjusted to dai et al s 2009 data by the time dependent multiplicative factor the excessive river discharge in 1958 of jra55 do occurred because the high runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 of that year could not be appropriately corrected by the present adjustment method that uses the multiplicative factor for 1963 during the period 1958 1962 the river model used by suzuki et al 2017 is suitable only for liquid water thus in basins with significant runoff in the solid phase such as greenland and antarctica we used climatologies of existing datasets namely the climatologies of bamber et al 2012 for greenland and depoorter et al 2013 for antarctica we provide them as the total i e liquid plus solid river runoff in the main dataset the separate components are also provided if available appendix c we used a monthly climatology of greenland runoff for jra55 do because the interannually varying dataset is available only until 2010 this will be modified when an update to bamber et al 2012 which extends the seasonally varying time series to 2016 and will be imminently available bamber et al 2018 appendix c the climatology is based on the period 1961 1990 after which the total river runoff started to increase rapidly bamber et al 2012 during the 1961 1990 period the annual mean total river runoff from greenland is 0 0278 sv in jra55 do and 0 002 sv in core that is the total river runoff from greenland is an order of magnitude higher in jra55 do than that in core fig 20 compares the monthly climatology of the total river runoff from greenland in the two datasets the seasonal variability of the total river runoff also differs between jra55 do and core bamber et al 2012 utilises a high resolution regional climate model validated with in situ observations alongside observations of solid ice discharge however there was no gauges along the coastal greenland in the runoff dataset of dai et al 2009 on which core is based consequently jra55 do is considered to be more realistic than core for greenland for antarctica the annual mean runoff of the liquid and solid phases was represented by ice shelf basal melt and calving flux respectively as provided by depoorter et al 2013 prior to this study it was believed that iceberg calving was by far the dominant runoff mechanism but it is now evident that ice shelf bottom melting is of equal magnitude and importance depoorter et al 2013 provides a snapshot of the fluxes for the year 2009 for parts of west antarctica both bottom melting and calving have increased over at least the last 15 years paolo et al 2015 in east antarctica however the fluxes have been relatively stable during the satellite era and the 2009 value is a reasonable estimate of the long term value for west antarctica this is a less valid assumption even though the difference is only on the order of 9 msv paolo et al 2015 in depoorter et al 2013 the average annual mean of the liquid plus solid runoff from antarctica is 0 0876 sv versus 0 073 sv in core in contrast to core jra55 do provides a spatially variable antarctic runoff based on observations in fig 21 the runoff from antarctica is divided into longitudinal bins at 10 intervals note that the non uniform distribution of the 10 bins in core reflects the different numbers of coastal grid cells contained in each bin the runoff is generally higher in jra55 do than in core except the region 30 w 70 e including the eastern part of the weddell sea 0 30 e and the region 130 170 e including the eastern part of the eastern indian ocean sector where it is higher in core for the 1998 2007 period the global ocean integrated annual mean runoff in jra55 do totals 1 2566 sv approximately 0 03 sv larger than in core 1 2229 sv the difference is mainly sourced from the different runoffs of greenland and antarctica in the two datasets the original intent was that any new river runoff dataset incorporated into this project would be adjusted to match its long term mean 1988 2007 with that of core 1 22 sv however we have now decided to refer to new datasets to the total runoff of the present dataset 1 26 sv taking the oceanic area as 3 654 1014 m2 this runoff is equivalent to a global ocean averaged freshwater flux of 3 44 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 5 final adjustment for achieving global balance after making the main and additional adjustments described in the previous sections we computed the heat and freshwater fluxes using cobesst ishii et al 2005 the albedo and bulk formulas of large and yeager 2009 and a set of formulas to compute properties of moist air presented in appendix b the fluxes for evaluating the global ocean heat and freshwater balances were calculated on the 1 1 grid of cobesst as explained in section 3 2 3 we impose exact closure on long term mean global ocean averaged heat and freshwater fluxes in the satellite era to achieve this we adjusted the downward fluxes i e the shortwave and longwave radiation and precipitation fluxes by globally and temporally constant factors these factors are applied for the entire dataset period after the main and additional adjustments the long term mean global ocean averaged surface heat flux 2 retains some residuals res 24 q sw q dlw q ulw q la q se q p e r q io res where q x denotes the global ocean average for qx in 24 25 q sw ocean f o q dsw 1 α d s ocean d s is the long term mean global ocean averaged net shortwave radiation flux determined by the downwelling shortwave radiation flux qdsw and albedo α where means a long term average whose period will be determined shortly similarly q

4 w m 2 is the heat flux due to the sea ice thermodynamics all of which are taken from a previous interannual core simulation conducted at mri these figures are tentative and should be revised when an observational estimate or an ensemble mean of multi model outputs becomes available the heat budget is closed by applying a common factor a to the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes 26 a q sw q dlw q ulw q la q se q p e r q io 0 combining eqs 26 and 24 the factor a is calculated as 27 a q sw q dlw res q sw q dlw the period to impose exact closure of the global ocean averaged surface fluxes is determined using an assessment of their time series note that we will use common closure periods for heat and freshwater fluxes looking at the total heat flux of jra55 do in advance fig 22 e implies that a minor regime shift remains in the total heat flux in the late 1990s even after the main and additional adjustments this is largely caused by the shift in the latent heat flux or evaporation as seen in figs 22c and 23a details are discussed in the next section to constrain a long term budget it is desirable to choose an interval that includes equal periods both before and after the regime shift therefore we decided to take the period of 1988 2007 which covers the last and first 10 years of the adjustment phases ii 1973 1997 and iii 1998 present respectively the choice of 10 years is because there was an increasing trend of precipitation in the latter part of phase iii that was presumably caused by the introduction of gnss ro into jra 55 in 2006 as well as the increase in the number of radiance observations from satellite water vapor channels though the trend was mitigated by further dividing the adjustment phase iii in the latest version we still refrained from including this period for the computation of the exact closure the residual heat flux res was 5 8 w m 2 during the 1988 2007 period for this period q sw and q dlw were 167 9 w m 2 and 345 7 w m 2 respectively giving a 0 98863 an approximate reduction of 1 1 to close the budget of the long term mean global ocean averaged freshwater flux we multiply the precipitation p by a factor b 28 b p e r s 0 where s is the long term mean global ocean averaged sublimation over sea ice s ocean 1 f o s d s ocean d s 1 3 10 7 kg m 2 s 1 here s is determined in a simulation forced by a preliminary version of the jra55 do dataset and should be revised when an observational estimate or an ensemble mean of multi model outputs becomes available e and r represent the long term mean global ocean averaged evaporation and runoff respectively the factor b is calculated as 29 b e r s p given the evaporation e 3 971 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 precipitation p 3 565 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 and river runoff r 3 44 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 over the 1988 2007 period b was computed as 1 02118 denoting an approximate enhancement of 2 1 6 evaluation this section compares the atmospheric fields and surface fluxes derived from the jra55 do core and jra55 raw datasets and aims to motivate the replacement of core by jra55 do in the omip framework for this purpose we focus on the large scale features and global balances of the surface fluxes we first interpolated the atmospheric fields on the 1 1 grid of cobesst then calculated the heat and freshwater fluxes as described in the previous section note that cobesst is commonly used as the lower boundary condition for all of the three datasets in order to compare only the set of atmospheric variables the wind speed and surface wind stress cannot be suitably computed using this approach because any temporal or spatial interpolation of the wind vector slightly weakens both variables complicating the comparison with observations therefore the equivalent neutral wind speeds and surface wind stresses in jra55 do and jra55 raw were computed on their original normal tl319 grid points using their surface atmospheric variables and jra 55 brightness temperature which is based on cobesst as a reference a detailed comparison of surface meteorological variables with buoy observations is given in appendix f jra55 do showed reduced rms misfits and increased correlations in comparison with jra55 raw and core an atlas of annual mean surface fluxes of jra55 do and their comparison with the core dataset is given in appendix g several notable features have also been described there 6 1 time series of the global mean the downward shortwave and longwave radiations fig 24 precipitation fig 23b and the surface marine meteorological variables air temperature specific humidity and wind speed fig 25 for the three sets of surface atmospheric data were averaged over the global ocean over 60 s 60 n for wind speed and are depicted as time series the time dependent adjustment applied to jra55 raw caused no apparent spurious behaviour in the time series of global means in jra55 do but it did correct the abrupt reduction of shortwave radiation in the 1973 data of jra55 raw fig 24a after 2000 the radiation fields of jra55 raw and jra55 do well reproduced the inter annual or year to year variability of adjusted ceres shortwave and unadjusted ceres longwave radiation fig 24 although there is an offset between jra55 do radiation and ceres due to the global balance adjustment explained in section 5 the increased precipitation in jra55 raw during the late 1990s fig 1b is suppressed in jra55 do fig 23b however the inter annual precipitation variability in jra55 do somewhat deviates from that in gpcp the abrupt increase of the surface winds around the late 1990s in jra55 raw is alleviated in jra55 do fig 25a the inter annual variation of air temperature and specific humidity largely follows that of core fig 25b and c although the specific humidity is lower in jra55 do than in core implying that the majority of reanalysis products have lower relative humidity than core 6 2 global heat and freshwater flux figs 22 and 23 plot the time series of the annual mean global ocean averaged heat fluxes and the annual mean global ocean integrated freshwater fluxes respectively in general the heat flux components of jra55 do better resemble the core components than those of jra55 raw specifically the total heat flux in jra55 raw was considerably decreased by 5 w m 2 during the late 1990s at that time the increased wind speed and the suppression of the increasing specific humidity trend fig 25a and c artificially enhanced the evaporation this effect was mitigated in jra55 do specifically the overall wind speed increase from the 1990s to the 2000s is much less in jra55 do which would reduce the evaporation change meanwhile the humidity increase between these periods is slightly larger in jra55 do than in jra55 raw which would also act to reduce the evaporation and latent heat flux change there are some notable differences between the jra55 do and core analyses the time series of longwave radiation and sensible heat fluxes are steadier in jra55 raw and jra55 do than in core the large decadal variations in latent and sensible heat fluxes seen in core during the 1970s and 1980s are not seen in jra55 do the lower boundary condition is cobesst in jra 55 but another sst dataset is used in the ncep ncar reanalysis and the isccp fd longwave radiation calculation in general the surface air temperature is strongly influenced by the sst used as the lower boundary condition therefore we may expect less variability in the difference between surface air temperature and sst in jra 55 than core in the present flux computation which commonly uses cobesst as the lower boundary condition our assessment on the jra 55 downward longwave radiation at the sea surface implies that the interannual variation of the downward longwave radiation correlated well with that of the surface air temperature which is influenced by the sst i e cobesst therefore we may generally expect less variability in the difference between upward and downward longwave radiation fluxes in jra 55 than in core if cobesst is used as the lower boundary condition however the use of another sst dataset hurrell et al 2008 as the lower boundary condition only slightly enhanced variability grey lines in fig 22 this would imply that the surface air temperature of jra 55 follows more closely the variation of the sst than that of core a detailed analysis on the boundary layer scheme of the atmospheric model used by jra 55 would be required to resolve this issue which is beyond the scope of this paper it should also be noted that the effects of the pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991 represented as the decline of the downward shortwave radiation flux in core are missing from the radiative fluxes of jra 55 fig 24a however the simulated fields forced by jra55 do might be cooled by the reduced air temperature assimilated into jra 55 in the 1991 92 period see fig 25b the long term 1988 2007 averages of the three datasets are summarised in table 9 in jra55 do the net fluxes of shortwave radiation 166 0 w m 2 longwave radiation 53 4 w m 2 latent heat 97 2 w m 2 and sensible heat 13 6 w m 2 sum to 1 8 w m 2 which exactly compensates the sum of q p e r and q io 1 8 w m 2 implying that the closure in section 5 worked as intended the long term 1988 2007 average of the difference between evaporation 14 51 10 9 kg s 1 and precipitation 13 30 10 9 kg s 1 is 1 21 10 9 kg s 1 which can account for the difference between the river runoff 1 26 10 9 kg s 1 and sublimation 0 05 10 9 kg s 1 table 9 also lists the averages of heat and fresh water flux components for the overlapping period 1958 2009 of core and jra 55 the differences for jra55 do between 1958 2009 and 1988 2007 are less than 1 w m 2 for heat fluxes and 0 1 10 9 kg s 1 for fresh water fluxes these differences are less than or equal to those between datasets jra55 do and core as a result it can be concluded that the constraints imposed on the surface heat and freshwater flux specifically that the long term mean globally averaged heat flux and globally integrated freshwater flux into the ocean sea ice system are both nearly zero or slightly positive approximately hold for the entire dataset period for jra55 do within the accuracy range of the major components of surface heat 0 1 w m 2 and freshwater 0 1 10 8 kg s 1 flux budgets 6 3 regional comparison of flux components following large and yeager 2009 we divided the oceanic domain into almost identical regions the components of the heat and freshwater fluxes are regionally compared for the period 1988 2007 in figs 26 and 27 respectively and their values in jra55 do and core are presented in table 10 in general the heat flux components differ by less than 5 w m 2 and the freshwater flux components are consistent within a few mg m 2 s 1 jra55 do is more consistent with core than jra55 raw specifically in the low latitude downwelling shortwave radiation and precipitation this implies that the adjustments are successful overall it should be noted that jra55 do tends to put more freshwater into the northern north atlantic regions 2 and 3 than core this is contributed by the smaller evaporation and the larger runoff from greenland in jra55 do impact of this feature on the north atlantic meridional overturning in simulations should be investigated in future works figs 28 and 29 compare the basin wide zonal means of the wind stress components in jra55 do jra55 raw and core in general the wind stress of jra55 do best matches the scatterometer oceanic wind stress product scow provided by risien and chelton 2008 the exception is the slightly weak eastward wind stress in the latitude band of the mid latitude westerly wind of the north atlantic fig 28b this weakening presumably arises from the low resolution sst cobesst which is adopted as the lower boundary condition in the wind stress computation of jra55 do at mid latitudes the atmospheric stability and bulk transfer coefficients are strongly sensitive to the location and strength of the oceanic fronts and eddies the strength of the sst fronts measured by the sst gradient is stronger in the north atlantic than that of the north pacific this makes the resolution issue more critical for the north atlantic see also fig 36 additionally the horizontal interpolation of the quikscat wind vector onto the tl319 grid of jra 55 in the suite of the adjustment operations may lead to the reduction of jra55 do wind stresses regarding the meridional wind stress jra55 do shows improvement relative to both jra55 raw and core but there still remains differences from scow 6 4 implied meridional heat and freshwater transports the implied oceanic meridional heat transport is typically calculated as follows 30 mht ϕ π 2 ϕ 0 2 π δ λ ϕ q λ ϕ r cos ϕ d λ r d ϕ where δ λ ϕ is a digital mask that includes only the target basin q is defined by 2 and is positive into the ocean r is the radius of the earth and λ and ϕ are the longitude and latitude respectively expressed in radians the implied meridional freshwater transport in the ocean sea ice system is calculated as follows 31 mft ϕ π 2 ϕ 0 2 π δ λ ϕ f ocean ice λ ϕ r cos ϕ d λ r d ϕ where f ocean ice is defined by 4 the transports in core and jra55 do were computed by slightly different methods in core the implied meridional heat transport was computed with zero ice ocean flux qio and zero material transport by the freshwater fluxes q p e and qr we instead applied the corrections described by large and yeager 2009 following their computation of the meridional heat transport fig 10a of large and yeager 2009 the global heat flux imbalance of 0 6 w m 2 in core table 9 was assumed to be uniformly distributed except in the atlantic ocean the exclusion of the atlantic ocean was based on the assumption that there was no bias and oceanic heat storage in the atlantic basin which gave the most consistent results with the estimated oceanic heat transports for the core datasets as explained by large and yeager 2009 thus we subtracted 0 8 w m 2 0 6 w m 2 a global ocean a global ocean a atlantic ocean where a represents horizontal area from the total heat flux q in 30 in all oceanic regions except the atlantic ocean to compute the meridional heat transport in jra55 do we added the 2d distributions of both the ice ocean heat flux 1 f o q io and the heat flux due to precipitation evaporation and runoff assumed to have the local sst f o q p e q r to the total heat flux the values are taken from a previous interannual core simulation conducted at mri when computing the implied meridional freshwater transport in jra55 do we considered the 2d distribution of the sublimation over sea ice 1 f o s in the total freshwater flux the values were obtained by simulating with a preliminary version of the jra55 do dataset which is also used to compute the precipitation adjustment factor for achieving global balance in section 5 the core computation of the implied meridional freshwater transport ignored the sublimation effects instead the global imbalance of the core dataset p e r 6 4 10 7 kg m 2 s 1 where p 3 547 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 e 3 946 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 and r 3 35 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 taking the oceanic area as 3 654 1014 m2 is compensated uniformly over the oceans including the atlantic ocean the mht and mft are depicted in figs 30 and 31 respectively the meridional heat and freshwater transports are comparable in core and jra55 do and largely fit within the error bars of the observational estimates macdonald and baringer 2013 wijffels 2001 talley 2008 mcdonagh et al 2015 a notable difference is the peaks of poleward heat transport appearing at low latitudes these peaks are smaller in jra55 do than in core because the net heat loss in jra55 do is reduced in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere and enhanced denoting lower heat gain in the tropics relative to core fig 32 in jra55 do less latent heat is lost to the atmosphere in the mid to high latitude north atlantic ocean while more latent heat and net longwave fluxes are lost to the atmosphere in the tropical indian and pacific oceans for confirmation see the regional comparison in fig 26 and also appendix g 7 summary and conclusions in this paper we revisited the scientific and engineering foundations required to produce surface forcing datasets for driving coupled ocean sea ice models and in so doing we produced the jra55 do dataset of use within the core omip framework when generating the jra55 do forcing dataset we followed the methods of large and yeager 2009 and advanced several aspects of their methods by utilising newly available datasets and considering feedback from the ocean modelling community in the core dataset provided by large and yeager 2009 the surface atmospheric variables e g air temperature and specific humidity wind vectors and sea level pressure are based on the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 whereas the downward fluxes affected by clouds e g radiative fluxes and precipitation are based on other sources such as satellite data and direct observations our new jra55 do dataset is based on a recent long term more than 50 years reanalysis projects the jra 55 project which uses an atmospheric model with refined horizontal resolution 55 km and state of the art data assimilation techniques such as 4d var kobayashi et al 2015 the atmospheric variables are based on the forecast phase of jra 55 and the temporal interval 3 h can marginally resolve the diurnal cycle further advancing jra55 do over the core dataset besides applying the jra 55 reanalysis product we made several updates to the data production process we retained quikscat as the reference dataset for the wind field adjustment and used the full ten years available we also used the ssm i wind speed product to cover the pre quikscat period 1988 1998 the air temperature and specific humidity were adjusted using the ensemble means of 7 atmospheric products this averaging suppresses the appearance of isolated adjustment factors caused by the impact of locally over constrained analysis fields on the reference data josey et al 2014 such effects could appear around isolated field observations such as tropical arrays and other station data even on land by the ensemble mean approach we also mitigated the impact of the locally confined systematic biases in the individual products for cloud affected fluxes such as the downward radiative fluxes and precipitation we use the reanalysis outputs and adjust them relative to the reference fields thus facilitating data updates in near real time moreover the synoptic variabilities of the surface atmospheric variables are more self contained and mutually consistent than the earlier dataset we also possess the inter annual variations in the pre satellite era before the 1980s which are absent in the core dataset as references we adopt ceres ebaf surface ed2 8 for the shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes and core for the precipitation the ceres shortwave radiation data were slightly reduced in the tropics as well as over sea ice before being applied as the reference field a state of the art atmospheric reanalysis product still necessitates the introduction of adjustment factors specifically changes in the observing system and the input data density and quality cause transitions in the quality of the assimilation product which manifest as abrupt shifts in the jra 55 data quality to remove these shifts requires time dependent adjustments fortunately these adjustments can be calculated with some fidelity because the jra 55c dataset was acquired by the same data assimilation system as jra 55 but contains only the conventional surface and upper air observations i e contains no satellite observations therefore the biases in the pre satellite period can be estimated from jra 55c data in recent years although the inter annual variability of the adjusted fields raises concern the adjustment factors used in the pre satellite and satellite periods are qualitatively similar furthermore the time dependent adjustments introduce no artificial transitions in the time series of the global means figs 24 and 25 these findings guarantee consistency in the quality of large scale climatological features over the entire dataset period to complete the dataset we imported independent river runoff datasets the river runoff is determined by a river routing model cama flood forced by input runoff from the land surface component of jra 55 suzuki et al 2017 the input is adjusted to ensure similar long term variabilities in jra55 do and the core dataset based on dai et al 2009 the river runoffs from greenland and antarctica which involve ice sheets are taken from bamber et al 2012 and depoorter et al 2013 respectively the dataset details are summarised in appendix c we plan to regularly update the jra55 do dataset thus facilitating real time numerical experiments other global surface datasets with similar features are based either on satellite data hoaps andersson et al 2010 and j ofuro tomita et al 2010 or the synthesis of several sources oaflux yu and weller 2007 it is important to understand that the purposes and merits of these datasets differ from those of the datasets customised for driving ocean sea ice models the former datasets tend to provide realistic fluxes yet omit regions of large uncertainty or non availability of observations the area covered by sea ice is a typical example of such regions this treatment is unsuitable for driving global ocean sea ice models when compiling a dataset for ocean sea ice models an atmospheric reanalysis which omits no region is a suitable starting point however by adopting this approach we inevitably compromise the data accuracy which in turn requires careful assessments and corrections the jra 55 project uses a relatively low resolution sst dataset cobesst as the lower boundary condition this approach causes concerns that the jra 55 based products are not appropriate for forcing mesoscale eddy permitting models a number of groups are currently investigating the topic of how to force ocean models in a mesoscale resolving regime and it is not obvious that we should use atmospheric reanalysis fields based on a high resolution sst product one issue concerns the potential for double counting or mismatching of fluxes if the reanalysis product already contains the response to observed ocean eddies such as the response of wind speed or air temperature but in a different location to the ocean model another point of concern is that if a high resolution ocean model feeds sst and surface ocean currents into the bulk fluxes as is usual then the air sea fluxes will show detailed structure e g in western boundary currents for these reasons there is some justification for using a smooth sst product until we better understand how to use high resolution products for ocean models after adjusting local atmospheric variables and fluxes the global flux budgets based on a specified sst the cobesst product were positively biased on a multi decadal time scale this result implies that biases still remain in all flux components and they can vary regionally in a forced ocean sea ice model a balanced heat budget can be achieved by developing globally high ssts allowing additional surface heat losses through upward longwave sensible and latent heat fluxes to compensate for the excessive downwelling radiation fluxes e g brodeau et al 2010 an enhanced evaporation will affect the freshwater balance but there is no feedback process to restore a balance thus a global adjustment on freshwater fluxes is always warranted in a global ocean sea ice model simulation if the freshwater fluxes are treated explicitly this is not necessary if the freshwater fluxes are converted to the corresponding virtual salt fluxes to minimise these false adjustments in forced ocean sea ice models the global flux budgets based on a realistic sst should preferably be balanced in the present study we took a relatively simple approach to close a long term 1988 2007 surface flux budget by applying a globally and temporally constant multiplicative factor on downwelling radiations and precipitation the factors are applied for the entire dataset period these adjustment factors can be revised if major regional biases in any variables of the present version are identified after assessing the large scale features and global balances of the fluxes we confirmed that jra55 do is a valid alternative to the core dataset for driving global ocean sea ice models we hypothesise that the technical advances incorporated into jra55 do will improve many aspects of ocean modelling studies however the production processes will be continually reviewed and revised based on experience from the wide suite of anticipated studies specifically the downward fluxes affected by clouds radiation and precipitation fluxes were derived from a reanalysis product the validity of this choice should be carefully checked and reviewed in future studies also the adjustment methods of all variables require large improvements near the coast e g taboada et al 2018 the horizontal resolution of jra 55 55 km is still insufficient for capturing the meteorological features affected by orography in the coastal regions and the reference datasets in the present adjustment methods except for the scatterometer wind products are even less well resolved our group is planning to write several papers related to the present study for the simulation paper a number of international groups will conduct long term inter annual simulations forced by both core and jra55 do and compare their mean states and variabilities the normal or repeat year forcing paper will propose typical years that represent the present climate and display the results of model integrations forced by repeated use of each of those years additionally we expect various studies will arise from the cmip6 omip process griffies et al 2016 which makes use of both

paper not to the contact of the jra 55 project appendix a processing raw jra 55 data a1 mapping from reduced to normal latitude longitude tl319 grid the basic atmospheric model of jra 55 uses a reduced tl319 grid on which the raw jra 55 data are provided the number of longitudinal grid points is reduced at latitudes poleward of 41 5 and the first datum of each latitude band is placed at 0 longitude after the first main adjustment stage the adjusted data are zonally regridded at the common interval of 0 5625 for all latitude bands by the following rules if the target grid point is between two oceanic grid points its value is found by linear interpolation if the target grid point is between an ocean and a land grid point it is treated as an ocean grid if it locates at the mid point or closer to the ocean grid its value is then computed as the weighted average of the values of the ocean grid points among six candidate points the candidate points are the three pairs of the two points flanking the target longitude or residing on the two adjacent latitudinal circles the weighting factor is the inverse of the distance from the target point if the target grid point is determined as a land point its value is found by linear interpolation a2 shifting the temperature and specific humidity of jra 55 from 2 m to 10 m jra 55 provides the surface air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m above the surface as in the core dataset the temperature and specific humidity in the final dataset are provided at 10 m above the surface where the wind vectors are measured in jra55 do the air temperature and specific humidity of the jra 55 forecast fields are adjusted at 2 m height because the reference fields of both variables iabp npoles and the atmospheric reanalysis products for computing the ensemble mean are available at this height the main adjustments to the forecast fields are made on the original reduced tl319 grid points of jra 55 after the main adjustment on the surface air temperature and specific humidity sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 the following steps are taken to produce the final product of the surface meteorological variables the equivalent neutral wind at 10 m height of jra55 raw is estimated based on the adjusted air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m the equivalent neutral wind field is adjusted section 3 4 the adjusted air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m are shifted upwards to 10 m and the adjusted wind vector is converted from neutral to actual stability additional adjustments are performed on the air temperature and specific humidity at 10 m section 3 3 4 in the suite of operations we use the bulk formula of large and yeager 2009 and a set of formulas to compute the properties of moist air based on gill 1982 appendix b the surface temperatures of the ocean grids with and without sea ice are taken from the surface brightness temperatures of jra 55 and from cobesst respectively the surface temperatures of land grids are taken from the brightness temperature of jra 55 the computation of the bulk transfer coefficient is iterated five times at most appendix b computation of properties of moist air in producing the jra55 do dataset a set of formulas given by gill 1982 is used to compute properties of moist air which is thought to be more accurate than that used for producing the core dataset we recommend using these formulas for driving ocean sea ice models formulas used for producing the core dataset and in the current framework of core omip are given by large and yeager 2004 which is replicated here for comparison b1 saturation specific humidity we consider computing saturation specific humidity in an environment with the sea surface temperature t c and pressure p hpa the relation between the vapor pressure e hpa and specific humidity q is given by b 1 e p q ω 1 ω q where ω is the molecular weight ratio between water vapor and air b 2 ω m w m a 18 016 28 966 0 62197 this is solved for the specific humidity as b 3 q ω e p 1 ω e the relative humidity γ is the mixing ratio of the mass of vapor to the mass of dry air divided by that of the saturated one the mixing ratio r of the mass of vapor to the mass of dry air is given by b 4 r q 1 q thus the relative humidity is computed using the specific humidity q and the saturation specific humidity q sat as b 5 γ q 1 q sat q

ρa is the density of air over sea ice the formula of the same form is used but now a 1 11637800 kg m 3 and a 2 5897 8 k in summary we advocate replacing the core computation of saturation specific

data freshwater discharge at river mouths resulting from several sources table 1 all surface atmospheric fields are derived from the forecast phase of jra 55 the temporal coverage is 3 hourly from the 1st of january 1958 to the present to be updated at least annually the downward surface fluxes the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes and precipitation rain and snow are averaged over three hours the first datum of each year is averaged from 00 00 to 03 00 gmt on the 1st of january other surface atmospheric fields namely the air temperature specific humidity wind vectors all at 10 m height see appendix a 2 for the height shift of temperature and specific humidity and sea level pressure are 3 hourly instantaneous values starting at 00 00 gmt on the 1st of january of each year all variables except the sea level pressure are modified from their original fields by multiplicative or offsetting factors to fit the reference fields derived from observations or other datasets the modification and adjustment procedures are explained in sections 3 and 5 jra 55 does not directly provide the river runoff from rivers and glaciers at river mouths the liquid runoff fields are obtained from a river routing model forced by runoffs from the land surface component of jra 55 suzuki et al 2017 the runoffs from greenland and antarctica which contain a significant solid runoff component are taken from independent estimates that combine satellite observations of solid discharge with high resolution climate models of runoff and surface processes bamber et al 2012 and depoorter et al 2013 respectively the river runoff data are explained in section 4 the daily runoff from greenland is based on the monthly climatology 1961 1990 and the liquid plus solid runoff for time interpolation from monthly to daily data a method to preserve monthly mean values introduced by killworth 1996 is used the runoff from antarctica is constant in time and the liquid plus solid runoff besides the merged runoff data we provide the solid water discharge from antarctica represented as the calving flux derived from depoorter et al 2013 table 2 c2 supplementary data the dataset also includes the following supplementary data summarised in table 2 c2 1 variables at the sea surface the variables at the sea surface are necessary for computing surface fluxes in most ocean sea ice models these variables are taken from their own solution thus including a set of sea surface variables is not prerequisite to a dataset for driving ocean sea ice models however to assist computation of surface fluxes without using ocean sea ice models the observation based data for the sea surface variables are provided as part of the dataset we included surface temperature derived from brightness temperature of jra 55 sea surface temperature from cobesst ishii et al 2005 sea ice area fraction from both jra 55 and cobesst and surface oceanic current from the globcurrent dataset rio et al 2014 as discussed in section 3 4 the surface oceanic current may be added to the time series of the wind vector of this dataset to approximately construct a time series of the absolute wind vector in most ocean sea ice model simulations uncoupled with atmospheric models sea surface salinity is restored to observational data to prevent model drifts for this purpose we provide monthly climatology of sea surface salinity derived from the world ocean atlas 2013 version 2 zweng et al 2013 boyer et al 2015 this is computed as an average in the upper 10 m thus it should be more appropriately understood as salinity at 5 m depth c2 2 land sea mask the land sea mask for the atmospheric data on a tl319 grid is based on the original land sea mask of jra 55 the original land sea mask land 1 sea 0 on the reduced tl319 grid is linearly interpolated in the zonal direction onto the normal latitude longitude tl319 grid a grid point valued at 0 5 or less is designated as a sea point otherwise it is assigned to land then inland seas and lakes such as the caspian sea and lake victoria are manually buried and designated as land in the data provided land and sea grids are set to zero and unity respectively c2 3 grid information the earth s sphere is occupied by grid cells centred at the latitudes and longitudes provided in the data file for each variable cell boundaries are given by lat bnds and lon bnds variables contained in each file note that the grid spacing is different depending on the variable atmospheric variables derived from jra 55 are put on a tl319 grid 0 5625 river runoff data are equally spaced by 0 25 starting at 0 125 longitude and 89 875 latitude therefore the longitude and latitude bounds are also equally spaced starting at 0 longitude and 90 latitude the areas of the cells are provided for the atmospheric grid tl319 and the river runoff grid 0 25 0 25 c3 planned updates and older versions the latest version of jra55 do as of april 2018 is 1 3 the plan is to continually update this version using near real time updates to the raw jra 55 reanalysis the version number will advance accompanied by a detailed document whenever new datasets or adjustment methods are incorporated we will soon upgrade in version 1 4 the greenland runoff to include interannualy varying forcing from 1958 to 2016 incorporating an update to bamber et al 2012 that extends the seasonally varying time series to 2016 bamber et al 2018 the updated time series will also include runoff from arctic glaciers and ice caps which have also started to rapidly lose mass since the early 2000s bamber et al 2018 in addition to those over greenland as reported by bamber et al 2012 the cumulative runoff anomaly in the new time series will be about twice that of bamber et al 2012 because of the inclusion of in particular canadian arctic glaciers and the extension of the time series to 2016 separate components of runoff liquid and solid as well as the total runoff will be provided there are several older versions that deserve mention because there are many users of versions 1 1 and 1 2 we list in the following the fixes and upgrades included in versions 1 3 and 1 2 relative to their immediate predecessors as a convenient reference c3 1 difference between versions 1 3 and 1 2 in version 1 2 the magnitude of the wind vector was adjusted by a multiplicative factor r s λ ϕ whereas an offsetting factor was used for version 1 3 section 3 4 2 the adjustment of the wind direction was the same as that described in the main text the wind vector of jra55 raw u jra55 v jra55 at λ ϕ was adjusted as follows cf 19 c 1 u adj v adj r s λ ϕ cos χ sin χ sin χ cos χ u jra 55 v jra 55 where c 2 r s w ref w jra 55 in this adjustment method high winds are selectively modified by a large amount to produce a mean wind speed that matches that of the reference field this treatment may significantly modify the variance of the wind speed and hence the magnitude of the wind stress which is a quadratic function of the wind speed figs 33 and 34 show the comparison of the basin wide zonal mean wind stress as expected the zonal wind stress fig 33 is enhanced in version 1 3 in the mid latitude westerly region compared to the scatterometer oceanic wind stress scow product risien and chelton 2008 the zonal wind stress in version 1 3 in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere is reasonable but the stress is too strong in the southern hemisphere however the southern ocean westerlies in version 1 3 still exhibit improvements relative to jra55 raw fig 28 the meridional wind stress is similar between versions 1 2 and 1 3 fig 34 as shown in fig 29 version 1 3 is closer to scow than core and jra55 raw for these reasons we made a shift to version 1 3 c3 2 difference between versions 1 2 and 1 1 version 1 2 includes the following updates relative to version 1 1 bug fix an error in computing the annual mean climatology of wind speed for jra 55 and jra 55c was corrected this resulted in minor less than 0 5 changes in the adjustment factors for wind speed bug fix the temperature and specific humidity anomalies of core relative to jra 55 were not added to jra 55 in inland seas and lakes poleward of 40 n section 3 3 4 upgrade the phase iii precipitation adjustment was further divided into 1999 2006 and 2006 2015 to suppress the recent positive trend section 3 6 upgrade the contributions to the ensemble mean temperature and specific humidity reference data from ncep r1 ncep r2 and 20crv2 were reduced around semi enclosed seas section 3 3 1 fig 2 upgrade the region of full ice cover fraction 0 99 used for smoothing temperature and specific humidity was determined based on daily instead of monthly cobesst data to facilitate quicker updating in the future section 3 3 4 upgrade when calculating surface fluxes using the bulk formula to determine the globally uniform constant adjustment factors applied to downward fluxes scalar wind speed is first calculated on the original grid of the dataset and then interpolated onto the cobesst 1 1 grid in the older version the wind vector components were first interpolated onto the cobesst grid before computing the scalar wind speed sections 5 and 6 fig 35 shows the comparison of surface fresh water fluxes between versions 1 1 and 1 2 the global ocean integrated evaporation flux from versions 1 1 and 1 2 lie on top of each other but the flux in version 1 1 is reduced by about 1 when the older wind treatment is used the last item in the above list this is reflected in slightly reduced precipitation in version 1 1 before 1996 phases i and ii when the common spatially dependent adjustment factors are used in version 1 1 the precipitation shows an increasing trend in the most recent decade this motivated us to divide the phase iii at 2006 corresponding to the time period when gnss ro as well as an increased number of radiance observations from satellite water vapor channels were introduced in the reanalysis appendix d cobesst this appendix briefly introduces cobesst ishii et al 2005 where cobe is an acronym for centennial in situ observation based estimates of the variability of ssts and marine meteorological variables cobesst is a daily objective analysis of sea surface temperature on a 1 1 grid spanning the global oceans for the period from 1870 to present the objective analysis is based on optimal interpolation and reconstruction with empirical orthogonal functions only conventional observed datasets are used for the analysis the cobesst dataset also contains sea ice concentration sic data derived from walsh and chapman 2001 in the pre satellite period before october 1978 and from satellites afterwards sst and sic of cobesst were used as the lower boundary condition of jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 for more details on the analysis method and the evaluation of the cobesst dataset readers are referred to ishii et al 2005 fig 36 shows a long term mean 1981 2010 sst from cobesst and the difference to hurrell et al 2008 which was used by large and yeager 2009 for evaluating surface fluxes based on the core dataset cobesst exhibits features typical to low resolution sst analyses the weak sst fronts and the lack of explicit representation of mesoscale eddies this would result in smooth surface flux distribution in the western boundary current regions appendix g the difference from the sst product of hurrell et al 2008 which is also a low resolution 1 1 product is less than 0 5 c in most regions except for the mid latitude frontal zones of the north and south atlantic and the southern ocean cobesst shows ssts lower than the product of hurrell et al 2008 in the mid latitude north and south atlantic frontal zones in a long term average this difference resulted in about 20 w m 2 less heat loss to the atmosphere due to latent plus sensible heat fluxes when cobesst was used as the lower boundary condition not shown fig 37 shows a long term 1981 2010 root mean square difference from the monthly climatology and the comparison with the same quantity computed from the product of hurrell et al 2008 cobesst exhibits less variability than hurrell et al 2008 specifically in the sst frontal zones this may have resulted in the reduced variability in the surface flux components when cobesst was used as the lower boundary condition however the difference in the long term mean global ocean averaged heat fluxes is less than 0 5 w m 2 table 9 and is within the uncertainty 0 5 w m 2 loeb et al 2012 furthermore the difference in the flux variability arising from the two different sst products is considerably smaller than the difference arising from the two different atmospheric fields fig 22 appendix e evaluation and adjustment to ceres ebaf as a reference dataset e1 shortwave adjustment fig 38 shows the biases relative to the buoy observations expressed as percentages relative to the annual mean climatology of the ceres downward shortwave radiation to adjust the ceres radiation toward the buoy observations this fraction is subtracted from if positive or added to if negative the annual mean values of the ceres radiation the buoy observations were mainly available at low latitudes the biases revealed that ceres is positively biased in the tropics except right at the equator the positive tropical biases in ceres are larger in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere observations are limited at latitudes above 30 n s those available imply that the biases are generally small to evaluate the high latitude radiation we compared the ceres data with observations at land stations around the arctic ocean and the coastal zone of antarctica fig 39 shows the percentage biases from the land data in the monthly climatology of the ceres downward shortwave radiation the bias typically reached 10 in the summer season of both hemispheres the exceptions are stations gvn and nya where the areal fractions of sea ice are small in summer result not shown in conclusion the downward shortwave radiation of ceres was reduced in the low latitude regions as a function of latitude in the mid latitude regions the downward shortwave radiation was unchanged at high latitudes the downward shortwave radiation was reduced by up to 10 over sea ice depending on the area fraction of the sea ice 0 reduction for no ice coverage and 10 reduction for total ice coverage fig 13a compares the downward shortwave radiations zonally averaged over the ocean among core the raw ceres and the adjusted ceres the adjusted ceres generally gets close to core the somewhat noisy structures of ceres at high latitudes are presumably because only polar orbit satellites are available poleward of around 60 fig 13b shows the ratio of the adjusted ceres to the raw ceres which represents the adjustment factor applied to the raw ceres as explained above then the adjusted downward shortwave radiation was applied as a reference field for adjusting the jra 55 downward shortwave radiation e2 longwave adjustment fig 40 shows the percentage biases relative to the buoy observations in the annual mean climatology of the ceres downward longwave radiation note that the biases in the longwave radiation tend to offset those of the shortwave fig 38 but the fractional differences are generally below 1 fig 41 shows the percentage biases in the monthly climatology of the ceres longwave radiation relative to the observations at land stations around the sea ice zones at high latitudes generally the biases were less than 5 and their signs were not coordinated in conclusion the downward longwave radiation of ceres is used as a reference field without adjustment note that in the second adjustment step both the downward shortwave and longwave radiations are adjusted by a globally uniform time invariant factor that closes the surface heat flux budget section 5 appendix f comparison of marine meteorological variables with buoy data comparison of air temperature specific humidity and wind speed with buoy observations are presented in figs 42 47 for core jra55 raw and jra55 do it is acknowledged that the buoy stations presented here do not represent the full array it is hoped that more regionally focussed comparison studies by interested users will complement the present incomplete evaluation as the dataset is widely distributed we understand the following features from the bias maps the general cold bias of air temperature of jra55 raw is corrected successfully in jra55 do fig 42 the specific humidity of jra55 do has smaller bias than jra55 raw and core in the middle and high latitudes but it is lower than buoys in the tropics fig 44 recalling that the specific humidity of jra55 raw was adjusted toward an ensemble of reanalyses in jra55 do the majority of reanalysis products have a low humidity bias in the tropics the wind speed of core is generally higher than buoys fig 46 as discussed in the main text this is because the actual wind speed of ncep r1 was directly adjusted toward the equivalent neutral wind of quikscat in core from the scatter diagrams and the statistical values figs 43 45 and 47 we understand that jra55 do gives the smallest root mean square errors and the highest correlation coefficients relative to buoys for all variables the mean bias of jra55 do is smallest for the air temperature and the wind speed the mean bias of the specific humidity of jra55 do is smaller than that of jra55 raw but it is larger than that of core this is due to the low bias of the specific humidity of jra55 do in the tropics as shown in the bias map fig 44 appendix g atlas of surface flux distribution g1 heat flux figs 48 fig 52 give the global map of the mean 1988 2007 total surface heat flux and components of jra55 do as well as the difference from those of core the total surface heat flux into the ocean of jra55 do tends to be smaller in the tropics and larger in mid latitudes specifically in the north atlantic than that of core this feature is dominated by the latent heat flux fig 51 the differences of shortwave and longwave radiation flux from core figs 49 and 50 respectively are oppositely signed in the high latitudes reflecting the compensatory natures of shortwave and longwave radiations in the radiative transfer models in the tropics only the shortwave radiation of ceres was reduced before it was used as the reference data to adjust the shortwave radiation of jra55 raw based on the comparison with buoy observations appendix e and fig 13b the wavy structures with 5 10 wave lengths in the difference of the sensible heat flux the lower panel of fig 52 are due to those of the air temperature field of core which are traceable to ncep r1 g2 fresh water flux figs 53 fig 55 give the global map of the mean 1988 2007 precipitation minus evaporation evaporation and precipitation of jra55 do as well as the difference from those of core the difference of precipitation minus evaporation of jra55 do relative to core tends to be negative fresh water leaving the ocean in the tropics and positive in mid latitudes specifically in the north atlantic this feature is dominated by the evaporation fig 54 because we applied an approximate enhancement of 2 1 to the precipitation in the final adjustment to impose an exact closure section 5 the precipitation of jra55 do is slightly larger than that of core in most regions g3 wind stress figs 56 and 57 give the global map of the mean 1988 2007 surface zonal and meridional wind stress of jra55 do as well as the difference from those of core the wind stress of jra55 do is weaker than core this is because the equivalent neutral wind from quikscat was directly used to adjust the actual ncep r1 wind to produce core fig 58 gives the mean nov 1999 oct 2009 wind stress curl of jra55 do and scatterometer oceanic wind stress product scow of risien and chelton 2008 jra55 do reproduces scow well implying that the adjustment on the wind direction was successful at least in the offshore regions a more dedicated assessment of the features around the coastal regions is presented in the companion paper taboada et al 2018 
24091,we propose a time dependent eulerian model for sea surface entrainment buoyancy transport and droplet dynamics of ocean oil the model captures the microscale vertical oil mass exchanges in the neighborhood of the sea surface this model is in turn part of an oil fate model designed to capture oil dynamics at large spatio temporal scales typical of environmental studies the adiabatic dynamics of the droplets are upscaled by a combination of filtering and stochastic parametrization the upscaling addresses the computational burden of resolving the microscale the upscaled droplet dynamics are tested against data and the mass exchange mechanism is incorporated into a nearshore oil transport model in order to highlight the importance of incorporating vertical mass exchanges and droplet distribution dynamics in predicting the distributing of shoaling oil keywords oil spill oil fate model oil entrainment ocean oil transport ocean pollution 1 introduction there are many ocean oil spill models for reviews see the asce task committee on modeling of oil spills of the water resources engineering division 1996 report and the transportation research board and national research council 2003 report the latter of these reports has a good summary of the fundamental processes affecting oil spill dynamics in the ocean own oscar from sintef and simap oilmap from applied science associates are examples of commercial oil fate models owm see daling and strom 1999 is an oil weathering model these packages include an oil fate model along with a comprehensive suite of ancillary diagnostic design modules useful in impact and planning assessments their oil transport models aim to be fairly comprehensive with regard to the inclusion of the many and sometimes complex mechanisms that alter the fate of oil in the ocean among non commercial packages we could mention adios see lehr et al 1992 lehr et al 2002 and gnome see zelenke et al 2012 the noaa office of response and restoration model along with medslik see dominicis et al 2013 is the european consortium model and one of several european mediterranean model for surface oil spills there are also a variety of oil plume models that are meant to capture blowouts and oil seeping from the ocean bottom for example voils described in azevedo et al 2014 and vdrop zhao et al 2014 most oil spill models are lagrangian lagrangian oil fate models see for example lonin 1999 are essentially parcel advection diffusion schemes with added complex phenomenology many of these lagrangian models import the wind and ocean velocity fields from separate ocean and wind circulation models eulerian models similar to the one we are developing are less common examples of eulerian models are formulated in tkalich and chan 2002 see also tkalich and chan 2006 as well as in wang and shen 2010 eulerian models are thought to be computationally less efficient see yapa et al 1999 and this case may be made about some of them an advantage of an eulerian transport model is that if properly designed will be easily incorporated into an ocean circulation model further if the circulation model has an optimized high performance advection diffusion solver sophisticated grid generation capabilities and time marching schemes these can be used to great advantage in the efficient implementation and maintenance of the transport model module compatibility in the boundary conditions and fluxes in the transport and the ocean circulation models are other important advantage presumably improvements in the eulerian mixing and dispersion parameterizations in the ocean circulation can be exploited as well in improving the dynamics of the transport model the oil fate model we introduced in restrepo et al 2015 is eulerian and is designed to be a tool in environmental work and thus is designed to capture oil spills at very large spatio temporal scales in basins with very complex geometries and flows efficiency is paramount time spans from hundreds of seconds to seasons and spatial scales spanning hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers to reach these large spatio temporal scales we have opted to pose the model in terms of depth averaged equations a consequence of depth averaging is that the model will not capture the depth dependence of the distribution of oil the oil transport model is a shallow water model which means that it applies on problems where the variability of oil in the horizontal direction is much larger than the variability in the vertical direction this does not imply that we ignore vertical variations in distribution of the oil within the water column that significantly affect the overall transport in transverse directions it also makes no special requirements from the ocean code with regard to whether it resolves ocean vertical dynamics or not a depth averaged model for oil dynamics makes geophysical sense in shallow waters specifically in the shallow reaches of the continental shelf and large shallow lakes examples are the shelf areas near the gulf coast states and the east coast of the united states the shelf is close to many major cities and sensitive habitats the shelf zone has complicated shipping traffic and a fair share of operational and dormant oil wells hence the shelf is a zone of major environmental concern these shallow oceanic regions have complex topographically dependent flows complex coasts and river deltas these conditions place enormous modeling challenges on sub mesoscale ocean dynamics and small scale winds and coastal hydrodynamics in many of these nearshore regions upwelling is critical and thus the vertical dependence has to be explicit or carefully accounted for in the depth averaging of the ocean flow simulations not withstanding that we are going to ignore much of the vertical structure of the oil field in restrepo et al 2015 the general design of the oil fate model is laid out in that same work the fundamentals of transverse oil advection and dispersion were worked out as is the effect of the presence of oil on the dynamics of the ocean wave field there are well known challenges in developing a comprehensive oil model and its computational platform of the type we envision reaching the large spatio temporal scales required by an environmental oil transport model will require a very large number of degrees of freedom and by extension of computational resources in order to control the computational complexity of the resulting simulation platform it is necessary to design aspects of the physics and the computation simultaneously thus allowing coupling of numerical resolutions and the physics in a consistent and efficient manner the transport model we are building uses specialization to the shallow reaches of the continental shelf where depth averaging and adiabatic assumptions apply in order to reach high resolutions over large spatio temporal expanses a focus on the shallow reaches of the continental shelf requires coupling oil transport to nearshore dynamics ocean dynamics at the submesoscale see romero et al 2013 uchiyama et al 2014 romero et al 2016 as well as wind weather fields and wave dynamics the latter to capture wave induced transport and dispersion see mcwilliams et al 1997 mcwilliams et al 2004 restrepo et al 2011 and the former to generate the stresses on the ocean surface as well as on oil exposed to air coupling to a weather model would provide the requisite fields for an oil transport model that includes chemodynamics the chemical composition of the oil as a function of space and time is important in a variety of environmental problems see thibodeaux 1996 a model with the capacity to model chemodynamics would enable engineers the simulation capabilities to investigate weathering and dispersal via chemical means see li 2009 delvigne and sweeney 1988 and belore et al 2009 and references contained in these for how dispersants affect oil a long range goal of the modeling effort is thus to incorporate a comprehensive chemodynamics capability some chemical process such as bio degradation sedimentation and photolysis are already accounted for in mature oil models see lehr 2001 daling et al 2014 and the documentation of adios gnome won simap bio degradation involves both the live population as well as the dead populations of many organisms see loh et al 2014 chemodynamics would give an oil fate model the capability of making these processes reactive and dynamic chemistry also plays a role at microscopic scales in the surface tension buoyancy viscosity of oil droplets changes in these in turn affect the oil droplet mechanics oil is a composite compound consisting of hundreds if not thousands chemicals see thibodeaux 1996 hammam et al 1988 tracking these reacting chemicals adds significant complexity to the oil fate model moreover the chemodynamics component adds a considerable computational burden to the resulting discretized oil fate model without some form of dimension reduction strategy the addition of chemodynamics can easily lead to an impractical oil transport model aggregation strategies such as those used in combustion chemistry may prove helpful here see maas and pope 1992 and references contained therein see also daling et al 2014 for an application of such strategies to oil spill models aggregation produces chemical complexes whose chemodynamics are seldom a linear superposition of their individual reactions in venkataramani et al 2017 we developed a data driven dimension reduction strategy that addresses non standard behavior of chemical complexes the strategy exploits takens embedding in order to capture the memory terms that arise from the interaction of short time and long time dynamics unlike other strategies our dimension reduction strategy leads to a reduction of computational degrees of freedom while at the same time reducing the inherent stiffness of the chemical complexes because it reduces the disparity of time scales thermodynamics and energy conservation enter chemical dynamics processes and can affect mass conservation as well mass conservation is a non trivial and basic requirement in oil reservoir simulations particularly in chemically reacting flows chen 2007 it is a complex problem in ocean oils examples include sedimentation rates see loebing 2015 and the fact that oil gas near the sea surface can exist in liquid forms at depth and thus subjected to different dissolution dynamics see aman et al 2015 sokolofsky et al 2011 notwithstanding our interest in the macroscopic dynamics of the oil the microscopic realm cannot be ignored see reed et al 2009 the vertical transport is affected by droplet merging and splitting merging and splitting is also affected by surface tension and viscosity which are thus dependent on the chemical dynamics the mechanics of buoyancy droplet dynamics and turbulent processes near the ocean surface play important roles in the oil mass fluxes this study addresses the modeling challenges of the last item on this list which we collectively call the mass exchange dynamics specifically we want to formulate an upscaled dynamic model that captures oil entrainment by waves the droplet merging splitting dynamics and stokes force balances buoyancy and drag of distributions of droplets the mass exchange refers to capturing the exchanges of oil between the surface and subsurface components of the oil fate model we will not account for chemistry at this stage most models for oil transport take into account oil mass exchanges between surface and the subsurface the sintef products see reed et al 2009 for example will use a combination of empirically derived and mechanical models based mainly on equilibrium conditions for this exchange we will include mechanics of droplet merging and splitting along the lines proposed in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 the micromechanics of buoyancy drag and of surface mixing due to wave breaking extend the model suggested in tkalich and chan 2002 to include a parametrization of wave breaking based on results found in restrepo et al 2011 hereon tkalich and chan 2002 will be dennoted as tc using upscaling filtering the resulting non stationary model will approximately capture micromechanics without resolving these it can thus be incorporated into an eulerian oil transport model such as the one proposed in restrepo et al 2015 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly summarize the shallow water oil model and identify where the mass exchange term appears in the transport equation the full details on the advection and diffusion dispersion in the transport equations can be found in restrepo et al 2015 the mass exchange mechanism between surface and subsurface oil is proposed in section 3 as well as the evolution of the droplet size distribution and merging splitting dynamics the upscaling strategy of the vertical oil exchanges is described in section 4 in section 5 we compare the reduced dimension droplet distribution model to data and by extension to another droplet model in restrepo et al 2014 we proposed a model for the slowing down and possibly parking of buoyant pollutants and tracers in oceanic regions adjacent and offshore of the break zone the term nearshore sticky waters is used to describe the conditions that lead to slowing parking of incoming pollutants the stickiness is a result of the advective and dispersive conditions near the break zone and the conditions whereby the effective transport velocity decreases or goes to zero away from the shore depends in turn on the vertical distribution of the buoyant pollutant in restrepo et al 2014 we prescribed the vertical distribution in section 5 of this study we revisit the nearshore sticky water problem and replace a prescribed vertical distribution by one given dynamically by the mass exchange model developed here we confirm that sticky water conditions are still possible and show how the droplet distribution has a bearing on how the transport unfolds in section 6 we summarize the model and its features 2 the shallow water oil fate model the framework of the oil fate model appears in restrepo et al 2015 the general transport model is formulated for a surface slick layer s in units of length that represents the effective thickness of surface oil and a subsurface component of oil described by a concentration field c in units of density times volume over volume there may be hundreds to thousands of chemicals in a any sample of oil and each oil spill may have different chemical composition we take this into account and describe the slick as a composite of homogeneous sub slicks each of thickness si hence 1 s x t i 1 n s i x t where n is the total number of chemical complexes the total oil slick mass is then given by 2 m s t ω t i 1 n s i x t ρ i d x where x is the transverse coordinate ωt is the possibly time dependent oceanic domain or area of interest time is denoted by t and is understood as associated with the time scales in which advection diffusion dissipation takes place as opposed to the shorter time scales of the micromechanics the densities of each chemical complex are denoted by the ρi for the ith chemical complex the transport equation is 3 s i t c x s v s i τ 2 μ i s i 2 ψ s i r i e i s s i p i s g i s here is the transverse gradient operator v are the x components of the transport velocity cxs is a slip parameter τ is the wind stress μi the viscosity of the ith oil species the last term on the left hand side is the eddy dispersion term with ψ denoting its rate tensor its symmetric component is associated with diffusion and the antisymmetric part with advection ri is the rate associated with mass exchanges between the oil slick and the interior of the ocean and is the focus of this study the reaction term e i s b i s i s j encompasses chemical reactions among chemical complexes within the slick as well as other processes modeled by rates such as evaporation p i s is the rate of biodegradation emulsification photodegradation and g i s is the source rate term unlike ri the terms with s superscript are particular to the surface oil the total mass of the oil in the sub surface is defined as 4 m c ω t h η i 1 n c i x z t d z d x where ci is the concentration of the ith chemical complex in the sub surface layer in units of m l3 we define the depth averaged subsurface concentration of the ith complex as 5 c i x t 1 h x h η t c i x z t d z where h is the total water column depth note that the product hci has units of m l2 and its evolution is given by 6 h c i t h v c i h ψ c i ρ i r i ρ i e i c c i p i c g i c on the right hand side the first term is the mass exchange term ρiri the reaction chemistry term is e i c p i c represents the sedimentation and biodegradation mechanisms the subsurface source term is g i c this paper concerns itself with developing a model for ri which is related to the mass exchange term and it has units of l t 3 the mass exchange model the term r represents oil gained by the slick from the subsurface by buoyancy and lost by mixing and wave breaking for an alternative model see reed et al 2009 because buoyancy forces depend on the radius of the droplets it is necessary to keep track of the droplet distribution in the subsurface which in turn requires that droplet merging and splitting be incorporated in the dynamics the consequence of this is that micromechanics need to be resolved or they must be upscaled if the scales of interest are far larger than the droplet coherence scale here as in restrepo et al 2015 we develop the rationale for an upscaled version of the mass exchange process to environmental spatio temporal scales 3 1 slick subsurface oil exchanges focusing on the ith chemical species and making use of ms and mc from 2 and 4 respectively gives the total mass per unit area of oil at a fixed transverse location x and time t as 7 m i x t h x c i x t ρ i s i x t 8 h η t c i x z t d z ρ i s i x t h η t 0 ρ i v r n i x z r t d r d z ρ i s i x t the last term in 8 represents the slick contribution the first term on the right of 8 represents the submerged oil in terms of droplets of radii r and volume v r 4 3 π r 3 and their space time varying distribution ni x z r t the dynamics model for ni will be developed in section 3 3 ni x z r t dr gives the number of droplets of radii in r r d r per unit volume of water and at depth z hence ni has units of l 4 in order to describe the dynamics of the submerged portion of the ith chemical complex ci and hci in 5 and 6 one must account for the fraction occupied by such chemical complex within each of the submerged droplets consider the total mass of such chemical stored in droplets submerged in the volume of water d x dz there are ni d x dz dr of them with radii in r r d r and we may assume that the jth droplet contains a random fraction f i j of the ith chemical within it we hence approximate 9 c i d x d z e 0 ρ i v r j 1 n d x d z d r f i j z r 0 ρ i v r f i z r n x z r t d r d x d z with f i r z denoting the average fraction of chemical i contained in droplets of radius r submerged at depth z the total amount of chemical complex i per unit area in the water column can therefore be written as 10 m i x t h η t 0 ρ i v r n x z r t f i z r d r d z ρ i s i x t if we ignore the dispersion wind forcing reaction chemistry sedimentation biodegradation and subsurface sources the total derivatives of mi in 7 and mi given by 10 must be consistent therefore 11 h c i t v h c i ρ i r i ρ i s i t v s i r i where ri is the exchange term see 3 and 6 and may be conveniently decomposed as 12 r i r i r i 0 v r w b r n i x η r t d r s i x t b x t the component r i is the rate of oil gained by the slick in units of length time coming from the subsurface by means of buoyancy with wb 0 denoting the upwards velocity of the buoyant droplets oil which is here supposed to depend only on their radius as any effects of internal droplet composition have been averaged out the second term r i s i b is the rate of oil lost from the slick due to wave breaking and will be described in section 3 2 below also see tc for an alternative derivation disregarding all processes of chemical degradation and exchange the quantities hci and si satisfy an equation identical to 11 but involving the corresponding mass exchange rate ri which may also be decomposed as r i r i r i where 13 r i 0 v r w b r f i r η n x η r t d r 3 2 the wave breaking term r i wave breaking occurs within the location x and x d x at a rate of λb events per unit time each having a strength that may be characterized in terms of the wave slope ka where k is the wavenumber and a is the wave amplitude of the breaking wave see restrepo et al 2011 for the time scales of interest a wave breaking event occurring at time tk can be regarded as an instantaneous transport event in which a fraction bk of the available volume s x tk d x is injected and distributed into the water column let δ t k t denote the delta function at time tk namely δ t k t 1 d t for t t k t k d t and zero everywhere else the breaking inputs can then be written in terms of a compound poisson nb process of rate λb yielding the following expression for b in 12 14 b x t i 1 n b t b k δ t k t we will refer to the unitless bk as the strength of the kth wave breaking event note that the units of b are 1 t droplets created from the available volume s x t b x t d x are the source term for the equation describing the dynamics of n which is derived in section 3 3 below hence we now decompose sb into the appropriate distributions of radii and depths according to delvigne and sweeny 1988 if a unit of oil per unit area is available to be distributed into droplets the number of droplets per unit volume of oil and of radius in r r d r will be n r dr with 15 n r 3 4 s 4 π r m 4 s r 1 4 s r s r r 1 r m s 3 zero otherwise which is such that 0 v r n r d r 1 the units of n are l 4 the empirical parameter s is frequently quoted as taking the value of 2 3 see tc the resulting droplets are distributed along the water column according to a function gb z which we assume does not depend on anything besides z and satisfies 16 0 g b z d z 1 the distribution of droplet sizes 15 proposed by delvigne and sweeny is not universally accepted for example reed et al 2009 propose a log normal fit to droplet distributions instead based upon laboratory data see mitzenmacher 2003 for a discussion on the challenges associated with fitting certain types of data to log normal and power law distributions the density of available droplets of radius r at depth z per unit area is denoted 17 s b x z r t n r g b z b x t s x t which has units of t 1 l 4 and by virtue of 1 15 and 16 satisfies 18 h η 0 v r s b x z r t d r d z b x t s x t r as for the mass transport r i of the ith chemical from the slick into the water column we assume that wave breaking acts indiscriminately on the composite slick and that the following balance holds 19 r i s i s r 3 3 subsurface droplet distribution dynamics we must now specify a dynamic model for the droplets in the subsurface that includes sb in 17 as a source term in accordance with the oil model restrepo et al 2015 droplets are assumed to undergo a linear vertical advection diffusion process furthermore the time scales at which the vertical distribution of oil sorts itself out given fast disturbances at the sea surface are assumed to be very short compared to the horizontal advection scales the shallow water wave approximation we denote the vertical turbulent diffusivity by dz r 10 2 10 3 m s 2 which can be parametrized in terms of the turbulent description of the flow while wb r 10 6 10 3 1 is the limiting velocity of a oil droplet moving through water the values ranges for dz and wb are taken from tc eq 13 in what follows we focus on vertical balances an adiabatic approximation in which for given radius r depth z and time t two flux sources affect n x z r t the droplets that are entrapped from the surface into depth z after a wave breaking event and changes on the distribution of radii due to merging and splitting of droplets putting all together gives 20 n t d z r 2 n z 2 w x z t w b r n z s b k n furthermore the background vertical velocity satisfies w wb r and will hence be ignored the operator k encodes the effect of merging and splitting of droplets this operator is discussed in detail in section 4 1 but for now it suffices to remark that it should be conservative namely 21 0 k n r dr 0 at the surface z η t we assume that there is no diffusive flux as the slick is saturated while all incoming droplets from the upward effect of buoyancy are added to s and removed from the concentration n the boundary condition at the subsurface slick interface is simply 22 n z t η r 0 t 0 r 0 at z h we allow for sedimentation which we ignore for now in what follows we fix x which we omit in the subsequent notation and solve for the amount of oil in the slick and subsurface droplets occupying the one dimensional moving water column h η t ignoring as well horizontal advection dispersion specifically we solve 23 n t d z r 2 n z 2 w b r n z s b z r t k n 24 s t 0 v r w b r n r x η t d r s t b t the first term on the right hand side of 23 represents effectively stochastic diffusion in the z direction and could be equivalently written in terms of stochastic wiener process for the movement of individual droplets the solution to 23 is 25 n r z t 0 t h η t g r z z t t k n s b r z t d z d t k 0 n b t h η t i g b z g r z z t t i d z n r s t k b k 0 t h η t g r z z t t k n z t r d z d t where we have made the convenient choice for the initial condition 26 n 0 z r 1 ρ h c 0 n r g b z and set t 0 0 b 0 1 ρ h c 0 s 0 the function g in 25 is the green s function associated with the parabolic eq 20 of n which may be approximated with the green s function corresponding to the operator w b z d z z 2 on η with boundary condition 22 that is to say 27 g r z z t 1 2 π t d z exp z z 2 4 t d z exp

exchange and its impact on the slick and subsurface oil supposing k 0 the following simple backwards difference scheme is used for the approximate solution of s s t s t δ t δ t r t 1 δ t b t where the mass transport into the slick can be written as r t i 0 n b t s t i b i δ t i t 0 v r w b r n r 0 g b z g t t i z 0 r d z d r for this illustrative example we use the parametrization of w r and d r suggested by tc w r 2 g 1 ρ ρ w 9 ν w r 2 d r d 0 d 0 d m r r m with ρ 800 kg m 3 d 0 10 2 m s 1 d m 10 3 1 r 1 10 6 m r m 10 4 m 1 100 µm respectively the rate of breaking was set as λ b 10 3 1 and the fraction of entrapped oil randomly distributed as b i uniform 0 10 1 after a breaking event the entrapped volume is distributed exponentially over the depth so 95 of it is above z m 1 m g b z κ e κ z with κ 3 m 1 fig 1 a describes the evolution of the fraction of slick and subsurface oil as a function of time the breaking events are clearly evident in the curves the upper curve in fig 1a is the total mass the middle is the normalized subsurface concentration and the lower curve the surface oil depth in fig 1b we plot the fraction of volume of entrained oil as a function of radii for several times see 28 for the definition of n the dashed curve is the original distribution the distribution shifts toward the smaller radii with time non dimensional quantities are computed with respect to the reference values dm zm t d m z m 2 t w b z m d m w b d d d m λ b z m 2 d m λ b 4 upscaled dynamics when the oil spill is young or the sea state is rough droplet distributions change quickly due to merging and splitting further it is often assumed that droplets in the subsurface smaller than a critical radius will remain in the subsurface see tc and references contained therein for the basis for such an assumption see also reed et al 2009 the critical radius for ocean oil is quoted in tc as r c 50 μ m for computational reasons it is convenient to bin droplet sizes for each chemical complex and formulate the subsurface oil transport in terms of a finite discrete set of droplet classes at the same time we incorporate depth averaging and pose the dynamics of subsurface droplets in terms of fluxes into and out of the depth averaged horizontal computational cells due to advection dispersion interactions with the slick via buoyancy and wave mixing and finally via changes to droplet class distributions within each cell we now use 23 24 to obtain a set of equations for the number of total droplets per unit area of ocean in prescribed radii classes namely let r 1 r 2 rm be a subdivision of radii of interest into m classes and δ r r j 1 r j we are interested in the evolution of 28 n j x t h η r j r j 1 n x z r t d r d z invoking 25 it can be written as omitting the x dependence 29 n j t k 0 n b t g j t t k s t k b k r j r j 1 0 t h η t h η t g r z z t t k n z t r d z dz d t dr where 30 g j t r j r j 1 h η t h η t g r z z t g b z n r d z d z d r we would like to derive an expression for the dynamics of merging and splitting of droplets that is independent of z and hence arrive to an approximate version of 29 in terms of solely n j we may assume that the merging and breaking processes occur at time scales much shorter than those of t in particular during an interval dt the change in the distribution of radii is 31 n r z t d t n r z t k n z t dt out of these added droplets the following amount is then transported to depth z 32 h η t g r z z t t k n z t r dt dz we approximate the second integral in 29 by commuting these mechanisms thus obtaining 33 0 t h η t h η t g r z z t t k n z t d z dz d t 0 t k h η t h η t g z z t t n z t d z dz d t which essentially disregards the depth wise structure of n when it comes to the merging and splitting mechanism note that for every r u r z t t h η t g r z z t t n r z t d z is a solution to the problem t u w b z u d z z 2 u on η t t with boundary conditions u z η t 0 and initial condition u r z t t n z r t the depth integral of u satisfies t h η t u r z t t d z w b u r η t t w b h h η t u r z t t d z for t t namely h η t u r z t t d z h η t n r z t d z e w b h t t the integral in the last expression is the depth integrated size distribution of droplets 34 n r t h η t n r z t d z eq 29 therefore simplifies and we approximately obtain an equation in terms of only depth averaged size

of the ith chemical we take another average over the fraction of chemical fi contained in each droplet let 36 f i j 1 h h η f i r j z d z using 5 and 9 and the approximations v r v rj and f i z r f i z r j for r r j r j 1 and f i z r j f i j we obtain 37 c i 1 h j 1 m ρ i v r j n j f i j in arriving at 37 we also used the approximation f i r j η n r j x η t f i r j η n j by integrating of 24 and focusing attention on the ith complex we arrive at the following corresponding upscaled equation for the slick oil 38 s i t j 1 m v r j w b r j h f i r j η n j k 0 n b t s i t k b k δ t k t the chemistry dynamics equations are necessary to determine the ultimate relation between f i r j η at the surface and the depth integrated f i j the chemodynamics is an aspect of the shallow water oil transport model that is yet to be developed 4 1 subsurface oil droplet merging and coalescence we will focus now on the droplet merging splitting mechanism captured by the operator k we consider the situation for a subsurface cell at position x in what follows we dispense tagging the variables with their chemical species and ignore other mechanisms that affect the distribution of droplets in a compartment or cell the total number of droplets of size class in v r v r d r occupying the volume of water under d x is n defined in 35 which changes due to breaking and merging as 39 k n b v d v where dv bv are death and birth rates that approximate the smoluchowsky operator k the death dv and birth bv terms in turn are defined as 40 d v n v t 0 λ v v h v v n v t d v g v n v t 41 b v 0 v 2 λ v v v h v v v n v v t n v t d v 42 v β v v ν v g v n v t d v where v v r v v r in the above expressions λ v v is the coalescence efficiency for collisions between droplets of classes v and v h v v is the frequency of droplets of class v colliding with droplets of class v g v is the breakage frequency of droplets of class v ν v represents the number of droplets formed by the splitting of droplets of class v and β v v is the probability of forming droplets of class v from splitting of droplets of class v to first order it can be assumed that only binary collisions occur and thus ν v 2 once the droplet distribution is binned assuming the total number of bins m is even the h d j t d v r j and h b j t b v r j are 43 h d j n j t l 1 m λ r j r l h r j r l n l t g r j n j t 44 h b j l 1 m 2 λ r j

surface and internal forces in the droplet see liao and lucas 2009 specific breakup mechanisms are droplet elongation in sheared flow turbulent pressure fluctuations relative velocity fluctuations and droplet eddy collisions the large eddies will advect droplets but those turbulent eddies that are comparable in size or smaller will exert a shear when they interact with a droplet of oil the breakup frequency f assuming droplet eddy collisions in isotropic turbulence conditions droplet sizes in the inertial sub range and droplet breakup due solely by eddy droplet collisions with smaller or the comparably sized eddies is defined in terms of the droplet radius r as f r k b h r b e kb is a system dependent parameter that needs to be calibrated see zhao et al 2014 the eddy droplet collision frequency h is defined as 45 h r n e m s e d u e 2 u r 2 1 2 n d n e where s e d π r e r 2 is the collision cross section area re is the size of eddies which collide with a droplet of radius r dne is number of eddies of size between re and r e d r e an estimate of the velocity square of the eddy is obtained from u e 2 3 8 ϵ k 2 3 here ϵ is the kinetic energy dissipation rate k π r e is wavenumber and u r 2 1 7 ϵ r 2 3 is the droplet velocity the estimated number of eddies per unit volume of the fluid is found from d n e m k 3 10 3 k 2 d k see azbel 1981 the breakup efficiency be is the probability of breakup if a drop eddy collision takes place b e exp e c e v c 1 e where ec is the mean excess energy required for breakage into two equal size drops and a small and a big daughter drop and ev is the viscous and surface tension energy associated with internal forces see zhao et al 2014and calabrese et al 1986 the minimum energy for droplet breakup is related to the amount of required energy to keep the surface of a droplet intact in binary splitting e c 2 2 π σ d r 2 1 3 2 π σ d r max 2 π σ d r min 2 2 π σ d r 2 where e 1 2 m u e 2 2 3 π ρ w r e 3 u e 2 r min r 1 r max r m and σd is the droplet surface tension see zhao et al 2014 the energy associated with internal forces is 46 e v 1 a exp t t t o t π 6 ϵ 1 3 2 r 7 3 μ d ρ w ρ where ρw is the fluid density ρ is the density of the particular chemical complex oil density ttot is interaction simulation time one time step of fluid oil interaction and μd is the oil species viscosity the constant a 1 1 is a calibration constant see zhao et al 2014 eq 15 in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 it is argued that assuming binary breakage recall it was assumed that ν v is 2 the amount of energy required for the generation of two like sized droplets is larger than what is required to produce one small and one big droplets they suggested the breakup distribution of a drop of class size v from a parent drop of class size v is given by 47 β r r e min e max e r 0 r e min e max e r d r where e r 4 π σ r 3 r 3 2 3 r 2 r 2 4 1 2 parametrizing coalescence mechanics the merging process in which two or more colliding droplets form a bigger droplet is called coalescence the coalescence of droplets normally evolves in three stages 1 collision 2 interfacial drainage of liquid at touching interfaces and 3 the rupture of the droplet surface in this study we assume that background turbulence is the main cause for droplet collisions the volume absorbed by a moving droplet when colliding with other droplets is the basis for calculating the collision frequency the swept volume rate h v v is modeled following the kinetic gas theory assuming both droplets moving with turbulent eddies with relative velocity of c a collision tube with cross section of π r r 2 is swept therefore the h v v could be defined as h v v π r r 2 c assuming isotropic turbulence it is reported in kuboi et al 1972 that the relative colliding velocity in stirred and pipe flows was well estimated as c 2 2 ϵ 2 3 r r 2 3 in this work uniform turbulence assumptions are used see kolmogorov 1941 assuming this is correct the swept volume rate for droplets v and v then reads h v v π 4 5 657 ϵ 1 3 r r 7 3 the droplets need to stay in contact for a certain time to complete the coalescence process turbulence promotes collisions however it can also move the droplets away from each other before the coalescence process takes place therefore the collision efficiency is defined as the ratio between the average drainage time t and average contact time τ λ v v exp t τ see prince and blanch 1990 the drainage time of the thin interface between two droplets depends on the viscosities of each droplet and the main phase could be different for air bubbles in comparison with oil droplets as a result we need to be more careful about implementation of this parameter the average drainage time for fully mobile interfaces is given by prince and blanch 1990 eq 18 t r e q 3 ρ l 16 σ d 1 2 ln h 0 h c where ρl is the density of the continuous phase σd is the surface tension and h 0 is the initial film thickness the critical film thickness hc as estimated in chesters 1991 is h c a r e q 8 π σ d where a is the hamaker constant and req is the equivalent droplet radius given by r e q 2 1 r 1 r where r and r are the radii of the colliding droplets the average contact time τ is given by see levich 1962 τ 2 2 3 r r 2 3 ϵ 1 3 4 2 the complete depth averaged model we now summarize the physical computational shallow water oil fate model in what follows we will omit the chemical complex identifier of the droplet distribution consider a cell at position x and suppose that s x t c x t and n j x t j 1 m are known we use the following split step strategy to advance into t δ t 1 first the mass exchanges is computed with s x t and 38 to obtain s s x t 1 2 δ t for the subsurface knowing n t for t t we produce the update n j via 35 which includes the merging splitting dynamics the update for the submerged oil concentration c is computed by using n j in 37 2 to step to t δ t we use s and c to advance on 3 and 6 with r 0 it has already been taken into account in the half step 3 finally the aggregated subsurface concentration c x t δ t is used to adjust the droplet distribution budget from the split step as follows 48 n j x t δ t c x t δ t n j c x t 1 2 δ t there is no expectation that droplets will retain their chemical complex composition over time and this issue is itself a very challenging modeling problem well outside the scope of this study nevertheless we can suggest how this challenge will be tackled our goal is to deliver a chemical description of oil at the kilometer scales or greater and thus we will be upscaling the chemodynamics equations as well as applying dimension reduction strategies so that a smaller number of chemical complexes are tracked in space and time than the full complement of oil constituents these chemical complexes are not expected to retain the dynamics of the oil constituents most critically the chemical complexes will have memory terms that cannot be ignored as reported and tested in venkataramani et al 2017 our dimension reduction strategy based upon embedding can capture memory effects over time scales closer to the macroscopic scales than the chemical scales the depth averaged algorithm presented above will need to be modified once chemodynamics are incorporated into the oil fate model 4 3 computational complexity of the shallow water oil fate model depth averaging clearly produces computational efficiencies when compared to the non depth averaged case it does so at the expense of loosing depth information of the oil however the oil fate model is being designed for use in shallow waters for the computation of oil spills over very large transverse scales and over significant time spans it is thus suggested that a model with these characteristics will still be of great practical utility even if it is unable to resolve the vertical distribution of oil in these waters in this study we develop a model that brings in critical oil dynamics that would be missed if all inherently vertically distributed processes would be ignored in the oil fate model and these are mostly processes that bring their own challenge of coupling the micro and macroscales we tackle directly the challenges posed by coupling of the microscale and macroscale by proposing a mass exchange model that upscales the microscale at the expense of fidelity the use of upscaling and adiabatic assumptions in the mass exchange mechanics proposed in this study approximates critical microscale dynamics and balances without requiring resolving these as a result there is no significant increase in computational overhead to appreciate the computational efficiency of the oil fate model we first compute the computational complexity of the oil model in three space dimensions and time and without making use of upscaling we will also assume that the computations are explicit in time since present codes are mostly designed that way to take advantage of shared distributed memory computing machines if the computation uses nx spatial degrees of freedom and runs for nt time steps the computational complexity is o p n x 3 q n t the factor p 3 q represents the overhead multiplier if the microscale is to be resolved in addition we have a multiplicative factor of o i j where i is the number of droplet size classes and j is the number of chemicals to appreciate the magnitude of the computational complexity let us assume that the macroscale is to be resolved over kilometers and the microscale to centimeters p would be about 104 and q would be comparable an optimistic estimate due to numerical stability constraints the size classes i would be of order 101 j of order 10 2 10 3 the complexity of the shallow water oil model is o n x 2 n t for the space time discretization the size classes i would be of order 101 j could be reduced to order of 101 if the dimension reduction strategy in venkataramani et al 2017 as applied to the chemodynamics equations delivers acceptable outcomes 5 results we present three calculations in section 5 1 we focus on simulations that illustrate the complexity of the dynamics of buoyancy and wave breaking balances the focus of the calculations in section 5 2 will be on demonstrating by comparison to data that the considerably simpler birth death model for droplet distribution dynamics proposed here is consistent with the more complex model of tsouris and tavlarides tsouris and tavlarides 1994 in section 5 3 we incorporate the mass exchange mechanism developed here into a simplified version of the shallow water oil transport model of restrepo et al 2015 to explore a nearshore oil pollution problem the problem in question is called the nearshore sticky water conditions see restrepo et al 2014 in the calculations that follow we connote by stack a single vertical column of the computational domain of ocean a stack is composed of a surface compartment and a subsurface compartment directly below the surface compartment corresponds to the slick the subsurface compartment has oil and water 5 1 mass exchanges in a single stack eqs 35 and 38 were implemented on a single stack the oil can only rise and sink within the stack and thus can only be present in the surface or sub surface compartments for this case the size classes were chosen using r 1 25 10 6 m and r m 217 10 6 m 25 and 317 µm respectively there were 17 different size classes we simulated one hour of random wave breaking with 14 setting λ b 1 6 t w tw being the wave period see restrepo et al 2011 λb is the intensity parameter of the poisson process the wave amplitude was 1m we initialized oil in the surface and in the subsurface boxes with equal volumes fig 2 shows four cases corresponding to different probability distributions for the breaking strength bi all cases show a very fast transient adjustment followed by a slower evolution largely dominated by buoyancy forces for small bi and wave breaking large bi in the large wave breaking regime the oil is mostly relegated to the subsurface clearly the results differ from any steady state concerning oil distributions on the surface and the subsurface a more detailed view of the overall distribution of the subsurface oil appears in fig 3 the distributions are plotted as equivalent thicknesses of each size class corresponding to the wave breaking strengths in fig 2 for small breaking strengths the small droplets stay in the subsurface and the larger ones buoyantly rise to the surface the buoyancy forces are dominant when the wave breaking strength is high the small droplets are affected dramatically in the subsurface as well as the larger droplets the wave breaking forces dominate the steady state assumption on droplet distributions depends very strongly on the distribution of droplets and on the strength of the breaking and arguably this assumption would be even more exceptional if transverse advection dispersion affecting the oil droplet distribution in each stack is considered 5 2 benchmarking the merging and coalescence mechanics in our model our focus now turns to illustrating and benchmarking the birth death droplet mechanics in our model specifically we compare our model results to experiments that track the cumulative volume fraction of a toluene and water mixture as a function of droplet distribution and holdup conditions and time the data is reported in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 in order to accomplish the comparison between our model and laboratory data we omit the slick dynamics and suppress all of the mechanics in the subsurface dynamics except for the terms associated with bv and dv in 39 the parameters for the model match those reported in connection with figs 3 and 4 in the tsouris and tavlarides paper for continuous phase water the viscosity is μ c 1 787 10 3 ps water density ρw 1025 0 kg m3 and the kinematic viscosity νc μc ρw m2 s for the dispersed phase toluene we chose a surface tension σd 28 4 10 3 n m a dispersed phase molecular viscosity μd 0 59 10 3 ps and a density ρ 865 kg m3 the droplets ranged in size from r 1 100 10 6 m to r m 380 10 6 m 100 and 380 µm respectively and we used 25 droplet size classes m 1 25 in fig 4 we superimpose the output of our model lines with dots representing the experimental data in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 originally obtained by bae and tavlarides 1989 our results show consistency between our simpler model and data and by implication consistency with the more complex model proposed by tsouris and tavlarides 1994 the numerical results suggest that the simplifications we made primarily affect the fidelity of the dynamics of the larger droplet size classes the degradation is an acceptable tradeoff with gains in computational efficiency 5 3 mass exchanges in the nearshore sticky waters problem an explanation for the slowing down of shoreward directed buoyant pollutant transport in proximity of the shore was proposed in restrepo et al 2014 the mechanism can be summarized as follows the transport of buoyant pollutants toward the shore by the action of ocean currents and the residual flow due to waves proceeds nearly ballistically when the pollutant occupies the thinnest possible region of the water column close to the surface however the transport can slow down significantly due to increased entrainment and friction if the pollutant distributes itself widely within the water column the effect is particularly strong when there is a great deal of mixing or the bathymetry is shallow and or rough in fact the depth averaged transport has an effective advection that can go to zero under certain circumstances away from the shore in such case the average transport of pollutant can slow down and park the pollutant some distance away from the shore if any of the pollutant reaches the beach it does so primarily by diffusion since the vertical distribution of the oil plays a critical role we revisit the simple conceptual model used in restrepo et al 2014 and updated in restrepo et al 2015 replacing the simple mass exchange model used in these with the entrainment model proposed in this work the basic scenario is presented in section 6 1 of restrepo et al 2015 the domain for the computation is shown schematically as fig 5 in restrepo et al 2015 the changes to the original model given by eqs 39 40 and 43 in restrepo et al 2015 and the one captured by 3 6 and 18 in the algorithmic process described in section 4 2 are as follows the subsurface oil will be captured by 4 size classes chosen in the range r 1 100 10 6 m and r m 380 10 6 m a range of droplets suggested by north et al 2015 for simplicity we will employ a constant mixed layer depth p in the calculations in restrepo et al 2015 p is a function of position x in restrepo et al 2014 the mass exchange term in the dynamics of the slick and the subsurface oil used in the original model reads 1 γ s γ p x s ς x where γ is a constant fraction parameter that regulates the rate of exchange of surface and subsurface oil ς is the relaxation rate parameter the oil in the surface is s and in the subsurface it is p x s the mass exchange component of the subsurface associated with oil entrainment due to wave breaking s t b t in 18 is complemented by s t 2 ϵ ρ w g a 2 here ϵ is the wave action damping see equation 33 of restrepo et al 2015 ρw is the ocean density g is gravity and a is the wave amplitude in the calculations that follow the wave amplitude in the deeper end of the domain is 1 m and the wave period is 9 1 s the driving velocity is solely due to wave generated transport or stokes drift see mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 the new term accounts for the intense turbulence associated with the shoaling process of the waves in general it tends to dominate the mass exchanges due to wave breaking in the shoaling region each computational grid location in the transverse coordinate x has a stack composed of a multi size subsurface compartment and an upper slick compartment the x coordinate refers to the distance from the shore alongshore are ignored the specifics of the calculation are as follows at time t the stack balance of oil is updated after the transverse distribution of oil is advected dispersed this is an adiabatic approximation that is based on the disparate time scales in which oil in the vertical direction rebalances compared with the slower times of transverse advection the imposed transport velocity is approximately 0 02 m s and is consistent with the transport imparted by the stokes drift velocity due to gravity waves of about 1m height and 9 1 s periods the mass exchange within each stack is run for about 1 5 h of simulated time then the advection and dispersion across the coupled stacks is performed this process is repeated the total simulated time is 100 hrs the parameters used in the calculation are the same as those that were used to generate fig 7 of restrepo et al 2015 fig 5a shows the initial oil distribution the total amount of oil is constant over time and equal to vol tot 2 334 10 3 m3 m 2 all of the oil is initially in the slick fig 5b and c show the final oil distribution the oil is reported on a logarithmic scale as the volume ratio with respect to vtot in each size class or in the slick the cases shown in fig 5b and c differ only in the thickness of the mixed layer with b corresponding to p 1 m and c to p 6 m as was shown in restrepo et al 2014 and restrepo et al 2015 the p 1 m case shows little evidence of slowing or parking in the earlier papers we reported that the oil that initially started in the slick stayed in the slick even very close to the shore this is no longer the case with the mass exchange term proposed in this paper after 100 h of simulated time the slick still accounts for most of the oil away from the shore but there is a redistribution of the oil between the slick and the subsurface due to shoaling moreover the bulk of the subsurface oil is found in the smaller droplet size class after 100 h of simulated time the p 6 m case leads to results that do not differ from the results with the old mass exchange term however there is a more complicated distribution namely for this case oil parks away from the shore the center of mass is roughly 200m away from the shore the oil has also redistributed between the slick and the subsurface both close as well as far away from the coast in this case we also find that the subsurface oil has a larger concentration of small droplet sizes 6 summary in restrepo et al 2015 an eulerian oil fate model was proposed the model is specialized to shallow waters and is being designed to approximate the oil dynamics at environmental spatio temporal scales from hundreds of seconds to seasons and hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers it is a depth averaged transport model that includes advection and dispersion due to wind waves and currents and captures the dynamics of oil in terms of two compartments a surface compartment or oil slick and a subsurface compartment the oil slick is thus the portion of the oil in proximity of or at the sea surface itself the subsurface oil is the remaining portion distributed throughout the water column in the form of droplets with a dispersive distribution in order to provide an accounting of the chemical composition of the oil spill a future version of the model will include chemodynamics chemodynamics will also have a bearing on the transport dynamics of oil since chemistry affects the macroscopic realm e g photolysis sedimentation evaporation etc as well as the microscopic via changes in the surface tension and viscosity of the oil droplets the present study focused on the development of a model for the mass exchanges between the surface and subsurface oil the model takes into account the entrainment mixing caused by sea surface intermittencies e g white capping see restrepo et al 2011 the merging and splitting of droplets and oil droplet buoyancy drag effects the starting point of the mass exchange model proposed here is found in tkalich and chan 2002 aside from upscaling and depth averaging the most salient difference between their model and ours is that the model proposed here does not assume time stationarity or equilibration we also work out in detail the momentum balances of buoyancy and near surface mixing and how these affect the dynamics of droplet merging splitting and their vertical distribution the droplet distribution dynamics model we adopted modified is largely inspired by the work of tsouris and tavlarides 1994 we tested the proposed upscaled droplet distribution dynamics against data with good outcomes the model takes into account microscopic dynamics without resolving them at the heart of the upscaling strategy is the use of an adiabatic approximation that assumes that the dynamics of the droplets settle at time scales much shorter than the macroscopic time scales of the transverse advection dispersion of oil and depth averaging and filtering and stochastic parametrization depth averaging is justified in oceanic regions where barotropic flows have small aspect ratios these conditions can be found in the shallow reaches of the continental shelf and the nearshore the upscaling strategies lead to a practically implementable model at the expense of fidelity we provided estimates of efficiency in our approach and suggest that these make the eulerian framework of the oil model we are developing practical and its computer implementation feasible we also took the opportunity in this study to apply the mass exchange model developed here on a geophysical problem related to buoyant pollutant transport in the nearshore the specific problem considered is nearshore sticky waters detailed in restrepo et al 2014 nearshore sticky waters refers to oceanic conditions that lead to the slowing down and possibly parking of shoreward propagating buoyant tracers the thickness of the vertical mixing layer when compared to the overall water column depth turns out to be critical for sticky conditions in this study we replace the original fixed mixed layer depth by the time dependent and oil droplet distribution dependent layer produced by the mass exchange model developed in this study doing so still lead to situations whereby nearshore sticky waters were possible further the addition of the mass exchange mechanism demonstrates that mixing the type of oil and the droplet distribution dynamics will influence oil budgets and the manner in which oil distributes itself vertically under nearshore sticky water conditions most ocean oil fate models are lagrangian the mass exchange model developed here is intended to be retrofitted into an eulerian framework the specific oil fate model is in restrepo et al 2015 however the mass exchange dynamic proposed here can in principle be included in any other eulerian model acknowledgments this

24091,we propose a time dependent eulerian model for sea surface entrainment buoyancy transport and droplet dynamics of ocean oil the model captures the microscale vertical oil mass exchanges in the neighborhood of the sea surface this model is in turn part of an oil fate model designed to capture oil dynamics at large spatio temporal scales typical of environmental studies the adiabatic dynamics of the droplets are upscaled by a combination of filtering and stochastic parametrization the upscaling addresses the computational burden of resolving the microscale the upscaled droplet dynamics are tested against data and the mass exchange mechanism is incorporated into a nearshore oil transport model in order to highlight the importance of incorporating vertical mass exchanges and droplet distribution dynamics in predicting the distributing of shoaling oil keywords oil spill oil fate model oil entrainment ocean oil transport ocean pollution 1 introduction there are many ocean oil spill models for reviews see the asce task committee on modeling of oil spills of the water resources engineering division 1996 report and the transportation research board and national research council 2003 report the latter of these reports has a good summary of the fundamental processes affecting oil spill dynamics in the ocean own oscar from sintef and simap oilmap from applied science associates are examples of commercial oil fate models owm see daling and strom 1999 is an oil weathering model these packages include an oil fate model along with a comprehensive suite of ancillary diagnostic design modules useful in impact and planning assessments their oil transport models aim to be fairly comprehensive with regard to the inclusion of the many and sometimes complex mechanisms that alter the fate of oil in the ocean among non commercial packages we could mention adios see lehr et al 1992 lehr et al 2002 and gnome see zelenke et al 2012 the noaa office of response and restoration model along with medslik see dominicis et al 2013 is the european consortium model and one of several european mediterranean model for surface oil spills there are also a variety of oil plume models that are meant to capture blowouts and oil seeping from the ocean bottom for example voils described in azevedo et al 2014 and vdrop zhao et al 2014 most oil spill models are lagrangian lagrangian oil fate models see for example lonin 1999 are essentially parcel advection diffusion schemes with added complex phenomenology many of these lagrangian models import the wind and ocean velocity fields from separate ocean and wind circulation models eulerian models similar to the one we are developing are less common examples of eulerian models are formulated in tkalich and chan 2002 see also tkalich and chan 2006 as well as in wang and shen 2010 eulerian models are thought to be computationally less efficient see yapa et al 1999 and this case may be made about some of them an advantage of an eulerian transport model is that if properly designed will be easily incorporated into an ocean circulation model further if the circulation model has an optimized high performance advection diffusion solver sophisticated grid generation capabilities and time marching schemes these can be used to great advantage in the efficient implementation and maintenance of the transport model module compatibility in the boundary conditions and fluxes in the transport and the ocean circulation models are other important advantage presumably improvements in the eulerian mixing and dispersion parameterizations in the ocean circulation can be exploited as well in improving the dynamics of the transport model the oil fate model we introduced in restrepo et al 2015 is eulerian and is designed to be a tool in environmental work and thus is designed to capture oil spills at very large spatio temporal scales in basins with very complex geometries and flows efficiency is paramount time spans from hundreds of seconds to seasons and spatial scales spanning hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers to reach these large spatio temporal scales we have opted to pose the model in terms of depth averaged equations a consequence of depth averaging is that the model will not capture the depth dependence of the distribution of oil the oil transport model is a shallow water model which means that it applies on problems where the variability of oil in the horizontal direction is much larger than the variability in the vertical direction this does not imply that we ignore vertical variations in distribution of the oil within the water column that significantly affect the overall transport in transverse directions it also makes no special requirements from the ocean code with regard to whether it resolves ocean vertical dynamics or not a depth averaged model for oil dynamics makes geophysical sense in shallow waters specifically in the shallow reaches of the continental shelf and large shallow lakes examples are the shelf areas near the gulf coast states and the east coast of the united states the shelf is close to many major cities and sensitive habitats the shelf zone has complicated shipping traffic and a fair share of operational and dormant oil wells hence the shelf is a zone of major environmental concern these shallow oceanic regions have complex topographically dependent flows complex coasts and river deltas these conditions place enormous modeling challenges on sub mesoscale ocean dynamics and small scale winds and coastal hydrodynamics in many of these nearshore regions upwelling is critical and thus the vertical dependence has to be explicit or carefully accounted for in the depth averaging of the ocean flow simulations not withstanding that we are going to ignore much of the vertical structure of the oil field in restrepo et al 2015 the general design of the oil fate model is laid out in that same work the fundamentals of transverse oil advection and dispersion were worked out as is the effect of the presence of oil on the dynamics of the ocean wave field there are well known challenges in developing a comprehensive oil model and its computational platform of the type we envision reaching the large spatio temporal scales required by an environmental oil transport model will require a very large number of degrees of freedom and by extension of computational resources in order to control the computational complexity of the resulting simulation platform it is necessary to design aspects of the physics and the computation simultaneously thus allowing coupling of numerical resolutions and the physics in a consistent and efficient manner the transport model we are building uses specialization to the shallow reaches of the continental shelf where depth averaging and adiabatic assumptions apply in order to reach high resolutions over large spatio temporal expanses a focus on the shallow reaches of the continental shelf requires coupling oil transport to nearshore dynamics ocean dynamics at the submesoscale see romero et al 2013 uchiyama et al 2014 romero et al 2016 as well as wind weather fields and wave dynamics the latter to capture wave induced transport and dispersion see mcwilliams et al 1997 mcwilliams et al 2004 restrepo et al 2011 and the former to generate the stresses on the ocean surface as well as on oil exposed to air coupling to a weather model would provide the requisite fields for an oil transport model that includes chemodynamics the chemical composition of the oil as a function of space and time is important in a variety of environmental problems see thibodeaux 1996 a model with the capacity to model chemodynamics would enable engineers the simulation capabilities to investigate weathering and dispersal via chemical means see li 2009 delvigne and sweeney 1988 and belore et al 2009 and references contained in these for how dispersants affect oil a long range goal of the modeling effort is thus to incorporate a comprehensive chemodynamics capability some chemical process such as bio degradation sedimentation and photolysis are already accounted for in mature oil models see lehr 2001 daling et al 2014 and the documentation of adios gnome won simap bio degradation involves both the live population as well as the dead populations of many organisms see loh et al 2014 chemodynamics would give an oil fate model the capability of making these processes reactive and dynamic chemistry also plays a role at microscopic scales in the surface tension buoyancy viscosity of oil droplets changes in these in turn affect the oil droplet mechanics oil is a composite compound consisting of hundreds if not thousands chemicals see thibodeaux 1996 hammam et al 1988 tracking these reacting chemicals adds significant complexity to the oil fate model moreover the chemodynamics component adds a considerable computational burden to the resulting discretized oil fate model without some form of dimension reduction strategy the addition of chemodynamics can easily lead to an impractical oil transport model aggregation strategies such as those used in combustion chemistry may prove helpful here see maas and pope 1992 and references contained therein see also daling et al 2014 for an application of such strategies to oil spill models aggregation produces chemical complexes whose chemodynamics are seldom a linear superposition of their individual reactions in venkataramani et al 2017 we developed a data driven dimension reduction strategy that addresses non standard behavior of chemical complexes the strategy exploits takens embedding in order to capture the memory terms that arise from the interaction of short time and long time dynamics unlike other strategies our dimension reduction strategy leads to a reduction of computational degrees of freedom while at the same time reducing the inherent stiffness of the chemical complexes because it reduces the disparity of time scales thermodynamics and energy conservation enter chemical dynamics processes and can affect mass conservation as well mass conservation is a non trivial and basic requirement in oil reservoir simulations particularly in chemically reacting flows chen 2007 it is a complex problem in ocean oils examples include sedimentation rates see loebing 2015 and the fact that oil gas near the sea surface can exist in liquid forms at depth and thus subjected to different dissolution dynamics see aman et al 2015 sokolofsky et al 2011 notwithstanding our interest in the macroscopic dynamics of the oil the microscopic realm cannot be ignored see reed et al 2009 the vertical transport is affected by droplet merging and splitting merging and splitting is also affected by surface tension and viscosity which are thus dependent on the chemical dynamics the mechanics of buoyancy droplet dynamics and turbulent processes near the ocean surface play important roles in the oil mass fluxes this study addresses the modeling challenges of the last item on this list which we collectively call the mass exchange dynamics specifically we want to formulate an upscaled dynamic model that captures oil entrainment by waves the droplet merging splitting dynamics and stokes force balances buoyancy and drag of distributions of droplets the mass exchange refers to capturing the exchanges of oil between the surface and subsurface components of the oil fate model we will not account for chemistry at this stage most models for oil transport take into account oil mass exchanges between surface and the subsurface the sintef products see reed et al 2009 for example will use a combination of empirically derived and mechanical models based mainly on equilibrium conditions for this exchange we will include mechanics of droplet merging and splitting along the lines proposed in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 the micromechanics of buoyancy drag and of surface mixing due to wave breaking extend the model suggested in tkalich and chan 2002 to include a parametrization of wave breaking based on results found in restrepo et al 2011 hereon tkalich and chan 2002 will be dennoted as tc using upscaling filtering the resulting non stationary model will approximately capture micromechanics without resolving these it can thus be incorporated into an eulerian oil transport model such as the one proposed in restrepo et al 2015 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly summarize the shallow water oil model and identify where the mass exchange term appears in the transport equation the full details on the advection and diffusion dispersion in the transport equations can be found in restrepo et al 2015 the mass exchange mechanism between surface and subsurface oil is proposed in section 3 as well as the evolution of the droplet size distribution and merging splitting dynamics the upscaling strategy of the vertical oil exchanges is described in section 4 in section 5 we compare the reduced dimension droplet distribution model to data and by extension to another droplet model in restrepo et al 2014 we proposed a model for the slowing down and possibly parking of buoyant pollutants and tracers in oceanic regions adjacent and offshore of the break zone the term nearshore sticky waters is used to describe the conditions that lead to slowing parking of incoming pollutants the stickiness is a result of the advective and dispersive conditions near the break zone and the conditions whereby the effective transport velocity decreases or goes to zero away from the shore depends in turn on the vertical distribution of the buoyant pollutant in restrepo et al 2014 we prescribed the vertical distribution in section 5 of this study we revisit the nearshore sticky water problem and replace a prescribed vertical distribution by one given dynamically by the mass exchange model developed here we confirm that sticky water conditions are still possible and show how the droplet distribution has a bearing on how the transport unfolds in section 6 we summarize the model and its features 2 the shallow water oil fate model the framework of the oil fate model appears in restrepo et al 2015 the general transport model is formulated for a surface slick layer s in units of length that represents the effective thickness of surface oil and a subsurface component of oil described by a concentration field c in units of density times volume over volume there may be hundreds to thousands of chemicals in a any sample of oil and each oil spill may have different chemical composition we take this into account and describe the slick as a composite of homogeneous sub slicks each of thickness si hence 1 s x t i 1 n s i x t where n is the total number of chemical complexes the total oil slick mass is then given by 2 m s t ω t i 1 n s i x t ρ i d x where x is the transverse coordinate ωt is the possibly time dependent oceanic domain or area of interest time is denoted by t and is understood as associated with the time scales in which advection diffusion dissipation takes place as opposed to the shorter time scales of the micromechanics the densities of each chemical complex are denoted by the ρi for the ith chemical complex the transport equation is 3 s i t c x s v s i τ 2 μ i s i 2 ψ s i r i e i s s i p i s g i s here is the transverse gradient operator v are the x components of the transport velocity cxs is a slip parameter τ is the wind stress μi the viscosity of the ith oil species the last term on the left hand side is the eddy dispersion term with ψ denoting its rate tensor its symmetric component is associated with diffusion and the antisymmetric part with advection ri is the rate associated with mass exchanges between the oil slick and the interior of the ocean and is the focus of this study the reaction term e i s b i s i s j encompasses chemical reactions among chemical complexes within the slick as well as other processes modeled by rates such as evaporation p i s is the rate of biodegradation emulsification photodegradation and g i s is the source rate term unlike ri the terms with s superscript are particular to the surface oil the total mass of the oil in the sub surface is defined as 4 m c ω t h η i 1 n c i x z t d z d x where ci is the concentration of the ith chemical complex in the sub surface layer in units of m l3 we define the depth averaged subsurface concentration of the ith complex as 5 c i x t 1 h x h η t c i x z t d z where h is the total water column depth note that the product hci has units of m l2 and its evolution is given by 6 h c i t h v c i h ψ c i ρ i r i ρ i e i c c i p i c g i c on the right hand side the first term is the mass exchange term ρiri the reaction chemistry term is e i c p i c represents the sedimentation and biodegradation mechanisms the subsurface source term is g i c this paper concerns itself with developing a model for ri which is related to the mass exchange term and it has units of l t 3 the mass exchange model the term r represents oil gained by the slick from the subsurface by buoyancy and lost by mixing and wave breaking for an alternative model see reed et al 2009 because buoyancy forces depend on the radius of the droplets it is necessary to keep track of the droplet distribution in the subsurface which in turn requires that droplet merging and splitting be incorporated in the dynamics the consequence of this is that micromechanics need to be resolved or they must be upscaled if the scales of interest are far larger than the droplet coherence scale here as in restrepo et al 2015 we develop the rationale for an upscaled version of the mass exchange process to environmental spatio temporal scales 3 1 slick subsurface oil exchanges focusing on the ith chemical species and making use of ms and mc from 2 and 4 respectively gives the total mass per unit area of oil at a fixed transverse location x and time t as 7 m i x t h x c i x t ρ i s i x t 8 h η t c i x z t d z ρ i s i x t h η t 0 ρ i v r n i x z r t d r d z ρ i s i x t the last term in 8 represents the slick contribution the first term on the right of 8 represents the submerged oil in terms of droplets of radii r and volume v r 4 3 π r 3 and their space time varying distribution ni x z r t the dynamics model for ni will be developed in section 3 3 ni x z r t dr gives the number of droplets of radii in r r d r per unit volume of water and at depth z hence ni has units of l 4 in order to describe the dynamics of the submerged portion of the ith chemical complex ci and hci in 5 and 6 one must account for the fraction occupied by such chemical complex within each of the submerged droplets consider the total mass of such chemical stored in droplets submerged in the volume of water d x dz there are ni d x dz dr of them with radii in r r d r and we may assume that the jth droplet contains a random fraction f i j of the ith chemical within it we hence approximate 9 c i d x d z e 0 ρ i v r j 1 n d x d z d r f i j z r 0 ρ i v r f i z r n x z r t d r d x d z with f i r z denoting the average fraction of chemical i contained in droplets of radius r submerged at depth z the total amount of chemical complex i per unit area in the water column can therefore be written as 10 m i x t h η t 0 ρ i v r n x z r t f i z r d r d z ρ i s i x t if we ignore the dispersion wind forcing reaction chemistry sedimentation biodegradation and subsurface sources the total derivatives of mi in 7 and mi given by 10 must be consistent therefore 11 h c i t v h c i ρ i r i ρ i s i t v s i r i where ri is the exchange term see 3 and 6 and may be conveniently decomposed as 12 r i r i r i 0 v r w b r n i x η r t d r s i x t b x t the component r i is the rate of oil gained by the slick in units of length time coming from the subsurface by means of buoyancy with wb 0 denoting the upwards velocity of the buoyant droplets oil which is here supposed to depend only on their radius as any effects of internal droplet composition have been averaged out the second term r i s i b is the rate of oil lost from the slick due to wave breaking and will be described in section 3 2 below also see tc for an alternative derivation disregarding all processes of chemical degradation and exchange the quantities hci and si satisfy an equation identical to 11 but involving the corresponding mass exchange rate ri which may also be decomposed as r i r i r i where 13 r i 0 v r w b r f i r η n x η r t d r 3 2 the wave breaking term r i wave breaking occurs within the location x and x d x at a rate of λb events per unit time each having a strength that may be characterized in terms of the wave slope ka where k is the wavenumber and a is the wave amplitude of the breaking wave see restrepo et al 2011 for the time scales of interest a wave breaking event occurring at time tk can be regarded as an instantaneous transport event in which a fraction bk of the available volume s x tk d x is injected and distributed into the water column let δ t k t denote the delta function at time tk namely δ t k t 1 d t for t t k t k d t and zero everywhere else the breaking inputs can then be written in terms of a compound poisson nb process of rate λb yielding the following expression for b in 12 14 b x t i 1 n b t b k δ t k t we will refer to the unitless bk as the strength of the kth wave breaking event note that the units of b are 1 t droplets created from the available volume s x t b x t d x are the source term for the equation describing the dynamics of n which is derived in section 3 3 below hence we now decompose sb into the appropriate distributions of radii and depths according to delvigne and sweeny 1988 if a unit of oil per unit area is available to be distributed into droplets the number of droplets per unit volume of oil and of radius in r r d r will be n r dr with 15 n r 3 4 s 4 π r m 4 s r 1 4 s r s r r 1 r m s 3 zero otherwise which is such that 0 v r n r d r 1 the units of n are l 4 the empirical parameter s is frequently quoted as taking the value of 2 3 see tc the resulting droplets are distributed along the water column according to a function gb z which we assume does not depend on anything besides z and satisfies 16 0 g b z d z 1 the distribution of droplet sizes 15 proposed by delvigne and sweeny is not universally accepted for example reed et al 2009 propose a log normal fit to droplet distributions instead based upon laboratory data see mitzenmacher 2003 for a discussion on the challenges associated with fitting certain types of data to log normal and power law distributions the density of available droplets of radius r at depth z per unit area is denoted 17 s b x z r t n r g b z b x t s x t which has units of t 1 l 4 and by virtue of 1 15 and 16 satisfies 18 h η 0 v r s b x z r t d r d z b x t s x t r as for the mass transport r i of the ith chemical from the slick into the water column we assume that wave breaking acts indiscriminately on the composite slick and that the following balance holds 19 r i s i s r 3 3 subsurface droplet distribution dynamics we must now specify a dynamic model for the droplets in the subsurface that includes sb in 17 as a source term in accordance with the oil model restrepo et al 2015 droplets are assumed to undergo a linear vertical advection diffusion process furthermore the time scales at which the vertical distribution of oil sorts itself out given fast disturbances at the sea surface are assumed to be very short compared to the horizontal advection scales the shallow water wave approximation we denote the vertical turbulent diffusivity by dz r 10 2 10 3 m s 2 which can be parametrized in terms of the turbulent description of the flow while wb r 10 6 10 3 1 is the limiting velocity of a oil droplet moving through water the values ranges for dz and wb are taken from tc eq 13 in what follows we focus on vertical balances an adiabatic approximation in which for given radius r depth z and time t two flux sources affect n x z r t the droplets that are entrapped from the surface into depth z after a wave breaking event and changes on the distribution of radii due to merging and splitting of droplets putting all together gives 20 n t d z r 2 n z 2 w x z t w b r n z s b k n furthermore the background vertical velocity satisfies w wb r and will hence be ignored the operator k encodes the effect of merging and splitting of droplets this operator is discussed in detail in section 4 1 but for now it suffices to remark that it should be conservative namely 21 0 k n r dr 0 at the surface z η t we assume that there is no diffusive flux as the slick is saturated while all incoming droplets from the upward effect of buoyancy are added to s and removed from the concentration n the boundary condition at the subsurface slick interface is simply 22 n z t η r 0 t 0 r 0 at z h we allow for sedimentation which we ignore for now in what follows we fix x which we omit in the subsequent notation and solve for the amount of oil in the slick and subsurface droplets occupying the one

first term on the right hand side of 23 represents effectively stochastic diffusion in the z direction and could be equivalently written in terms of stochastic wiener process for the movement of

quickly due to merging and splitting further it is often assumed that droplets in the subsurface smaller than a critical radius will remain in the subsurface see tc and references contained therein for the basis for such an assumption see also reed et al 2009 the critical radius for ocean oil is quoted in tc as r c 50 μ m for computational reasons it is convenient to bin droplet sizes for each chemical complex and formulate the subsurface oil transport in terms of a finite discrete set of droplet classes at the same time we incorporate depth averaging and pose the dynamics of subsurface droplets in terms of fluxes into and out of the depth averaged horizontal computational cells due to advection dispersion interactions with the slick via buoyancy and wave mixing and finally via changes to droplet class distributions within each cell we now use 23 24 to obtain a set of equations for the number of total droplets per unit area of ocean in prescribed radii classes namely let r 1 r 2 rm be a subdivision of radii of interest into m classes and δ r r j 1 r j we are interested in the evolution of 28 n j x t h η r j r j 1 n x z r t d r d z invoking 25 it can be written as omitting

to derive an expression for the dynamics of merging and splitting of droplets that is independent of z and hence arrive to an approximate version of 29 in terms of solely n j we may assume that the merging and breaking processes occur at time scales much shorter than those of t in particular during an interval dt the change in the distribution of radii is 31 n r z t d t n r z t k n z t dt out of these added droplets the following amount is then transported to depth z 32 h η t g r z z t t k n z t r dt dz we approximate the second integral in 29 by commuting these mechanisms thus obtaining 33 0

chemistry dynamics equations are necessary to determine the ultimate relation between f i r j η at the surface and the depth integrated f i j the chemodynamics is an aspect of the shallow water oil transport model that is yet to be developed 4 1 subsurface oil droplet merging and coalescence we will focus now on the droplet merging splitting mechanism captured by the operator k we consider the situation for a subsurface cell at position x in what follows we dispense tagging the variables with their chemical species and ignore other mechanisms that affect the distribution of droplets in a compartment or cell the total number of droplets of size class in v r v r d r occupying the volume of water under d x is n defined in 35 which changes due to breaking and merging as 39 k n b v d v where dv bv are death and birth rates that approximate the smoluchowsky operator k the death dv and birth bv terms in turn are defined as 40 d v n v t 0 λ v v h v v n v t d v g v n v t 41 b v 0 v 2 λ v v v h v v v n v v t n v t d v 42 v β v v ν v g v n v t d v where v v r v v r in the above expressions λ v v is the coalescence efficiency for collisions between droplets of classes v and v h v v is the frequency of droplets of class v colliding with droplets of class v g v is the breakage frequency of droplets of class v ν v represents the number of droplets formed by the splitting of droplets of class v and β v v is the probability of forming droplets of class v from splitting of droplets of class v to first order it can be assumed that only binary collisions occur and thus ν v 2 once the

surface and internal forces in the droplet see liao and lucas 2009 specific breakup mechanisms are droplet elongation in sheared flow turbulent pressure fluctuations relative velocity fluctuations and droplet eddy collisions the large eddies will advect droplets but those turbulent eddies that are comparable in size or smaller will exert a shear when they interact with a droplet of oil the breakup frequency f assuming droplet eddy collisions in isotropic turbulence conditions droplet sizes in the inertial sub range and droplet breakup due solely by eddy droplet collisions with smaller or the comparably sized eddies is defined in terms of the droplet radius r as f r k b h r b e kb is a system dependent parameter that needs to be calibrated see zhao et al 2014 the eddy droplet collision frequency h is defined as 45 h r n e m s e d u e 2 u r 2 1 2 n d n e where s e d π r e r 2 is the collision cross section area re is the size of eddies which collide with a droplet of radius r dne is number of eddies of size between re and r e d r e an estimate of the velocity square of the eddy is obtained from u e 2 3 8 ϵ k 2 3 here ϵ is the kinetic energy dissipation rate k π r e is wavenumber and u r 2 1 7 ϵ r 2 3 is the droplet velocity the estimated number of eddies per unit volume of the fluid is found from d n e m k 3 10 3 k 2 d k see azbel 1981 the breakup efficiency be is the probability of breakup if a drop eddy collision takes place b e exp e c e v c 1 e where ec is the mean excess energy required for breakage into two equal size drops and a small and a big daughter drop and ev is the viscous and surface tension energy associated with internal forces see zhao et al 2014and calabrese et al 1986 the minimum energy for droplet breakup is related to the amount of required energy to keep the surface of a droplet intact in binary splitting e c 2 2 π σ d r 2 1 3 2 π σ d r max 2 π σ d r min 2 2 π σ d r 2 where e 1 2 m u e 2 2 3 π ρ w r e 3 u e 2 r min r 1 r max r m and σd is the droplet surface tension see zhao et al 2014 the energy associated with internal forces is 46 e v 1 a exp t t t o t π 6 ϵ 1 3 2 r 7 3 μ d ρ w ρ where ρw is the fluid density ρ is the density of the particular chemical complex oil density ttot is interaction simulation time one time step of fluid oil interaction and μd is the oil species viscosity the constant a 1 1 is a calibration constant see zhao et al 2014 eq 15 in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 it is argued that assuming binary breakage recall it was assumed that ν v is 2 the amount of energy required for the generation of two like sized droplets is larger than what is required to produce one small and one big droplets they suggested the breakup distribution of a drop of class size v from a parent drop of class size v is given by 47 β r r e min e max e r 0 r e min e max e r d r where e r 4 π σ r 3 r 3 2 3 r 2 r 2 4 1 2 parametrizing coalescence mechanics the merging process in which two or more colliding droplets form a bigger droplet is called coalescence the coalescence of droplets normally evolves in three stages 1 collision 2 interfacial drainage of liquid at touching interfaces and 3 the rupture of the droplet surface in this study we assume that background turbulence is the main cause for droplet collisions the volume absorbed by a moving droplet when colliding with other droplets is the basis for calculating the collision frequency the swept volume rate h v v is modeled following the kinetic gas theory assuming both droplets moving with turbulent eddies with relative velocity of c a collision tube with cross section of π r r 2 is swept therefore the h v v could be defined as h v v π r r 2 c assuming isotropic turbulence it is reported in kuboi et al 1972 that the relative colliding velocity in stirred and pipe flows was well estimated as c 2 2 ϵ 2 3 r r 2 3 in this work uniform turbulence assumptions are used see kolmogorov 1941 assuming this is correct the swept volume rate for droplets v and v then reads h v v π 4 5 657 ϵ 1 3 r r 7 3 the droplets need to stay in contact for a certain time to complete the coalescence process turbulence promotes collisions however it can also move the droplets away from each other before the coalescence process takes place therefore the collision efficiency is defined as the ratio between the average drainage time t and average contact time τ λ v v exp t τ see prince and blanch 1990 the drainage time of the thin interface between two droplets depends on the viscosities of each droplet and the main phase could be different for air bubbles in comparison with oil droplets as a result we need to be more careful about implementation of this parameter the average drainage time for fully mobile interfaces is given by prince and blanch 1990 eq 18 t r e q 3 ρ l 16 σ d 1 2 ln h 0 h c where ρl is the density of the continuous phase σd is the surface tension and h 0 is the initial film thickness the critical film thickness hc as estimated in chesters 1991 is h c a r e q 8 π σ d where a is the hamaker constant and req is the equivalent droplet radius given by r e q 2 1 r 1 r where r and r are the radii of the colliding droplets the average contact time τ is given by see levich 1962 τ 2 2 3 r r 2 3 ϵ 1 3 4 2 the complete depth averaged model we now summarize the physical computational shallow water oil fate model in what follows we will omit the chemical complex identifier of the droplet distribution consider a cell at position x and suppose that s x t c x t and n j x t j 1 m are known we use the following split step strategy to advance into t δ t 1 first the mass exchanges is computed with s x t and 38 to obtain s s x t 1 2 δ t for the subsurface knowing n t for t t we produce the update n j via 35 which includes the merging splitting dynamics the update for the submerged oil concentration c is computed by using n j in 37 2 to step to t δ t we use s and c to advance on 3 and 6 with r 0 it has already been taken into account in the half step 3 finally the aggregated subsurface concentration c x t δ t is used to adjust the droplet distribution budget from the split step as follows 48 n j x t δ t c x t δ t n j c x t 1 2 δ t there is no expectation that droplets will retain their chemical complex composition over time and this issue is itself a very challenging modeling problem well outside the scope of this study nevertheless we can suggest how this challenge will be tackled our goal is to deliver a chemical description of oil at the kilometer scales or greater and thus we will be upscaling the chemodynamics equations as well as applying dimension reduction strategies so that a smaller number of chemical complexes are tracked in space and time than the full complement of oil constituents these chemical complexes are not expected to retain the dynamics of the oil constituents most critically the chemical complexes will have memory terms that cannot be ignored as reported and tested in venkataramani et al 2017 our dimension reduction strategy based upon embedding can capture memory effects over time scales closer to the macroscopic scales than the chemical scales the depth averaged algorithm presented above will need to be modified once chemodynamics are incorporated into the oil fate model 4 3 computational complexity of the shallow water oil fate model depth averaging clearly produces computational efficiencies when compared to the non depth averaged case it does so at the expense of loosing depth information of the oil however the oil fate model is being designed for use in shallow waters for the computation of oil spills over very large transverse scales and over significant time spans it is thus suggested that a model with these characteristics will still be of great practical utility even if it is unable to resolve the vertical distribution of oil in these waters in this study we develop a model that brings in critical oil dynamics that would be missed if all inherently vertically distributed processes would be ignored in the oil fate model and these are mostly processes that bring their own challenge of coupling the micro and macroscales we tackle directly the challenges posed by coupling of the microscale and macroscale by proposing a mass exchange model that upscales the microscale at the expense of fidelity the use of upscaling and adiabatic assumptions in the mass exchange mechanics proposed in this study approximates critical microscale dynamics and balances without requiring resolving these as a result there is no significant increase in computational overhead to appreciate the computational efficiency of the oil fate model we first compute the computational complexity of the oil model in three space dimensions and time and without making use of upscaling we will also assume that the computations are explicit in time since present codes are mostly designed that way to take advantage of shared distributed memory computing machines if the computation uses nx spatial degrees of freedom and runs for nt time steps the computational complexity is o p n x 3 q n t the factor p 3 q represents the overhead multiplier if the microscale is to be resolved in addition we have a multiplicative factor of o i j where i is the number of droplet size classes and j is the number of chemicals to appreciate the magnitude of the computational complexity let us assume that the macroscale is to be resolved over kilometers and the microscale to centimeters p would be about 104 and q would be comparable an optimistic estimate due to numerical stability constraints the size classes i would be of order 101 j of order 10 2 10 3 the complexity of the shallow water oil model is o n x 2 n t for the space time discretization the size classes i would be of order 101 j could be reduced to order of 101 if the dimension reduction strategy in venkataramani et al 2017 as applied to the chemodynamics equations delivers acceptable outcomes 5 results we present three calculations in section 5 1 we focus on simulations that illustrate the complexity of the dynamics of buoyancy and wave breaking balances the focus of the calculations in section 5 2 will be on demonstrating by comparison to data that the considerably simpler birth death model for droplet distribution dynamics proposed here is consistent with the more complex model of tsouris and tavlarides tsouris and tavlarides 1994 in section 5 3 we incorporate the mass exchange mechanism developed here into a simplified version of the shallow water oil transport model of restrepo et al 2015 to explore a nearshore oil pollution problem the problem in question is called the nearshore sticky water conditions see restrepo et al 2014 in the calculations that follow we connote by stack a single vertical column of the computational domain of ocean a stack is composed of a surface compartment and a subsurface compartment directly below the surface compartment corresponds to the slick the subsurface compartment has oil and water 5 1 mass exchanges in a single stack eqs 35 and 38 were implemented on a single stack the oil can only rise and sink within the stack and thus can only be present in the surface or sub surface compartments for this case the size classes were chosen using r 1 25 10 6 m and r m 217 10 6 m 25 and 317 µm respectively there were 17 different size classes we simulated one hour of random wave breaking with 14 setting λ b 1 6 t w tw being the wave period see restrepo et al 2011 λb is the intensity parameter of the poisson process the wave amplitude was 1m we initialized oil in the surface and in the subsurface boxes with equal volumes fig 2 shows four cases corresponding to different probability distributions for the breaking strength bi all cases show a very fast transient adjustment followed by a slower evolution largely dominated by buoyancy forces for small bi and wave breaking large bi in the large wave breaking regime the oil is mostly relegated to the subsurface clearly the results differ from any steady state concerning oil distributions on the surface and the subsurface a more detailed view of the overall distribution of the subsurface oil appears in fig 3 the distributions are plotted as equivalent thicknesses of each size class corresponding to the wave breaking strengths in fig 2 for small breaking strengths the small droplets stay in the subsurface and the larger ones buoyantly rise to the surface the buoyancy forces are dominant when the wave breaking strength is high the small droplets are affected dramatically in the subsurface as well as the larger droplets the wave breaking forces dominate the steady state assumption on droplet distributions depends very strongly on the distribution of droplets and on the strength of the breaking and arguably this assumption would be even more exceptional if transverse advection dispersion affecting the oil droplet distribution in each stack is considered 5 2 benchmarking the merging and coalescence mechanics in our model our focus now turns to illustrating and benchmarking the birth death droplet mechanics in our model specifically we compare our model results to experiments that track the cumulative volume fraction of a toluene and water mixture as a function of droplet distribution and holdup conditions and time the data is reported in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 in order to accomplish the comparison between our model and laboratory data we omit the slick dynamics and suppress all of the mechanics in the subsurface dynamics except for the terms associated with bv and dv in 39 the parameters for the model match those reported in connection with figs 3 and 4 in the tsouris and tavlarides paper for continuous phase water the viscosity is μ c 1 787 10 3 ps water density ρw 1025 0 kg m3 and the kinematic viscosity νc μc ρw m2 s for the dispersed phase toluene we chose a surface tension σd 28 4 10 3 n m a dispersed phase molecular viscosity μd 0 59 10 3 ps and a density ρ 865 kg m3 the droplets ranged in size from r 1 100 10 6 m to r m 380 10 6 m 100 and 380 µm respectively and we used 25 droplet size classes m 1 25 in fig 4 we superimpose the output of our model lines with dots representing the experimental data in tsouris and tavlarides 1994 originally obtained by bae and tavlarides 1989 our results show consistency between our simpler model and data and by implication consistency with the more complex model proposed by tsouris and tavlarides 1994 the numerical results suggest that the simplifications we made primarily affect the fidelity of the dynamics of the larger droplet size classes the degradation is an acceptable tradeoff with gains in computational efficiency 5 3 mass exchanges in the nearshore sticky waters problem an explanation for the slowing down of shoreward directed buoyant pollutant transport in proximity of the shore was proposed in restrepo et al 2014 the mechanism can be summarized as follows the transport of buoyant pollutants toward the shore by the action of ocean currents and the residual flow due to waves proceeds nearly ballistically when the pollutant occupies the thinnest possible region of the water column close to the surface however the transport can slow down significantly due to increased entrainment and friction if the pollutant distributes itself widely within the water column the effect is particularly strong when there is a great deal of mixing or the bathymetry is shallow and or rough in fact the depth averaged transport has an effective advection that can go to zero under certain circumstances away from the shore in such case the average transport of pollutant can slow down and park the pollutant some distance away from the shore if any of the pollutant reaches the beach it does so primarily by diffusion since the vertical distribution of the oil plays a critical role we revisit the simple conceptual model used in restrepo et al 2014 and updated in restrepo et al 2015 replacing the simple mass exchange model used in these with the entrainment model proposed in this work the basic scenario is presented in section 6 1 of restrepo et al 2015 the domain for the computation is shown schematically as fig 5 in restrepo et al 2015 the changes to the original model given by eqs 39 40 and 43 in restrepo et al 2015 and the one captured by 3 6 and 18 in the algorithmic process described in section 4 2 are as follows the subsurface oil will be captured by 4 size classes chosen in the range r 1 100 10 6 m and r m 380 10 6 m a range of droplets suggested by north et al 2015 for simplicity we will employ a constant mixed layer depth p in the calculations in restrepo et al 2015 p is a function of position x in restrepo et al 2014 the mass exchange term in the dynamics of the slick and the subsurface oil used in the original model reads 1 γ s γ p x s ς x where γ is a constant fraction parameter that regulates the rate of exchange of surface and subsurface oil ς is the relaxation rate parameter the oil in the surface is s and in the subsurface it is p x s the mass exchange component of the subsurface associated with oil entrainment due to wave breaking s t b t in 18 is complemented by s t 2 ϵ ρ w g a 2 here ϵ is the wave action damping see equation 33 of restrepo et al 2015 ρw is the ocean density g is gravity and a is the wave amplitude in the calculations that follow the wave amplitude in the deeper end of the domain is 1 m and the wave period is 9 1 s the driving velocity is solely due to wave generated transport or stokes drift see mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 the new term accounts for the intense turbulence associated with the shoaling process of the waves in general it tends to dominate the mass exchanges due to wave breaking in the shoaling region each computational grid location in the transverse coordinate x has a stack composed of a multi size subsurface compartment and an upper slick compartment the x coordinate refers to the distance from the shore alongshore are ignored the specifics of the calculation are as follows at time t the stack balance of oil is updated after the transverse distribution of oil is advected dispersed this is an adiabatic approximation that is based on the disparate time scales in which oil in the vertical direction rebalances compared with the slower times of transverse advection the imposed transport velocity is approximately 0 02 m s and is consistent with the transport imparted by the stokes drift velocity due to gravity waves of about 1m height and 9 1 s periods the mass exchange within each stack is run for about 1 5 h of simulated time then the advection and dispersion across the coupled stacks is performed this process is repeated the total simulated time is 100 hrs the parameters used in the calculation are the same as those that were used to generate fig 7 of restrepo et al 2015 fig 5a shows the initial oil distribution the total amount of oil is constant over time and equal to vol tot 2 334 10 3 m3 m 2 all of the oil is initially in the slick fig 5b and c show the final oil distribution the oil is reported on a logarithmic scale as the volume ratio with respect to vtot in each size class or in the slick the cases shown in fig 5b and c differ only in the thickness of the mixed layer with b corresponding to p 1 m and c to p 6 m as was shown in restrepo et al 2014 and restrepo et al 2015 the p 1 m case shows little evidence of slowing or parking in the earlier papers we reported that the oil that initially started in the slick stayed in the slick even very close to the shore this is no longer the case with the mass exchange term proposed in this paper after 100 h of simulated time the slick still accounts for most of the oil away from the shore but there is a redistribution of the oil between the slick and the subsurface due to shoaling moreover the bulk of the subsurface oil is found in the smaller droplet size class after 100 h of simulated time the p 6 m case leads to results that do not differ from the results with the old mass exchange term however there is a more complicated distribution namely for this case oil parks away from the shore the center of mass is roughly 200m away from the shore the oil has also redistributed between the slick and the subsurface both close as well as far away from the coast in this case we also find that the subsurface oil has a larger concentration of small droplet sizes 6 summary in restrepo et al 2015 an eulerian oil fate model was proposed the model is specialized to shallow waters and is being designed to approximate the oil dynamics at environmental spatio temporal scales from hundreds of seconds to seasons and hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers it is a depth averaged transport model that includes advection and dispersion due to wind waves and currents and captures the dynamics of oil in terms of two compartments a surface compartment or oil slick and a subsurface compartment the oil slick is thus the portion of the oil in proximity of or at the sea surface itself the subsurface oil is the remaining portion distributed throughout the water column in the form of droplets with a dispersive distribution in order to provide an accounting of the chemical composition of the oil spill a future version of the model will include chemodynamics chemodynamics will also have a bearing on the transport dynamics of oil since chemistry affects the macroscopic realm e g photolysis sedimentation evaporation etc as well as the microscopic via changes in the surface tension and viscosity of the oil droplets the present study focused on the development of a model for the mass exchanges between the surface and subsurface oil the model takes into account the entrainment mixing caused by sea surface intermittencies e g white capping see restrepo et al 2011 the merging and splitting of droplets and oil droplet buoyancy drag effects the starting point of the mass exchange model proposed here is found in tkalich and chan 2002 aside from upscaling and depth averaging the most salient difference between their model and ours is that the model proposed here does not assume time stationarity or equilibration we also work out in detail the momentum balances of buoyancy and near surface mixing and how these affect the dynamics of droplet merging splitting and their vertical distribution the droplet distribution dynamics model we adopted modified is largely inspired by the work of tsouris and tavlarides 1994 we tested the proposed upscaled droplet distribution dynamics against data with good outcomes the model takes into account microscopic dynamics without resolving them at the heart of the upscaling strategy is the use of an adiabatic approximation that assumes that the dynamics of the droplets settle at time scales much shorter than the macroscopic time scales of the transverse advection dispersion of oil and depth averaging and filtering and stochastic parametrization depth averaging is justified in oceanic regions where barotropic flows have small aspect ratios these conditions can be found in the shallow reaches of the continental shelf and the nearshore the upscaling strategies lead to a practically implementable model at the expense of fidelity we provided estimates of efficiency in our approach and suggest that these make the eulerian framework of the oil model we are developing practical and its computer implementation feasible we also took the opportunity in this study to apply the mass exchange model developed here on a geophysical problem related to buoyant pollutant transport in the nearshore the specific problem considered is nearshore sticky waters detailed in restrepo et al 2014 nearshore sticky waters refers to oceanic conditions that lead to the slowing down and possibly parking of shoreward propagating buoyant tracers the thickness of the vertical mixing layer when compared to the overall water column depth turns out to be critical for sticky conditions in this study we replace the original fixed mixed layer depth by the time dependent and oil droplet distribution dependent layer produced by the mass exchange model developed in this study doing so still lead to situations whereby nearshore sticky waters were possible further the addition of the mass exchange mechanism demonstrates that mixing the type of oil and the droplet distribution dynamics will influence oil budgets and the manner in which oil distributes itself vertically under nearshore sticky water conditions most ocean oil fate models are lagrangian the mass exchange model developed here is intended to be retrofitted into an eulerian framework the specific oil fate model is in restrepo et al 2015 however the mass exchange dynamic proposed here can in principle be included in any other eulerian model acknowledgments this

indian and western pacific oceans down to sub kilometer scale at the coast tidal model data comparisons are presented to assess the capabilities and limitations of our large scale barotropic model the average root mean square rms discrepancies of tidal elevations at coastal tide gauges is 14 cm which is 3 cm smaller than those of a state of the art global data assimilated barotropic tidal model sensitivities to lateral boundary conditions bathymetry and dissipative processes are explored to guide future endeavors related to large scale barotropic modeling in the region and other regions throughout the world lateral boundary conditions are found to induce adverse resonant effects on the lunar semi diurnal modes when poorly placed elevation specified boundary conditions are used this problem is largely resolved by using an absorption generation layer at the boundary parameterization of internal tide energy conversion is identified as the most important aspect to control deep water solutions and help reduce the rms discrepancies of the entire system two forms of this parameterization are presented and their spatial distributions of dissipation are compared bathymetry has a negligible effect on the tidal solutions in deep water but local high resolution bathymetry results in significant reductions to the average rms discrepancies on the continental shelf 26 and at the coast 30 implementing a spatially varying bottom friction coefficient based on sediment types decreases the average rms discrepancy at the coast by 9 predominantly due to its positive effects in the yellow sea the model is shown to capture a large amount of the tidal physics and has the potential for application to a range of barotropic problems such as wind driven surge and tidal processes

the surface area of the world oceans they are interconnected by marginal seas such as the java timor banda andaman and arafura seas and are separated by the intricate island chains of indonesia and the philippines major ports and cities are located in the northern parts of both the indian ocean dubai karachi mumbai colombo and the western pacific ocean hong kong shanghai tokyo singapore representing a significant portion of the world s economy and human population thus within this region which we call indwpac hereafter there is great interest in being able to better understand coastal hazards and hydrodynamics for e g coastal protection and management risk evaluation and navigational purposes for such purposes our long term objective is to develop a large domain depth integrated forward model of the indwpac region which couples tides atmospheric driven currents density driven circulation and wind waves the focus is to advance the modeling of these individual processes and systematically understand the interactivity of dissipation mechanisms bathymetric sensitivities and lateral boundary forcing mechanisms on the response functions throughout this domain in particular our interests lie on inner shelf and estuarine processes and how these mechanisms impact coastal and inland water levels and currents this is notwithstanding the challenge of the indwpac region in terms of its complex geometry topography such as the many interconnected shallow seas and island chains and associated hydrodynamics in comparison with e g the western north atlantic region that has received significant attention hope et al 2013 kerr et al 2013 bunya et al 2010 to model the dynamics at coastal and inland locations within the indwpac region all processes and exchanges from ocean scale to harbor inlet scale must be appropriately represented coarse resolution global models e g egbert et al 2004 green and nycander 2013 buijsman et al 2015 green et al 2017 have been developed to simulate the large scale global ocean dynamics but as a result of grid resolution they may inadequately capture geometric features and nonlinearities of the hydrodynamics in the inner shelf and nearshore region conversely higher resolution shelf scale regional domain models are often developed to accurately capture local effects e g green and david 2013 cai et al 2006 zu et al 2008 in south china sea however accurate lateral boundary conditions are required to propagate in all of the required information from offshore the closer one gets to the coast the more boundary conditions become complicated and difficult to match with the interior domain physics in order to correctly exchange mass momentum and energy across the boundary furthermore regional model parameters are calibrated to generate accurate results in the specific region that may not be generally applicable in other regions thus this study presents the development of an ocean basin scale model which minimizes lateral boundary interaction yet sufficiently resolves energetic processes from the deep water to the coast using a single unstructured computational grid in a physically consistent manner without ad hoc parameterization the scale of this model fits somewhere in between the global scale and shelf scale regional models that are more commonly developed the ocean basin scale model utilizes varying resolutions to produce high fidelity coastal bathymetry of critical geographic and topographic features such as island chains reef systems and floodplain systems provides connectivity to estuarine and harbor systems where dense coastal populations live and captures key dynamics of a large regional domain in which the effects of changing dynamics in a certain region can propagate into other regions at the same time lateral boundaries are placed further offshore than shelf scale regional models thus more focus is placed on the inner model dynamics allowing the governing physics to equilibrate without constraining the system hence a more accurate understanding of the controls and the extent of impact throughout the domain may be obtained note that in future work as computational resources allow we would like to extend this ocean basin scale model to the global scale while maintaining high resolution in the coastal areas the aim is to systematically build complexity into the external forcing terms and the underlying physics in the process sensitivity of the dynamical system and sub grid scale parameterizations will be explored to assess the capabilities and limitations of the model in the indwpac region in this study we begin this process through model data comparisons of tidal elevations predominantly and tidal currents due to astronomical forcing since tides can be reduced to a series of harmonic constituents of well defined frequencies model data comparisons can be robustly made comparisons are conducted against point observations at tide gauges and regionally against global data assimilative model atlases examples of the latter include tpxo8 egbert and erofeeva 2002 http volkov oce orst edu tides tpxo8 atlas html fes2014 lyard et al 2006 https www aviso altimetry fr en data products auxiliary products global tide fes description fes2014 html and nao 99b matsumoto et al 2000 these models assimilate elevation data from satellite altimetry and selected coastal tide gauges to accurately obtain estimates of the tidal elevation fields in terms of individual harmonic constituents m2 tidal wave root mean square errors rmse of modern data assimilated models are typically 0 5 0 7 cm versus deep ocean bottom pressure recorder stations stammer et al 2014 in contrast m2 rmse ranges within 5 6 12 7 cm for purely hydrodynamic global models without data assimilation stammer et al 2014 however non assimilative forward models on large domains can be applied to a wide variety of problems including wind pressure ice and wave coupling effects and may be used to conduct past egbert et al 2004 green 2010 wilmes and green 2014 green et al 2017 or future forecasting and perturbation response analysis green and david 2013 e g due to changing sea level large scale ice sheet collapse wilmes et al 2017 dredging operations and land reclamation suh et al 2014 importantly this study explores the sensitivities of various controls on the barotropic tidal dynamics at first the effects of lateral boundary placement and the addition of an absorption generation sponge layer at the lateral boundary are discussed secondly the responses to two different global bathymetric databases are directly compared thirdly high resolution local bathymetric data are included where available to assess its potential to facilitate improvements in the solution lastly internal tide and bed stress bottom friction driven dissipative effects are explored after it was discovered that around 25 30 of the total global tidal dissipation is in the deep ocean egbert and ray 2000 the conversion of barotropic energy into baroclinic energy through the generation of internal tides over rough submarine topography was determined to be an important process to include in ocean tide models for a review see garrett and kunze 2007 parameterizations of internal tide energy conversion in which it is incorporated as a sink term through this process is critical to reduce tidal elevation discrepancies in barotropic ocean models jayne and st laurent 2001 egbert et al 2004 zaron and egbert 2006 green and nycander 2013 buijsman et al 2015 the effects of the energy conversion parameterization in the indwpac region including comparisons between two different forms of parameterization are discussed in addition spatially varying bottom friction coefficients in the parameterization of bed stress are rarely considered in large scale models instead a canonical spatially constant coefficient is commonly applied lyard et al 2006 egbert and erofeeva 2002 however changing the bottom friction coefficient has been shown to have positive effects regionally kerr et al 2013 lefevre et al 2000 we briefly discuss the impacts of estimating spatially varying coefficients based on local sediment types and the local hydrodynamics the requirements for improved estimations of local bottom friction coefficients for future research are considered to summarize this paper describes the development of the indwpac unstructured grid and hydrodynamic modeling system 2 3 it is built with state of the art bathymetric datasets 2 absorption generation boundary conditions 3 5 and data informed parameterizations of internal tide energy conversion 3 3 and bottom friction dissipation 3 4 we analyze the sensitivity of the model to these four factors 5 and conduct model data comparisons of tidal elevations and tidal currents against both tide gauge records and a data assimilated tidal model 4 the capabilities and limitations of the model are identified and discussed 4 5 suggested areas of focus to advance barotropic coastal ocean models are highlighted 2 domain definition bathymetry and unstructured grid development our ocean basin scale model includes the entire indian ocean the western half of the pacific ocean and the southern ocean between these extents specifically the domain fig 1 lies between 17 9 e 175 8 e longitude and 73 3 s 62 7 n latitude covering an area of roughly 150 million km2 there are two open ocean boundaries a longitudinal parallel boundary running from nearby the cape of good hope south africa to antarctica and a concave shaped boundary between the bering sea coast of kamchatka krai russia and antarctica the boundaries were chosen so that tidal amphidromic points and complications with the aleutian hawaiian and new zealand islands in the pacific ocean were avoided an illustration on the effects of boundary placement is shown in 5 1 the mesh is a triangular unstructured grid with resolution ranging from as large as 25 km in parts of the deep ocean down to 1 km along most coastlines fig 1 b additionally resolution is as fine as 100 m in the ports and harbors of hong kong tokyo bay and osaka bay the mesh contains a total of 9 6 million nodes and 18 8 million elements development of the unstructured mesh is achieved predominantly through an automated algorithm developed in house based on the matlab distmesh code persson and strang 2004 resolution is varied through an edgelength local grid resolution function λe defined as the minimum of three criteria 1 λ e min λ m α d d t α w g h 2 π α s h h where λm is the nominal minimum edgelength d is the distance from a node to the closest coastline boundary t is the period of the m2 tidal wave h is the bathymetric depth and αi are the dimensionless user defined coefficients for each criterion distance from the coastline αd 0 075 wavelength αw 600 and topographic length scale αs 30 lyard et al 2006 in addition to obtaining higher resolution nearshore to support local bathymetric data and capture complex geometries of the coastline these edgelength criteria ensure that important bathymetric features are adequately represented throughout the ocean model bathymetry fig 1 a is interpolated onto the mesh from a number of sources in a specified order using an automated cell averaging technique bilskie and hagen 2013 as summarized in table 1 references are included here the adopted background bathymetry is the 1 120 srtm30 plus global database becker et al 2009 combined with a synthetic realization of seafloor roughness along the abyssal hills goff and arbic 2010 timko et al 2017 the synthetic abyssal hill roughness is used because the effective resolution of the global altimetric based bathymetry is limited to 10 km in the deep ocean while 1 km resolution is necessary to describe the required topographic roughness that generates internal tides converting barotropic energy into baroclinic energy goff and arbic 2010 melet et al 2013 timko et al 2017 in addition to include depths under ice shelves in antarctica we interpolate from the tpxo8 model bathymetry containing the padman et al 2002 dataset for shallower regions in depths 500 m where the abyssal hill roughness is not important we start by interpolating from the global 1 240 srtm15 plus database which improves on srtm30 plus with newer measured nearshore bathymetry and topography sources thereby reducing the number of erroneous holes in the data on top of this 100 m deepreef explorer great barrier reef and coral seas gbr and kerguelen plateau kp datasets are applied it was discovered that deepreef explorer gbr in the torres strait new guinea region matches substantially better with gebco 2014 than srtm15 plus thus gebco 2014 is applied locally here differences between the two databases are discussed further in 5 2 also 90 m east asia nearshore bathymetry datasets in the philippines japan gulf of thailand south china sea and east china sea regions and local high resolution bathymetry and grids privately obtained for tokyo bay and south korea are applied however even in the high resolution datasets erroneous depth in harbor complexes and channels persist these are corrected where possible using data from fugawi navigational charts https www fugawi com however the errors in the final bathymetry that is applied to indwpac are still largely uncertain furthermore the bathymetric data sources included in this study are not exhaustive and there may be others available possibly more accurate than the sources currently used that we have not yet included e g choi et al 2002 krien et al 2016 3 adcirc hydrodynamic model 3 1 governing equations the horizontal two dimensional implementation of the advanced circulation coastal ocean model adcirc 2dh is used to calculate the hydrodynamics westerink et al 2008 1992 the governing equations are the shallow water equations swe in primitive non conservative and barotropic form 2 η t u h σ x η η c 0 3 u t u u f k u g η η e q η s a l c f u u h c u 1 h ν t h u u t σ x u u c 0 where η is the surface elevation h h η is the total water depth in which h is the still water depth u is the depth averaged velocity vector g is the acceleration due to gravity k is the vertical unit vector and f 2 ω sin ϕ is the coriolis parameter in which ω is the angular speed of the earth and ϕ is the latitude the quantity ηeq is the equilibrium tide and ηsal is the ocean self attraction and loading term sal in the dissipation terms cf is the coefficient of bottom friction c is the dissipation matrix due to the internal tide energy conversion and νt is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient that is calculated through the smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 dresback et al 2005 finally we impose an absorption generation sponge layer e g zhang et al 2014 where σ x are the spatially varying absorption coefficients applied over the defined sponge boundary and ηc and uc are the corresponding reference solutions for surface elevation and velocity respectively see 3 5 for details 3 2 ocean self attraction and loading term the ocean self attracting and loading sal term ηsal is related to the yielding of the solid earth to tides and to the weight of the ocean and its self attraction hendershott 1972 for the large scale indwpac domain it is essential to include the effect of sal terms on the tides however since the model is regional the global integrals of the tidal elevations required to be solved iteratively for the sal terms ray 1998 are not available thus in this study the amplitudes and phases of sal for each tidal constituent are simply interpolated from those used in the global data assimilated model fes2014 lyard et al 2006 onto our mesh and forced by reconstructing the time series from the constituents given the accuracy of state of the art global data assimilated models stammer et al 2014 the slowly varying sal terms obtained from these models are also assumed to be sufficiently accurate however the calculation of sal through global integrals to obtain full consistency with the surface elevation including non periodic components is ultimately desired c f apecechea et al 2017 3 3 internal tide energy conversion internal tides generated by flow over rough bathymetry are major contributors to barotropic tidal energy dissipation more precisely the conversion into baroclinic energy in the deep ocean equivalent to around 25 30 of the global total egbert and ray 2000 2001 as a result parameterization of this energy conversion is necessary in barotropic ocean models that include expanses of ocean where major submarine ridges island chains and shelf breaks that induce internal waves are present in this study parameterization of internal tide energy conversion is particularly important since the indian ocean basin contains narrow shelves and vast expanses of open ocean where the dissipation due to internal tides over its well defined abyssal hills is crucial to the accuracy of the tidal solutions parameterizations of internal tide energy conversion are usually based on a linear wave drag type implementation valid only for subcritical topography γ 1 bell 1975 jayne and st laurent 2001 here γ h α in which α ω 2 f 2 n b 2 ω 2 1 2 is the internal wave slope ω is the angular frequency of the pertinent tidal wave m2 in this study and nb is the brunt väisälä frequency at the seabed in this study we investigate two subcritical theory parameterizations for the dissipation matrix c in 3 one based only on local topographic features and another that includes the nonlocal effects on wave generation first we use a simple and robust parameterization that takes into account the directionality of dissipation which we denote as the local method similar to that presented by lyard et al 2006 is 4 c c d i r n b 2 ω 2 n 2 ω 2 1 2 ω h x 2 h x h y h x h y h y 2 where cdir is a scale factor n is the depth averaged brunt väisälä frequency and the subscripts x and y indicate gradients in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions respectively note that we have substituted the typical wavenumber κ in lyard et al 2006 for the fundamental internal mode at the pertinent tidal frequency zaron and egbert 2006 the local method only dissipates across slopes rather than along them second a rigorous formulation for c that includes the nonlocal effects of the nearby topography on internal tide generation melet et al 2013 was derived by nycander 2005 denoted as the nonlocal method hereafter it has the following form in a general coordinate system green and nycander 2013 5 c c n y c n b 4 π h 1 f 2 ω 2 2 j x h x j x h y j y h x j x h y j y h x 2 j y h y where cnyc is a scale factor and j is a convolution integral of a filtered green s function of the topographic heights h defined positive from seabed within a specified radius from the point of interest c f green and nycander 2013 nycander 2005 details of the calculation of the gradients of j h and h the correction to 4 and 5 at supercritical topographical slopes γ 1 and the calculation of the buoyancy frequency terms nb n required for the two methods are detailed in pringle et al 0000 submitted buoyancy frequencies are calculated from the world ocean atlas 2013 mean annual decadal averaged 1955 2012 database of salinity zweng et al 2013 and temperature locarnini et al 2013 note that for h 100 m we set c 0 because the topographic gradients on the continental shelf should be small and bottom friction dissipation starts to dominate here the advantage of the local method is that c is positive definite and it does not require the computationally intensive calculation of j allowing it to be quickly implemented into the model on the other hand the nonlocal method accounts for the nonlocal topographic effects on internal tide generation however c in 5 is not guaranteed to be positive definite since the sign of the gradients of j and h do not necessarily conform furthermore the calculation of the gradients of j is computationally expensive so it is not as readily implemented into a numerical model modifications to get a positive definite c and guassian smoothing of nb to incorporate the nonlocal effects of buoyancy frequencies for the nonlocal method are implemented and briefly evaluated in this study see pringle et al 0000 submitted for details on modifications we also investigate whether the nonlocal method provides any meaningful advantageous effect over the local method by comparing the results between the two methods see 5 3 3 4 bottom friction dissipation dissipation due to bottom friction bed stress is known to account for a significant proportion of dissipation of the barotropic tides particularly in shallow regions h 100 m values for the coefficient of bottom friction cf in the bed stress term refer 3 have shown to be predominantly on the order of 10 3 based on measurements of the flow velocity at 1 m above the bed in continental shelf and estuarine regions e g you 2005 heathershaw 1979 heathershaw and simpson 1978 charnock 1959 thus canonical global values of cf equal to 2 5 10 3 lyard et al 2006 or 3 0 10 3 egbert and erofeeva 2002 are usually applied as a spatial constant in large scale tidal models it has been suggested that deviations from the canonical value of cf globally do not significantly change the overall dissipation but that deviations by an order of ten can significantly degrade the tidal solution lyard et al 2006 nevertheless if other dissipation mechanisms are reliable internal tide energy conversion there is evidence that local variations in cf over the range of physically plausible values 10 4 to 10 2 can improve local tidal solutions e g lefevre et al 2000 in this study we present a semidata informed method of calculating spatially varying cf we aim to show that it is possible to calculate a spatially varying cf map that locally improves tidal elevations based on some knowledge of the seabed and physical properties of the flow notwithstanding the assumptions of the method and uncertainties in the data used to inform the method we start with the log law formulation of cf schlichting 1979 6 c f κ ln 0 5 h z 0 2 where κ 0 4 is the von kármán constant and z 0 is the seabed roughness length which can be equated to an effective sediment roughness ks 30 z 0 it is important to note that ks is not simply a function of the sediment roughness grain size itself rather it is mainly determined by the heights of ripples and dunes bedforms that form due to the prevailing currents which can be a major source of the resultant bed stress heathershaw 1979 to estimate ks that takes into account the bedform heights we use empirical equations van rijn 2007 that are a function of median sediment grain diameter d 50 sediment density relative to water s an effective mean current speed uf and the depth h see appendix a the empirical equations return small values of ks when either the sediments are light and the tidal currents are strong flattening out the bed or when the sediment grains are too heavy for the currents to create bedforms in between these extremes ripples and dunes will form resulting in larger values of ks in addition due to inadequate data availability of their locations a large grain size roughness due to very large rocks or boulders is ignored to obtain the sediment grain sizes we make use of a database of the census of the world s seafloor sediment types dutkiewicz et al 2015 we map these sediment types onto physically reasonable values of d 50 see table 2 for pelagic type sediments oozes and clays cf is set to 2 5 10 3 as a default roughness relative sediment density s 1 722 dry bulk density by mass of sand van rijn 2007 for d 50 dsand s 1 2 natural sediment with organic materials involved van rijn 2007 for d 50 dsilt and is linearly interpolated in between here dsand 6 2 10 5 m and dsilt 3 2 10 5 m where the assumption is made that the finer sized sediments in the census database contain a higher percentage of lighter organic material the effective mean current speed uf is defined as zaron 2017 7 u f u 0 2 0 5 k u k 2 0 5 where u 0 is a constant non tidal current snyder et al 1979 that we set equal to 0 25 m s zaron 2017 and u k are the amplitudes of the east and north components of the tidal currents of the kth constituent the spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 simulation is used to approximate uf in order to compute the spatially varying cf map see 5 4 for details on this cf map and its effectiveness 3 5 lateral boundary conditions lateral open ocean boundaries are forced by reconstructing the elevations from the tidal constituents obtained from a global data assimilative model tpxo8 egbert and erofeeva 2002 in this study we force with the major semi diurnal m2 n2 s2 k2 and diurnal k1 o1 p1 q1 constituents which are also used to force the sal and equilibrium potential terms prescribing the elevations at the open boundaries provides a reflecting boundary condition that allows the velocities to freely satisfy the governing equations in some cases this condition can generate spurious modes that may lead to instabilities utilizing an absorption generation sponge layer can reduce the production of these modes as demonstrated in 5 1 firstly the location and width of the sponge layer l must be specified we take l to be approximately equal to 10 of the wavelength of the m2 tidal wave λ m 2 the overall solution is found to be fairly insensitive to the choice of sponge layer width but for l 0 1 λ m 2 the solutions may not match well across the sponge calculation domain interface to show the location and width of the sponge layer region a hatched region is included in figures throughout this paper in addition the sponge layer requires spatially varying absorption coefficients σ x and reference solutions of the free surface ηc and velocities u c assuming a polynomial type function for the absorptive coefficients inside the sponge layer they are derived from the linear shallow water solution 8 σ σ m r l α 9 σ m g h α 1 ln 1 f l r c l α 1 where r is the distance from the edge of the sponge layer α is the order of the polynomial function f is the reduction factor of the outgoing wave at the position rc from the edge of the sponge the parameters α 2 f 20 and r c l 0 5 are chosen in this study but the solution is not typically sensitive to the choice of these factors the reference solutions ηc and u c are obtained by interpolating tidal constituents from the tpxo8 model onto every vertex node in the sponge zone note that to get u c the conservative transport variable u c h is interpolated from tpxo8 before dividing this by our model nodal depths for consistency 3 6 finite element solution adcirc solves the governing equations in a continuous galerkin framework where the generalized wave continuity equation gwce is utilized to eliminate spurious modes c f westerink et al 1992 the two part symmetrical velocity based method for the lateral stress terms dresback et al 2005 and explicit mass lumping mode are used to solve the gwce in this study a time step δ t 2 s can be used with our current grid without generating courant friedrichs lewy cfl induced numerical instabilities wall clock times are approximately 11 min day 1 of simulation time using 960 computational cores 10 000 finite element nodes per core of a high performance computing machine with haswell processors and a mellanox fdr infiniband network connection to validate the model with observations we simulated for 195 days including a 15 day spin up from a completely zero state the final 180 days are used for the harmonic analysis of the tides the long six month time period is required to correctly separate all the tidal constituents of interest e g k1 and p1 4 summary of tidal validation from best model setup 4 1 best model setup to obtain the best model setup we first find the global amplification factor of the internal tide energy conversion parameter so that the model skill in terms of tidal elevations versus tpxo8 is maximized in the deep ocean h 500 m a positive definite and spatially smoothed nb modified version of the nonlocal method with c n y c 2 9 and local multiplier coefficients over the luzon strait see 5 3 was decided on local bathymetry datasets and hand edits are applied to shallow water regions and responses against coastal tide gauges are checked for reliability in the harmonic analysis finally a map of varying bottom friction dissipation coefficients cf is calculated based on some information of the local sediment types as described in 3 4 in an attempt to increase the model skill versus using a spatially constant cf the best model setup is denoted by comp it sv indicating the use of our comprehensive bathymetric data table 1 optimal internal tide dissipation and spatially varying cf 4 2 measure of model skill to measure the skill of the model for the purpose of determining and evaluating the best setup in 4 4 we compare with the root mean square rms discrepancy d of the elevation either for a single tidal constituent or for the total free surface at a point d is the average of the squared differences between measured and observed elevations integrated over a long period of time it is calculated in this study using the sum of the vector differences of the in phase ak cos θk and quadrature ak sin θk components of each constituent wang et al 2012 10 d 0 5 k a 0 k 2 a m k 2 2 a 0 k a m k cos θ 0 k θ m k 1 2 where ak and θk are the amplitudes and phase lags of the kth constituent respectively and the subscripts o and m refer to the observed and modeled values respectively in addition the relative rms discrepancy is defined as r d d v where v is the absolute average value of the variability in the free surface elevation and is calculated by wang et al 2012 11 v 0 5 k a 0 k 2 1 2 for an overview of the spatial distribution we include scatter plots of d and rd at the tide gauges and contour plots versus tpxo8 in order to highlight regions of notably small or large discrepancies however to obtain a single global metric of performance the mean of the discrepancy d denoted d or the mean of rd denoted r d is used note that when calculating d over a region to compare against tpxo8 tpx this is computed as 12 d t p x d d a d a where d a indicates an area integral that is performed over the elements of the grid when comparing against tide gauges d t g r d t g the arithmetic average is used in comparison to d the rmse metric commonly used e g stammer et al 2014 buijsman et al 2015 is 13 rmse d 2 d a d a i e it is the square root of the mean of d 2 and is always larger than d the rmse may experience abrupt changes with depth and tends to overestimate the overall discrepancy wang et al 2012 in contrast d has been shown to decrease monotonically with depth wang et al 2012 thus we choose to predominantly use d however we also quote values of rmse for comparison with those reported in other studies finally in 4 5 comparisons of the tidal currents at seven tide gauges are shown to evaluate the comparison here the rms discrepancy of the tidal current ellipse dtc cummins and thupaki 2018 for the kth constituent is used 14 d t c k 0 5 u 0 k 2 u 0 k 2 u m k 2 u m k 2 cos g 0 k g m k cos θ 0 k θ m k u 0 k u m k u 0 k u m k sin g 0 k g m k sin θ 0 k θ m k u 0 k u m k u 0 k u m k 1 2 where u k and u k are the amplitudes of the semi major and semi minor tidal current axes respectively θk is the ellipse inclination angle and gk is the phase lag of alignment along the semi major tidal current axis 4 3 tidal gauge database a database of tidal elevation harmonic constituents used to evaluate the model in 4 4 consisting of 39 deep water stations 62 shallow water shelf stations and 659 unique coastal tide gauge locations has been assembled from multiple sources for the computational domain table 3 see pringle 2017 for tide gauge locations and tidal constituent values some of the sources are listed tidal constituent values at websites or in refereed journals denoted const in table 3 other sources are long term hourly time series of elevations denoted elev in table 3 where we have used the utide matlab function ut solv codiga 2011 which uses the iteratively weighted least square harmonic analysis technique to obtain up to 68 tidal constituents within the coastal tide gauge set there are a number of data points duplicated between sources so we set up a hierarchy between the different sources to decide what value to use in our model evaluation based on perceived reliability table 3 is listed in hierarchical order and the number of stations listed for each source is the eventual number after removal of duplicates note that all the phase lags in the database pringle 2017 are referenced to gmt the phase lags from some sources e g scs yellow sea and jma that are posted in terms of local phase lags have been converted in addition posted tidal current harmonic constituents at seven shallow water locations denoted curr in table 3 are used to evaluate the model in 4 5 4 4 tidal elevations 4 4 1 spatial distribution of tidal elevations and discrepancies this study focuses on presenting the m2 and k1 tidal waves and their discrepancies although 4 4 2 presents statistics for a combination of all major eight tidal constituents as well this choice is justified because out of the 760 tide gauges in the domain 4 3 the m 2 constituent is dominant at 625 locations 82 k1 is dominant at 106 locations 14 thus another constituent is dominant at just 29 locations 4 the global responses of the m2 and k1 tidal waves and their rms discrepancies against tpxo8 dtpx for the comp it sv model setup are illustrated in fig 2 the general response for both constituents is well described by our model including the positions of most amphidromes except for the two m2 amphidromes in the southern region of the domain one near the south west tip of australia and another near mawson station antarctica the positions of these amphidromes and the solution in the southern ocean are found to be very sensitive to the boundary conditions applied in this study and may be impacted by the tpxo8 derived velocities in the absorption generation sponge layer see 5 1 the spatial distribution of the rms discrepancies dtg and relative discrepancies rdtg for the comp it sv model setup against tide gauges are also illustrated fig 3 overall tide gauges with similar discrepancies are generally clustered together and there is a relatively strong spatial correlation between discrepancies against tpxo8 and those at tide gauges exceptions to this include much of the inner coast of the yellow sea and the seto inland sea where the tpxo8 model may not be reliable the comp it sv model setup performs particularly well throughout the western pacific ocean including along the japanese archipelago and northeastern australia for both constituents notable wide spread rms discrepancies in the m2 tidal wave appear in the mozambique channel north and west arabian sea red sea sea of okhotsk andaman sea yellow sea northern australian shelf and the celebes sea k1 rms discrepancies are notable in the sea of okhotsk arabian sea south china sea and java seas and the arafura sea predominantly large tidal ranges account for the discrepancies shown for example m2 rdtg values are relatively small in the yellow sea even though dtpx values appear large in the yellow sea for the comp it sv model setup in fact the response is improved rather substantially from the comp it sc model setup here 5 4 rdtg is also less significant than dtg in the mozambique channel and northern australian shelf these two regions are heavily influenced by large scale effects related to lateral boundary conditions 5 1 and internal tide energy conversion 5 3 on the other hand both dtg and rdtg are large in the sea of okhotsk for both constituents the importance of bathymetry in the region which is not well known has been highlighted by zaron 2017 the celebes sea is also a problem area for m2 that is most likely a result of incorrect flux exchanges through the island chains due to inadequate bathymetry and a poor representation of internal tide energy conversion particularly in shallow waters it should be noted that the celebes sea and surrounding indonesian seas was a focus of the original tpxo study egbert and erofeeva 2002 due to its poor forward model responses and the region has been found to cause problems for three dimensional ocean circulation models robertson and ffield 2008 ngodock et al 2016 the south china and java sea region extending down to the torres strait has a relatively large diurnal tidal range and k1 dtg and rdtg values are not small compared to most of the domain the physics of the k1 tidal wave here can be thought of as a standing wave where the response is likely to depend highly on the overall bathymetry and shoreline of the region the region is also heavily influenced by the energy flux permitted through the luzon strait 4 5 which is largely controlled by internal tide energy conversion 5 3 note that in some areas such as between south china sea and java sea which has a small m2 tidal range because it is close to an amphidrome rdtg becomes very large however dtg is relatively small 4 4 2 statistics of tidal elevation discrepancies a summary of the global tide gauge errors shown in terms of amplitudes r 2 0 93 σ s t d 0 09 m e 0 04 m and phases r 2 0 97 σstd 18 3 e 10 3 of up to all eight major tidal constituents from the comp it sv model setup against the observed values is presented fig 4 see caption for definitions of error metrics there is a total of 6080 data points on each plot just 2 4 of them represent absolute amplitude errors 0 2 m and 2 9 represent absolute phase errors 36 colored orange to purple in fig 4 outliers in the amplitudes of constituents tend to be underestimates rather than overestimates which may indicate deltaic regions estuaries back bays and rivers where the bathymetry is inadequate and overly dissipative e g the ganges delta where large discrepancies are present fig 3 aside from these regions there is a consistent spread of errors for both the amplitudes e 0 02 m and phases e 1 37 indicating a largely unbiased system table 4 compares the mean and standard deviations of the rms discrepancies between the various indwpac model setups different bathymetry datasets with and without internal tide energy conversion and spatially varying bottom friction coefficients versus tide gauges observations and the tpxo8 atlas note that when the interpolation of tpxo8 to the coastal tide gauges is performed using their native data extraction program otps2 a total of 93 locations return a null value thus for a fair comparison we present our model results against this reduced set of stations the statistics of the indwpac model are not noticeably different for the full coastal gauge set based on dimensional considerations different physical processes are expected to be important depending on the water depth and proximity to the coast thus the statistics are broken up into three regions deep water h 500 m continental shelf and slope waters 25 h 500 m and coastal waters includes continental and island coastlines at the deep water tide gauges the total free surface mean discrepancies for the comp it sv model setup d t g 4 7 cm r d t g 13 are 2 4 times those of the tpxo8 atlas d t g 2 0 cm r d t g 5 5 the indwpac model discrepancies in deep water are predominantly affected by the internal tide energy conversion which reduces the total free surface rms discrepancy by 47 d t p x and 55 d t g different bathymetry datasets and bottom friction coefficients have little effect hot spots of discrepancy against deep water tide gauges for the indwpac model occur in the celebes sea and banda sea see fig 3 against topex poseidon satellite crossover observations robertson and ffield 2008 particularly for the m2 tidal wave without the crossover points which are technically not tide gauges the m2 d t g for the comp it sv model setup is closer to 2 cm instead of 3 6 cm for comparison in waters deeper than 1000 m the rmse against tpxo8 for another non assimilative hydrodynamic model buijsman et al 2015 is approximately 4 cm in the indian and pacific oceans furthermore in waters deeper than 500 m wilmes et al 2017 obtains a global rmse 3 8 cm and the comp it sv model setup here obtains an rmse 3 6 cm in waters deeper than 500 m versus tpxo8 this cannot be said to be a statistically significant improvement despite generally higher resolution of the grid and nearshore bathymetric data than buijsman et al 2015 wilmes et al 2017 as shown only internal tide energy conversion resulted in a notable reduction to the deep water discrepancies better nearshore bathymetry and grid resolutions do not allow for significant improvements in the internal tide energy conversion matrix compared with coarser grid models because the calculation relies mostly on the deep water satellite altimetry data in global bathymetric datasets that are still limited to 10 km resolution accuracy goff and arbic 2010 furthermore the topographic roughness can be calculated on the relatively fine 1 km bathymetric grid before being interpolated onto the coarser computational grid for parameterization in barotropic models reducing the requirement for a fine grid in the ocean on the continental shelf the total free surface d t g at tide gauges are 2 6 to 2 8 times larger than those in deep water for both the comp it sv model setup and the tpxo8 atlas similar to deep water regions the comp it sv model total free surface discrepancies d t g 13 cm r d t g 23 are 2 5 times those of the tpxo8 atlas d t g 5 4 cm r d t g 9 2 at the tide gauges on the continental shelf the most significant factors in reducing the total free surface discrepancies on the shelf are internal tide energy conversion 34 reduction in d t p x and the nearshore bathymetric datasets 26 reduction in d t p x the bottom friction coefficient has a small impact overall although the discrepancy for the k1 constituent increased when using the spatially varying cf map the gebco 2014 bathymetry model gives lower d t g than the srtm15 plus model however d t p x is quite similar between the two bathymetric datasets note that d t p x tends to give a smoother indicator of the change between model setups because it is integrated over the whole domain where 25 h 500 m furthermore d t p x is 2 9 cm or 30 smaller than d t g for m2 this could be because the shelf gauges tend to be in regions with large tidal ranges such as the northern regions of the australian shelf and the yellow sea for comparison stammer et al 2014 report that the global m2 rmse in shelf waters is 24 49 cm against tide gauges and 19 28 cm versus tpxo8 comparatively the m2 rmse is 13 1 cm against tide gauges and 10 1 cm versus tpxo8 for the comp it sv model setup although it should be kept in mind that the stammer et al 2014 errors are global and hence they cannot be treated as a direct comparison according to the tpxo8 atlas the total energy density ted defined in 5 1 of the m2 tidal wave is slightly higher in the indwpac domain 820 jm 2 compared to the entire globe 695 jm 2 suggesting a degree of difficulty for the indwpac domain the rms discrepancies at the coastal tide gauges are only marginally larger than those on the shelf for the comp it sv model setup however the discrepancies increase significantly from the shelf to the coast when only the global bathymetry datasets are used in particular gebco 2014 the nearshore bathymetry dataset plays a large role in reducing the discrepancy 30 reduction in total free surface d t g the spatially varying cf map has a smaller but noticeable global effect 9 reduction in total free surface d t g local effects of cf are detailed in 5 4 at approximately 77 of the coastal tide gauge locations the total free surface d t g of the comp it sv model setup is less than 20 cm fig 5 which was the target metric used for a high resolution western north atlantic model much smaller in scale than indwpac where this is satisfied at 324 of 398 81 locations technology riverside inc and aecom 2015 even though the total free surface d t g for the comp it sv model setup is 2 5 times that of the tpxo8 atlas on the shelf d t g is 2 6 cm 15 smaller than the tpxo8 atlas for the comp it sv model setup at the coast however a higher percentage of locations will be within a given target discrepancy up to d t g 24 cm r d t g 35 for the tpxo8 model fig 5 on the other hand the tpxo8 model cdf curves fig 5 have long tails indicating a number of high magnitude outliers whereas this is not the case for the indwpac model with the nearshore bathymetry included thus if the solution is not significantly different from that offshore and where the gauges have been included in the assimilation process the tpxo8 model is accurate however due to coarse resolution and bathymetry the tpxo8 atlas may perform poorly in areas where small scale changes in amplitude and or phase that can occur in bays and harbors or in behind small islands and peninsulas are important comparatively the high resolution computational grids and bathymetric data included in the indwpac model allow it to capture the faster changing characteristics of tides particularly semi diurnal ones hence there are fewer large magnitude outliers and a smaller mean discrepancy compared with the tpxo8 atlas however in order to elevate the median performance at the coast it would appear that significant improvements in offshore bathymetric data and internal tide energy conversion dynamics are required if data assimilation is not involved 5 describes the sensitivities to these and other factors in addition it has been noted that the inclusion of atmospheric forcings and baroclinic components can lead to an improved barotropic tidal response in the region e g cai et al 2006 4 5 tidal currents and energy flux densities it is useful to investigate the energy flux densities and tidal currents in order to understand the hydrodynamics of the system that cannot be explained simply through tidal elevations furthermore even though tidal elevations may be accurate it does not always follow that tidal currents are well represented however since this model has been designed to be as physically driven a shallow water model as possible ignoring baroclinic and atmospheric forcings for now it is expected that the barotropic flow including tidal currents can be reasonably represented we concentrate on the marginal seas separating the indian ocean and the western pacific ocean because this is where tidal energy is transported between the two oceanic basins and dissipated in the process note that the energy flux density of the kth tidal wave is computed as wei et al 2016 15 p k 1 2 g ρ 0 h a k u k cos θ k θ k where ρ 0 is the reference density of sea water p k and u k of the m2 and k1 tidal waves are illustrated in fig 6 although not shown the energy flux densities qualitatively agree well with those from tpxo8 predominantly a large amount of m2 tidal energy flows from the indian ocean through the indonesian seas up into the yellow sea and around into the south china sea in contrast k1 tidal energy flows down from the northeast of the western pacific ocean into the south china sea and the indonesian sea thus the luzon strait and the indonesian seas play a large role with regards to the tidal dynamics of the domain the luzon strait is known for the generation of large internal tides where the energy conversion of this effect is parameterized in this study see 5 3 3 in addition the indonesian seas e g celebes sea and banda sea are fairly deep compared to the shelves of the java sea and the south china so bottom friction dissipation does not play a large role as confirmed by the presence of mostly small tidal currents throughout this region fig 6 instead internal tide conversion parameterization over the high gradient shallow island chains where tidal currents become locally large is likely to be important here a portion of the m2 tidal energy also flows through the shallow and narrow malacca strait where high magnitude tidal currents are generated fig 6 thus bathymetry and bottom friction are expected to be important here tidal current harmonic constituent observations were obtained in the region between the java sea and the south china sea locations a e and in the northern south china sea near hong kong locations f g in which tidal ellipses are plotted in fig 7 and their rms discrepancies dtc at each location for the indwpac model and for the tpxo8 atlas are summarized in table 5 these observations are in fairly low energy regions fig 6 which in some cases may make a model more susceptible to discrepancies without constraints on the solution in particular for the m2 although the direction and magnitude of the flow is fairly accurate in locations c e in the java sea where the m2 tide is very small the rotation of the tidal ellipse is anticlockwise in the indwpac model but is clockwise according to observations and tpxo8 as d t c m 2 is smaller for tpxo8 at locations c e but is smaller in the indwpac model at a b on the other hand the k1 tide is larger than m2 in the java sea region and the rotation of the tidal ellipse is in agreement at all locations a e furthermore d t c k 1 for the indwpac model is significantly smaller than those for tpxo8 at most locations in the northern south china sea there is good qualitative agreement in the tidal ellipses between the indwpac model and the observations for the m2 tide but less so for k1 note that location g is in a coastal region near hong kong and that the observations are surface currents where both the indwpac model and tpxo8 have large d t c k 1 thus perhaps for the k1 constituent there is a significant 3d effect or atmospheric driven response at this location given cai et al 2006 was able to obtain a tidal current solution closer to observations than our model when using a 3d model forced with winds and baroclinicity based on the plots and discrepancies of the tidal ellipses the tidal currents in the northern south china sea are not clearly better or worse in the indwpac model compared with tpxo8 5 sensitivities to lateral boundary conditions bathymetry and dissipative controls 5 1 lateral boundary conditions in this study it was found that the most dramatic effect on the solution occurred when modifying the position and or lateral boundary condition type fig 8 it turns out that the boundaries used in the final indwpac model which we call the two open boundaries domain in this section are well placed in the initial stages of the indwpac model the domain was set up so that the western pacific boundary was split into two separate boundaries where one of the boundaries was defined spanning from the great australian bight down to antarctica parallel with latitude designated as the three open boundaries domain the impact of the absorption generation sponge layer is also of concern with regards to the ability to absorb outgoing waves reduce reflections and instabilities and generate tidal solutions at the boundary to help evaluate the effect of the lateral boundary position and boundary condition type we quantify the total energy te and total energy dissipation td of the kth tidal constituent which are computed by 16 t e k ρ 0 2 h u k 2 g a k 2 d a 17 t d k w k p k d a where w is the work rate c f egbert and ray 2001 and p is the energy flux 15 since the numerical calculation of p with finite precision is very noisy in this work the area integral is computed using the divergence theorem note that the absorption generation sponge layer region is omitted from the above area integrals and we quote te and td values per unit area to help in enabling comparisons across the domains which have different total areas four simulations are conducted the two open boundaries domain with and without an absorption generation sponge layer and the three open boundaries domain with and without a sponge layer none of these simulations use internal tide energy conversion and a spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 is employed 5 1 1 boundary placement effects without sponge layer for simulations without the sponge layer t e m 2 900 jm 2 for the two open boundaries domain and t e m 2 3210 jm 2 when using the three open boundaries domain essentially a 250 increase similarly t d m 2 4 5 mw 2 and t d m 2 8 5 mw 2 for the two and three open boundaries domain respectively for comparison t e m 2 830 jm 2 and t d m 2 7 2 mw 2 in the tpxo8 atlas within the two open boundaries domain in this experiment the excess in total energy and deficit in the total dissipation per unit area respectively between the two open boundaries domain indwpac and tpxo8 solutions is at least partly explained by the absence of internal tide energy conversion the effect on the solution due to boundary placement is not nearly as prominent for the diurnal k1 tidal wave for example t e k 1 288 jm 2 for the two open boundaries domain and 298 jm 2 for the three open boundaries domain representing a small 3 5 increase most other constituents also show single digit percent increases in the total energy except for the other two lunar semi diurnal tides k2 and n2 in particular k2 whose response is most similar looking to m2 has a 231 increase n2 is increased by 31 4 5 1 2 effects of sponge layer it is found that applying the absorption generation sponge layer even for the three open boundaries domain can result in improved responses fig 8 b ii reducing t e m 2 to 1040 jm 2 and t d m 2 to 5 3 mw 2 the sponge layer thus allows for significant leeway in boundary positioning but it does not necessarily entirely eliminate issues in the response note how in the two open boundaries domain the amphidrome in the southern ocean below australia is located near where the third open boundary is the sponge acts to push this amphidrome away from the boundary because the three open boundaries indwpac model solution and the tpxo8 solution are incompatible here this indicates reliance on internal dissipative mechanisms to ensure compatibility with each other for example in our best model setup with the sponge layer applied when appropriate internal tide energy conversion is included better compatibility is obtained leading to t e m 2 780 jm 2 and t d m 2 7 1 mw 2 which are rather similar to the values from the tpxo8 atlas quoted in 5 1 1 5 1 3 discussion what to make of the dramatic results to the solution due to boundary placement and condition types firstly even though there should not be an amphidrome right next to the boundary according to the tpxo8 solution although the elevations are still fairly small our model without adequate internal dissipative effects expects there to be one instabilities and problems may arise near amphidromes because a physically incorrect solution that satisfies the governing equations can be obtained mathematically both boundary conditions and initial conditions are required to get the correct solution instead the method commonly adopted including in this study is to impose the elevation boundary conditions and ramp up the system from a completely zero state we found from a simple test case that when internal dissipative effects are low ramping generates spurious modes that persist for very long periods of time secondly the indian ocean and the australian indonesian marginal seas appear very sensitive to fluctuations in fluxes on the boundary in particular without adequate abyssal dissipation but even when internal tide energy conversion was included the three open boundaries domain without the sponge layer did not converge to a suitable solution in studies of free barotropic oscillations platzman 1975 zahel and müller 2005 resonant modes around 9 20 11 65 hour show similar patterns to the lunar semi diurnal tides in the indian ocean furthermore the energy density of the 11 65 hour mode is 2 2 times the global average in the indian ocean zahel and müller 2005 hence the resonant nature of the lunar semi diurnal tides in this basin causes the total energy to increase wildly in response to the poor boundary conditions the absorption generation sponge layer reduces reflections at the boundary allowing the spurious modes to exit the domain by introducing external information as part of the governing equations the sponge layer is applicable to a wide range of conditions in contrast a radiation type condition is difficult to devise in the case where actively imposing external information is required because you need to identify regions of inflow lavelle and thacker 2008 which may be time dependent however one of the main issues with using the absorption generation sponge layer is the reliance on the reference solution in particular because only the sea surface is assimilated tidal fluxes obtained from tpxo8 may be less likely to be as accurate or compatible with the indwpac model as the tidal elevations 5 2 bathymetry bathymetry is a boundary condition for oceanic models hence its importance to the solution is clear recent years have shown marked improvements in global bathymetric databases such as srtm15 plus and gebco 2014 this section begins by outlining the effects of using one of these databases over the other followed by effects between srtm15 plus and our more comprehensive bathymetric data table 1 the section concludes with a discussion on the results and implications 5 2 1 comparisons between global bathymetric databases current global bathymetric databases srtm15 plus and gebco 2014 are sufficiently accurate that they do allow us to obtain mean rms discrepancies 3 cm for the m2 tidal wave in the deep ocean nevertheless there is still a reasonable level of uncertainty between them fig 9 a for example on the abyssal hills the use of statistical roughness goff and arbic 2010 to calculate a new bathymetry set timko et al 2017 has been undertaken to account for the effective coarseness of satellite altimetry derived bathymetry note that the srtm15 plus database used here is a combination with srtm30 plus that contains the synthetic realization of the abyssal hill roughness but gebco 2014 is without it to investigate the effects of the global bathymetric databases we compute one simulation using srtm15 plus with abyssal hill roughness everywhere srtm it sc and another using gebco 2014 everywhere gebco it sc rms differences between the simulations for the m2 tidal wave are plotted in fig 9 b optimal internal tide energy conversion factors it and spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 sc are employed for both along the ocean ridges that include a synthetic realization of the abyssal hill roughness the normalized bathymetric differences are in the range 5 25 except for the southwest indian ocean ridge where the normalized bathymetric differences can exceed 50 in spots fig 9 a despite this m2 rms differences in deep water do not exceed 2 cm anywhere except east of australia and new guinea fig 9 b i e the rms differences between responses resulting from the two global bathymetric databases tend to be much less than rms discrepancies between comp it sv model setup and tpxo8 fig 2 c i note that although differences in the bathymetry should change the internal tide energy conversion matrix we use the same matrix as the comp it sv model setup for both simulations to help identify strictly bathymetric effects major normalized bathymetric and rms differences are unsurprisingly found in shallow waters such as the south china sea bass strait yellow sea sea of okhotsk ganges delta northern andaman sea persian gulf and the gulfs of khambhat and kutch fig 9 the most astounding rms differences are located on the northern australian shelves the taiwan strait and the seto inland sea fig 9 b in particular the rms differences in the coral sea and around torres strait fig 9 b are larger than the discrepancies between the comp it sv model setup and tpxo8 fig 2 c i according to the sources of gebco 2014 the 2009 australian bathymetry and topography grid whiteway 2009 is used around the australian continent within this dataset some of the nearshore bathymetry is made up of multibeam laser airborne depth sounder and nautical charts with the rest based on 1 arc min and 2 arc min etopo satellite derived bathymetry in comparison srtm15 plus is said to include 50 m multibeam datasets from 2012 as well as the deepreef explorer gbr dataset from 2010 both newer than the 2009 australian bathymetry and topography grid 5 2 2 comparisons between srtm15 plus and local high resolution bathymetry another issue with a global bathymetric dataset such as srtm15 plus is that on the shelf and nearshore the resolution can be too coarse and it may contain holes in the bathymetry thus it is not completely reliable for accurate regional simulations this section outlines the differences between srtm15 plus and our more comprehensive bathymetric data table 1 containing local high resolution datasets we focus on three regions the east china sea including the yellow sea and southern japan the south china sea including the philippines seas and north java sea and the coral sea including the torres strait fig 10 all nearshore areas in the east china sea show significant normalized bathymetric differences aside from hong kong which contains our smallest element sizes fig 10 a i due to numerous spurious large depths in the srtm15 plus dataset in this region we replace this area with the local high resolution bathymetry in order to avoid instabilities due to violation of the cfl condition this is not thought to have a large effect on the results of the comparisons between the bathymetric datasets and the conclusions that we draw from them the simulations show large rms differences of the m2 tidal wave in the taiwan strait and seto inland sea fig 10 a ii but interestingly they are not as large as those between gebco and srtm15 plus fig 9 b nor are differences in the gulf of tonkin as pronounced it should be mentioned that we noticed reduced discrepancies at tide gauges in the seto inland sea when using the high resolution bathymetry it is a complicated region with many small islands and channels and requires accurate connectivity of the energy fluxes to improve results most of the rms differences in the yellow sea between srtm15 plus and the local high resolution bathymetry fig 10 a ii are larger than those between gebco and srtm15 plus fig 9 b in particular north of shanghai and in the incheon area however generally these differences are smaller than the discrepancies between tpxo8 and the comp it sv model setup despite widespread normalized bathymetric differences in the philippines and the region between the south china sea and java sea fig 10 b i small rms differences in the m2 tidal wave result with the exception of a few channels near singapore and in the gulfs near batang lupar and north kalimantan both on borneo fig 10 b ii this is perhaps partly because the m2 amplitudes are relatively small in the region between the south china sea and java sea fig 2 a i although it is not shown the larger k1 fig 2 a ii produces up to 10 30 cm rms difference in the area south of singapore but is not notable elsewhere in the two gulfs on borneo which have fairly large m2 tidal ranges up to 1 7 m in the gulf near batang lupar fig 2 the differences result not only from local high resolution bathymetric datasets but are due to hand edits vis à vis fugawi navigational charts areas like the gulf near batang lupar can be extremely sensitive to bathymetry particularly deep in the gulf where the v shape concentrates the tidal energy the effect of our hand edits is to deepen the area near batang lupar allowing the tidal range to reach close to the measured one the final region is the coral sea which demonstrably shows large widespread normalized bathymetric differences fig 10 c i this is slightly perplexing as srtm15 plus should include the deepreef explorer gbr dataset according to their references ftp topex ucsd edu pub srtm15 plus however the srtm15 plus version used in this study does not seem to have it incorporated the bathymetry in the torres strait and papua new guinea region is also very different from srtm15 plus where we have used gebco 2014 in our more comprehensive bathymetric dataset this is because gebco 2014 matches rather well with deepreef explorer gbr at the interface whereas srtm15 plus does not the resulting m2 rms differences shown here fig 10 c ii are certainly large and often well exceed discrepancies between our model and tpxo8 fig 2 in fact in most of the coral sea the comp it sv model setup is performing rather well with respect to tpxo8 which could be largely attributed to the deepreef explorer gbr dataset significant discrepancies for our model against tpxo8 and tide gauges are still present near the torres strait fig 10 c ii where opposing m2 energy fluxes meet over the strait fig 6 the residual discrepancy here is likely a combination of the remaining uncertainties in the gebco 2014 bathymetry based on 2009 australian bathymetry and topography grid and bottom friction dissipation 5 2 3 discussion the effect of different bathymetric datasets is not shown to be an important factor in the deep ocean but on the shelf and nearshore there are certain regions where bathymetry plays a large role this has been also highlighted in terms of the global rms discrepancies presented in 4 4 2 summarized in table 4 in some cases the rms differences between simulations using different bathymetric datasets are greater than discrepancies between tpxo8 and the comp it sv model setup particularly between the two global bathymetric datasets our more comprehensive bathymetric data and srtm15 plus are mostly the same except nearshore in certain regions which is likely the reason for smaller rms differences in general as discussed in previous studies e g egbert et al 2004 green 2010 zaron 2017 bathymetry has the potential to control the tidal elevation particularly through resonant effects that are in general nonlocal for example the effect of the deepreef explorer gbr high resolution bathymetry is to change the m2 elevation over a large area beyond the coral sea out into the deep ocean conversely only small changes are noted throughout the region between the south china sea and java sea more locally in a resonant basin such as the gulf near batang lupar hand edits of the bathymetry based on fugawi navigational charts allow the tidal elevation to reach close to the measured m2 amplitude clearly greater availability and quality of nearshore and shelf bathymetry has the potential to greatly improve the modeling not only of tides but all shallow water flows with regards to the effect of the bathymetry in the deep ocean it should be noted that bathymetry will affect internal tide energy conversion as the dissipation matrix is based on topographic depths and slopes so technically the deep ocean may be more impacted than is shown here taking this aspect into account nevertheless addition of the abyssal hill roughness for example has only marginally increased the fidelity of ocean models buijsman et al 2015 timko et al 2017 in 3d baroclinic models arbic et al 2010 2012 timko et al 2017 this can be explained in part by limitations of resolution on the other hand 2d barotropic models such as indwpac can achieve high resolution over a wide scale but may be somewhat limited by the underlying assumptions of internal tide energy conversion no matter the bathymetric data greater discussion on this aspect is presented in the next section 5 3 internal tide energy conversion in the two internal tide energy conversion parameterizations 3 3 it is necessary to calibrate a global amplification factor due to unknowns involved with the resolution of the bathymetric data and the way in which dissipation that is overestimated at supercritical slopes is handled due to their linear assumptions in addition to finding these amplification factors this section discusses the differences between the two parameterization methods introduces multiplier coefficients due to semi diurnal resonance in the luzon strait and concludes with some final remarks on reasons for differences between the methods and remaining issues for the parameterization of internal tide energy conversion 5 3 1 calibrating amplification factors we begin by trying to determine the optimal values of cnyc and cdir for the indwpac model before comparing the performance of both parameterization methods this is evaluated by looking at d t p x for the m2 and k1 tidal waves in deep water h 500 m with a spatially constant bottom friction cf 2 5 10 3 to a lesser degree we are also interested in the total dissipation td of individual tidal constituents comparisons of d t p x versus td in deep water for the m2 and k1 tidal waves are shown in fig 11 a b using four different values of amplification factors for each method regarding the k1 tidal wave amplification factors slightly smaller than the values tested appear optimal in both parameterization methods however we focus on the results of the m2 tidal wave to determine the optimal amplification factors this leads to cnyc 2 9 and cdir 0 22 based on a second order polynomial best fit for comparison buijsman et al 2015 determined cnyc 2 75 which is in close agreement furthermore two modifications are applied to the nonlocal method the first modification simply ensures that the dissipation matrix is positive definite pd a second modification involves applying gaussian smoothing of nb to obtain a variable denoted as nbav using the same radius and scaling as the convolution integral for j the argument being that nonlocal effects of buoyancy may be just as important as nonlocal effects of topography both modifications create more dissipation and make d t p x for m2 smaller for the same value of cnyc fig 11 with the pd modification having the largest effect 5 3 2 differences between parameterization methods two opposing outcomes result from the comparison between the nonlocal and local methods for both constituents the nonlocal method leads to slightly smaller values of d t p x while td at the optimal amplification factor matches tpxo8 in deep water more closely for the local method since tpxo8 can be reliably validated for elevations but not for dissipation we are inclined to prefer the nonlocal method thus it is incorporated into our best model results presented in 4 it is however worth pointing out that the difference between the methods is no more than 15 mm in d t p x for m2 thus the local method can be considered a very useful parameterization in its own right not least because it can be quickly calculated and introduced to a numerical model with regards to total dissipation the optimal nonlocal method results in 24 greater m2 td compared with tpxo8 see fig 12 for a comparison of the dissipation densities computed through 17 with the area integral omitted the global hycom model has a similar td ratio 23 greater versus tpxo8 buijsman et al 2015 who note that the tpxo8 dissipation rates are diffused over large areas in comparison to the parameterized internal tide energy conversion in their model we also see this in fig 12 in that sense it is somewhat unclear how reliable tpxo8 dissipation in deep water may be issues with tidal dissipation in global data assimilated models have been previously highlighted lyard et al 2006 le provost and lyard 1997 and there are large regions of negative dissipation rates when computing this with the tpxo8 solutions fig 12 b depth wise the characteristics of local and large scale nonlocal topographic effects tend to translate into the nonlocal method creating greater dissipation in shallower depths fig 11 c both methods give large amounts of dissipation in the 3000 4000 m range corresponding to abyssal hills but a general observation we find is that the nonlocal method focuses dissipation towards the center peaks of the ridges whilst the local method tends to spread dissipation over the width of the ridge as mentioned above it remains unclear whether the overestimate in dissipation from both schemes in the 500 4000 m depth range and underestimate in the 4500 6000 m range is a major cause of concern or it simply reflects the coarseness of the data assimilated model buijsman et al 2015 found similar trends to this study for their global model the differences in amplitudes of the m2 tidal wave between the nonlocal and local methods are illustrated in fig 13 there is a clear divide between amplitudes in the indian ocean and those in the western pacific ocean this indicates disparity in the way the m2 tides are balanced between basins depending on the method the nonlocal method dissipates more in shallower depths fig 11 c so it is perhaps unsurprising that the amplitudes will be smaller in the western pacific basin which contains many shallow shelves and island chains moreover the energy flux density p of the m2 tidal wave predominantly flows from the indian ocean into the western pacific basin through the indonesian seas and to a lesser extent through the malacca strait fig 6 due to the greater dissipation in shallow depths in the passages through the island chains and shallow seas more energy remains on the indian ocean side instead of flowing into the western pacific basin compared with the local method 5 3 3 multiplier due to semi diurnal resonance over the luzon strait a local improvement to internal tide energy conversion is applied over the luzon strait the luzon strait controls the amount of energy into the south china sea for both the m2 and k1 tidal waves fig 6 here the amplitude of k1 is mostly larger than m2 fig 2 because the separation of the double ridge topography in the strait is similar to the semi diurnal internal tide wavelength it has been shown that resonance dramatically increases the barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion buijsman et al 2014 in comparison to the sum of the two ridges considered separately the double ridge produces up to as much as four times the energy conversion for the first internal mode buijsman et al 2014 since our internal tide energy conversion parameterizations do not include such resonance behavior we deem it appropriate to apply a multiplier to the amplification coefficients in the region 19 5 21 5 n and 120 122 5 e the multiplier coefficients cluzon are defined using a skewed gaussian curve as a function of latitude ϕ to approximate the data points presented in buijsman et al 2014 18 c l u z o n 1 a l 2 σ l π exp ξ l 2 2 σ l 2 1 erf α l ξ l 2 σ l with al 5 0 σl 0 3 αl 1 0 and ξ l ϕ 20 9 n cluzon reaches a maximum of 4 24 at 20 75 n fig 14 shows the amplitude differences for the m2 and k1 tidal waves in the south china sea and surroundings from the optimal nonlocal method with and without the multiplier coefficients cluzon as expected the increase to the internal tide coefficients reduces the amplitudes inside most of the south china sea for both constituents the decrease is on the order of 0 5 1 cm for m2 in most areas with a few pockets of 2 5 5 cm reductions additionally the blockage increases amplitudes slightly to the east of the strait and in the sulu sea the k1 amplitude is decreased in the south china sea by 1 2 5 cm almost uniformly furthermore due to the blockage at the luzon strait more of the energy flux is now diverted down into the indonesian seas fig 6 increasing amplitudes uniformly by 0 5 1 cm m2 rms discrepancies at coastal tide gauges are generally decreased about 1 cm within the south china sea due to the cluzon multiplier coefficients the discrepancy is increased slightly in the sulu sea and near the taiwan strait the changes in k1 discrepancies do not follow a clear pattern aside from the gulf of thailand and celebes sea regions decrease and increase respectively the rms discrepancies against tide gauges and tpxo8 in the plotted region fig 14 are summarized in table 6 overall only small decreases in discrepancies are found when using the cluzon multiplier coefficients the magnitude of discrepancies are comparable to local hydrodynamic models for the south china sea region green and david 2013 gao et al 2015 we obtain 8 5 cm and 5 0 cm rmse for m2 and k1 versus tpxo8 respectively green and david 2013 quote 9 cm and 10 cm in green and david 2013 cf had to be raised to an unphysical value of 0 01 to achieve optimal results for m2 it was speculated that this is because the internal tide energy conversion rates in e g the luzon strait are underestimated for m2 perhaps the increased cf may have accounted for additional dissipation in the luzon strait that the cluzon multiplier coefficients applied here are trying to achieve although it is shown here that the effects of applying cluzon are somewhat small furthermore green and david 2013 use a different method to cap dissipation at supercritical slopes in which this is the case in parts of the luzon strait that may not be appropriate locally bathymetric differences and the higher grid resolution in indwpac also likely play a role in helping to obtain relatively accurate tidal elevations in the indwpac model in addition by including wind and baroclinic forcing cai et al 2006 were able to obtain smaller rmse values compared to a barotropic model without atmospheric forcing in the south china sea thus our model may further improve if these forcings are included 5 3 4 discussion as a result of the dissipation dynamics we find that the local method gives better results in the western indian ocean but elsewhere the nonlocal method is generally preferable it is worth noting that the m2 amplitude differences fig 13 in the indian ocean between the two methods is in the range 0 5 2 5 cm and greater in the bay of bengal this is a rather large amplitude difference in the deep ocean since d t p x 2 9 cm indicating that there is some scope to improve deep water solutions further through better parameterization of internal tide energy conversion perhaps some of the remaining issues for the nonlocal method can be explained by the fact that bathymetry is still rather uncertain and coarse in much of the deep ocean most of the indian ocean is deep with very narrow shelves and internal tide energy conversion is an important dissipation mechanism furthermore internal tide energy conversion in shallow regions is less reliable because of larger tidal velocities and uncertainties and there is a greater chance of the flow being supercritical melet et al 2013 in fact one of the main effects of the nbav modification to the nonlocal method is to move some dissipation away from shallow regions into deeper regions fig 11 c additional investigation into the parameterization of internal tide energy conversion in shallow regions is warranted especially because the shallow areas of the indonesian seas provide a critical connection between the basins a region that has created issues previously melet et al 2013 finally it is worth highlighting that the internal tide energy conversion matrices used here have been derived based on the m2 tidal wave that is ω 2 π 12 42 rad hr are used in 4 and 5 and the optimal amplification factors are determined from results for m2 however theoretically diurnal internal tides become trapped in latitudes higher than 30 as f ω and no barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion due to freely propagating internal waves results because we apply the dissipation matrix for m2 some energy conversion of diurnal tides does occur at these higher latitudes in our model however without separating the modes and taking into account the influences from the other constituents similar to methods for bottom friction e g le provost and lyard 1997 it is unclear how selective dissipation for each mode is possible using this type of parameterization in a forward model instead jayne and st laurent 2001 decided to ignore the relationship between ω and f here our assumption for internal tide energy conversion is that the m2 tidal wave dominates the signal nevertheless smaller amplification factors are optimal for the k1 tidal wave fig 11 b than those for m2 fig 11 a although using the internal tide energy conversion parameterization does improve the k1 tides versus not including it furthermore in the luzon strait only resonance of the semi diurnal internal tides occurs so theoretically the multiplier coefficients cluzon should not be applied to the diurnal tides perhaps including information from measurements and operational baroclinic 3d models e g hycom chassignet et al 2007 may provide us with an opportunity to locally improve dissipation matrices for depth integrated barotropic models although we are still somewhat limited by the assumptions of the underlying parameterization 5 4 bottom friction dissipation this section summarizes the effect of implementing the spatially varying cf map fig 15 a based on sediment types and tidal current speeds fig 6 into the indwpac model firstly it is useful to highlight regions where we expect bottom friction to have a large effect zaron 2017 recently introduced a bottom friction number zf for the k th constituent to quantitatively illustrate this 19 z f k 2 c f u f u k h 2 ω k u k 2 c f u f u k h 2 where ωk is the tidal frequency of the k th constituent the term ωk corresponds to local acceleration since depth and velocities are highly correlated velocity and cf are to some extent also correlated but much less so it is clear from 19 that the effect of cf is in fact secondary to the effects of h thus a global map of zf based on the spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 simulation ought to suffice for visualization purposes fig 15 b zf shows a similar pattern for the k1 tidal wave not shown as the plotted m2 tidal wave on the continental shelves at depths 100 m zf is generally in the 0 1 0 5 range and only becomes larger than 0 5 close to the coast in depths much less than 50 m see also zaron 2017 regions where zf is large correlate to areas where the tidal solutions will be most impacted by any variability in cf when implementing the spatially varying cf map fig 15 a specific areas with relatively large zf that are noticeably different to cf 2 5 10 3 include the yellow sea and southern japan small cf in the yellow sea large cf just south of the yellow sea and in the seto inland sea the area between the java sea and south china sea near singapore mostly large cf with pockets of small cf and timor and arafura seas both large and small cf the change in amplitudes for the m2 and k1 tidal waves in these three regions when using the spatially varying cf map over the spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 are illustrated in fig 16 changes in the rms discrepancy at the coastal tide gauges are also plotted the mean discrepancies at the coastal tide gauges within the boxed regions are summarized in table 6 the following sections detail the findings at each region individually followed by a discussion of the results 5 4 1 yellow sea and southern japan in the census sediment database the yellow sea is designated as a mud sediment type we also modified the database to ensure that bohai sea and hangzhou bay are designated as mud sediment types and the tidal currents are very large over the shallow basin this leads to small values of cf between 7 5 10 4 and 2 0 10 3 except close to the coastline where cf becomes large due to small depths in 6 a patch of sand just south of the yellow sea causes cf to exceed 4 0 10 3 here additionally a sand zone throughout most of the seto inland sea induces a large cf 4 0 10 3 the tidal amplitudes increase due to the spatially varying cf in most of the yellow sea and decrease just south of the yellow sea due to the mud and sand zones respectively for both constituents the m2 amplitude is also decreased in the western seto inland sea but there is no noticeable change for k1 impressively the rms discrepancy is decreased almost everywhere for both constituents aside from a couple of outliers in the yellow sea and for a group of stations in the eastern seto inland sea for m2 for example the discrepancy is decreased by up to 25 cm and 5 cm for m2 and k1 respectively at many yellow sea locations it appears that the combination of the small friction in the yellow and bohai seas and the large friction just south of the yellow sea and in the korea japan strait results in systematic positive changes to the solution overall the mean rms discrepancies versus coastal tide gauges decrease by 4 9 cm 28 for m2 and 0 71 cm 19 for k1 due to the spatially varying cf here 5 4 2 area between the java sea and south china sea the region in between the java sea and south china sea is predominantly designated as a sand zone cf 4 0 10 3 with pockets of fine grain calcareous sediment cf 2 0 10 3 and volcanic ash cf 3 0 10 3 in the census sediment database there is only a small number of data points in the census to back up these sediment types the m2 amplitudes decrease most significantly in the region close to singapore due to the higher values of cf and zf here in response to this decrease in amplitude the m2 rms discrepancies in this region increase by approximately 5 cm a large scale decrease in k1 amplitudes occurs southeast of singapore but there are no coastal tide gauges there to measure the effect on the discrepancy a band of increased k1 amplitude in between singapore and borneo which increases the rms discrepancies at the tide gauges is also present the mean total free surface rms discrepancies are increased versus tide gauges by 1 4 cm 8 5 overall table 6 thus increasing cf from the base value of 0 025 to the sediment current informed estimate clearly degrades the accuracy in both the semi diurnal and diurnal constituents suggesting that either the census sediment database is not correct or that the high current speeds in the malacca strait artificially increase the friction coefficient for the sand sediment type we believe that the comprehensive bathymetry in this heavily trafficked region is reliable in that it matches navigation charts well 5 4 3 timor and arafura seas the timor sea is designated as a sand sediment type in the census sediment database while the arafura sea is designated as mainly fine grained calcareous sediment with a couple of pockets of sand types as a result in most of the timor sea cf 4 0 10 3 except for nearshore in the joseph bonaparte gulf where the tidal velocities are very large causing cf to decrease as the fine grained sediment bedforms are washed out tidal current speeds are fairly small in the gulf of carpentaria fig 6 so even though some of sediment is fine grained cf is similar to the standard value 2 5 10 3 north of arnhem the sediment is fine grained and the tidal current speeds are fairly large fig 6 hence cf becomes smaller than the standard value because most of the region has larger values of cf than the standard value tidal amplitudes tend to decrease for both constituents on the whole fig 16 iii exceptions are the van diemen gulf small cf north of arnhem small cf nearshore with high cf just offshore and east of the torres strait but only for m2 the mechanism for the latter is mainly through dampening of the energy fluxes traveling east towards the torres strait as they encounter the sand zones in the timor and arafura seas this results in less resistance to the westward directed energy fluxes into the torres strait see fig 6 increasing amplitudes to the east of the strait in general using the spatially varying cf leads to poorer results for both constituents only deep in the joseph bonaparte gulf and at a couple of stations near the van diemen gulf with smaller cf values does the m2 rms discrepancy decrease mean total free surface rms discrepancies at tide gauges increase by 1 7 cm 6 6 due to the spatially varying cf again this could be related to the sediment information derived from the census sediment data or from the friction coefficient estimation in addition the degree of uncertainty of the bathymetry is high as explored in 5 2 which will substantially influence the dissipation and the energy fluxes 5 4 4 discussion results summarized in the above sections highlight one region the yellow sea and southern japan that experienced wholesale decreases in the discrepancies at tidal stations by significant magnitudes and two regions with small increases in discrepancies when using the spatially varying cf map over the standard c f 2 5 10 3 the yellow sea region represents a flagship result of the possibilities of using a data informed approach to estimating bottom friction coefficients over using a standard value furthermore the distribution of cf used in the region is in close agreement to previous studies for example lefevre et al 2000 found a small value of cf 1 5 10 3 to be optimal throughout the east china sea yellow sea region more interestingly the distribution of cf closely resembles the optimal one determined through the adjoint method lu and zhang 2006 this may appear to indicate that the adjoint method can estimate cf values that correspond to physical characteristics of the seabed such as the muddy nature throughout most of the yellow sea however it is not clear whether the sand zone south of the yellow sea creating an increase in cf similar to the optimal distribution of cf in lu and zhang 2006 is simply a coincidence or not due to the sparseness of data points in the census here and the tendency of sand zones in the other two regions to in fact increase discrepancies the arafura sea in the census is mainly fine grained calcareous but there are two pockets of sand zones however according to the grain size map presented in porter smith et al 2004 we expect the arafura sea and gulf of carpentaria to be fairly muddy with small grain sizes in the timor sea the census contains many data points that are used to determine that the sediment is sandy here this may be the case but our definition of the sediment grain size of sand does not seem to match porter smith et al 2004 who indicate fairly small grain sizes for the region the rest of the australian shelf has fairly large grain sizes porter smith et al 2004 but they are mainly designated as ooze types in the census it can be assumed that there are similar issues with sediment types and the correlation of these to physical sediment characteristics in the area between the java sea and south china sea this indicates that the census is generally insufficient for our purpose due to the relative sparseness of the data particularly of terrestrial type sediments and because it requires us to estimate the grain size and density from the sediment types the physical characteristic of sand for example can vary considerably we have experimented with changing some of the sediment type definitions of the census for example the sandy sediment definition in the area between java sea and south china sea is changed to fine grained calcareous sediment which decreases the discrepancies around singapore for m2 similarly all of the arafura sea is changed to a muddy sediment type and timor sea to fine grained calcareous sediment based on the grain size figure in porter smith et al 2004 this leads to generally improved results in future studies if actual physical sediment characteristics from databases e g porter smith et al 2004 buczkowski et al 2006 could be adopted with a focus on regions where zf exceeds 0 4 0 5 there are indications that non trivial improvements to tidal solutions can be achieved e g yellow sea bohai sea and seto inland sea 6 conclusions this study has presented a finite element barotropic model of the indian and western pacific oceans with elemental resolution ranging from as small as 100 m in hong kong up to 25 km in less barotropically interesting areas of the deep ocean most of the resolution at the coast is 1 km bathymetry has been sourced predominantly from the global srtm bathymetric database in addition to local high resolution datasets and hand edits at first comparisons of the indwpac model results with both the data assimilated tpxo8 atlas and tidal constituents at tide gauges in deep continental shelf and slope waters and at the coast have been shown this has been followed by a presentation of the sensitivities to lateral boundary conditions bathymetry internal tide energy conversion and bottom friction dissipation within each of these sections a discussion of the findings and implications with regards to the sensitivity for that component has been presented the key results e g rms discrepancies for the comp it sv model setup and conclusions for each region deep shelf and coastal follows deep water m2 mean rms discrepancies against tpxo8 are 2 9 cm rmse 3 6 cm which is marginally better than reported for other forward hydrodynamic models however the total free surface rms discrepancies at deep water tide gauges are 2 3 times those of the tpxo8 atlas poorly placed elevation specified lateral boundaries lead to global resonant amplifications of the lunar semi diurnal modes an absorption generation sponge zone suppresses the resonant amplifications but it relies on data assimilated model fluxes e g tpxo8 and similar models which may not be as reliable as the elevations from these models a comprehensive global forward model may have advantages in eliminating the uncertainties from the boundary conditions strictly bathymetric effects are not of great importance to the deep water solution however internal tide energy conversion that relies on topographic features and slopes for parameterization is shown to be the key control in deep water the nonlocal method for internal tide energy conversion is shown to obtain marginally superior results to the local method but the latter is more dissipative in the indian ocean and hence results in smaller m2 amplitudes there which match tpxo8 slightly better there is evidence that there is scope to further improve the deep water solution through internal tide energy conversion but it is probably not possible using the same paradigm strict reliance on the nonlocal equation and calibration of a global amplification factor as presented here significant local modifications based on 3d baroclinic models and measurements including improvements to internal tide energy conversion in shallower waters are likely required continental shelf and slope water m2 mean rms discrepancies against tpxo8 are 6 5 cm rmse 10 1 cm this is shown to be significantly superior to those reported for other forward hydrodynamic models rmse 19 28 cm stammer et al 2014 albeit these are global errors the total energy density is at least as large in the indwpac domain compared to the rest of the world s ocean one of the most important factors for improvement is shown to be the inclusion of local high resolution bathymetry notable changes in the m2 amplitude and a corresponding reduction in the rms discrepancies against tpxo8 and at tide gauges are evident in the greater yellow sea region due to changes in bottom friction coefficients based on combinations of muddy and sandy sediment types however the regions around the java and south china seas and timor and arafura seas do not generate significant nor positive changes to the discrepancy if more complete databases of physical characteristics of sediment are made available combined with accurate local bathymetric data it may be possible to improve solutions elsewhere particularly in resonant basins e g gulfs of khambhat and kutch on the west coast of india king sound joseph bonaparte gulf and van diemen gulf in northern australia among others due to spatially varying bottom friction coefficients nevertheless we are still limited by residual discrepancies from deeper waters and the uncertainties of internal tide energy conversion in shallower waters the discrepancies at the coast for the indwpac model are not significantly different from those obtained further offshore on the shelf furthermore the mean total free surface rms discrepancies at coastal tide gauges d t g 14 cm are 2 6 cm smaller than those of the tpox8 atlas however the discrepancies at the majority of locations are smaller for the tpxo8 atlas due to data assimilation offshore and at selected tide gauges the large mean rms discrepancy for the tpxo8 atlas is likely related to tpxo8 s coarser resolution not resolving certain nearshore features and harbor complexes in detail and therefore not correctly propagating the tides into them for example bathymetric and bottom friction controls are both found to play a very important role nearshore and in some cases dominate the reasons for discrepancy due to resonance in a basin or inadequate connectivity into a bay in contrast the indwpac model does not have such a large number or magnitude of outlier locations these results are an indication that the model adequately captures a large amount of the nearshore physics throughout the domain thus the model is potentially suitable to simulate a great range of shallow water physics within the region specifically into detailed harbor complexes and other nearshore features where the tide gauges are located if we are solely interested in tidal elevations then the simple answer is to use data assimilation within the indwpac model to achieve highly accurate solutions from the deep ocean all the way to the well resolved coastal regions however in many other applications such as the forecasting and analysis of coupled surge tide and wave processes capturing the large scale responses to meteorology and modeling the shallow water physics including the nonlinear interactions of the processes becomes vital in order to accomplish this correctly specifying high resolution bathymetry and topography becomes a controlling factor furthermore physics based improvements to more accurately quantify dissipation within forward barotropic models are possible offshore through coupling to coarser 3d baroclinic

24092,in this study a 9 6 million node large scale unstructured grid finite element forward barotropic model is developed and applied to understand the tidal dynamics and dissipation mechanisms of the indian and western pacific oceans down to sub kilometer scale at the coast tidal model data comparisons are presented to assess the capabilities and limitations of our large scale barotropic model the average root mean square rms discrepancies of tidal elevations at coastal tide gauges is 14 cm which is 3 cm smaller than those of a state of the art global data assimilated barotropic tidal model sensitivities to lateral boundary conditions bathymetry and dissipative processes are explored to guide future endeavors related to large scale barotropic modeling in the region and other regions throughout the world lateral boundary conditions are found to induce adverse resonant effects on the lunar semi diurnal modes when poorly placed elevation specified boundary conditions are used this problem is largely resolved by using an absorption generation layer at the boundary parameterization of internal tide energy conversion is identified as the most important aspect to control deep water solutions and help reduce the rms discrepancies of the entire system two forms of this parameterization are presented and their spatial distributions of dissipation are compared bathymetry has a negligible effect on the tidal solutions in deep water but local high resolution bathymetry results in significant reductions to the average rms discrepancies on the continental shelf 26 and at the coast 30 implementing a spatially varying bottom friction coefficient based on sediment types decreases the average rms discrepancy at the coast by 9 predominantly due to its positive effects in the yellow sea the model is shown to capture a large amount of the tidal physics and has the potential for application to a range of barotropic problems such as wind driven surge and tidal processes keywords finite element unstructured grid barotropic tides bathymetry internal tide energy conversion bottom friction 1 introduction the indian and western pacific oceans represent approximately 30 of the surface area of the world oceans they are interconnected by marginal seas such as the java timor banda andaman and arafura seas and are separated by the intricate island chains of indonesia and the philippines major ports and cities are located in the northern parts of both the indian ocean dubai karachi mumbai colombo and the western pacific ocean hong kong shanghai tokyo singapore representing a significant portion of the world s economy and human population thus within this region which we call indwpac hereafter there is great interest in being able to better understand coastal hazards and hydrodynamics for e g coastal protection and management risk evaluation and navigational purposes for such purposes our long term objective is to develop a large domain depth integrated forward model of the indwpac region which couples tides atmospheric driven currents density driven circulation and wind waves the focus is to advance the modeling of these individual processes and systematically understand the interactivity of dissipation mechanisms bathymetric sensitivities and lateral boundary forcing mechanisms on the response functions throughout this domain in particular our interests lie on inner shelf and estuarine processes and how these mechanisms impact coastal and inland water levels and currents this is notwithstanding the challenge of the indwpac region in terms of its complex geometry topography such as the many interconnected shallow seas and island chains and associated hydrodynamics in comparison with e g the western north atlantic region that has received significant attention hope et al 2013 kerr et al 2013 bunya et al 2010 to model the dynamics at coastal and inland locations within the indwpac region all processes and exchanges from ocean scale to harbor inlet scale must be appropriately represented coarse resolution global models e g egbert et al 2004 green and nycander 2013 buijsman et al 2015 green et al 2017 have been developed to simulate the large scale global ocean dynamics but as a result of grid resolution they may inadequately capture geometric features and nonlinearities of the hydrodynamics in the inner shelf and nearshore region conversely higher resolution shelf scale regional domain models are often developed to accurately capture local effects e g green and david 2013 cai et al 2006 zu et al 2008 in south china sea however accurate lateral boundary conditions are required to propagate in all of the required information from offshore the closer one gets to the coast the more boundary conditions become complicated and difficult to match with the interior domain physics in order to correctly exchange mass momentum and energy across the boundary furthermore regional model parameters are calibrated to generate accurate results in the specific region that may not be generally applicable in other regions thus this study presents the development of an ocean basin scale model which minimizes lateral boundary interaction yet sufficiently resolves energetic processes from the deep water to the coast using a single unstructured computational grid in a physically consistent manner without ad hoc parameterization the scale of this model fits somewhere in between the global scale and shelf scale regional models that are more commonly developed the ocean basin scale model utilizes varying resolutions to produce high fidelity coastal bathymetry of critical geographic and topographic features such as island chains reef systems and floodplain systems provides connectivity to estuarine and harbor systems where dense coastal populations live and captures key dynamics of a large regional domain in which the effects of changing dynamics in a certain region can propagate into other regions at the same time lateral boundaries are placed further offshore than shelf scale regional models thus more focus is placed on the inner model dynamics allowing the governing physics to equilibrate without constraining the system hence a more accurate understanding of the controls and the extent of impact throughout the domain may be obtained note that in future work as computational resources allow we would like to extend this ocean basin scale model to the global scale while maintaining high resolution in the coastal areas the aim is to systematically build complexity into the external forcing terms and the underlying physics in the process sensitivity of the dynamical system and sub grid scale parameterizations will be explored to assess the capabilities and limitations of the model in the indwpac region in this study we begin this process through model data comparisons of tidal elevations predominantly and tidal currents due to astronomical forcing since tides can be reduced to a series of harmonic constituents of well defined frequencies model data comparisons can be robustly made comparisons are conducted against point observations at tide gauges and regionally against global data assimilative model atlases examples of the latter include tpxo8 egbert and erofeeva 2002 http volkov oce orst edu tides tpxo8 atlas html fes2014 lyard et al 2006 https www aviso

coastal tide gauges to accurately obtain estimates of the tidal elevation fields in terms of individual harmonic constituents m2 tidal wave root mean square errors rmse of modern data assimilated models are typically 0 5 0 7 cm versus deep ocean bottom pressure recorder stations stammer et al 2014 in contrast m2 rmse ranges within 5 6 12 7 cm for purely hydrodynamic global models without data assimilation stammer et al 2014 however non assimilative forward models on large domains can be applied to a wide variety of problems including wind pressure ice and wave coupling effects and may be used to conduct past egbert et al 2004 green 2010 wilmes and green 2014 green et al 2017 or future forecasting and perturbation response analysis green and david 2013 e g due to changing sea level large scale ice sheet collapse wilmes et al 2017 dredging operations and land reclamation suh et al 2014 importantly this study explores the sensitivities of various controls on the barotropic tidal dynamics at first the effects of lateral boundary placement and the addition of an absorption generation sponge layer at the lateral boundary are discussed secondly the responses to two different global bathymetric databases are directly compared thirdly high resolution local bathymetric data are included where available to assess its potential to facilitate improvements in the solution lastly internal tide and bed stress bottom friction driven dissipative effects are explored after it was discovered that around 25 30 of the total global tidal dissipation is in the deep ocean egbert and ray 2000 the conversion of barotropic energy into baroclinic energy through the generation of internal tides over rough submarine topography was determined to be an important process to include in ocean tide models for a review see garrett and kunze 2007 parameterizations of internal tide energy conversion in which it is incorporated as a sink term through this process is critical to reduce tidal elevation discrepancies in barotropic ocean models jayne and st laurent 2001 egbert et al 2004 zaron and egbert 2006 green and nycander 2013 buijsman et al 2015 the effects of the energy conversion parameterization in the indwpac region including comparisons between two different forms of parameterization are discussed in addition spatially varying bottom friction coefficients in the parameterization of bed stress are rarely considered in large scale models instead a canonical spatially constant coefficient is commonly applied lyard et al 2006 egbert and erofeeva 2002 however changing the bottom friction coefficient has been shown to have positive effects regionally kerr et al 2013 lefevre et al 2000 we briefly discuss the impacts of estimating spatially varying coefficients based on local sediment types and the local hydrodynamics the requirements for improved estimations of local bottom friction coefficients for future research are considered to summarize this paper describes the development of the indwpac unstructured grid and hydrodynamic modeling system 2 3 it is built with state of the art bathymetric datasets 2 absorption generation boundary conditions 3 5 and data informed parameterizations of internal tide energy conversion 3 3 and bottom friction dissipation 3 4 we analyze the sensitivity of the model to these four factors 5 and conduct model data comparisons of tidal elevations and tidal currents against both tide gauge records and a data assimilated tidal model 4 the capabilities and limitations of the model are identified and discussed 4 5 suggested areas of focus to advance barotropic coastal ocean models are highlighted 2 domain definition bathymetry and unstructured grid development our ocean basin scale model includes the entire indian ocean the western half of the pacific ocean and the southern ocean between these extents specifically the domain fig 1 lies between 17 9 e 175 8 e longitude and 73 3 s 62 7 n latitude covering an area of roughly 150 million km2 there are two open ocean boundaries a longitudinal parallel boundary running from nearby the cape of good hope south africa to antarctica and a concave shaped boundary between the bering sea coast of kamchatka krai russia and antarctica the boundaries were chosen so that tidal amphidromic points and complications with the aleutian hawaiian and new zealand islands in the pacific ocean were avoided an illustration on the effects of boundary placement is shown in 5 1 the mesh is a triangular unstructured grid with resolution ranging from as large as 25 km in parts of the deep ocean down to 1 km along most coastlines fig 1 b additionally resolution is as fine as 100 m in the ports and harbors of hong kong tokyo bay and osaka bay the mesh contains a total of 9 6 million nodes and 18 8 million elements development of the unstructured mesh is achieved predominantly through an automated algorithm developed in house based on the matlab distmesh code persson and strang 2004 resolution is varied through an edgelength local grid resolution function λe defined as the minimum of three criteria 1 λ e min λ m α d d t α w g h 2 π α s h h where λm is the nominal minimum edgelength d is the distance from a node to the closest coastline boundary t is the period of the m2 tidal wave h is the bathymetric depth and αi are the dimensionless user defined coefficients for each criterion distance from the coastline αd 0 075 wavelength αw 600 and topographic length scale αs 30 lyard et al 2006 in addition to obtaining higher resolution nearshore to support local bathymetric data and capture complex geometries of the coastline these edgelength criteria ensure that important bathymetric features are adequately represented throughout the ocean model bathymetry fig 1 a is interpolated onto the mesh from a number of sources in a specified order using an automated cell averaging technique bilskie and hagen 2013 as summarized in table 1 references are included here the adopted background bathymetry is the 1 120 srtm30 plus global database becker et al 2009 combined with a synthetic realization of seafloor roughness along the abyssal hills goff and arbic 2010 timko et al 2017 the synthetic abyssal hill roughness is used because the effective resolution of the global altimetric based bathymetry is limited to 10 km in the deep ocean while 1 km resolution is necessary to describe the required topographic roughness that generates internal tides converting barotropic energy into baroclinic energy goff and arbic 2010 melet et al 2013 timko et al 2017 in addition to include depths under ice shelves in antarctica we interpolate from the tpxo8 model bathymetry containing the padman et al 2002 dataset for shallower regions in depths 500 m where the abyssal hill roughness is not important we start by interpolating from the global 1 240 srtm15 plus database which improves on srtm30 plus with newer measured nearshore bathymetry and topography sources thereby reducing the number of erroneous holes in the data on top of this 100 m deepreef explorer great barrier reef and coral seas gbr and kerguelen plateau kp datasets are applied it was discovered that deepreef explorer gbr in the torres strait new guinea region matches substantially better with gebco 2014 than srtm15 plus thus gebco 2014 is applied locally here differences between the two databases are discussed further in 5 2 also 90 m east asia nearshore bathymetry datasets in the philippines japan gulf of thailand south china sea and east china sea regions and local high resolution bathymetry and grids privately obtained for tokyo bay and south korea are applied however even in the high resolution datasets erroneous depth in harbor complexes and channels persist these are corrected where possible using data from fugawi navigational charts https www fugawi com however the errors in the final bathymetry that is applied to indwpac are still largely uncertain furthermore the bathymetric data sources included in this study are not exhaustive and there may be others available possibly more accurate than the sources currently used that we have not yet included e g choi et al 2002 krien et al 2016 3 adcirc hydrodynamic model 3 1 governing equations the horizontal two dimensional implementation of the advanced circulation coastal ocean model adcirc 2dh is used to calculate the hydrodynamics westerink et al 2008 1992 the governing equations are the shallow water equations swe in primitive non conservative and barotropic form 2 η t u h σ x η η c 0 3 u t u u f k u g η η e q η s a l c f u u h c u 1 h ν t h u u t σ x u u c 0 where η is the surface elevation h h η is the total water depth in which h is the still water depth u is the depth averaged velocity vector g is the acceleration due to gravity k is the vertical unit vector and f 2 ω sin ϕ is the coriolis parameter in which ω is the angular speed of the earth and ϕ is the latitude the quantity ηeq is the equilibrium tide and ηsal is the ocean self attraction and loading term sal in the dissipation terms cf is the coefficient of bottom friction c is the dissipation matrix due to the internal tide energy conversion and νt is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient that is calculated through the smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 dresback et al 2005 finally we impose an absorption generation sponge layer e g zhang et al 2014 where σ x are the spatially varying absorption coefficients applied over the defined sponge boundary and ηc and uc are the corresponding reference solutions for surface elevation and velocity respectively see 3 5 for details 3 2 ocean self attraction and loading term the ocean self attracting and loading sal term ηsal is related to the yielding of the solid earth to tides and to the weight of the ocean and its self attraction hendershott 1972 for the large scale indwpac domain it is essential to include the effect of sal terms on the tides however since the model is regional the global integrals of the tidal elevations required to be solved iteratively for the sal terms ray 1998 are not available thus in this study the amplitudes and phases of sal for each tidal constituent are simply interpolated from those used in the global data assimilated model fes2014 lyard et al 2006 onto our mesh and forced by reconstructing the time series from the constituents given the accuracy of state of the art global data assimilated models stammer et al 2014 the slowly varying sal terms obtained from these models are also assumed to be sufficiently accurate however the calculation of sal through global integrals to obtain full consistency with the surface elevation including non periodic components is ultimately desired c f apecechea et al 2017 3 3 internal tide energy conversion internal tides generated by flow over rough bathymetry are major contributors to barotropic tidal energy dissipation more precisely the conversion into baroclinic energy in the deep ocean equivalent to around 25 30 of the global total egbert and ray 2000 2001 as a result parameterization of this energy conversion is necessary in barotropic ocean models that include expanses of ocean where major submarine ridges island chains and shelf breaks that induce internal waves are present in this study parameterization of internal tide energy conversion is particularly important since the indian ocean basin contains narrow shelves and vast expanses of open ocean where the dissipation due to internal tides over its well defined abyssal hills is crucial to the accuracy of the tidal solutions parameterizations of internal tide energy conversion are usually based on a linear wave drag type implementation valid only for subcritical topography γ 1 bell 1975 jayne and st laurent 2001 here γ h α in which α ω 2 f 2 n b 2 ω 2 1 2 is the internal wave slope ω is the angular frequency of the pertinent tidal wave m2 in this study and nb is the brunt väisälä frequency at the seabed in this study we investigate two subcritical theory parameterizations for the dissipation matrix c in 3 one based only on local topographic features and another that includes the nonlocal effects on wave generation first we use a simple and robust parameterization that takes into account the directionality of dissipation which we denote as the local method similar to that presented by lyard et al 2006 is 4 c c d i r n b 2 ω 2 n 2 ω 2 1 2 ω h x 2 h x h y h x h y h y 2 where cdir is a scale factor n is the depth averaged brunt väisälä frequency and the subscripts x and y indicate gradients in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions respectively note that we have substituted the typical wavenumber κ in lyard et al 2006 for the fundamental internal mode at the pertinent tidal frequency zaron and egbert 2006 the local method only dissipates across slopes rather than along them second a rigorous formulation for c that includes the nonlocal effects of the nearby topography on internal tide generation melet et al 2013 was derived by nycander 2005 denoted as the nonlocal method hereafter it has the following form in a general coordinate system green and nycander 2013 5 c c n y c n b 4 π h 1 f 2 ω 2 2 j x h x j x h y j y h x j x h y j y h x 2 j y h y where cnyc is a scale factor and j is a convolution integral of a filtered green s function of the topographic heights h defined positive from seabed within a specified radius from the point of interest c f green and nycander 2013 nycander 2005 details of the calculation of the gradients of j h and h the correction to 4 and 5 at supercritical topographical slopes γ 1 and the calculation of the buoyancy frequency terms nb n required for the two methods are detailed in pringle et al 0000 submitted buoyancy frequencies are calculated from the world ocean atlas 2013 mean annual decadal averaged 1955 2012 database of salinity zweng et al 2013 and temperature locarnini et al 2013 note that for h 100 m we set c 0 because the topographic gradients on the continental shelf should be small and bottom friction dissipation starts to dominate here the advantage of the local method is that c is positive definite and it does not require the computationally intensive calculation of j allowing it to be quickly implemented into the model on the other hand the nonlocal method accounts for the nonlocal topographic effects on internal tide generation however c in 5 is not guaranteed to be positive definite since the sign of the gradients of j and h do not necessarily conform furthermore the calculation of the gradients of j is computationally expensive so it is not as readily implemented into a numerical model modifications to get a positive definite c and guassian smoothing of nb to incorporate the nonlocal effects of buoyancy frequencies for the nonlocal method are implemented and briefly evaluated in this study see pringle et al 0000 submitted for details on modifications we also investigate whether the nonlocal method provides any meaningful advantageous effect over the local method by comparing the results between the two methods see 5 3 3 4 bottom friction dissipation dissipation due to bottom friction bed stress is known to account for a significant proportion of dissipation of the barotropic tides particularly in shallow regions h 100 m values for the coefficient of bottom friction cf in the bed stress term refer 3 have shown to be predominantly on the order of 10 3 based on measurements of the flow velocity at 1 m above the bed in continental shelf and estuarine regions e g you 2005 heathershaw 1979 heathershaw and simpson 1978 charnock 1959 thus canonical global values of cf equal to 2 5 10 3 lyard et al 2006 or 3 0 10 3 egbert and erofeeva 2002 are usually applied as a spatial constant in large scale tidal models it has been suggested that deviations from the canonical value of cf globally do not significantly change the overall dissipation but that deviations by an order of ten can significantly degrade the tidal solution lyard et al 2006 nevertheless if other dissipation mechanisms are reliable internal tide energy conversion there is evidence that local variations in cf over the range of physically plausible values 10 4 to 10 2 can improve local tidal solutions e g lefevre et al 2000 in this study we present a semidata informed method of calculating spatially varying cf we aim to show that it is possible to calculate a spatially varying cf map that locally improves tidal elevations based on some knowledge of the seabed and physical properties of the flow notwithstanding the assumptions of the method and uncertainties in the data used to inform the method we start with the log law formulation of cf schlichting 1979 6 c f κ ln 0 5 h z 0 2 where κ 0 4 is the von kármán constant and z 0 is the seabed roughness length which can be equated to an effective sediment roughness ks 30 z 0 it is important to note that ks is not simply a function of the sediment roughness grain size itself rather it is mainly determined by the heights of ripples and dunes bedforms that form due to the prevailing currents which can be a major source of the resultant bed stress heathershaw 1979 to estimate ks that takes into account the bedform heights we use empirical equations van rijn 2007 that are a function of median sediment grain diameter d 50 sediment density relative to water s an effective mean current speed uf and the depth h see appendix a the empirical equations return small values of ks when either the sediments are light and the tidal currents are strong flattening out the bed or when the sediment grains are too heavy for the currents to create bedforms in between these extremes ripples and dunes will form resulting in larger values of ks in addition due to inadequate data availability of their locations a large grain size roughness due to very large rocks or boulders is ignored to obtain the sediment grain sizes we make use of a database of the census of the world s seafloor sediment types dutkiewicz et al 2015 we map these sediment types onto physically reasonable values of d 50 see table 2 for pelagic type sediments oozes and clays cf is set to 2 5 10 3 as a default roughness relative sediment density s 1 722 dry bulk density by mass of sand van rijn 2007 for d 50 dsand s 1 2 natural sediment with organic materials involved van rijn 2007 for d 50 dsilt and is linearly interpolated in between here dsand 6 2 10 5 m and dsilt 3 2 10 5 m where the assumption is made that the finer sized sediments in the census database contain a higher percentage of lighter organic material the effective mean current speed uf is defined as zaron 2017 7 u f u 0 2 0 5 k u k 2 0 5 where u 0 is a constant non tidal current snyder et al 1979 that we set equal to 0 25 m s zaron 2017 and u k are the amplitudes of the east and north components of the tidal currents of the kth constituent the spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 simulation is used to approximate uf in order to compute the spatially varying cf map see 5 4 for details on this cf map and its effectiveness 3 5 lateral boundary conditions lateral open ocean boundaries are forced by reconstructing the elevations from the tidal constituents obtained from a global data assimilative model tpxo8 egbert and erofeeva 2002 in this study we force with the major semi diurnal m2 n2 s2 k2 and diurnal k1 o1 p1 q1 constituents which are also used to force the sal and equilibrium potential terms prescribing the elevations at the open boundaries provides a reflecting boundary condition that allows the velocities to freely satisfy the governing equations in some cases this condition can generate spurious modes that may lead to instabilities utilizing an absorption generation sponge layer can reduce the production of these modes as demonstrated in 5 1 firstly the location and width of the sponge layer l must be specified we take l to be approximately equal to 10 of the wavelength of the m2 tidal wave λ m 2 the overall solution is found to be fairly insensitive to the choice of sponge layer width but for l 0 1 λ m 2 the solutions may not match well across the sponge calculation domain interface to show the location and width of the sponge layer region a hatched region is included in figures throughout this paper in addition the sponge layer requires spatially varying absorption coefficients σ x and reference solutions of the free surface ηc and velocities u c assuming a polynomial type function for the absorptive coefficients inside the sponge layer they are derived from the linear shallow water solution 8 σ σ m r l α 9 σ m g h α 1 ln 1 f l r c l α 1 where r is the distance from the edge of the sponge layer α is the order of the polynomial function f is the reduction factor of the outgoing wave at the position rc from the edge of the sponge the parameters α 2 f 20 and r c l 0 5 are chosen in this study but the solution is not typically sensitive to the choice of these factors the reference solutions ηc and u c are obtained by interpolating tidal constituents from the tpxo8 model onto every vertex node in the sponge zone note that to get u c the conservative transport variable u c h is interpolated from tpxo8 before dividing this by our model nodal depths for consistency 3 6 finite element solution adcirc solves the governing equations in a continuous galerkin framework where the generalized wave continuity equation gwce is utilized to eliminate spurious modes c f westerink et al 1992 the two part symmetrical velocity based method for the lateral stress terms dresback et al 2005 and explicit mass lumping mode are used to solve the gwce in this study a time step δ t 2 s can be used with our current grid without generating courant friedrichs lewy cfl induced numerical instabilities wall clock times are approximately 11 min day 1 of simulation time using 960 computational cores 10 000 finite element nodes per core of a high performance computing machine with haswell processors and a mellanox fdr infiniband network connection to validate the model with observations we simulated for 195 days including a 15 day spin up from a completely zero state the final 180 days are used for the harmonic analysis of the tides the long six month time period is required to correctly separate all the tidal constituents of interest e g k1 and p1 4 summary of tidal validation from best model setup 4 1 best model setup to obtain the best model setup we first find the global amplification factor of the internal tide energy conversion parameter so that the model skill in terms of tidal elevations versus tpxo8 is maximized in the deep ocean h 500 m a positive definite and spatially smoothed nb modified version of the nonlocal method with c n y c 2 9 and local multiplier coefficients over the luzon strait see 5 3 was decided on local bathymetry datasets and hand edits are applied to shallow water regions and responses against coastal tide gauges are checked for reliability in the harmonic analysis finally a map of varying bottom friction dissipation coefficients cf is calculated based on some information of the local sediment types as described in 3 4 in an attempt to increase the model skill versus using a spatially constant cf the best model setup is denoted by comp it sv indicating the use of our comprehensive bathymetric data table 1 optimal internal tide dissipation and spatially varying cf 4 2 measure of model skill to measure the skill of the model for the purpose of determining and evaluating the best setup in 4 4 we compare with the root mean square rms discrepancy d of the elevation either for a single tidal constituent or for the total free surface at a point d is the average of the squared differences between measured and observed elevations integrated over a long period of time it is calculated in this study using the sum of the vector differences of the in phase ak cos θk and quadrature ak sin θk components of each constituent wang et al 2012 10 d 0 5 k a 0 k 2 a m k 2 2 a 0 k a m k cos θ 0 k θ m k 1 2 where ak and θk are the amplitudes and phase lags of the kth constituent respectively and the subscripts o and m refer to the observed and modeled values respectively in addition the relative rms discrepancy is defined as r d d v where v is the absolute average value of the variability in the free surface elevation and is calculated by wang et al 2012 11 v 0 5 k a 0 k 2 1 2 for an overview of the spatial distribution we include scatter plots of d and rd at the tide gauges and contour plots versus tpxo8 in order to highlight regions of notably small or large discrepancies however to obtain a single global metric of performance the mean of the discrepancy d denoted d or the mean of rd denoted r d is used note that when calculating d over a region to compare against tpxo8 tpx this is computed as 12 d t p x d d a d a where d a indicates an area integral that is performed over the elements of the grid when comparing against tide gauges d t g r d t g the arithmetic average is used in comparison to d the rmse metric commonly used e g stammer et al 2014 buijsman et al 2015 is 13 rmse d 2 d a d a i e it is the square root of the mean of d 2 and is always larger than d the rmse may experience abrupt changes with depth and tends to overestimate the overall discrepancy wang et al 2012 in contrast d has been shown to decrease monotonically with depth wang et al 2012 thus we choose to predominantly use d however we also quote values of rmse for comparison with those reported in other studies finally in 4 5 comparisons of the tidal currents at seven tide gauges are shown to evaluate the comparison here the rms discrepancy of the tidal current ellipse dtc cummins and thupaki 2018 for the kth constituent is used 14 d t c k 0 5 u 0 k 2 u 0 k 2 u m k 2 u m k 2 cos g 0 k g m k cos θ 0 k θ m k u 0 k u m k u 0 k u m k sin g 0 k g m k sin θ 0 k θ m k u 0 k u m k u 0 k u m k 1 2 where u k and u k are the amplitudes of the semi major and semi minor tidal current axes respectively θk is the ellipse inclination angle and gk is the phase lag of alignment along the semi major tidal current axis 4 3 tidal gauge database a database of tidal elevation harmonic constituents used to evaluate the model in 4 4 consisting of 39 deep water stations 62 shallow water shelf stations and 659 unique coastal tide gauge locations has been assembled from multiple sources for the computational domain table 3 see pringle 2017 for tide gauge locations and tidal constituent values some of the sources are listed tidal constituent values at websites or in refereed journals denoted const in table 3 other sources are long term hourly time series of elevations denoted elev in table 3 where we have used the utide matlab function ut solv codiga 2011 which uses the iteratively weighted least square harmonic analysis technique to obtain up to 68 tidal constituents within the coastal tide gauge set there are a number of data points duplicated between sources so we set up a hierarchy between the different sources to decide what value to use in our model evaluation based on perceived reliability table 3 is listed in hierarchical order and the number of stations listed for each source is the eventual number after removal of duplicates note that all the phase lags in the database pringle 2017 are referenced to gmt the phase lags from some sources e g scs yellow sea and jma that are posted in terms of local phase lags have been converted in addition posted tidal current harmonic constituents at seven shallow water locations denoted curr in table 3 are used to evaluate the model in 4 5 4 4 tidal elevations 4 4 1 spatial distribution of tidal elevations and discrepancies this study focuses on presenting the m2 and k1 tidal waves and their discrepancies although 4 4 2 presents statistics for a combination of all major eight tidal constituents as well this choice is justified because out of the 760 tide gauges in the domain 4 3 the m 2 constituent is dominant at 625 locations 82 k1 is dominant at 106 locations 14 thus another constituent is dominant at just 29 locations 4 the global responses of the m2 and k1 tidal waves and their rms discrepancies against tpxo8 dtpx for the comp it sv model setup are illustrated in fig 2 the general response for both constituents is well described by our model including the positions of most amphidromes except for the two m2 amphidromes in the southern region of the domain one near the south west tip of australia and another near mawson station antarctica the positions of these amphidromes and the solution in the southern ocean are found to be very sensitive to the boundary conditions applied in this study and may be impacted by the tpxo8 derived velocities in the absorption generation sponge layer see 5 1 the spatial distribution of the rms discrepancies dtg and relative discrepancies rdtg for the comp it sv model setup against tide gauges are also illustrated fig 3 overall tide gauges with similar discrepancies are generally clustered together and there is a relatively strong spatial correlation between discrepancies against tpxo8 and those at tide gauges exceptions to this include much of the inner coast of the yellow sea and the seto inland sea where the tpxo8 model may not be reliable the comp it sv model setup performs particularly well throughout the western pacific ocean including along the japanese archipelago and northeastern australia for both constituents notable wide spread rms discrepancies in the m2 tidal wave appear in the mozambique channel north and west arabian sea red sea sea of okhotsk andaman sea yellow sea northern australian shelf and the celebes sea k1 rms discrepancies are notable in the sea of okhotsk arabian sea south china sea and java seas and the arafura sea predominantly large tidal ranges account for the discrepancies shown for example m2 rdtg values are relatively small in the yellow sea even though dtpx values appear large in the yellow sea for the comp it sv model setup in fact the response is improved rather substantially from the comp it sc model setup here 5 4 rdtg is also less significant than dtg in the mozambique channel and northern australian shelf these two regions are heavily influenced by large scale effects related to lateral boundary conditions 5 1 and internal tide energy conversion 5 3 on the other hand both dtg and rdtg are large in the sea of okhotsk for both constituents the importance of bathymetry in the region which is not well known has been highlighted by zaron 2017 the celebes sea is also a problem area for m2 that is most likely a result of incorrect flux exchanges through the island chains due to inadequate bathymetry and a poor representation of internal tide energy conversion particularly in shallow waters it should be noted that the celebes sea and surrounding indonesian seas was a focus of the original tpxo study egbert and erofeeva 2002 due to its poor forward model responses and the region has been found to cause problems for three dimensional ocean circulation models robertson and ffield 2008 ngodock et al 2016 the south china and java sea region extending down to the torres strait has a relatively large diurnal tidal range and k1 dtg and rdtg values are not small compared to most of the domain the physics of the k1 tidal wave here can be thought of as a standing wave where the response is likely to depend highly on the overall bathymetry and shoreline of the region the region is also heavily influenced by the energy flux permitted through the luzon strait 4 5 which is largely controlled by internal tide energy conversion 5 3 note that in some areas such as between south china sea and java sea which has a small m2 tidal range because it is close to an amphidrome rdtg becomes very large however dtg is relatively small 4 4 2 statistics of tidal elevation discrepancies a summary of the global tide gauge errors shown in terms of amplitudes r 2 0 93 σ s t d 0 09 m e 0 04 m and phases r 2 0 97 σstd 18 3 e 10 3 of up to all eight major tidal constituents from the comp it sv model setup against the observed values is presented fig 4 see caption for definitions of error metrics there is a total of 6080 data points on each plot just 2 4 of them represent absolute amplitude errors 0 2 m and 2 9 represent absolute phase errors 36 colored orange to purple in fig 4 outliers in the amplitudes of constituents tend to be underestimates rather than overestimates which may indicate deltaic regions estuaries back bays and rivers where the bathymetry is inadequate and overly dissipative e g the ganges delta where large discrepancies are present fig 3 aside from these regions there is a consistent spread of errors for both the amplitudes e 0 02 m and phases e 1 37 indicating a largely unbiased system table 4 compares the mean and standard deviations of the rms discrepancies between the various indwpac model setups different bathymetry datasets with and without internal tide energy conversion and spatially varying bottom friction coefficients versus tide gauges observations and the tpxo8 atlas note that when the interpolation of tpxo8 to the coastal tide gauges is performed using their native data extraction program otps2 a total of 93 locations return a null value thus for a fair comparison we present our model results against this reduced set of stations the statistics of the indwpac model are not noticeably different for the full coastal gauge set based on dimensional considerations different physical processes are expected to be important depending on the water depth and proximity to the coast thus the statistics are broken up into three regions deep water h 500 m continental shelf and slope waters 25 h 500 m and coastal waters includes continental and island coastlines at the deep water tide gauges the total free surface mean discrepancies for the comp it sv model setup d t g 4 7 cm r d t g 13 are 2 4 times those of the tpxo8 atlas d t g 2 0 cm r d t g 5 5 the indwpac model discrepancies in deep water are predominantly affected by the internal tide energy conversion which reduces the total free surface rms discrepancy by 47 d t p x and 55 d t g different bathymetry datasets and bottom friction coefficients have little effect hot spots of discrepancy against deep water tide gauges for the indwpac model occur in the celebes sea and banda sea see fig 3 against topex poseidon satellite crossover observations robertson and ffield 2008 particularly for the m2 tidal wave without the crossover points which are technically not tide gauges the m2 d t g for the comp it sv model setup is closer to 2 cm instead of 3 6 cm for comparison in waters deeper than 1000 m the rmse against tpxo8 for another non assimilative hydrodynamic model buijsman et al 2015 is approximately 4 cm in the indian and pacific oceans furthermore in waters deeper than 500 m wilmes et al 2017 obtains a global rmse 3 8 cm and the comp it sv model setup here obtains an rmse 3 6 cm in waters deeper than 500 m versus tpxo8 this cannot be said to be a statistically significant improvement despite generally higher resolution of the grid and nearshore bathymetric data than buijsman et al 2015 wilmes et al 2017 as shown only internal tide energy conversion resulted in a notable reduction to the deep water discrepancies better nearshore bathymetry and grid resolutions do not allow for significant improvements in the internal tide energy conversion matrix compared with coarser grid models because the calculation relies mostly on the deep water satellite altimetry data in global bathymetric datasets that are still limited to 10 km resolution accuracy goff and arbic 2010 furthermore the topographic roughness can be calculated on the relatively fine 1 km bathymetric grid before being interpolated onto the coarser computational grid for parameterization in barotropic models reducing the requirement for a fine grid in the ocean on the continental shelf the total free surface d t g at tide gauges are 2 6 to 2 8 times larger than those in deep water for both the comp it sv model setup and the tpxo8 atlas similar to deep water regions the comp it sv model total free surface discrepancies d t g 13 cm r d t g 23 are 2 5 times those of the tpxo8 atlas d t g 5 4 cm r d t g 9 2 at the tide gauges on the continental shelf the most significant factors in reducing the total free surface discrepancies on the shelf are internal tide energy conversion 34 reduction in d t p x and the nearshore bathymetric datasets 26 reduction in d t p x the bottom friction coefficient has a small impact overall although the discrepancy for the k1 constituent increased when using the spatially varying cf map the gebco 2014 bathymetry model gives lower d t g than the srtm15 plus model however d t p x is quite similar between the two bathymetric datasets note that d t p x tends to give a smoother indicator of the change between model setups because it is integrated over the whole domain where 25 h 500 m furthermore d t p x is 2 9 cm or 30 smaller than d t g for m2 this could be because the shelf gauges tend to be in regions with large tidal ranges such as the northern regions of the australian shelf and the yellow sea for comparison stammer et al 2014 report that the global m2 rmse in shelf waters is 24 49 cm against tide gauges and 19 28 cm versus tpxo8 comparatively the m2 rmse is 13 1 cm against tide gauges and 10 1 cm versus tpxo8 for the comp it sv model setup although it should be kept in mind that the stammer et al 2014 errors are global and hence they cannot be treated as a direct comparison according to the tpxo8 atlas the total energy density ted defined in 5 1 of the m2 tidal wave is slightly higher in the indwpac domain 820 jm 2 compared to the entire globe 695 jm 2 suggesting a degree of difficulty for the indwpac domain the rms discrepancies at the coastal tide gauges are only marginally larger than those on the shelf for the comp it sv model setup however the discrepancies increase significantly from the shelf to the coast when only the global bathymetry datasets are used in particular gebco 2014 the nearshore bathymetry dataset plays a large role in reducing the discrepancy 30 reduction in total free surface d t g the spatially varying cf map has a smaller but noticeable global effect 9 reduction in total free surface d t g local effects of cf are detailed in 5 4 at approximately 77 of the coastal tide gauge locations the total free surface d t g of the comp it sv model setup is less than 20 cm fig 5 which was the target metric used for a high resolution western north atlantic model much smaller in scale than indwpac where this is satisfied at 324 of 398 81 locations technology riverside inc and aecom 2015 even though the total free surface d t g for the comp it sv model setup is 2 5 times that of the tpxo8 atlas on the shelf d t g is 2 6 cm 15 smaller than the tpxo8 atlas for the comp it sv model setup at the coast however a higher percentage of locations will be within a given target discrepancy up to d t g 24 cm r d t g 35 for the tpxo8 model fig 5 on the other hand the tpxo8 model cdf curves fig 5 have long tails indicating a number of high magnitude outliers whereas this is not the case for the indwpac model with the nearshore bathymetry included thus if the solution is not significantly different from that offshore and where the gauges have been included in the assimilation process the tpxo8 model is accurate however due to coarse resolution and bathymetry the tpxo8 atlas may perform poorly in areas where small scale changes in amplitude and or phase that can occur in bays and harbors or in behind small islands and peninsulas are important comparatively the high resolution computational grids and bathymetric data included in the indwpac model allow it to capture the faster changing characteristics of tides particularly semi diurnal ones hence there are fewer large magnitude outliers and a smaller mean discrepancy compared with the tpxo8 atlas however in order to elevate the median performance at the coast it would appear that significant improvements in offshore bathymetric data and internal tide energy conversion dynamics are required if data assimilation is not involved 5 describes the sensitivities to these and other factors in addition it has been noted that the inclusion of atmospheric forcings and baroclinic components can lead to an improved barotropic tidal response in the region e g cai et al 2006 4 5 tidal currents and energy flux densities it is useful to investigate the energy flux densities and tidal currents in order to understand the hydrodynamics of the system that cannot be explained simply through tidal elevations furthermore even though tidal elevations may be accurate it does not always follow that tidal currents are well represented however since this model has been designed to be as physically driven a shallow water model as possible ignoring baroclinic and atmospheric forcings for now it is expected that the barotropic flow including tidal currents can be reasonably represented we concentrate on the marginal seas separating the indian ocean and the western pacific ocean because this is where tidal energy is transported between the two oceanic basins and dissipated in the process note that the energy flux density of the kth tidal wave is computed as wei et al 2016 15 p k 1 2 g ρ 0 h a k u k cos θ k θ k where ρ 0 is the reference density of sea water p k and u k of the m2 and k1 tidal waves are illustrated in fig 6 although not shown the energy flux densities qualitatively agree well with those from tpxo8 predominantly a large amount of m2 tidal energy flows from the indian ocean through the indonesian seas up into the yellow sea and around into the south china sea in contrast k1 tidal energy flows down from the northeast of the western pacific ocean into the south china sea and the indonesian sea thus the luzon strait and the indonesian seas play a large role with regards to the tidal dynamics of the domain the luzon strait is known for the generation of large internal tides where the energy conversion of this effect is parameterized in this study see 5 3 3 in addition the indonesian seas e g celebes sea and banda sea are fairly deep compared to the shelves of the java sea and the south china so bottom friction dissipation does not play a large role as confirmed by the presence of mostly small tidal currents throughout this region fig 6 instead internal tide conversion parameterization over the high gradient shallow island chains where tidal currents become locally large is likely to be important here a portion of the m2 tidal energy also flows through the shallow and narrow malacca strait where high magnitude tidal currents are generated fig 6 thus bathymetry and bottom friction are expected to be important here tidal current harmonic constituent observations were obtained in the region between the java sea and the south china sea locations a e and in the northern south china sea near hong kong locations f g in which tidal ellipses are plotted in fig 7 and their rms discrepancies dtc at each location for the indwpac model and for the tpxo8 atlas are summarized in table 5 these observations are in fairly low energy regions fig 6 which in some cases may make a model more susceptible to discrepancies without constraints on the solution in particular for the m2 although the direction and magnitude of the flow is fairly accurate in locations c e in the java sea where the m2 tide is very small the rotation of the tidal ellipse is anticlockwise in the indwpac model but is clockwise according to observations and tpxo8 as d t c m 2 is smaller for tpxo8 at locations c e but is smaller in the indwpac model at a b on the other hand the k1 tide is larger than m2 in the java sea region and the rotation of the tidal ellipse is in agreement at all locations a e furthermore d t c k 1 for the indwpac model is significantly smaller than those for tpxo8 at most locations in the northern south china sea there is good qualitative agreement in the tidal ellipses between the indwpac model and the observations for the m2 tide but less so for k1 note that location g is in a coastal region near hong kong and that the observations are surface currents where both the indwpac model and tpxo8 have large d t c k 1 thus perhaps for the k1 constituent there is a significant 3d effect or atmospheric driven response at this location given cai et al 2006 was able to obtain a tidal current solution closer to observations than our model when using a 3d model forced with winds and baroclinicity based on the plots and discrepancies of the tidal ellipses the tidal currents in the northern south china sea are not clearly better or worse in the indwpac model compared with tpxo8 5 sensitivities to lateral boundary conditions bathymetry and dissipative controls 5 1 lateral boundary conditions in this study it was found that the most dramatic effect on the solution occurred when modifying the position and or lateral boundary condition type fig 8 it turns out that the boundaries used in the final indwpac model which we call the two open boundaries domain in this section are well placed in the initial stages of the indwpac model the domain was set up so that the western pacific boundary was split into two separate boundaries where one of the boundaries was defined spanning from the great australian bight down to antarctica parallel with latitude designated as the three open boundaries domain the impact of the absorption generation sponge layer is also of concern with regards to the ability to absorb outgoing waves reduce reflections and instabilities and generate tidal solutions at the boundary to help evaluate the effect of the lateral boundary position and boundary condition type we quantify the total energy te and total energy dissipation td of the kth tidal constituent which are computed by 16 t e k ρ 0 2 h u k 2 g a k 2 d a 17 t d k w k p k d a where w is the work rate c f egbert and ray 2001 and p is the energy flux 15 since the numerical calculation of p with finite precision is very noisy in this work the area integral is computed using the divergence theorem note that the absorption generation sponge layer region is omitted from the above area integrals and we quote te and td values per unit area to help in enabling comparisons across the domains which have different total areas four simulations are conducted the two open boundaries domain with and without an absorption generation sponge layer and the three open boundaries domain with and without a sponge layer none of these simulations use internal tide energy conversion and a spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 is employed 5 1 1 boundary placement effects without sponge layer for simulations without the sponge layer t e m 2 900 jm 2 for the two open boundaries domain and t e m 2 3210 jm 2 when using the three open boundaries domain essentially a 250 increase similarly t d m 2 4 5 mw 2 and t d m 2 8 5 mw 2 for the two and three open boundaries domain respectively for comparison t e m 2 830 jm 2 and t d m 2 7 2 mw 2 in the tpxo8 atlas within the two open boundaries domain in this experiment the excess in total energy and deficit in the total dissipation per unit area respectively between the two open boundaries domain indwpac and tpxo8 solutions is at least partly explained by the absence of internal tide energy conversion the effect on the solution due to boundary placement is not nearly as prominent for the diurnal k1 tidal wave for example t e k 1 288 jm 2 for the two open boundaries domain and 298 jm 2 for the three open boundaries domain representing a small 3 5 increase most other constituents also show single digit percent increases in the total energy except for the other two lunar semi diurnal tides k2 and n2 in particular k2 whose response is most similar looking to m2 has a 231 increase n2 is increased by 31 4 5 1 2 effects of sponge layer it is found that applying the absorption generation sponge layer even for the three open boundaries domain can result in improved responses fig 8 b ii reducing t e m 2 to 1040 jm 2 and t d m 2 to 5 3 mw 2 the sponge layer thus allows for significant leeway in boundary positioning but it does not necessarily entirely eliminate issues in the response note how in the two open boundaries domain the amphidrome in the southern ocean below australia is located near where the third open boundary is the sponge acts to push this amphidrome away from the boundary because the three open boundaries indwpac model solution and the tpxo8 solution are incompatible here this indicates reliance on internal dissipative mechanisms to ensure compatibility with each other for example in our best model setup with the sponge layer applied when appropriate internal tide energy conversion is included better compatibility is obtained leading to t e m 2 780 jm 2 and t d m 2 7 1 mw 2 which are rather similar to the values from the tpxo8 atlas quoted in 5 1 1 5 1 3 discussion what to make of the dramatic results to the solution due to boundary placement and condition types firstly even though there should not be an amphidrome right next to the boundary according to the tpxo8 solution although the elevations are still fairly small our model without adequate internal dissipative effects expects there to be one instabilities and problems may arise near amphidromes because a physically incorrect solution that satisfies the governing equations can be obtained mathematically both boundary conditions and initial conditions are required to get the correct solution instead the method commonly adopted including in this study is to impose the elevation boundary conditions and ramp up the system from a completely zero state we found from a simple test case that when internal dissipative effects are low ramping generates spurious modes that persist for very long periods of time secondly the indian ocean and the australian indonesian marginal seas appear very sensitive to fluctuations in fluxes on the boundary in particular without adequate abyssal dissipation but even when internal tide energy conversion was included the three open boundaries domain without the sponge layer did not converge to a suitable solution in studies of free barotropic oscillations platzman 1975 zahel and müller 2005 resonant modes around 9 20 11 65 hour show similar patterns to the lunar semi diurnal tides in the indian ocean furthermore the energy density of the 11 65 hour mode is 2 2 times the global average in the indian ocean zahel and müller 2005 hence the resonant nature of the lunar semi diurnal tides in this basin causes the total energy to increase wildly in response to the poor boundary conditions the absorption generation sponge layer reduces reflections at the boundary allowing the spurious modes to exit the domain by introducing external information as part of the governing equations the sponge layer is applicable to a wide range of conditions in contrast a radiation type condition is difficult to devise in the case where actively imposing external information is required because you need to identify regions of inflow lavelle and thacker 2008 which may be time dependent however one of the main issues with using the absorption generation sponge layer is the reliance on the reference solution in particular because only the sea surface is assimilated tidal fluxes obtained from tpxo8 may be less likely to be as accurate or compatible with the indwpac model as the tidal elevations 5 2 bathymetry bathymetry is a boundary condition for oceanic models hence its importance to the solution is clear recent years have shown marked improvements in global bathymetric databases such as srtm15 plus and gebco 2014 this section begins by outlining the effects of using one of these databases over the other followed by effects between srtm15 plus and our more comprehensive bathymetric data table 1 the section concludes with a discussion on the results and implications 5 2 1 comparisons between global bathymetric databases current global bathymetric databases srtm15 plus and gebco 2014 are sufficiently accurate that they do allow us to obtain mean rms discrepancies 3 cm for the m2 tidal wave in the deep ocean nevertheless there is still a reasonable level of uncertainty between them fig 9 a for example on the abyssal hills the use of statistical roughness goff and arbic 2010 to calculate a new bathymetry set timko et al 2017 has been undertaken to account for the effective coarseness of satellite altimetry derived bathymetry note that the srtm15 plus database used here is a combination with srtm30 plus that contains the synthetic realization of the abyssal hill roughness but gebco 2014 is without it to investigate the effects of the global bathymetric databases we compute one simulation using srtm15 plus with abyssal hill roughness everywhere srtm it sc and another using gebco 2014 everywhere gebco it sc rms differences between the simulations for the m2 tidal wave are plotted in fig 9 b optimal internal tide energy conversion factors it and spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 sc are employed for both along the ocean ridges that include a synthetic realization of the abyssal hill roughness the normalized bathymetric differences are in the range 5 25 except for the southwest indian ocean ridge where the normalized bathymetric differences can exceed 50 in spots fig 9 a despite this m2 rms differences in deep water do not exceed 2 cm anywhere except east of australia and new guinea fig 9 b i e the rms differences between responses resulting from the two global bathymetric databases tend to be much less than rms discrepancies between comp it sv model setup and tpxo8 fig 2 c i note that although differences in the bathymetry should change the internal tide energy conversion matrix we use the same matrix as the comp it sv model setup for both simulations to help identify strictly bathymetric effects major normalized bathymetric and rms differences are unsurprisingly found in shallow waters such as the south china sea bass strait yellow sea sea of okhotsk ganges delta northern andaman sea persian gulf and the gulfs of khambhat and kutch fig 9 the most astounding rms differences are located on the northern australian shelves the taiwan strait and the seto inland sea fig 9 b in particular the rms differences in the coral sea and around torres strait fig 9 b are larger than the discrepancies between the comp it sv model setup and tpxo8 fig 2 c i according to the sources of gebco 2014 the 2009 australian bathymetry and topography grid whiteway 2009 is used around the australian continent within this dataset some of the nearshore bathymetry is made up of multibeam laser airborne depth sounder and nautical charts with the rest based on 1 arc min and 2 arc min etopo satellite derived bathymetry in comparison srtm15 plus is said to include 50 m multibeam datasets from 2012 as well as the deepreef explorer gbr dataset from 2010 both newer than the 2009 australian bathymetry and topography grid 5 2 2 comparisons between srtm15 plus and local high resolution bathymetry another issue with a global bathymetric dataset such as srtm15 plus is that on the shelf and nearshore the resolution can be too coarse and it may contain holes in the bathymetry thus it is not completely reliable for accurate regional simulations this section outlines the differences between srtm15 plus and our more comprehensive bathymetric data table 1 containing local high resolution datasets we focus on three regions the east china sea including the yellow sea and southern japan the south china sea including the philippines seas and north java sea and the coral sea including the torres strait fig 10 all nearshore areas in the east china sea show significant normalized bathymetric differences aside from hong kong which contains our smallest element sizes fig 10 a i due to numerous spurious large depths in the srtm15 plus dataset in this region we replace this area with the local high resolution bathymetry in order to avoid instabilities due to violation of the cfl condition this is not thought to have a large effect on the results of the comparisons between the bathymetric datasets and the conclusions that we draw from them the simulations show large rms differences of the m2 tidal wave in the taiwan strait and seto inland sea fig 10 a ii but interestingly they are not as large as those between gebco and srtm15 plus fig 9 b nor are differences in the gulf of tonkin as pronounced it should be mentioned that we noticed reduced discrepancies at tide gauges in the seto inland sea when using the high resolution bathymetry it is a complicated region with many small islands and channels and requires accurate connectivity of the energy fluxes to improve results most of the rms differences in the yellow sea between srtm15 plus and the local high resolution bathymetry fig 10 a ii are larger than those between gebco and srtm15 plus fig 9 b in particular north of shanghai and in the incheon area however generally these differences are smaller than the discrepancies between tpxo8 and the comp it sv model setup despite widespread normalized bathymetric differences in the philippines and the region between the south china sea and java sea fig 10 b i small rms differences in the m2 tidal wave result with the exception of a few channels near singapore and in the gulfs near batang lupar and north kalimantan both on borneo fig 10 b ii this is perhaps partly because the m2 amplitudes are relatively small in the region between the south china sea and java sea fig 2 a i although it is not shown the larger k1 fig 2 a ii produces up to 10 30 cm rms difference in the area south of singapore but is not notable elsewhere in the two gulfs on borneo which have fairly large m2 tidal ranges up to 1 7 m in the gulf near batang lupar fig 2 the differences result not only from local high resolution bathymetric datasets but are due to hand edits vis à vis fugawi navigational charts areas like the gulf near batang lupar can be extremely sensitive to bathymetry particularly deep in the gulf where the v shape concentrates the tidal energy the effect of our hand edits is to deepen the area near batang lupar allowing the tidal range to reach close to the measured one the final region is the coral sea which demonstrably shows large widespread normalized bathymetric differences fig 10 c i this is slightly perplexing as srtm15 plus should include the deepreef explorer gbr dataset according to their references ftp topex ucsd edu pub srtm15 plus however the srtm15 plus version used in this study does not seem to have it incorporated the bathymetry in the torres strait and papua new guinea region is also very different from srtm15 plus where we have used gebco 2014 in our more comprehensive bathymetric dataset this is because gebco 2014 matches rather well with deepreef explorer gbr at the interface whereas srtm15 plus does not the resulting m2 rms differences shown here fig 10 c ii are certainly large and often well exceed discrepancies between our model and tpxo8 fig 2 in fact in most of the coral sea the comp it sv model setup is performing rather well with respect to tpxo8 which could be largely attributed to the deepreef explorer gbr dataset significant discrepancies for our model against tpxo8 and tide gauges are still present near the torres strait fig 10 c ii where opposing m2 energy fluxes meet over the strait fig 6 the residual discrepancy here is likely a combination of the remaining uncertainties in the gebco 2014 bathymetry based on 2009 australian bathymetry and topography grid and bottom friction dissipation 5 2 3 discussion the effect of different bathymetric datasets is not shown to be an important factor in the deep ocean but on the shelf and nearshore there are certain regions where bathymetry plays a large role this has been also highlighted in terms of the global rms discrepancies presented in 4 4 2 summarized in table 4 in some cases the rms differences between simulations using different bathymetric datasets are greater than discrepancies between tpxo8 and the comp it sv model setup particularly between the two global bathymetric datasets our more comprehensive bathymetric data and srtm15 plus are mostly the same except nearshore in certain regions which is likely the reason for smaller rms differences in general as discussed in previous studies e g egbert et al 2004 green 2010 zaron 2017 bathymetry has the potential to control the tidal elevation particularly through resonant effects that are in general nonlocal for example the effect of the deepreef explorer gbr high resolution bathymetry is to change the m2 elevation over a large area beyond the coral sea out into the deep ocean conversely only small changes are noted throughout the region between the south china sea and java sea more locally in a resonant basin such as the gulf near batang lupar hand edits of the bathymetry based on fugawi navigational charts allow the tidal elevation to reach close to the measured m2 amplitude clearly greater availability and quality of nearshore and shelf bathymetry has the potential to greatly improve the modeling not only of tides but all shallow water flows with regards to the effect of the bathymetry in the deep ocean it should be noted that bathymetry will affect internal tide energy conversion as the dissipation matrix is based on topographic depths and slopes so technically the deep ocean may be more impacted than is shown here taking this aspect into account nevertheless addition of the abyssal hill roughness for example has only marginally increased the fidelity of ocean models buijsman et al 2015 timko et al 2017 in 3d baroclinic models arbic et al 2010 2012 timko et al 2017 this can be explained in part by limitations of resolution on the other hand 2d barotropic models such as indwpac can achieve high resolution over a wide scale but may be somewhat limited by the underlying assumptions of internal tide energy conversion no matter the bathymetric data greater discussion on this aspect is presented in the next section 5 3 internal tide energy conversion in the two internal tide energy conversion parameterizations 3 3 it is necessary to calibrate a global amplification factor due to unknowns involved with the resolution of the bathymetric data and the way in which dissipation that is overestimated at supercritical slopes is handled due to their linear assumptions in addition to finding these amplification factors this section discusses the differences between the two parameterization methods introduces multiplier coefficients due to semi diurnal resonance in the luzon strait and concludes with some final remarks on reasons for differences between the methods and remaining issues for the parameterization of internal tide energy conversion 5 3 1 calibrating amplification factors we begin by trying to determine the optimal values of cnyc and cdir for the indwpac model before comparing the performance of both parameterization methods this is evaluated by looking at d t p x for the m2 and k1 tidal waves in deep water h 500 m with a spatially constant bottom friction cf 2 5 10 3 to a lesser degree we are also interested in the total dissipation td of individual tidal constituents comparisons of d t p x versus td in deep water for the m2 and k1 tidal waves are shown in fig 11 a b using four different values of amplification factors for each method regarding the k1 tidal wave amplification factors slightly smaller than the values tested appear optimal in both parameterization methods however we focus on the results of the m2 tidal wave to determine the optimal amplification factors this leads to cnyc 2 9 and cdir 0 22 based on a second order polynomial best fit for comparison buijsman et al 2015 determined cnyc 2 75 which is in close agreement furthermore two modifications are applied to the nonlocal method the first modification simply ensures that the dissipation matrix is positive definite pd a second modification involves applying gaussian smoothing of nb to obtain a variable denoted as nbav using the same radius and scaling as the convolution integral for j the argument being that nonlocal effects of buoyancy may be just as important as nonlocal effects of topography both modifications create more dissipation and make d t p x for m2 smaller for the same value of cnyc fig 11 with the pd modification having the largest effect 5 3 2 differences between parameterization methods two opposing outcomes result from the comparison between the nonlocal and local methods for both constituents the nonlocal method leads to slightly smaller values of d t p x while td at the optimal amplification factor matches tpxo8 in deep water more closely for the local method since tpxo8 can be reliably validated for elevations but not for dissipation we are inclined to prefer the nonlocal method thus it is incorporated into our best model results presented in 4 it is however worth pointing out that the difference between the methods is no more than 15 mm in d t p x for m2 thus the local method can be considered a very useful parameterization in its own right not least because it can be quickly calculated and introduced to a numerical model with regards to total dissipation the optimal nonlocal method results in 24 greater m2 td compared with tpxo8 see fig 12 for a comparison of the dissipation densities computed through 17 with the area integral omitted the global hycom model has a similar td ratio 23 greater versus tpxo8 buijsman et al 2015 who note that the tpxo8 dissipation rates are diffused over large areas in comparison to the parameterized internal tide energy conversion in their model we also see this in fig 12 in that sense it is somewhat unclear how reliable tpxo8 dissipation in deep water may be issues with tidal dissipation in global data assimilated models have been previously highlighted lyard et al 2006 le provost and lyard 1997 and there are large regions of negative dissipation rates when computing this with the tpxo8 solutions fig 12 b depth wise the characteristics of local and large scale nonlocal topographic effects tend to translate into the nonlocal method creating greater dissipation in shallower depths fig 11 c both methods give large amounts of dissipation in the 3000 4000 m range corresponding to abyssal hills but a general observation we find is that the nonlocal method focuses dissipation towards the center peaks of the ridges whilst the local method tends to spread dissipation over the width of the ridge as mentioned above it remains unclear whether the overestimate in dissipation from both schemes in the 500 4000 m depth range and underestimate in the 4500 6000 m range is a major cause of concern or it simply reflects the coarseness of the data assimilated model buijsman et al 2015 found similar trends to this study for their global model the differences in amplitudes of the m2 tidal wave between the nonlocal and local methods are illustrated in fig 13 there is a clear divide between amplitudes in the indian ocean and those in the western pacific ocean this indicates disparity in the way the m2 tides are balanced between basins depending on the method the nonlocal method dissipates more in shallower depths fig 11 c so it is perhaps unsurprising that the amplitudes will be smaller in the western pacific basin which contains many shallow shelves and island chains moreover the energy flux density p of the m2 tidal wave predominantly flows from the indian ocean into the western pacific basin through the indonesian seas and to a lesser extent through the malacca strait fig 6 due to the greater dissipation in shallow depths in the passages through the island chains and shallow seas more energy remains on the indian ocean side instead of flowing into the western pacific basin compared with the local method 5 3 3 multiplier due to semi diurnal resonance over the luzon strait a local improvement to internal tide energy conversion is applied over the luzon strait the luzon strait controls the amount of energy into the south china sea for both the m2 and k1 tidal waves fig 6 here the amplitude of k1 is mostly larger than m2 fig 2 because the separation of the double ridge topography in the strait is similar to the semi diurnal internal tide wavelength it has been shown that resonance dramatically increases the barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion buijsman et al 2014 in comparison to the sum of the two ridges considered separately the double ridge produces up to as much as four times the energy conversion for the first internal mode buijsman et al 2014 since our internal tide energy conversion parameterizations do not include such resonance behavior we deem it appropriate to apply a multiplier to the amplification coefficients in the region 19 5 21 5 n and 120 122 5 e the multiplier coefficients cluzon are defined using a skewed gaussian curve as a function of latitude ϕ to approximate the data points presented in buijsman et al 2014 18 c l u z o n 1 a l 2 σ l π exp ξ l 2 2 σ l 2 1 erf α l ξ l 2 σ l with al 5 0 σl 0 3 αl 1 0 and ξ l ϕ 20 9 n cluzon reaches a maximum of 4 24 at 20 75 n fig 14 shows the amplitude differences for the m2 and k1 tidal waves in the south china sea and surroundings from the optimal nonlocal method with and without the multiplier coefficients cluzon as expected the increase to the internal tide coefficients reduces the amplitudes inside most of the south china sea for both constituents the decrease is on the order of 0 5 1 cm for m2 in most areas with a few pockets of 2 5 5 cm reductions additionally the blockage increases amplitudes slightly to the east of the strait and in the sulu sea the k1 amplitude is decreased in the south china sea by 1 2 5 cm almost uniformly furthermore due to the blockage at the luzon strait more of the energy flux is now diverted down into the indonesian seas fig 6 increasing amplitudes uniformly by 0 5 1 cm m2 rms discrepancies at coastal tide gauges are generally decreased about 1 cm within the south china sea due to the cluzon multiplier coefficients the discrepancy is increased slightly in the sulu sea and near the taiwan strait the changes in k1 discrepancies do not follow a clear pattern aside from the gulf of thailand and celebes sea regions decrease and increase respectively the rms discrepancies against tide gauges and tpxo8 in the plotted region fig 14 are summarized in table 6 overall only small decreases in discrepancies are found when using the cluzon multiplier coefficients the magnitude of discrepancies are comparable to local hydrodynamic models for the south china sea region green and david 2013 gao et al 2015 we obtain 8 5 cm and 5 0 cm rmse for m2 and k1 versus tpxo8 respectively green and david 2013 quote 9 cm and 10 cm in green and david 2013 cf had to be raised to an unphysical value of 0 01 to achieve optimal results for m2 it was speculated that this is because the internal tide energy conversion rates in e g the luzon strait are underestimated for m2 perhaps the increased cf may have accounted for additional dissipation in the luzon strait that the cluzon multiplier coefficients applied here are trying to achieve although it is shown here that the effects of applying cluzon are somewhat small furthermore green and david 2013 use a different method to cap dissipation at supercritical slopes in which this is the case in parts of the luzon strait that may not be appropriate locally bathymetric differences and the higher grid resolution in indwpac also likely play a role in helping to obtain relatively accurate tidal elevations in the indwpac model in addition by including wind and baroclinic forcing cai et al 2006 were able to obtain smaller rmse values compared to a barotropic model without atmospheric forcing in the south china sea thus our model may further improve if these forcings are included 5 3 4 discussion as a result of the dissipation dynamics we find that the local method gives better results in the western indian ocean but elsewhere the nonlocal method is generally preferable it is worth noting that the m2 amplitude differences fig 13 in the indian ocean between the two methods is in the range 0 5 2 5 cm and greater in the bay of bengal this is a rather large amplitude difference in the deep ocean since d t p x 2 9 cm indicating that there is some scope to improve deep water solutions further through better parameterization of internal tide energy conversion perhaps some of the remaining issues for the nonlocal method can be explained by the fact that bathymetry is still rather uncertain and coarse in much of the deep ocean most of the indian ocean is deep with very narrow shelves and internal tide energy conversion is an important dissipation mechanism furthermore internal tide energy conversion in shallow regions is less reliable because of larger tidal velocities and uncertainties and there is a greater chance of the flow being supercritical melet et al 2013 in fact one of the main effects of the nbav modification to the nonlocal method is to move some dissipation away from shallow regions into deeper regions fig 11 c additional investigation into the parameterization of internal tide energy conversion in shallow regions is warranted especially because the shallow areas of the indonesian seas provide a critical connection between the basins a region that has created issues previously melet et al 2013 finally it is worth highlighting that the internal tide energy conversion matrices used here have been derived based on the m2 tidal wave that is ω 2 π 12 42 rad hr are used in 4 and 5 and the optimal amplification factors are determined from results for m2 however theoretically diurnal internal tides become trapped in latitudes higher than 30 as f ω and no barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion due to freely propagating internal waves results because we apply the dissipation matrix for m2 some energy conversion of diurnal tides does occur at these higher latitudes in our model however without separating the modes and taking into account the influences from the other constituents similar to methods for bottom friction e g le provost and lyard 1997 it is unclear how selective dissipation for each mode is possible using this type of parameterization in a forward model instead jayne and st laurent 2001 decided to ignore the relationship between ω and f here our assumption for internal tide energy conversion is that the m2 tidal wave dominates the signal nevertheless smaller amplification factors are optimal for the k1 tidal wave fig 11 b than those for m2 fig 11 a although using the internal tide energy conversion parameterization does improve the k1 tides versus not including it furthermore in the luzon strait only resonance of the semi diurnal internal tides occurs so theoretically the multiplier coefficients cluzon should not be applied to the diurnal tides perhaps including information from measurements and operational baroclinic 3d models e g hycom chassignet et al 2007 may provide us with an opportunity to locally improve dissipation matrices for depth integrated barotropic models although we are still somewhat limited by the assumptions of the underlying parameterization 5 4 bottom friction dissipation this section summarizes the effect of implementing the spatially varying cf map fig 15 a based on sediment types and tidal current speeds fig 6 into the indwpac model firstly it is useful to highlight regions where we expect bottom friction to have a large effect zaron 2017 recently introduced a bottom friction number zf for the k th constituent to quantitatively illustrate this 19 z f k 2 c f u f u k h 2 ω k u k 2 c f u f u k h 2 where ωk is the tidal frequency of the k th constituent the term ωk corresponds to local acceleration since depth and velocities are highly correlated velocity and cf are to some extent also correlated but much less so it is clear from 19 that the effect of cf is in fact secondary to the effects of h thus a global map of zf based on the spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 simulation ought to suffice for visualization purposes fig 15 b zf shows a similar pattern for the k1 tidal wave not shown as the plotted m2 tidal wave on the continental shelves at depths 100 m zf is generally in the 0 1 0 5 range and only becomes larger than 0 5 close to the coast in depths much less than 50 m see also zaron 2017 regions where zf is large correlate to areas where the tidal solutions will be most impacted by any variability in cf when implementing the spatially varying cf map fig 15 a specific areas with relatively large zf that are noticeably different to cf 2 5 10 3 include the yellow sea and southern japan small cf in the yellow sea large cf just south of the yellow sea and in the seto inland sea the area between the java sea and south china sea near singapore mostly large cf with pockets of small cf and timor and arafura seas both large and small cf the change in amplitudes for the m2 and k1 tidal waves in these three regions when using the spatially varying cf map over the spatially constant cf 2 5 10 3 are illustrated in fig 16 changes in the rms discrepancy at the coastal tide gauges are also plotted the mean discrepancies at the coastal tide gauges within the boxed regions are summarized in table 6 the following sections detail the findings at each region individually followed by a discussion of the results 5 4 1 yellow sea and southern japan in the census sediment database the yellow sea is designated as a mud sediment type we also modified the database to ensure that bohai sea and hangzhou bay are designated as mud sediment types and the tidal currents are very large over the shallow basin this leads to small values of cf between 7 5 10 4 and 2 0 10 3 except close to the coastline where cf becomes large due to small depths in 6 a patch of sand just south of the yellow sea causes cf to exceed 4 0 10 3 here additionally a sand zone throughout most of the seto inland sea induces a large cf 4 0 10 3 the tidal amplitudes increase due to the spatially varying cf in most of the yellow sea and decrease just south of the yellow sea due to the mud and sand zones respectively for both constituents the m2 amplitude is also decreased in the western seto inland sea but there is no noticeable change for k1 impressively the rms discrepancy is decreased almost everywhere for both constituents aside from a couple of outliers in the yellow sea and for a group of stations in the eastern seto inland sea for m2 for example the discrepancy is decreased by up to 25 cm and 5 cm for m2 and k1 respectively at many yellow sea locations it appears that the combination of the small friction in the yellow and bohai seas and the large friction just south of the yellow sea and in the korea japan strait results in systematic positive changes to the solution overall the mean rms discrepancies versus coastal tide gauges decrease by 4 9 cm 28 for m2 and 0 71 cm 19 for k1 due to the spatially varying cf here 5 4 2 area between the java sea and south china sea the region in between the java sea and south china sea is predominantly designated as a sand zone cf 4 0 10 3 with pockets of fine grain calcareous sediment cf 2 0 10 3 and volcanic ash cf 3 0 10 3 in the census sediment database there is only a small number of data points in the census to back up these sediment types the m2 amplitudes decrease most significantly in the region close to singapore due to the higher values of cf and zf here in response to this decrease in amplitude the m2 rms discrepancies in this region increase by approximately 5 cm a large scale decrease in k1 amplitudes occurs southeast of singapore but there are no coastal tide gauges there to measure the effect on the discrepancy a band of increased k1 amplitude in between singapore and borneo which increases the rms discrepancies at the tide gauges is also present the mean total free surface rms discrepancies are increased versus tide gauges by 1 4 cm 8 5 overall table 6 thus increasing cf from the base value of 0 025 to the sediment current informed estimate clearly degrades the accuracy in both the semi diurnal and diurnal constituents suggesting that either the census sediment database is not correct or that the high current speeds in the malacca strait artificially increase the friction coefficient for the sand sediment type we believe that the comprehensive bathymetry in this heavily trafficked region is reliable in that it matches navigation charts well 5 4 3 timor and arafura seas the timor sea is designated as a sand sediment type in the census sediment database while the arafura sea is designated as mainly fine grained calcareous sediment with a couple of pockets of sand types as a result in most of the timor sea cf 4 0 10 3 except for nearshore in the joseph bonaparte gulf where the tidal velocities are very large causing cf to decrease as the fine grained sediment bedforms are washed out tidal current speeds are fairly small in the gulf of carpentaria fig 6 so even though some of sediment is fine grained cf is similar to the standard value 2 5 10 3 north of arnhem the sediment is fine grained and the tidal current speeds are fairly large fig 6 hence cf becomes smaller than the standard value because most of the region has larger values of cf than the standard value tidal amplitudes tend to decrease for both constituents on the whole fig 16 iii exceptions are the van diemen gulf small cf north of arnhem small cf nearshore with high cf just offshore and east of the torres strait but only for m2 the mechanism for the latter is mainly through dampening of the energy fluxes traveling east towards the torres strait as they encounter the sand zones in the timor and arafura seas this results in less resistance to the westward directed energy fluxes into the torres strait see fig 6 increasing amplitudes to the east of the strait in general using the spatially varying cf leads to poorer results for both constituents only deep in the joseph bonaparte gulf and at a couple of stations near the van diemen gulf with smaller cf values does the m2 rms discrepancy decrease mean total free surface rms discrepancies at tide gauges increase by 1 7 cm 6 6 due to the spatially varying cf again this could be related to the sediment information derived from the census sediment data or from the friction coefficient estimation in addition the degree of uncertainty of the bathymetry is high as explored in 5 2 which will substantially influence the dissipation and the energy fluxes 5 4 4 discussion results summarized in the above sections highlight one region the yellow sea and southern japan that experienced wholesale decreases in the discrepancies at tidal stations by significant magnitudes and two regions with small increases in discrepancies when using the spatially varying cf map over the standard c f 2 5 10 3 the yellow sea region represents a flagship result of the possibilities of using a data informed approach to estimating bottom friction coefficients over using a standard value furthermore the distribution of cf used in the region is in close agreement to previous studies for example lefevre et al 2000 found a small value of cf 1 5 10 3 to be optimal throughout the east china sea yellow sea region more interestingly the distribution of cf closely resembles the optimal one determined through the adjoint method lu and zhang 2006 this may appear to indicate that the adjoint method can estimate cf values that correspond to physical characteristics of the seabed such as the muddy nature throughout most of the yellow sea however it is not clear whether the sand zone south of the yellow sea creating an increase in cf similar to the optimal distribution of cf in lu and zhang 2006 is simply a coincidence or not due to the sparseness of data points in the census here and the tendency of sand zones in the other two regions to in fact increase discrepancies the arafura sea in the census is mainly fine grained calcareous but there are two pockets of sand zones however according to the grain size map presented in porter smith et al 2004 we expect the arafura sea and gulf of carpentaria to be fairly muddy with small grain sizes in the timor sea the census contains many data points that are used to determine that the sediment is sandy here this may be the case but our definition of the sediment grain size of sand does not seem to match porter smith et al 2004 who indicate fairly small grain sizes for the region the rest of the australian shelf has fairly large grain sizes porter smith et al 2004 but they are mainly designated as ooze types in the census it can be assumed that there are similar issues with sediment types and the correlation of these to physical sediment characteristics in the area between the java sea and south china sea this indicates that the census is generally insufficient for our purpose due to the relative sparseness of the data particularly of terrestrial type sediments and because it requires us to estimate the grain size and density from the sediment types the physical characteristic of sand for example can vary considerably we have experimented with changing some of the sediment type definitions of the census for example the sandy sediment definition in the area between java sea and south china sea is changed to fine grained calcareous sediment which decreases the discrepancies around singapore for m2 similarly all of the arafura sea is changed to a muddy sediment type and timor sea to fine grained calcareous sediment based on the grain size figure in porter smith et al 2004 this leads to generally improved results in future studies if actual physical sediment characteristics from databases e g porter smith et al 2004 buczkowski et al 2006 could be adopted with a focus on regions where zf exceeds 0 4 0 5 there are indications that non trivial improvements to tidal solutions can be achieved e g yellow sea bohai sea and seto inland sea 6 conclusions this study has presented a finite element barotropic model of the indian and western pacific oceans with elemental resolution ranging from as small as 100 m in hong kong up to 25 km in less barotropically interesting areas of the deep ocean most of the resolution at the coast is 1 km bathymetry has been sourced predominantly from the global srtm bathymetric database in addition to local high resolution datasets and hand edits at first comparisons of the indwpac model results with both the data assimilated tpxo8 atlas and tidal constituents at tide gauges in deep continental shelf and slope waters and at the coast have been shown this has been followed by a presentation of the sensitivities to lateral boundary conditions bathymetry internal tide energy conversion and bottom friction dissipation within each of these sections a discussion of the findings and implications with regards to the sensitivity for that component has been presented the key results e g rms discrepancies for the comp it sv model setup and conclusions for each region deep shelf and coastal follows deep water m2 mean rms discrepancies against tpxo8 are 2 9 cm rmse 3 6 cm which is marginally better than reported for other forward hydrodynamic models however the total free surface rms discrepancies at deep water tide gauges are 2 3 times those of the tpxo8 atlas poorly placed elevation specified lateral boundaries lead to global resonant amplifications of the lunar semi diurnal modes an absorption generation sponge zone suppresses the resonant amplifications but it relies on data assimilated model fluxes e g tpxo8 and similar models which may not be as reliable as the elevations from these models a comprehensive global forward model may have advantages in eliminating the uncertainties from the boundary conditions strictly bathymetric effects are not of great importance to the deep water solution however internal tide energy conversion that relies on topographic features and slopes for parameterization is shown to be the key control in deep water the nonlocal method for internal tide energy conversion is shown to obtain marginally superior results to the local method but the latter is more dissipative in the indian ocean and hence results in smaller m2 amplitudes there which match tpxo8 slightly better there is evidence that there is scope to further improve the deep water solution through internal tide energy conversion but it is probably not possible using the same paradigm strict reliance on the nonlocal equation and calibration of a global amplification factor as presented here significant local modifications based on 3d baroclinic models and measurements including improvements to internal tide energy conversion in shallower waters are likely required continental shelf and slope water m2 mean rms discrepancies against tpxo8 are 6 5 cm rmse 10 1 cm this is shown to be significantly superior to those reported for other forward hydrodynamic models rmse 19 28 cm stammer et al 2014 albeit these are global errors the total energy density is at least as large in the indwpac domain compared to the rest of the world s ocean one of the most important factors for improvement is shown to be the inclusion of local high resolution bathymetry notable changes in the m2 amplitude and a corresponding reduction in the rms discrepancies against tpxo8 and at tide gauges are evident in the greater yellow sea region due to changes in bottom friction coefficients based on combinations of muddy and sandy sediment types however the regions around the java and south china seas and timor and arafura seas do not generate significant nor positive changes to the discrepancy if more complete databases of physical characteristics of sediment are made available combined with accurate local bathymetric data it may be possible to improve solutions elsewhere particularly in resonant basins e g gulfs of khambhat and kutch on the west coast of india king sound joseph bonaparte gulf and van diemen gulf in northern australia among others due to spatially varying bottom friction coefficients nevertheless we are still limited by residual discrepancies from deeper waters and the uncertainties of internal tide energy conversion in shallower waters the discrepancies at the coast for the indwpac model are not significantly different from those obtained further offshore on the shelf furthermore the mean total free surface rms discrepancies at coastal tide gauges d t g 14 cm are 2 6 cm smaller than those of the tpox8 atlas however the discrepancies at the majority of locations are smaller for the tpxo8 atlas due to data assimilation offshore and at selected tide gauges the large mean rms discrepancy for the tpxo8 atlas is likely related to tpxo8 s coarser resolution not resolving certain nearshore features and harbor complexes in detail and therefore not correctly propagating the tides into them for example bathymetric and bottom friction controls are both found to play a very important role nearshore and in some cases dominate the reasons for discrepancy due to resonance in a basin or inadequate connectivity into a bay in contrast the indwpac model does not have such a large number or magnitude of outlier locations these results are an indication that the model adequately captures a large amount of the nearshore physics throughout the domain thus the model is potentially suitable to simulate a great range of shallow water physics within the region specifically into detailed harbor complexes and other nearshore features where the tide gauges are located if we are solely interested in tidal elevations then the simple answer is to use data assimilation within the indwpac model to achieve highly accurate solutions from the deep ocean all the way to the well resolved coastal regions however in many other applications such as the forecasting and analysis of coupled surge tide and wave processes capturing the large scale responses to meteorology and modeling the shallow water physics including the nonlinear interactions of the processes becomes vital in order to accomplish this correctly specifying high resolution bathymetry and topography becomes a controlling factor furthermore physics based improvements to more accurately quantify dissipation within forward barotropic models are possible offshore through coupling to coarser 3d baroclinic

24093,the wind fields along the five eastern boundary currents ebc systems california canary humboldt benguela and west australia are highly seasonal this seasonality is mostly determined by the position of the semi permanent high pressure cells over the ocean during summer these high pressure cells with a thermal low pressure systems inland are the synoptic drivers of along coast winds these strong summer winds along the ebc systems off shore mid latitude continental coasts generate waves that can be rather extreme considering that these areas can be seen as limited fetch wave fields a qualitative analysis of the wave climate over the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc systems based on the era interim reanalysis wave data is presented the influence of coastal wind speed intensification processes in these areas like the occurrence of coastal low level jets and expansion fans in the lee of headlands and capes on the local wave field is studied it is shown that despite the distance between the five ebc systems their wave fields particularly during summer are very similar when the wind sea and swell characteristics are balanced in summer locally generated wave heights and energy content along ebc areas are comparable or even higher than swell ones 1 introduction wind waves are the inevitable consequence of the wind action over the air sea interface with gravity acting as the restoring force hence they can also be called surface gravity waves wind waves henceforth simply called waves mediate the exchange of primarily momentum between winds and the ocean surface but they also modulate exchanges of heat mass and gases between the ocean and the atmosphere also altering the radiative characteristics of the ocean surface babanin et al 2012 waves therefore play an important role in the coupled ocean atmosphere climate system rutgersson et al 2010 cavaleri et al 2012 patricola et al 2016 while generated by the local wind waves have the ubiquitous characteristic of propagating away from their generating area for that reason at the ocean surface two types of waves coexist waves under growing process intimately coupled with the local wind field are called wind sea once these waves propagate away from their generation area out speeding the local wind and no longer receiving energy from it they are called swell swells can travel across entire ocean basins losing very little energy ursel 1956 munk et al 1963 snodgrass et al 1966 young et al 1999 alves 2006 ardhuin et al 2009 before they eventually shoal and break at a coast swell waves can be called as young or old swells depending on the distance to their generation area it is because swells can propagate long distances that the wave field in the open ocean is most of the times the result of contributions from local and remotely generated waves with different origins and ages hanley et al 2010 semedo et al 2008 semedo 2010 recently it has been shown that swell dominates the global wave field chen et al 2002 semedo et al 2011 even along the main wave generation areas along the northern and southern hemisphere extratropical storm paths several observational studies e g drennan et al 1999 smedman et al 1999 2009 hogstrom et al 2009 2013 have shown that waves impact on the air sea exchanges is sea state dependent i e it depends on the qualitative characteristics of the wave field being influenced by the prevalence of one type of waves over the other when swell waves propagate into light wind areas with phase speeds much higher than the local wind speed they can have an impact on the lower atmosphere inducing a pressure perturbation in the first few meters of the marine atmospheric boundary layer mabl in these situations waves lose energy to the atmosphere as they propagate ardhuin and jenkins 2006 and accelerate the airflow at lower altitudes in the form of the so called wave driven wind harris 1966 sullivan et al 2008 or wave driven low level jet hogstrom et al 2009 this acceleration of the flow at low levels induces a departure from the logarithmic wind profile semedo et al 2009 nilsen et al 2012 for this reason swell has a consistent influence in the overall structure of the mabl in light wind areas since it reduces the wind shear in the boundary layer and consequently the mechanical production of turbulence smedman et al 1999 potter 2015 on the other hand under the wave generating process momentum is transferred from the atmosphere into the ocean this momentum is extracted from the wind field jansen et al 2002 janssen 2004 generating waves but also driving wind currents and triggering wave breaking and whitecapping koeman et al 1994 1998 waves also induce the so called wave induced currents at the ocean surface stokes 1847 that are mostly driven by wind sea waves mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 carrasco et al 2014 the wave breaking and white capping that occurs in high wind speed regimes when waves are being generated enhances the turbulence in the ocean surface mixing layer with great influence in the mass and gas transfer between the ocean and the lower atmosphere semedo et al 2009 babanin 2011 while the influence of swell waves in the mabl can extend up to the top of the boundary layer sullivan et al 2008 in wind sea dominated areas when waves are being generated the effect of waves is restricted to the first few meters of the atmosphere janssen 2004 hristov et al 2003 the climatological global wave heights resemble the global surface marine wind field the mean near surface wind speeds and the correspondent extremes are highest in the mid to high latitudes along the extratropical storm tracks with seasonal climatological maxima in the hemisphere winter gulev et al 2003 caires and sterl 2005 young 1999 semedo et al 2011 stopa et al 2014 wind speeds are lowest in the tropical and low latitudes nevertheless although some connection exists the climatological global significant wave heights swh do not exactly match the overlaying local marine wind field due to the propagating effect of waves this detachment between winds and wave heights ends up being highest in the inter tropical latitudes there the mean surface wind speeds are low but north and south bound swell waves generated in the mid latitudes prevail young 1999 having almost no relation with the local wind field semedo 2010 hanley et al 2010 and semedo et al 2011 showed that in most areas of the world ocean the wave field is dominated by swell more than 75 of the time even along the intense wind speed extratropical storm tracks in some areas the wave field characteristics have a strong seasonality for example in marginal or enclosed seas cavaleri et al 1991 tuomi et al 2011 galanis et al 2012 semedo et al 2014 this is also the case along equator ward eastern boundary currents ebc systems as already noticed by semedo et al 2011 where coast parallel strong local winds can occur playing an important role in the definition of regional wave climates these winds in the eastern flanks of the semi permanent subtropical high pressure cells along the five ebc systems are highly seasonal the semi permanent high pressure highs are part of the poleward branch of the hadley cells with a pronounced intra annual seasonality in winter due to the equatorward migration of the semi permanent highs the winds in the west mid latitude coastal areas are mostly from the west and northwest ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 during summer the high pressure systems migrate poleward and are more prevalent and thermal low pressure systems develop inland towards the east due to the day time radiative heating increase persistent equatorward coastal parallel wind features develop as the geostrophically adjusted response to the correspondent synoptic pattern a high pressure over the ocean and a low pressure inland rijo et al 2015 lima et al 2018 these winds are strongly linked to regional ocean dynamics with impacts both in the atmosphere and the ocean through an intrinsic atmosphere ocean coupling process beardsley et al 1987 they drive upwelling along the mid latitude west coasts due to offshore ekman transport bringing cold water to the surface vallis 2012 rijo et al 2017 the low sea surface temperature sst along the mid latitude continental west coasts in summer further sharpens the temperature and pressure gradients driving a local wind speed increase right at the coast it is within these coast parallel strong winds that mostly in summer coastal low level jets cllj winant et al 1988 ranjha et al 2013 develop that is the case off the coasts of california oregon along the california current iberia and northwest africa along the canary current chile along the humboldt current namibia angola along the benguela current and west australia along the west australian current the previously mentioned synoptic and regional patterns responsible for these coastal winds start to build during late spring and lasts until early fall ranjha et al 2013 soares et al 2014 rijo et al 2014 2017 lima et al 2018 although the interaction between the winds and the upwelling along ebc systems has been relatively well documented in previous studies e g bakun 1990 gersbach et al 1999 small and nicholls 2003 mohtadi et al 2005 narayan et al 2010 miranda et al 2013 that is not the case of the regional wave climate in these areas due to the strong seasonality of these coast parallel regional winds the wave climate characteristics there is also highly seasonal a qualitative analysis of the wave climate over the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc systems is precisely the main goal of this study the need for a qualitative analysis of the sea state characteristics has two fundamental reasons on the one hand as mentioned above the air sea interaction and exchanges are sea state dependent hence the need to understand which type of waves are more prevalent in a specific area on the other hand characterizing the wave climate in a specific area or globally by using the traditional swh and mean wave period mwp parameters might not be enough since they provide a limited description of the sea state two wave fields with the same swh and mwp may still be different in detail because they can be more or less dominated by one type of waves holthuijsen 2007 semedo et al 2011 the swh and mwp are integrated parameters computed directly from the wave spectra different sea states for example resulting from a light to moderate wind condition with incoming propagating swell and a locally generated wind sea from local winds can have similar swh or even mwp for this reason a more detailed investigation is needed to correctly characterize the wave field characteristics and the wave climate of a certain ocean area that is the case of the mid latitudes eastern continental coastal areas along the ebc systems where the wind regime varies considerably from winter to summer ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 potentially inducing similar variations on the regional wave fields wind sea and swell wave parameters can be investigated separately by the partitioning of the wave spectra into a high and low frequency parts gerling 1992 hanson and phillips 2001 the availability of wave spectra observations is scarce even in coastal areas wave spectra observation are available from in situ buoy measurements mostly in coastal areas in the northern hemisphere these point observations are nevertheless sparse and frequently have continuity problems due to gaps in the wave records and are therefore not suited for wave climate studies in large areas coastal hf high frequency radars can also provide wave spectra observations but the coverage is also limited and do not offer long enough data sets remote sensing synthetic aperture radar sar could be an alternative to wave buoys since they provide collocated wind and wave spectra observations nevertheless the retrieval of wave spectra from sar observations still poses problems that limit its use for wave climate purposes pandian et al 2011 particularly due to the fact that the high frequency part of the wave spectra is most of the times not observed kuo et al 1998 violante carvalho et al 2005 wave models are a good alternative to the limitations imposed by in situ and remote sensing observations offering global wave spectral data with the adequate temporal and spatial resolution wave reanalyses despite some problems like the lack of homogeneity sterl 2004 stopa and cheung 2014 or even some shortcomings related to long term tendencies aarnes et al 2015 are so far the only global wave dataset that can be used for wave climate qualitative studies where wave spectra are needed here a detailed study of the wave climate along ebc systems is presented following the previous studies of semedo et al 2011 2014 and the studies of raza et al 2013 and lima et al 2018 where the coastal winds in these areas where analyzed ranjha et al 2013 identified 6 major areas of occurrence of coastal low level jets along ebc systems and along the coast of oman see also ranjha et al 2015a our study is restricted to the five main upwelling areas of the ocean along the ebc systems the current study uses the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 the regional distribution and seasonal variation of the wind sea and swell swh and mwp parameters and how they combine in the total swh and mwp are presented the analysis of the prevalence of one type of waves over the other from an energy and predominance point of view is also examined the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the era interim reanalysis and the details about how wind sea and swell parameters are computed are presented in section 2 section 3 presents the climatology of the regional wind sea and swell characteristics in each of the five ebc systems and these results are discussed in section 4 the paper ends with the concluding remarks in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 era interim reanalysis data reanalyses have the goal of overcoming inhomogeneities related to model and data assimilation upgrades that occur regularly in operational forecasting models unfortunately inhomogeneities due to uneven data coverage in time and changes in observation systems remain uppala 1997 sterl 2004 aarnes et al 2015 stopa et al 2016 in the present study wind and wave data from the ecmwf era interim reanalysis are used era interim is a third generation reanalysis of meteorological observations starting in 1979 and being updated almost in real time the era interim was produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system ifs release cycle cy31r2 a two way coupled atmosphere wave model system janseen et al 2002 janssen 2004 and it includes both atmospheric and wave variables it is in fact the only reanalysis along with era 40 uppala et al 2005 that outputs wave parameters and assimilates wave data through a 4dvar four dimensional variational data assimilation scheme dee et al 2011 lorenc and rawlins 2005 observations of ocean wind speeds from vos voluntary observing ships buoys and remote sensing satellite scatterometery have been assimilated in the reanalysis process satellite altimetry wave heights were also assimilated since 1991 the wave model used in the ifs coupled model system was the third generation wam model wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric model is approximately 79 km t255 spectral truncation on a reduced gaussian grid while the wave model is run with shallow water physics with a horizontal resolution of 1 about 110 km the output resolution of era interim is 6 h the wave model set up in the era interim reanalysis uses the 2 minute gridded elevations bathymetry data for the world etopo2 ngdc 2006 additional details about the era interim reanalysis can be found in dee and uppala 2009 dee et al 2011 and aarnes et al 2015 here we use the period from 1979 to 2013 2 2 wave and wind parameters besides the total wave parameters

swell h s s t m s θ m s and wind sea h s w t m w θ m w wave fields respectively are used besides wave parameters wind speed u 10 and the wind direction φ at 10 m height are also used since the wind is a crucial parameter in the definition of the areas of study the wind sea and the swell parameters are computed by integrating f f θ over the high and low frequency parts of the energy wave spectra respectively separated by a characteristic frequency f corresponding to a wave phase speed 1 c g 2 π f 1 1 2 28 u c o s δ where u is the friction velocity and δ is the difference between the wave propagating direction and the wind direction δ θ φ bidlot 2001 the factor 28 corresponds to the peak wave phase speed from the pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 alves et al 2003 and 1 2 is a tuning parameter to assess the wind sea and swell wave climates along the ebc areas the era interim wind and wave parameters were processed for seasonal statistics following the wmo world meteorological society standards where seasons are defined and named as djf december to february mam march to may jja june to august and son september to november the climatological analysis is based on the djf and jja seasons winter or summer depending on the hemisphere despite some remarks in the text concerning mam and son the analysis is focused on the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc california canary humboldt benguela and west australia 3 waves climate along eastern boundary currents 3 1 global wind and wave climates the jja and djf seasonal maps for the climatological mean u 10 and φ global fields are shown in fig 1 as can be seen during boreal fig 1a and austral fig 1b summers coast parallel intense mean wind speeds occur off the mid latitude western continental coasts along the ebc systems these areas of interest where the present study will be focused are highlighted in red boxes in the respective hemisphere summer in fig 1a b these boxes are similar to the ones shown in ranjha et al 2013 and semedo et al 2015 where coastal jets were investigated an exception is the area along the canary ebc here a single area of study is assumed here instead of separating it into two areas iberia and northwest africa in jja fig 1a the highest climatological mean wind speeds in the north pacific sub basin occur along the california current these seasonal regional winds in jja are in fact stronger than the larger scale winds along the north pacific extratropical storm tracks and north pacific trades to some extend a similar situation takes place during jja in the north atlantic sub basin along the canary current although only off the coast of northwest africa are the wind speeds higher than along the mid latitude storm tracks and trade winds paths in djf fig 1b the close to surface wind speed fields in these two northern hemisphere areas are substantially different from jja during boreal winter the mean wind speed is now lower there and considerably lower than in the extratropical storm tracks and along the respective trade winds path in djf in the southern hemisphere high climatological mean wind speeds also occur along the humboldt benguela and west australia currents off the coasts of chile namibia angola and west australia respectively nevertheless in the southern hemisphere the strongest summer mean wind speeds still occur in the extratropical storm tracks in the southern ocean storm belt which displays a lower inter seasonal variability compared to the northern hemisphere during the austral winter in these areas the wind speed is also considerably different with a decrease in the local wind strength and an equatorward migration of the southern hemisphere storm belt from here onwards when the south pacific indian and atlantic oceans are mentioned it is assumed that the respective southern ocean sectors at higher latitudes are included unless otherwise mentioned the djf and jja global mean swh wave fields generated by the close to surface winds are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively the climatological mean hs h s s and h s w and the correspondent θ m θ m s and θ m w are shown separately allowing the propagating effect of swell and the local generation of wind sea waves to be seen and analyzed separately and in greater detail the seasonal large scale mean hs h s s and h s w from era 40 uppala et al 2005 were also presented by semedo et al 2008 2011 the era 40 reanalysis has been shown to under forecast high and extreme wave heights sterl and caires 2005 stopa et al 2013 although the comparison between era 40 and era interim swh is out of the scope of this study it is worth noticing that the climatological mean swh are as expected higher in era interim compared to the former this is most noticeable in the mean hs fields along the extratropical storm tracks in the respective hemisphere winter with differences in excess of 0 5 m as well as in the mean h s w fields also along the storm tracks in winter but also along the ebc systems and the trade winds paths in summer these differences between the two most recent ecmwf reanalyses are also present in the climatological mean u 10 fields shown in fig 1 besides the large scale features of the global mean hs fields figs 2a and 3a with higher seasonal mean maxima along the extratropical storm tracks during the respective hemisphere winter particularly in the southern ocean indian sector and larger lower inter seasonal variability in the north pacific and north atlantic southern ocean a careful attention should be taken to the mean jja and djf h s s and h s w fields the swell propagation features away from the wave generation areas in the mid and high latitudes towards the low latitudes are very clear figs 2b and 3b and are more noticeable than in the mean hs fields the swell propagation is clearer in the southern hemisphere winter jja particularly in the pacific ocean reaching far into the northern hemisphere but also in the indian ocean and to a less extend in the south atlantic sub basin the highest mean h s w values figs 2c and 3c are found during the respective hemisphere winter along the storm tracks in jja in the north pacific and north atlantic the highest mean h s w values coincide with the high mean u 10 values along the california and canary ebc areas in the north pacific and north atlantic respectively fig 1a in djf in the southern hemisphere the mean h s w values along the humboldt benguela and western australia ebc areas are not the highest in the respective sub basins since the climatological h s w maxima despite being summer lay along the intense extratropical storm tracks in the southern ocean as for the mean u 10 values fig 1b the lowest mean h s w values are found in the low latitudes regardless of the season also in mam and son not shown the general features of the mean h s w and u 10 are very similar which does not happen between h s s and u 10 reflecting the coupling between both fields this similarity is particularly noticeable along the five areas of study in the respective summer when u 10 increases as does the local h s w the alignment between θ m w and φ along the ebc areas coast parallel is also noticeable 3 2 regional wave climates a detailed analysis of the wave climate along the five ebc systems is presented in figs 4 8 the mean and extreme values of wind sea and swell parameters are shown allowing a comparison between the wave climates along the five areas of interest the summer jja or djf depending on the hemisphere climatological spatial distribution of the mean h s w 99 percentile as well as the ratios between h s s and h s w p w s and p w w where p w s and p w w are the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes respectively h s s and h s w 99 percentiles p w s and p w w 99 percentiles and the mean wind sea spectral energy weight at the surface ew et where ew and et are wind sea and total spectral density energies respectively are shown the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes or power in watts per linear wave crest meter w m 1 are defined as 2 p w s ρ g 2 64 π t m s h s s 2 3 p w w ρ g 2 64 π t m w h s 2 2 respectively where ρ is the sea water density and g is the gravitational acceleration the h s w 99 percentile h s 99 w fig 4a can reach values consistently higher than 2 m offshore california the maximum value is 2 4 m at the location marked as a white triangle on each area a key point is chosen using the h s 99 w maximum value see table 1 for geographic positions see also table 2 for the h s 99 w maximum values these extreme locally generated waves occurring about 1 of the time are steep waves with short wavelengths and periods not shown covering an area spanning from about 34 n to 44 n with an offshore extend of about 800 km these waves are the result of locally intensified extreme wind speeds also not shown that have grown rapidly in a limited fetch dimension coast parallel winds along the ebc systems in summer are primarily intensified by the ocean land temperature contrast at the coast but also due to the interaction of the flow with the coastal orography the warm subsiding air from the subtropical high pressure systems above and the cold marine air at the surface origin sharp temperature inversions that cap the mabl at the coast constraining the flow and the wind speed maxima at lower altitudes the temperature decrease of the marine layer along the coast due to the upwelling and low sst is further responsible for the sloping of the capping inversion towards the coast the increase of the wind speed nearshore in summer along the coastal areas above the five ebc systems is therefore the result of channelled flow with a temperature inversion above at 400 to 500 m ranjha et al 2013 soares et al 2014 rijo et al 2017 a sharp pressure gradient from the ocean to the coast and most of the times a mechanical constraint imposed by the coastal topography winant et al 1988 burk et al 1999 ranjha et al 2015b the low level coastal atmospheric flow along the ebc systems can also be intensified by the coastal topography and orientation burk and thompson 1996 tjernström and grisogono 2000 resulting in additional local enhancement of the wind speed through a process called expansion fan in the lee of capes and headlands winant et al 1988 this local enhancement of the wind speed is despite the coarse resolution captured by the era interim ranjha et al 2013 2015a with a direct impact on the wind sea waves field as seen in fig 4a where a bubble shaped area of intensified h s w occurs south of central california coastal headlands when compared to the mean swell heights in the same area fig 4b the mean summer h s w can be in the core of the intensified wind sea heights practically the same as h s s where h s s h s w 1 see table 2 which is a rare situation in the global ocean figs 2 and 3 and semedo et al 2011 when looking at the comparison between the summer extreme swell h s s 99 percentile h s 99 s and wind sea wave heights fig 4c it can be seen that extreme wind sea heights offshore the coast of central california are now higher than swell heights h s 99 s h s 99 w 0 8 this occurs given the proper conditions due to headland intensification of the local wind speed and then to the intensification of the locally generated waves that become higher than the remotely generated ones it must be understood nevertheless that this is the effect of several interconnected processes the synoptic pattern subtropical high and thermal low that aligns the along coast wind with the coastal headlands the low stt at the coast that sharpens the coastal wind speed and the low swell wave heights which in the summer can originate in the northern and southern hemisphere the wave energy flux or the ability of waves to actually perform work is a function of the wave heights to the second order but also of the wave periods to the first order hence for equal wave heights longer waves carry more energy per wave crest unit length eqs 2 and 3 the ratio between the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes fig 4d shows that despite the long swells reaching the area the locally generated wave energy flux is on average comparable i e p w s p w w 1 5 1 03 at the peak see table 2 it is worth mentioning the combination of the sheltering effect of the southern california bight and the intake of long swells from the south most probably from the southern hemisphere rising p w s p w w to values close to 20 or more the situation slightly changes when the summer swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes extreme values are compared fig 4e through the ratio between the swell and wind sea 99 percentiles p w 99 s and p w 99 w respectively now extreme wind sea wave heights although short in length can carry more energy than swell waves under extreme situations p w 99 s p w 99 w 1 during about 1 every summer ca 1 day per summer extreme locally generated waves consistently higher than 2 m height short but highly energized can occur offshore central california having a high destructive capability and posing a serious threat to the local navigation and ocean related seasonal tourism still having in mind wave energy and how it is distributed by wind sea and swell waves along the california ebc the mean wind sea spectral zeroth moment m o w and the total mean spectral moment m 0 were computed with the goal of assessing the summer mean wind sea energy density ew weight the zeroth wave spectral moment is defined as 4 m 0 f 0 f f θ d f d θ and m o w was computed by integrating the spectra from the separation frequency f to the highest frequency in the wave model frequency range and from 0 to 360 in direction the wave density spectral energy content or energy spectral weight as called by semedo et al 2011 of the wind sea was computed as the ratio e w e t m 0 w m 0 where et is the total wave energy density it should be noted that e w e t 1 e s e t m 0 s m 0 where es is the swell energy density and m 0 s is the swell spectral zeroth moment computed by integrating the spectra from lowest frequency in the frequency range and separation frequency f and from 0 to 360 in direction the summer mean wind sea spectral weight offshore california fig 4f shows that the wind sea part of the spectra is on average less that the swell one the jja mean ew et maximum value is close to 0 5 but less than that in most of the area meaning that at its maximum wind sea accounts for about half of the wave energy in the mean wave spectra nevertheless these values are within a range of 0 3 0 5 making the locally generated wave energy slightly lower and comparable to the one generated remotely which is an uncommon feature along the world oceans as shown by hanley et al 2010 and semedo et al 2011 in fig 5 the same statistics shown for the coast of california oregon are presented for the canary ebc in jja covering an area along iberia morocco and western sahara the h s 99 w along the canary current fig 5a shows different values from offshore west iberia to northwest africa with a clear separation between these two areas defined by the gulf of cadiz where locally generated waves decrease the extreme wind sea wave heights are lower along iberia 1 1 2 m compared the ones west of morocco and western sahara 1 4 1 6 m reaching a maximum of 1 7 m see table 2 and lower overall than along the california ebc mean fig 1a and extreme wind speeds not shown are higher offshore california compared to iberia and northwest africa ranjha et al 2013 and for that reason mean and extreme wind sea wave heights are also higher there the wind speed is intensified in the lee of several capes mostly along the coast morocco and western sahara with a direct impact on the locally generated waves when summer wind sea and swell wave heights are compared fig 5b h s s h s w only offshore western sahara h s w becomes comparable to h s s despite h s s h s w being always higher than 1 with a minimum value of 1 09 see table 2 with values similar to the offshore california ones this happens due to the local intensification of the wind speed driven by the interaction of the flow with the coastal orography this wind speed intensification has a direct impact on the raise of the locally generated wave heights that become in jja comparable to the remotely generated ones the local comparison between the jja swell and wind sea extreme wave heights fig 5c h s 99 s h s 99 w along canary current shows that particularly in the lee of major capes in morocco and western sahara extreme wind seas are higher than the swells although lower comparably than in california along western iberia h s 99 s h s 99 w 1 since not only extreme wind sea waves are lower there than in africa but also swell wave heights are higher the unique characteristic of the wind and wave fields long the canary ebc compared with the remaining four ebc should be noted not only the canary current is disrupted by the influx of mediterranean denser water into the north atlantic basin sinking as if flows through the gibraltar straight but also interacting with the equatorward surface flow pastor et al 2015 but also the coast line is also different from other continental mid latitude western coasts the gulf of cadiz disrupts the coast south of portugal and the flow encounters open waters situations finding coastal environment some hundreds of kilometers south in northwest africa therefore two separated centers of action exist along the canary current along western iberia and along the northwest african coast this fact was also mentioned by ranjha et al 2013 which separated the canary coastal jet in two the iberian coastal jet and the north africa coastal jet from the comparison between the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes in jja fig 5d it can be seen that despite the local intensification of the wind speed as in california swell waves along the canary ebc still carry on average more energy than the former with values of the ratio p w s p w w 1 5 1 41 at its minimum see table 2 the higher mean values of p w s p w w representing less wind sea energy flux take place are along west iberia when summer extreme values of swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes are compared fig 5e p s 99 w values are closer to p s 99 s particularly along the coasts of morocco and western sahara but still remotely generated waves carry more energy than the local ones which is not the case along the california ebc where in extreme events p s 99 s p s 99 w 1 nevertheless in extreme situations mostly along the northwest coast of africa severe wind speed events can lead to extreme locally generated wave heights carrying considerable amounts of energy the wind sea wave energy density weight fig 5f is about the same as in california close to 0 4 at its peak along the western sahara coast the sheltering effect of the canary islands limits to a certain extent swell energy density content there while the local intensification of the wind speed due to the interaction of the flow with the coastal headlands increases the relative content of the wind sea energy density role analogous statistics were also computed for the southern hemisphere ebc areas for the austral summer one of the characteristics of the winds along the southern hemisphere ebc particularly along the humboldt and benguela currents is their lower seasonality compared to the northern hemisphere ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 hence besides djf relevant wind sea waves are expected to be generated there in mom and son not shown but also during the austral winter figs 1b and 2 the summer wave field statistics along the humboldt ebc are shown in fig 6 the mean extreme wind sea wave heights fig 6a h s 99 w there are at its peak of the order of 1 8 1 9 m see table 2 lower than offshore california but comparable to the canary ebc area the local intensification of the wind speed due to the interaction of the flow with coastal topography has also been previously documented muñoz and garreud 2005 garreud and muñoz 2005 and has a direct impact on the wind sea wave heights locally the comparison between the mean djf wind sea and swell wave heights fig 6b h s s h s w reveals that contrary to what happens along the northern hemisphere ebc areas offshore chile the wind sea wave heights are lower that the swell ones therefore h s s h s w is always clearly higher than 1 1 76 at its peak see table 2 the southern ocean wind speed and wave height seasonality is lower than in the northern hemisphere figs 1 3 for that reason despite the clear local generation of wind sea waves in summer along the humboldt ebc waves keep being generated along the southern ocean storm belt in the pacific and indian sectors propagating northward as swells and reaching the coast of chile so in that area the mean wind sea wave heights are clearly lower that the swell ones making wave climate offshore chile different from the equivalent areas in the northern hemisphere the situation changes slightly when extreme wind sea and swell wave heights are compared fig 6c h s 99 s h s 99 w now the local extreme waves are more comparable to the swell extreme wave heights but still h s 99 s h s 99 w 1 1 36 at its peak see table 2 is the overall situation which is still different from what occurs in the northern hemisphere once again due to the strong swell intake the southern ocean swell effect along the humboldt ebc in djf is even more pronounced when the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes are compared p w s p w w fig 6d longer and still relatively high swell therefore carrying a great amount of energy reach the area the wind sea wave energy flux when compared to the swell power is clearly lower and p w s p w w 4 this ratio is different from the northern hemisphere where the locally generated wave energy flux is comparable to the swell one the total wave energy flux offshore chile not shown is also higher than along the california and canary currents the extreme wind sea and swell energy fluxes are more comparable fig 6e than their respective means although remotely generated waves still dominate energy wise compared to the locally generated ones the ratio of the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes 99 percentiles p s 99 s p s 99 w fig 6e shows that swell waves power is still 3 3 5 times higher than wind sea waves with a minimum value of 3 01 see table 2 a similar pattern occurs when looking at the djf wind sea energy spectral weight ew et fig 6f which is lower compared to similar patterns along california and iberia and northwest africa the wind sea energy spectral weight in this region is at its peak of the order of 30 and less than that in most of the area offshore chile swell waves generated far in the pacific extratropical storm tracks thus have a higher role along the humboldt ebc in terms of energy compared to the locally generated waves and in comparison to the northern hemisphere as in the humboldt current benguela has two characteristics differentiating it from the northern hemisphere ebc on the one hand the coastal winds offshore namibia and south angola have a lower seasonality ranjha et al 2013 patricola et al 2016 lima et al 2018 with a considerable occurrence of coastal low level jets almost all year round lima et al 2018 on the other hand the south atlantic as in the indian and pacific oceans is still very active storm wise in summer with considerable wave generation activity figs 1 3 nevertheless the south atlantic has some unique characteristics that make it different from the south pacific the narrow drake passage prevents most of the south indian and pacific oceans swell to penetrate the south atlantic which is not the case of the pacific ocean that receives swell waves from the south indian ocean young 1999 alves et al 2003 semedo et al 2011 and the south atlantic storm activity and strength and wind speed are less intense than their indian and pacific ocean counterparts fig 1 fig 7 depicts the benguela ebc wave climate statistics the extreme wind sea wave heights h s 99 w shown in fig 7a are similar to the humboldt ebc 1 7 1 8 m on the other hand since the intake of south atlantic swell into the area is lower the djf mean wind sea and swell wave heights ratio fig 7b h s s h s w is slightly lower 1 4 minimum value see table 2 than offshore chile revealing a higher contribution of locally generated waves as in the remaining ebc the local intensification of the wind speed along the benguela current due to the interaction with costal morphology nicholson 2010 patricola et al 2016 contributes to the increased role of the locally generated waves seen also in the comparison between extreme wind sea and swell waves fig 7c h s 99 s h s 99 w with values close to 1 lower than offshore chile 1 4 see table 2 this effect is not enough to raise the wind sea wave energy flux to the same level of the swell power in the area nevertheless swell and wind sea energy fluxes are more comparable fig 7d along the benguela ebc than offshore chile with p w s p w w 3 2 47 minimum see table 2 which is lower than along the humboldt ebc and closer to the california and canary currents the results of the comparison between the extreme swell and wind sea wave fluxes fig 7e p s 99 s p s 99 w are very similar the mean values comparison with extreme swells transporting around at least twice more energy 2 47 at the peak see table 2 than extreme locally generated waves the djf wind sea wind sea energy spectral percentage fig 7f ew et is very similar to the one in chile 30 35 and lower than the ebc currents in the northern hemisphere the indian ocean wave climate has also some distinctive characteristics compared to the pacific and the atlantic oceans its north span ends in the arabian sea at around 20 n and it has only one main wave generation area in the south extratropical storm tracks on the other hand the highest mean wave heights in the global ocean occur in the southern indian ocean while the most extreme wave heights occur in the north atlantic sub basin not shown in jja the mean hs along the southern ocean storm belt indian sector reaches mean values of the order of 6 m fig 2a and in djf these values are still high with mean hs higher than 4 m fig 2b these waves propagate eastward as swell all year round but also northward literally propagating wave energy across the entire indian ocean basin figs 2b and 3b these swells also reach the west australia coast where local waves are generated due to the summer wind speed increase as in the remaining ebc areas the djf statistics of the balance between wind sea and swell waves offshore west australia the last of the five ebc depicted here are shown in fig 8 the extreme locally generated summer waves along west australia fig 8a h s 99 w are almost as high the california ebc ones 2 0 m maximum see table 2 opposite to what happens along the other two southern hemisphere ebc winds offshore west australia have a well defined seasonality being virtually absent in winter and are also slightly stronger than along the coasts of chile and namibia angola for these reasons despite the high mean swell waves that propagate from the higher latitudes into the area mean locally generated wave heights are still comparable to those with h s s h s w values of the order of 1 5 fig 8b similar to humboldt and higher than in benguela when considering extreme local waves offshore west australia they are now more comparable to extreme swells fig 8c h s 99 s h s 99 w extreme wind speeds contribute to these high locally generated waves reaching heights close to swell waves where h s 99 s h s 99 w shows values closer to 1 1 24 at its peak see table 2 lower than along humboldt ebc and similar to offshore namibia angola long swell waves generated southward are still more energized carrying on the mean more energy than local waves fig 8d since p w s p w w 3 or higher when extreme waves are considered fig 8e p s 99 s p s 99 w these values are lower 2 3 at its peak see table 2 the west australia wind sea wind sea energy spectral percentage fig 8f ew et is of the order of 25 30 which is comparable to the humbolt and benguela ebc areas but lower than along the california and canary ebc currents summer and winter scatter diagrams of hs and u 10 are shown in fig 9 for the five ebc the scatter plots are built for the respective djf and jja season from specific key points marked as white triangle on panels a in figs 4 8 and the 8 grid points around them the key points were chosen considering the peak values of h s 99 w at each area during the correspondent summer and are seen as representative extreme summer wind sea positions of the respective areas the pierson moskowitz fully developed seas empirical relation between u 10 and hs is also shown in each scatter plot this empirical relation found by pierson and moskowitz 1964 and further corrected by alves et al 2003 defined as 5 h s 0 025 u 10 2 is shown as a red line in the scatter plots the fully developed relation line can be seen as a separation between the wind sea and swell sea states the u 10 and hs pairs under the line represent developing seas where wind sea dominates and the ones above are considered swell dominated seas with wave ages lower and higher than 1 2 respectively according to the wave growth theory u 10 and hs follow a monotonic relation at the growing sea state koeman et al 1994 until a fully developed spectrum corresponding to a saturated level is achieved the equilibrium saturated state represented by eq 5 is an asymptotic state where the wave spectrum is fully developed and from then on only its shape and peak frequency are changing slowly in time the wave age parameter is defined as cp u 10 where cp is the peak wave phase speed from eq 5 and from the pierson and moskowitz spectral theory pierson and moskowitz 1964 it can be demonstrated that the fully developed sea state corresponds to a wave age of 1 2 where cp 1 2u 10 holthuijse 2008 alves et al 2003 semedo 2010 semedo et al 2012 högström et al 2011 the higher levels of scattering at the five areas in the respective winters fig 9a c for california and canary and fig 9f h j for humboldt benguela and west australia and the highest density of points clearly above the respective fully developed seas lines emphasizes the dominant presence of swell or remotely generated waves interestingly despite the distance between the areas of interest the shape of the scatter plots is rather similar indicating the same type of winter sea state regimes the california ebc has a higher dispersion of the hs u 10 pairs and a different scatter plot shape fig 9a due to the presence of northern and southern hemisphere swells the open shape of the pacific ocean and to the strong wave generation activity in the southern ocean even during the austral summer allows the arrival of swells from both hemispheres in djf to the coast of california during jja in the california and canary ebc areas the situation changes significantly the dispersion is much lower with more points concentrated in the vicinity and below the fully developed line revealing a wind sea dominated sea states the situation in the northern hemisphere during the boreal summer is different from the southern hemisphere since the extratropical storm activity is low and the high wind speed events do occur but along the two ebc giving rise to strong wind sea dominated sea states offshore california and mostly morocco and west sahara nevertheless some swell waves generated in the southern hemisphere propagate into california in jja hence in this area the number of points above the fully developed seas line is higher as is the dispersion during djf along the humboldt benguela and west australia ebc the scattering is lower than in jja with a higher number of points on the wind sea dominated side the dispersion of the hs u 10 pairs in these three areas although lower than in winter is higher than in the two northern hemisphere areas this occurs due to the low seasonality of the wave climate in the southern hemisphere with waves being generated in the extratropical latitudes even in summer which propagate into the coasts of chile namibia angola and west australia 3 3 intra annual variability fig 10 displays the intra annual variability monthly means of the close to surface wind speed u 10 significant wave heights hs h s s and h s w and mean wave periods tm t m s and t m w at 9 grid points at the 5 key points in each ebc area plus the 8 grid points around them the intra annual variability of u 10 in the five key points shows a gradual increase of the local wind speed during the hemisphere summer this increase is more defined in the california and canary currents and in the west australia current along these areas a clear peak in july for the northern hemisphere areas and january for west australia can be seen corresponding to the highest summer mean wind speed this summer increase is lower and more gradual offshore chile and namibia with a less defined mean wind speed increase and highest wind speeds occurring during 4 months from november to february in the humboldt ebc and virtually for 6 months in the benguela ebc from october to march not surprisingly the h s w and t m w intra annual variabilities at the five areas of interest show a very high correlation with the close to surface wind speed inter annual variability 0 95 in the california and canary areas the mean hs decreases during summer as does h s s nevertheless the decrease in hs is lower than the swell heights due to the effect of the locally generated waves that are higher during summer balancing the decrease of h s s in the canary ebc during july the mean hs actually increases due to the increase of the mean july h s w since the h s s also decreases during that month in july the mean values of h s w offshore california and the atlantic coast of morocco is almost the same as h s s a similar behaviour and relation can be found in the west australia ebc with the peak of h s w taking place in january nevertheless in this area the mean h s w is always lower than h s s despite the fact that locally generated waves do drive the slight increase tendency of the mean hs during the austral summer opposite to the h s s behaviour the intra annual variability of the wave heights offshore chile and namibia is different from the remaining three areas in these two regions the mean h s s variation throughout the year is very low despite the increase of the locally generated wave heights during part of the year cantered in the austral summer months it has a low effect on the annual cycle of hs which ends up being more controlled by the all year round impinging swells 4 discussion as shown in the previous section the effect of the summer intensified wind speeds on the local wave field along the five ebc is notorious along these five areas the ratio between the swell and wind sea wave heights h s s h s w decreases in summer due to the rise of the locally generated wave heights this increase is also reflected in the higher energy content of the local waves during summer as well as in extreme locally generated wave heights summary in table 2 the effect of the summer local winds in the local wave field is similar between the five regions nevertheless some differences prevail due to the intake of swell waves but also due to the different wind speed seasonal variabilities as shown in fig 10 a clear indicator of these differences can be seen on fig 9 from the dispersion along the fully developed seas line during summer the dispersion of the hs u 10 pairs is lower in summer compared to the respective winter lower in the california and canary ebc compared to the remaining southern hemisphere ebc this dispersion has been assessed by computing the percentage of hs u 10 pairs above and below the fully generated seas line but also by computing the mean distance to this line for the points above and below the line where positive values represent the former and negative values the later additionally the standard distance sd of the hs u 10 scatter distribution has been computed the standard distance measures the compactness of a distribution providing a single value a distance representing the dispersion around the centre computed as 6 s d i 1 n h s i h s 2 n i 1 n u 10 i u 10 2 n where n is the number of events in this case 460 188 9 points times 12 783 days in the 1979 2013 period time 4 outputs per day and h s and u 10 are the mean values of the swh and wind speed at 10 m these statistical parameters have been computed for jja and djf for nine grid points centred at each area respective key point see white triangle on panels a in figs 4 8 and geographic positions in table 1 and can be seen on table 3 the california ebc mostly on the norwest african sector area stands out as the area where in summer locally generated waves are highest more extreme and carry more energy fig 4 and table 2 nevertheless the summer wave field along the canary ebc shows that wind sea dominated wave fields are more prevalent compared to off shore california and to the remaining southern hemisphere ebc areas in jja wind sea dominated wave events occur 48 4 of the times table 3a when the hs u 10 are under the fully developed curve fig 9d in the canary ebc this is in fact higher than in california 43 5 in jja and humboldt benguela and west australia 20 3 27 9 and 24 1 respectively in djf the southern hemisphere summer also along the canary ebc the summer wave field is less scattered i e more compact along the fully developed sea state and its mean centre value since the mean distance of the swell and wind sea events to this curve are 0 53 and 0 31 table 3b are lower than in any other area as is the standard distance 1 90 table 3c on the other hand in djf wind sea events along the canary ebc off shore northwest africa are low occurring only 8 1 of the times table 3a which is lower than in california west australia is the ebc area with lowest wind sea dominated winter events only 4 1 in jja table 3a this occurs because there is virtually no local wind in winter along west australia fig 1 and ranjha et al 2013 although strikingly similar as mentioned before the characteristics of the southern hemisphere regional wave fields along the three ebc have some differences compared to the california and canary ebc areas summer djf wind sea swell dominated events are lower higher than in the northern hemisphere this occurs mostly due to the lower seasonality of the wind along the southern ocean storm belt in the pacific atlantic and indian sectors generating waves that propagate as swell even in summer that reach the southern hemisphere ebc areas for example the mean wind speed along west australia is relatively high in djf higher than along the humboldt and benguela and comparable to the california in jja figs 1 and 10 nevertheless the swell intake in the indian ocean is so high that prevents wind sea events to prevail in that area to a certain extent the same occurs off shore chile and namibia angola a summary of the mean hs h s s and h s w values in the same nine grid points mentioned above centered each area respective key point for jja and djf as well as for the respective summer months june to august and december to february are shown in table 4 the mean hs during austral summer along the three southern hemisphere ebc is higher than in california and canary ebc areas in jja that occurs due to the intake of swell in the southern hemisphere since in those three areas in djf the mean h s s is considerably higher than the mean h s w there the summer difference between h s s and h s w along california and canary ebc is smaller when looking at the mean monthly values as in fig 10 clear peak monthly mean h s w values can be identified june for california and july for canary in the northern hemisphere areas which is not the case in the southern hemisphere areas where the mean h s w is almost the same throughout the austral summer the summer mean h s w offshore chile and namibia angola is lower than in california but higher than along the california ebc the summer mean hs along the west australia is the highest of the five ebc areas with the highest summer mean h s s and the same mean h s w as in california 5 concluding remarks a qualitative analysis of the wave climate over the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc systems has been presented based on the era interim reanalysis wave data the analysis used the swell wind sea partition from the wave model wam and the swell and wind sea parameters available in era interim data set as in e g hanley et al 2010 and semedo et al 2008 2011 2014 despite the relatively coarse resolution of era interim 0 7 in the atmospheric parameters and 1 in the wave parameters it can be seen as an adequate data set even in these coastal areas ranjha et al 2013 and lima et al 2018 allowing a coherent relative comparison between the five areas of interest the strong seasonality of the coastal winds along the five ebc ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 and fig 1 has been shown to have a direct influence on the locally generated waves triggering a peculiar regional wave climate strongly dominated by swell in the winter when the local mean local wind speed is low and high wind sea waves in summer when the along coast wind speed increases and is responsible for the locally generated waves the locally generated waves along the ebc in extreme wind speed situations become high of the order of 2 2 5 m table 2 and panels a on figs 4 8 which can be seen as considerably high if we look at the areas downwind of capes and coastal headlands as limited fetch areas since these local waves are young waves they are also relatively short lengthened and hence rather steep not shown posing serious threats to coastal community seafarers such as fishing vessels or summer tourism boating activity it should be noted that the five main ocean upwelling systems lay exactly along the mid latitude western coasts due to the strong summer wind speed these cold upwelled nutrient reach waters are responsible for the rich fishing resources mainly in summer when coastal fishing activity is stronger vallis 2000 leitão et al 2014 the direct effect of the summer intensified wind speeds on the local wave field in the western mid latitudes coastal areas along the five ebc has been studied a qualitative study of the wave fields in these areas has been presented by comparing swell remote and wind sea local waves quantifying their relative weight not only in terms of their swh but also on their mean and extreme energy content the h s w role compared to h s s in summer is highest than in any of the remaining four ebc areas offshore california extreme wind sea wave heights are highest 2 4 m have almost the same mean height and mean wave energy flux as swell and have the highest spectral weight of the five ebc areas see table 2 despite the distance between them the wave climates along these five ebc areas are strikingly similar for example the california ebc area wave field is rather similar to the australia ebc one figs 2 and 3 and tables 2 4 where for example the summer mean h s w is the same and the swell wind sea weight h s s h s w is only lower in australia because of the higher mean swell wave heights there the reason for the similarities between the five areas lays in the fact that the atmospheric synoptic and regional scales responsible for the winds and waves basin wide and regionally share similar mechanisms although similar the characteristics of the southern hemisphere regional wave fields along the three ebc have some differences compared to the california and canary ebc areas these differences being due mostly to the lower seasonality of the southern ocean storm belt generating waves that propagate equatorward as swell even during the austral summer and defining regional and ocean basin scale wave climates a study of how waves impact the regional climates of the mid latitude continental coastal areas and consequent impact in land remains to be studied it can be assumed that during summer when wind sea waves are more prevalent and the wave field is more prone to wave breaking and white capping the wave induce turbulence further induced the mixing of the ocean surface layer this mixing should therefore decrease the sst in the wind sea dominated areas where the wind speed is highest and contribute to the local thermal pressure gradient and ultimately to an increase of the wind speed the study of the impact of enhanced wind speed and cllj in the lee of capes and headlands on the atmosphere has been studied nuss et al 2000 patricola and chang 2016 the direct impact of these enhanced wind speeds due to expansion fan processes in the local upwelling and sst and on how locally generated waves interact with the upwelled cold waters remains to be studied also the interaction of the locally generated waves and the local wave driven currents stronger in summer as shown by carrasco et al 2014 and the larger scale ebc is a subject that should be addressed in future research climate change impact on the wind fields along the ebc systems has been the subject or recent research miranda et al 2013 semedo et al 2016 cardoso et al 2016 soares et al 2016 2017 it has been shown that coastal winds are projected to occur in the future with west iberia being on of the areas where potential changes might occur in the context of wave climate projections studies e g hemer et al 2013 semedo et al 2013 dobrinyn et al 2013 2015 global to regional wave climate projections along the eastern boundary currents should therefore be studied acknowledgements alvaro semedo and pedro m m

24093,the wind fields along the five eastern boundary currents ebc systems california canary humboldt benguela and west australia are highly seasonal this seasonality is mostly determined by the position of the semi permanent high pressure cells over the ocean during summer these high pressure cells with a thermal low pressure systems inland are the synoptic drivers of along coast winds these strong summer winds along the ebc systems off shore mid latitude continental coasts generate waves that can be rather extreme considering that these areas can be seen as limited fetch wave fields a qualitative analysis of the wave climate over the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc systems based on the era interim reanalysis wave data is presented the influence of coastal wind speed intensification processes in these areas like the occurrence of coastal low level jets and expansion fans in the lee of headlands and capes on the local wave field is studied it is shown that despite the distance between the five ebc systems their wave fields particularly during summer are very similar when the wind sea and swell characteristics are balanced in summer locally generated wave heights and energy content along ebc areas are comparable or even higher than swell ones 1 introduction wind waves are the inevitable consequence of the wind action over the air sea interface with gravity acting as the restoring force hence they can also be called surface gravity waves wind waves henceforth simply called waves mediate the exchange of primarily momentum between winds and the ocean surface but they also modulate exchanges of heat mass and gases between the ocean and the atmosphere also altering the radiative characteristics of the ocean surface babanin et al 2012 waves therefore play an important role in the coupled ocean atmosphere climate system rutgersson et al 2010 cavaleri et al 2012 patricola et al 2016 while generated by the local wind waves have the ubiquitous characteristic of propagating away from their generating area for that reason at the ocean surface two types of waves coexist waves under growing process intimately coupled with the local wind field are called wind sea once these waves propagate away from their generation area out speeding the local wind and no longer receiving energy from it they are called swell swells can travel across entire ocean basins losing very little energy ursel 1956 munk et al 1963 snodgrass et al 1966 young et al 1999 alves 2006 ardhuin et al 2009 before they eventually shoal and break at a coast swell waves can be called as young or old swells depending on the distance to their generation area it is because swells can propagate long distances that the wave field in the open ocean is most of the times the result of contributions from local and remotely generated waves with different origins and ages hanley et al 2010 semedo et al 2008 semedo 2010 recently it has been shown that swell dominates the global wave field chen et al 2002 semedo et al 2011 even along the main wave generation areas along the northern and southern hemisphere extratropical storm paths several observational studies e g drennan et al 1999 smedman et al 1999 2009 hogstrom et al 2009 2013 have shown that waves impact on the air sea exchanges is sea state dependent i e it depends on the qualitative characteristics of the wave field being influenced by the prevalence of one type of waves over the other when swell waves propagate into light wind areas with phase speeds much higher than the local wind speed they can have an impact on the lower atmosphere inducing a pressure perturbation in the first few meters of the marine atmospheric boundary layer mabl in these situations waves lose energy to the atmosphere as they propagate ardhuin and jenkins 2006 and accelerate the airflow at lower altitudes in the form of the so called wave driven wind harris 1966 sullivan et al 2008 or wave driven low level jet hogstrom et al 2009 this acceleration of the flow at low levels induces a departure from the logarithmic wind profile semedo et al 2009 nilsen et al 2012 for this reason swell has a consistent influence in the overall structure of the mabl in light wind areas since it reduces the wind shear in the boundary layer and consequently the mechanical production of turbulence smedman et al 1999 potter 2015 on the other hand under the wave generating process momentum is transferred from the atmosphere into the ocean this momentum is extracted from the wind field jansen et al 2002 janssen 2004 generating waves but also driving wind currents and triggering wave breaking and whitecapping koeman et al 1994 1998 waves also induce the so called wave induced currents at the ocean surface stokes 1847 that are mostly driven by wind sea waves mcwilliams and restrepo 1999 carrasco et al 2014 the wave breaking and white capping that occurs in high wind speed regimes when waves are being generated enhances the turbulence in the ocean surface mixing layer with great influence in the mass and gas transfer between the ocean and the lower atmosphere semedo et al 2009 babanin 2011 while the influence of swell waves in the mabl can extend up to the top of the boundary layer sullivan et al 2008 in wind sea dominated areas when waves are being generated the effect of waves is restricted to the first few meters of the atmosphere janssen 2004 hristov et al 2003 the climatological global wave heights resemble the global surface marine wind field the mean near surface wind speeds and the correspondent extremes are highest in the mid to high latitudes along the extratropical storm tracks with seasonal climatological maxima in the hemisphere winter gulev et al 2003 caires and sterl 2005 young 1999 semedo et al 2011 stopa et al 2014 wind speeds are lowest in the tropical and low latitudes nevertheless although some connection exists the climatological global significant wave heights swh do not exactly match the overlaying local marine wind field due to the propagating effect of waves this detachment between winds and wave heights ends up being highest in the inter tropical latitudes there the mean surface wind speeds are low but north and south bound swell waves generated in the mid latitudes prevail young 1999 having almost no relation with the local wind field semedo 2010 hanley et al 2010 and semedo et al 2011 showed that in most areas of the world ocean the wave field is dominated by swell more than 75 of the time even along the intense wind speed extratropical storm tracks in some areas the wave field characteristics have a strong seasonality for example in marginal or enclosed seas cavaleri et al 1991 tuomi et al 2011 galanis et al 2012 semedo et al 2014 this is also the case along equator ward eastern boundary currents ebc systems as already noticed by semedo et al 2011 where coast parallel strong local winds can occur playing an important role in the definition of regional wave climates these winds in the eastern flanks of the semi permanent subtropical high pressure cells along the five ebc systems are highly seasonal the semi permanent high pressure highs are part of the poleward branch of the hadley cells with a pronounced intra annual seasonality in winter due to the equatorward migration of the semi permanent highs the winds in the west mid latitude coastal areas are mostly from the west and northwest ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 during summer the high pressure systems migrate poleward and are more prevalent and thermal low pressure systems develop inland towards the east due to the day time radiative heating increase persistent equatorward coastal parallel wind features develop as the geostrophically adjusted response to the correspondent synoptic pattern a high pressure over the ocean and a low pressure inland rijo et al 2015 lima et al 2018 these winds are strongly linked to regional ocean dynamics with impacts both in the atmosphere and the ocean through an intrinsic atmosphere ocean coupling process beardsley et al 1987 they drive upwelling along the mid latitude west coasts due to offshore ekman transport bringing cold water to the surface vallis 2012 rijo et al 2017 the low sea surface temperature sst along the mid latitude continental west coasts in summer further sharpens the temperature and pressure gradients driving a local wind speed increase right at the coast it is within these coast parallel strong winds that mostly in summer coastal low level jets cllj winant et al 1988 ranjha et al 2013 develop that is the case off the coasts of california oregon along the california current iberia and northwest africa along the canary current chile along the humboldt current namibia angola along the benguela current and west australia along the west australian current the previously mentioned synoptic and regional patterns responsible for these coastal winds start to build during late spring and lasts until early fall ranjha et al 2013 soares et al 2014 rijo et al 2014 2017 lima et al 2018 although the interaction between the winds and the upwelling along ebc systems has been relatively well documented in previous studies e g bakun 1990 gersbach et al 1999 small and nicholls 2003 mohtadi et al 2005 narayan et al 2010 miranda et al 2013 that is not the case of the regional wave climate in these areas due to the strong seasonality of these coast parallel regional winds the wave climate characteristics there is also highly seasonal a qualitative analysis of the wave climate over the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc systems is precisely the main goal of this study the need for a qualitative analysis of the sea state characteristics has two fundamental reasons on the one hand as mentioned above the air sea interaction and exchanges are sea state dependent hence the need to understand which type of waves are more prevalent in a specific area on the other hand characterizing the wave climate in a specific area or globally by using the traditional swh and mean wave period mwp parameters might not be enough since they provide a limited description of the sea state two wave fields with the same swh and mwp may still be different in detail because they can be more or less dominated by one type of waves holthuijsen 2007 semedo et al 2011 the swh and mwp are integrated parameters computed directly from the wave spectra different sea states for example resulting from a light to moderate wind condition with incoming propagating swell and a locally generated wind sea from local winds can have similar swh or even mwp for this reason a more detailed investigation is needed to correctly characterize the wave field characteristics and the wave climate of a certain ocean area that is the case of the mid latitudes eastern continental coastal areas along the ebc systems where the wind regime varies considerably from winter to summer ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 potentially inducing similar variations on the regional wave fields wind sea and swell wave parameters can be investigated separately by the partitioning of the wave spectra into a high and low frequency parts gerling 1992 hanson and phillips 2001 the availability of wave spectra observations is scarce even in coastal areas wave spectra observation are available from in situ buoy measurements mostly in coastal areas in the northern hemisphere these point observations are nevertheless sparse and frequently have continuity problems due to gaps in the wave records and are therefore not suited for wave climate studies in large areas coastal hf high frequency radars can also provide wave spectra observations but the coverage is also limited and do not offer long enough data sets remote sensing synthetic aperture radar sar could be an alternative to wave buoys since they provide collocated wind and wave spectra observations nevertheless the retrieval of wave spectra from sar observations still poses problems that limit its use for wave climate purposes pandian et al 2011 particularly due to the fact that the high frequency part of the wave spectra is most of the times not observed kuo et al 1998 violante carvalho et al 2005 wave models are a good alternative to the limitations imposed by in situ and remote sensing observations offering global wave spectral data with the adequate temporal and spatial resolution wave reanalyses despite some problems like the lack of homogeneity sterl 2004 stopa and cheung 2014 or even some shortcomings related to long term tendencies aarnes et al 2015 are so far the only global wave dataset that can be used for wave climate qualitative studies where wave spectra are needed here a detailed study of the wave climate along ebc systems is presented following the previous studies of semedo et al 2011 2014 and the studies of raza et al 2013 and lima et al 2018 where the coastal winds in these areas where analyzed ranjha et al 2013 identified 6 major areas of occurrence of coastal low level jets along ebc systems and along the coast of oman see also ranjha et al 2015a our study is restricted to the five main upwelling areas of the ocean along the ebc systems the current study uses the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 the regional distribution and seasonal variation of the wind sea and swell swh and mwp parameters and how they combine in the total swh and mwp are presented the analysis of the prevalence of one type of waves over the other from an energy and predominance point of view is also examined the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the era interim reanalysis and the details about how wind sea and swell parameters are computed are presented in section 2 section 3 presents the climatology of the regional wind sea and swell characteristics in each of the five ebc systems and these results are discussed in section 4 the paper ends with the concluding remarks in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 era interim reanalysis data reanalyses have the goal of overcoming inhomogeneities related to model and data assimilation upgrades that occur regularly in operational forecasting models unfortunately inhomogeneities due to uneven data coverage in time and changes in observation systems remain uppala 1997 sterl 2004 aarnes et al 2015 stopa et al 2016 in the present study wind and wave data from the ecmwf era interim reanalysis are used era interim is a third generation reanalysis of meteorological observations starting in 1979 and being updated almost in real time the era interim was produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system ifs release cycle cy31r2 a two way coupled atmosphere wave model system janseen et al 2002 janssen 2004 and it includes both atmospheric and wave variables it is in fact the only reanalysis along with era 40 uppala et al 2005 that outputs wave parameters and assimilates wave data through a 4dvar four dimensional variational data assimilation scheme dee et al 2011 lorenc and rawlins 2005 observations of ocean wind speeds from vos voluntary observing ships buoys and remote sensing satellite scatterometery have been assimilated in the reanalysis process satellite altimetry wave heights were also assimilated since 1991 the wave model used in the ifs coupled model system was the third generation wam model wamdi group 1988 komen et al 1994 the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric model is approximately 79 km t255 spectral truncation on a reduced gaussian grid while the wave model is run with shallow water physics with a horizontal resolution of 1 about 110 km the output resolution of era interim is 6 h the wave model set up in the era interim reanalysis uses the 2 minute gridded elevations bathymetry data for the world etopo2 ngdc 2006 additional details about the era interim reanalysis can be found in dee and uppala 2009 dee et al 2011 and aarnes et al 2015 here we use the period from 1979 to 2013 2 2 wave and wind parameters besides the total wave parameters wind sea and swell parameters are also used in the present study with the goal of assessing qualitatively the role of local and remotely generated waves along ebc systems in the wave model wam the integrated wave parameters are computed from the two dimensional 2d wave energy spectra f f θ where f is the frequency and θ the propagating direction the wave spectra are outputted at each grid point upon solving the so called spectral wave action balance equation wamdi group 1994 koeman et al 1994 in the present study the swh mwp and mean wave direction mwd parameters from the total hs tm θ m swell h s s t m s θ m s and wind sea h s w t m w θ m w wave fields respectively are used besides wave parameters wind speed u 10 and the wind direction φ at 10 m height are also used since the wind is a crucial parameter in the definition of the areas of study the wind sea and the swell parameters are computed by integrating f f θ over the high and low frequency parts of the energy wave spectra respectively separated by a characteristic frequency f corresponding to a wave phase speed 1 c g 2 π f 1 1 2 28 u c o s δ where u is the friction velocity and δ is the difference between the wave propagating direction and the wind direction δ θ φ bidlot 2001 the factor 28 corresponds to the peak wave phase speed from the pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 alves et al 2003 and 1 2 is a tuning parameter to assess the wind sea and swell wave climates along the ebc areas the era interim wind and wave parameters were processed for seasonal statistics following the wmo world meteorological society standards where seasons are defined and named as djf december to february mam march to may jja june to august and son september to november the climatological analysis is based on the djf and jja seasons winter or summer depending on the hemisphere despite some remarks in the text concerning mam and son the analysis is focused on the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc california canary humboldt benguela and west australia 3 waves climate along eastern boundary currents 3 1 global wind and wave climates the jja and djf seasonal maps for the climatological mean u 10 and φ global fields are shown in fig 1 as can be seen during boreal fig 1a and austral fig 1b summers coast parallel intense mean wind speeds occur off the mid latitude western continental coasts along the ebc systems these areas of interest where the present study will be focused are highlighted in red boxes in the respective hemisphere summer in fig 1a b these boxes are similar to the ones shown in ranjha et al 2013 and semedo et al 2015 where coastal jets were investigated an exception is the area along the canary ebc here a single area of study is assumed here instead of separating it into two areas iberia and northwest africa in jja fig 1a the highest climatological mean wind speeds in the north pacific sub basin occur along the california current these seasonal regional winds in jja are in fact stronger than the larger scale winds along the north pacific extratropical storm tracks and north pacific trades to some extend a similar situation takes place during jja in the north atlantic sub basin along the canary current although only off the coast of northwest africa are the wind speeds higher than along the mid latitude storm tracks and trade winds paths in djf fig 1b the close to surface wind speed fields in these two northern hemisphere areas are substantially different from jja during boreal winter the mean wind speed is now lower there and considerably lower than in the extratropical storm tracks and along the respective trade winds path in djf in the southern hemisphere high climatological mean wind speeds also occur along the humboldt benguela and west australia currents off the coasts of chile namibia angola and west australia respectively nevertheless in the southern hemisphere the strongest summer mean wind speeds still occur in the extratropical storm tracks in the southern ocean storm belt which displays a lower inter seasonal variability compared to the northern hemisphere during the austral winter in these areas the wind speed is also considerably different with a decrease in the local wind strength and an equatorward migration of the southern hemisphere storm belt from here onwards when the south pacific indian and atlantic oceans are mentioned it is assumed that the respective southern ocean sectors at higher latitudes are included unless otherwise mentioned the djf and jja global mean swh wave fields generated by the close to surface winds are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively the climatological mean hs h s s and h s w and the correspondent θ m θ m s and θ m w are shown separately allowing the propagating effect of swell and the local generation of wind sea waves to be seen and analyzed separately and in greater detail the seasonal large scale mean hs h s s and h s w from era 40 uppala et al 2005 were also presented by semedo et al 2008 2011 the era 40 reanalysis has been shown to under forecast high and extreme wave heights sterl and caires 2005 stopa et al 2013 although the comparison between era 40 and era interim swh is out of the scope of this study it is worth noticing that the climatological mean swh are as expected higher in era interim compared to the former this is most noticeable in the mean hs fields along the extratropical storm tracks in the respective hemisphere winter with differences in excess of 0 5 m as well as in the mean h s w fields also along the storm tracks in winter but also along the ebc systems and the trade winds paths in summer these differences between the two most recent ecmwf reanalyses are also present in the climatological mean u 10 fields shown in fig 1 besides the large scale features of the global mean hs fields figs 2a and 3a with higher seasonal mean maxima along the extratropical storm tracks during the respective hemisphere winter particularly in the southern ocean indian sector and larger lower inter seasonal variability in the north pacific and north atlantic southern ocean a careful attention should be taken to the mean jja and djf h s s and h s w fields the swell propagation features away from the wave generation areas in the mid and high latitudes towards the low latitudes are very clear figs 2b and 3b and are more noticeable than in the mean hs fields the swell propagation is clearer in the southern hemisphere winter jja particularly in the pacific ocean reaching far into the northern hemisphere but also in the indian ocean and to a less extend in the south atlantic sub basin the highest mean h s w values figs 2c and 3c are found during the respective hemisphere winter along the storm tracks in jja in the north pacific and north atlantic the highest mean h s w values coincide with the high mean u 10 values along the california and canary ebc areas in the north pacific and north atlantic respectively fig 1a in djf in the southern hemisphere the mean h s w values along the humboldt benguela and western australia ebc areas are not the highest in the respective sub basins since the climatological h s w maxima despite being summer lay along the intense extratropical storm tracks in the southern ocean as for the mean u 10 values fig 1b the lowest mean h s w values are found in the low latitudes regardless of the season also in mam and son not shown the general features of the mean h s w and u 10 are very similar which does not happen between h s s and u 10 reflecting the coupling between both fields this similarity is particularly noticeable along the five areas of study in the respective summer when u 10 increases as does the local h s w the alignment between θ m w and φ along the ebc areas coast parallel is also noticeable 3 2 regional wave climates a detailed analysis of the wave climate along the five ebc systems is presented in figs 4 8 the mean and extreme values of wind sea and swell parameters are shown allowing a comparison between the wave climates along the five areas of interest the summer jja or djf depending on the hemisphere climatological spatial distribution of the mean h s w 99 percentile as well as the ratios between h s s and h s w p w s and p w w where p w s and p w w are the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes respectively h s s and h s w 99 percentiles p w s and p w w 99 percentiles and the mean wind sea spectral energy weight at the surface ew et where ew and et are wind sea and total spectral density energies respectively are shown the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes or power in watts per linear wave crest meter w m 1 are defined as 2 p w s ρ g 2 64 π t m s h s s 2 3 p w w ρ g 2 64 π t m w h s 2 2 respectively where ρ is the sea water density and g is the gravitational acceleration the h s w 99 percentile h s 99 w fig 4a can reach values consistently higher than 2 m offshore california the maximum value is 2 4 m at the location marked as a white triangle on each area a key point is chosen using the h s 99 w maximum value see table 1 for geographic positions see also table 2 for the h s 99 w maximum values these extreme locally generated waves occurring about 1 of the time are steep waves with short wavelengths and periods not shown covering an area spanning from about 34 n to 44 n with an offshore extend of about 800 km these waves are the result of locally intensified extreme wind speeds also not shown that have grown rapidly in a limited fetch dimension coast parallel winds along the ebc systems in summer are primarily intensified by the ocean land temperature contrast at the coast but also due to the interaction of the flow with the coastal orography the warm subsiding air from the subtropical high pressure systems above and the cold marine air at the surface origin sharp temperature inversions that cap the mabl at the coast constraining the flow and the wind speed maxima at lower altitudes the temperature decrease of the marine layer along the coast due to the upwelling and low sst is further responsible for the sloping of the capping inversion towards the coast the increase of the wind speed nearshore in summer along the coastal areas above the five ebc systems is therefore the result of channelled flow with a temperature inversion above at 400 to 500 m ranjha et al 2013 soares et al 2014 rijo et al 2017 a sharp pressure gradient from the ocean to the coast and most of the times a mechanical constraint imposed by the coastal topography winant et al 1988 burk et al 1999 ranjha et al 2015b the low level coastal atmospheric flow along the ebc systems can also be intensified by the coastal topography and orientation burk and thompson 1996 tjernström and grisogono 2000 resulting in additional local enhancement of the wind speed through a process called expansion fan in the lee of capes and headlands winant et al 1988 this local enhancement of the wind speed is despite the coarse resolution captured by the era interim ranjha et al 2013 2015a with a direct impact on the wind sea waves field as seen in fig 4a where a bubble shaped area of intensified h s w occurs south of central california coastal headlands when compared to the mean swell heights in the same area fig 4b the mean summer h s w can be in the core of the intensified wind sea heights practically the same as h s s where h s s h s w 1 see table 2 which is a rare situation in the global ocean figs 2 and 3 and semedo et al 2011 when looking at the comparison between the summer extreme swell h s s 99 percentile h s 99 s and wind sea wave heights fig 4c it can be seen that extreme wind sea heights offshore the coast of central california are now higher than swell heights h s 99 s h s 99 w 0 8 this occurs given the proper conditions due to headland intensification of the local wind speed and then to the intensification of the locally generated waves that become higher than the remotely generated ones it must be understood nevertheless that this is the effect of several interconnected processes the synoptic pattern subtropical high and thermal low that aligns the along coast wind with the coastal headlands the low stt at the coast that sharpens the coastal wind speed and the low swell wave heights which in the summer can originate in the northern and southern hemisphere the wave energy flux or the ability of waves to actually perform work is a function of the wave heights to the second order but also of the wave periods to the first order hence for equal wave heights longer waves carry more energy per wave crest unit length eqs 2 and 3 the ratio between the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes fig 4d shows that despite the long swells reaching the area the locally generated wave energy flux is on average comparable i e p w s p w w 1 5 1 03 at the peak see table 2 it is worth mentioning the combination of the sheltering effect of the southern california bight and the intake of long swells from the south most probably from the southern hemisphere rising p w s p w w to values close to 20 or more the situation slightly changes when the summer swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes extreme values are compared fig 4e through the ratio between the swell and wind sea 99 percentiles p w 99 s and p w 99 w respectively now extreme wind sea wave heights although short in length can carry more energy than swell waves under extreme situations p w 99 s p w 99 w 1 during about 1 every summer ca 1 day per summer extreme locally generated waves consistently higher than 2 m height short but highly energized can occur offshore central california having a high destructive capability and posing a serious threat to the local navigation and ocean related seasonal tourism still having in mind wave energy and how it is distributed by wind sea and swell waves along the california ebc the mean wind sea spectral zeroth moment m o w and the total mean spectral moment m 0 were computed with the goal of assessing the summer mean wind sea energy density ew weight the zeroth wave spectral moment is defined as 4 m 0 f 0 f f θ d f d θ and m o w was computed by integrating the spectra from the separation frequency f to the highest frequency in the wave model frequency range and from 0 to 360 in direction the wave density spectral energy content or energy spectral weight as called by semedo et al 2011 of the wind sea was computed as the ratio e w e t m 0 w m 0 where et is the total wave energy density it should be noted that e w e t 1 e s e t m 0 s m 0 where es is the swell energy density and m 0 s is the swell spectral zeroth moment computed by integrating the spectra from lowest frequency in the frequency range and separation frequency f and from 0 to 360 in direction the summer mean wind sea spectral weight offshore california fig 4f shows that the wind sea part of the spectra is on average less that the swell one the jja mean ew et maximum value is close to 0 5 but less than that in most of the area meaning that at its maximum wind sea accounts for about half of the wave energy in the mean wave spectra nevertheless these values are within a range of 0 3 0 5 making the locally generated wave energy slightly lower and comparable to the one generated remotely which is an uncommon feature along the world oceans as shown by hanley et al 2010 and semedo et al 2011 in fig 5 the same statistics shown for the coast of california oregon are presented for the canary ebc in jja covering an area along iberia morocco and western sahara the h s 99 w along the canary current fig 5a shows different values from offshore west iberia to northwest africa with a clear separation between these two areas defined by the gulf of cadiz where locally generated waves decrease the extreme wind sea wave heights are lower along iberia 1 1 2 m compared the ones west of morocco and western sahara 1 4 1 6 m reaching a maximum of 1 7 m see table 2 and lower overall than along the california ebc mean fig 1a and extreme wind speeds not shown are higher offshore california compared to iberia and northwest africa ranjha et al 2013 and for that reason mean and extreme wind sea wave heights are also higher there the wind speed is intensified in the lee of several capes mostly along the coast morocco and western sahara with a direct impact on the locally generated waves when summer wind sea and swell wave heights are compared fig 5b h s s h s w only offshore western sahara h s w becomes comparable to h s s despite h s s h s w being always higher than 1 with a minimum value of 1 09 see table 2 with values similar to the offshore california ones this happens due to the local intensification of the wind speed driven by the interaction of the flow with the coastal orography this wind speed intensification has a direct impact on the raise of the locally generated wave heights that become in jja comparable to the remotely generated ones the local comparison between the jja swell and wind sea extreme wave heights fig 5c h s 99 s h s 99 w along canary current shows that particularly in the lee of major capes in morocco and western sahara extreme wind seas are higher than the swells although lower comparably than in california along western iberia h s 99 s h s 99 w 1 since not only extreme wind sea waves are lower there than in africa but also swell wave heights are higher the unique characteristic of the wind and wave fields long the canary ebc compared with the remaining four ebc should be noted not only the canary current is disrupted by the influx of mediterranean denser water into the north atlantic basin sinking as if flows through the gibraltar straight but also interacting with the equatorward surface flow pastor et al 2015 but also the coast line is also different from other continental mid latitude western coasts the gulf of cadiz disrupts the coast south of portugal and the flow encounters open waters situations finding coastal environment some hundreds of kilometers south in northwest africa therefore two separated centers of action exist along the canary current along western iberia and along the northwest african coast this fact was also mentioned by ranjha et al 2013 which separated the canary coastal jet in two the iberian coastal jet and the north africa coastal jet from the comparison between the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes in jja fig 5d it can be seen that despite the local intensification of the wind speed as in california swell waves along the canary ebc still carry on average more energy than the former with values of the ratio p w s p w w 1 5 1 41 at its minimum see table 2 the higher mean values of p w s p w w representing less wind sea energy flux take place are along west iberia when summer extreme values of swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes are compared fig 5e p s 99 w values are closer to p s 99 s particularly along the coasts of morocco and western sahara but still remotely generated waves carry more energy than the local ones which is not the case along the california ebc where in extreme events p s 99 s p s 99 w 1 nevertheless in extreme situations mostly along the northwest coast of africa severe wind speed events can lead to extreme locally generated wave heights carrying considerable amounts of energy the wind sea wave energy density weight fig 5f is about the same as in california close to 0 4 at its peak along the western sahara coast the sheltering effect of the canary islands limits to a certain extent swell energy density content there while the local intensification of the wind speed due to the interaction of the flow with the coastal headlands increases the relative content of the wind sea energy density role analogous statistics were also computed for the southern hemisphere ebc areas for the austral summer one of the characteristics of the winds along the southern hemisphere ebc particularly along the humboldt and benguela currents is their lower seasonality compared to the northern hemisphere ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 hence besides djf relevant wind sea waves are expected to be generated there in mom and son not shown but also during the austral winter figs 1b and 2 the summer wave field statistics along the humboldt ebc are shown in fig 6 the mean extreme wind sea wave heights fig 6a h s 99 w there are at its peak of the order of 1 8 1 9 m see table 2 lower than offshore california but comparable to the canary ebc area the local intensification of the wind speed due to the interaction of the flow with coastal topography has also been previously documented muñoz and garreud 2005 garreud and muñoz 2005 and has a direct impact on the wind sea wave heights locally the comparison between the mean djf wind sea and swell wave heights fig 6b h s s h s w reveals that contrary to what happens along the northern hemisphere ebc areas offshore chile the wind sea wave heights are lower that the swell ones therefore h s s h s w is always clearly higher than 1 1 76 at its peak see table 2 the southern ocean wind speed and wave height seasonality is lower than in the northern hemisphere figs 1 3 for that reason despite the clear local generation of wind sea waves in summer along the humboldt ebc waves keep being generated along the southern ocean storm belt in the pacific and indian sectors propagating northward as swells and reaching the coast of chile so in that area the mean wind sea wave heights are clearly lower that the swell ones making wave climate offshore chile different from the equivalent areas in the northern hemisphere the situation changes slightly when extreme wind sea and swell wave heights are compared fig 6c h s 99 s h s 99 w now the local extreme waves are more comparable to the swell extreme wave heights but still h s 99 s h s 99 w 1 1 36 at its peak see table 2 is the overall situation which is still different from what occurs in the northern hemisphere once again due to the strong swell intake the southern ocean swell effect along the humboldt ebc in djf is even more pronounced when the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes are compared p w s p w w fig 6d longer and still relatively high swell therefore carrying a great amount of energy reach the area the wind sea wave energy flux when compared to the swell power is clearly lower and p w s p w w 4 this ratio is different from the northern hemisphere where the locally generated wave energy flux is comparable to the swell one the total wave energy flux offshore chile not shown is also higher than along the california and canary currents the extreme wind sea and swell energy fluxes are more comparable fig 6e than their respective means although remotely generated waves still dominate energy wise compared to the locally generated ones the ratio of the swell and wind sea wave energy fluxes 99 percentiles p s 99 s p s 99 w fig 6e shows that swell waves power is still 3 3 5 times higher than wind sea waves with a minimum value of 3 01 see table 2 a similar pattern occurs when looking at the djf wind sea energy spectral weight ew et fig 6f which is lower compared to similar patterns along california and iberia and northwest africa the wind sea energy spectral weight in this region is at its peak of the order of 30 and less than that in most of the area offshore chile swell waves generated far in the pacific extratropical storm tracks thus have a higher role along the humboldt ebc in terms of energy compared to the locally generated waves and in comparison to the northern hemisphere as in the humboldt current benguela has two characteristics differentiating it from the northern hemisphere ebc on the one hand the coastal winds offshore namibia and south angola have a lower seasonality ranjha et al 2013 patricola et al 2016 lima et al 2018 with a considerable occurrence of coastal low level jets almost all year round lima et al 2018 on the other hand the south atlantic as in the indian and pacific oceans is still very active storm wise in summer with considerable wave generation activity figs 1 3 nevertheless the south atlantic has some unique characteristics that make it different from the south pacific the narrow drake passage prevents most of the south indian and pacific oceans swell to penetrate the south atlantic which is not the case of the pacific ocean that receives swell waves from the south indian ocean young 1999 alves et al 2003 semedo et al 2011 and the south atlantic storm activity and strength and wind speed are less intense than their indian and pacific ocean counterparts fig 1 fig 7 depicts the benguela ebc wave climate statistics the extreme wind sea wave heights h s 99 w shown in fig 7a are similar to the humboldt ebc 1 7 1 8 m on the other hand since the intake of south atlantic swell into the area is lower the djf mean wind sea and swell wave heights ratio fig 7b h s s h s w is slightly lower 1 4 minimum value see table 2 than offshore chile revealing a higher contribution of locally generated waves as in the remaining ebc the local intensification of the wind speed along the benguela current due to the interaction with costal morphology nicholson 2010 patricola et al 2016 contributes to the increased role of the locally generated waves seen also in the comparison between extreme wind sea and swell waves fig 7c h s 99 s h s 99 w with values close to 1 lower than offshore chile 1 4 see table 2 this effect is not enough to raise the wind sea wave energy flux to the same level of the swell power in the area nevertheless swell and wind sea energy fluxes are more comparable fig 7d along the benguela ebc than offshore chile with p w s p w w 3 2 47 minimum see table 2 which is lower than along the humboldt ebc and closer to the california and canary currents the results of the comparison between the extreme swell and wind sea wave fluxes fig 7e p s 99 s p s 99 w are very similar the mean values comparison with extreme swells transporting around at least twice more energy 2 47 at the peak see table 2 than extreme locally generated waves the djf wind sea wind sea energy spectral percentage fig 7f ew et is very similar to the one in chile 30 35 and lower than the ebc currents in the northern hemisphere the indian ocean wave climate has also some distinctive characteristics compared to the pacific and the atlantic oceans its north span ends in the arabian sea at around 20 n and it has only one main wave generation area in the south extratropical storm tracks on the other hand the highest mean wave heights in the global ocean occur in the southern indian ocean while the most extreme wave heights occur in the north atlantic sub basin not shown in jja the mean hs along the southern ocean storm belt indian sector reaches mean values of the order of 6 m fig 2a and in djf these values are still high with mean hs higher than 4 m fig 2b these waves propagate eastward as swell all year round but also northward literally propagating wave energy across the entire indian ocean basin figs 2b and 3b these swells also reach the west australia coast where local waves are generated due to the summer wind speed increase as in the remaining ebc areas the djf statistics of the balance between wind sea and swell waves offshore west australia the last of the five ebc depicted here are shown in fig 8 the extreme locally generated summer waves along west australia fig 8a h s 99 w are almost as high the california ebc ones 2 0 m maximum see table 2 opposite to what happens along the other two southern hemisphere ebc winds offshore west australia have a well defined seasonality being virtually absent in winter and are also slightly stronger than along the coasts of chile and namibia angola for these reasons despite the high mean swell waves that propagate from the higher latitudes into the area mean locally generated wave heights are still comparable to those with h s s h s w values of the order of 1 5 fig 8b similar to humboldt and higher than in benguela when considering extreme local waves offshore west australia they are now more comparable to extreme swells fig 8c h s 99 s h s 99 w extreme wind speeds contribute to these high locally generated waves reaching heights close to swell waves where h s 99 s h s 99 w shows values closer to 1 1 24 at its peak see table 2 lower than along humboldt ebc and similar to offshore namibia angola long swell waves generated southward are still more energized carrying on the mean more energy than local waves fig 8d since p w s p w w 3 or higher when extreme waves are considered fig 8e p s 99 s p s 99 w these values are lower 2 3 at its peak see table 2 the west australia wind sea wind sea energy spectral percentage fig 8f ew et is of the order of 25 30 which is comparable to the humbolt and benguela ebc areas but lower than along the california and canary ebc currents summer and winter scatter diagrams of hs and u 10 are shown in fig 9 for the five ebc the scatter plots are built for the respective djf and jja season from specific key points marked as white triangle on panels a in figs 4 8 and the 8 grid points around them the key points were chosen considering the peak values of h s 99 w at each area during the correspondent summer and are seen as representative extreme summer wind sea positions of the respective areas the pierson moskowitz fully developed seas empirical relation between u 10 and hs is also shown in each scatter plot this empirical relation found by pierson and moskowitz 1964 and further corrected by alves et al 2003 defined as 5 h s 0 025 u 10 2 is shown as a red line in the scatter plots the fully developed relation line can be seen as a separation between the wind sea and swell sea states the u 10 and hs pairs under the line represent developing seas where wind sea dominates and the ones above are considered swell dominated seas with wave ages lower and higher than 1 2 respectively according to the wave growth theory u 10 and hs follow a monotonic relation at the growing sea state koeman et al 1994 until a fully developed spectrum corresponding to a saturated level is achieved the equilibrium saturated state represented by eq 5 is an asymptotic state where the wave spectrum is fully developed and from then on only its shape and peak frequency are changing slowly in time the wave age parameter is defined as cp u 10 where cp is the peak wave phase speed from eq 5 and from the pierson and moskowitz spectral theory pierson and moskowitz 1964 it can be demonstrated that the fully developed sea state corresponds to a wave age of 1 2 where cp 1 2u 10 holthuijse 2008 alves et al 2003 semedo 2010 semedo et al 2012 högström et al 2011 the higher levels of scattering at the five areas in the respective winters fig 9a c for california and canary and fig 9f h j for humboldt benguela and west australia and the highest density of points clearly above the respective fully developed seas lines emphasizes the dominant presence of swell or remotely generated waves interestingly despite the distance between the areas of interest the shape of the scatter plots is rather similar indicating the same type of winter sea state regimes the california ebc has a higher dispersion of the hs u 10 pairs and a different scatter plot shape fig 9a due to the presence of northern and southern hemisphere swells the open shape of the pacific ocean and to the strong wave generation activity in the southern ocean even during the austral summer allows the arrival of swells from both hemispheres in djf to the coast of california during jja in the california and canary ebc areas the situation changes significantly the dispersion is much lower with more points concentrated in the vicinity and below the fully developed line revealing a wind sea dominated sea states the situation in the northern hemisphere during the boreal summer is different from the southern hemisphere since the extratropical storm activity is low and the high wind speed events do occur but along the two ebc giving rise to strong wind sea dominated sea states offshore california and mostly morocco and west sahara nevertheless some swell waves generated in the southern hemisphere propagate into california in jja hence in this area the number of points above the fully developed seas line is higher as is the dispersion during djf along the humboldt benguela and west australia ebc the scattering is lower than in jja with a higher number of points on the wind sea dominated side the dispersion of the hs u 10 pairs in these three areas although lower than in winter is higher than in the two northern hemisphere areas this occurs due to the low seasonality of the wave climate in the southern hemisphere with waves being generated in the extratropical latitudes even in summer which propagate into the coasts of chile namibia angola and west australia 3 3 intra annual variability fig 10 displays the intra annual variability monthly means of the close to surface wind speed u 10 significant wave heights hs h s s and h s w and mean wave periods tm t m s and t m w at 9 grid points at the 5 key points in each ebc area plus the 8 grid points around them the intra annual variability of u 10 in the five key points shows a gradual increase of the local wind speed during the hemisphere summer this increase is more defined in the california and canary currents and in the west australia current along these areas a clear peak in july for the northern hemisphere areas and january for west australia can be seen corresponding to the highest summer mean wind speed this summer increase is lower and more gradual offshore chile and namibia with a less defined mean wind speed increase and highest wind speeds occurring during 4 months from november to february in the humboldt ebc and virtually for 6 months in the benguela ebc from october to march not surprisingly the h s w and t m w intra annual variabilities at the five areas of interest show a very high correlation with the close to surface wind speed inter annual variability 0 95 in the california and canary areas the mean hs decreases during summer as does h s s nevertheless the decrease in hs is lower than the swell heights due to the effect of the locally generated waves that are higher during summer balancing the decrease of h s s in the canary ebc during july the mean hs actually increases due to the increase of the mean july h s w since the h s s also decreases during that month in july the mean values of h s w offshore california and the atlantic coast of morocco is almost the same as h s s a similar behaviour and relation can be found in the west australia ebc with the peak of h s w taking place in january nevertheless in this area the mean h s w is always lower than h s s despite the fact that locally generated waves do drive the slight increase tendency of the mean hs during the austral summer opposite to the h s s behaviour the intra annual variability of the wave heights offshore chile and namibia is different from the remaining three areas in these two regions the mean h s s variation throughout the year is very low despite the increase of the locally generated wave heights during part of the year cantered in the austral summer months it has a low effect on the annual cycle of hs which ends up being more controlled by the all year round impinging swells 4 discussion as shown in the previous section the effect of the summer intensified wind speeds on the local wave field along the five ebc is notorious along these five areas the ratio between the swell and wind sea wave heights h s s h s w decreases in summer due to the rise of the locally generated wave heights this increase is also reflected in the higher energy content of the local waves during summer as well as in extreme locally generated wave heights summary in table 2 the effect of the summer local winds in the local wave field is similar between the five regions nevertheless some differences prevail due to the intake of swell waves but also due to the different wind speed seasonal variabilities as shown in fig 10 a clear indicator of these differences can be seen on fig 9 from the dispersion along the fully developed seas line during summer the dispersion of the hs u 10 pairs is lower in summer compared to the respective winter lower in the california and canary ebc compared to the remaining southern hemisphere ebc this dispersion has been assessed by computing the percentage of hs u 10 pairs above and below the fully generated seas line but also by computing the mean distance to this line for the points above and below the line where positive values represent the former and negative values the later additionally the standard distance sd of the hs u 10 scatter distribution has been computed the standard distance measures the compactness of a distribution providing a single value a distance representing the dispersion around the centre computed as 6 s d i 1 n h s i h s 2 n i 1 n u 10 i u 10 2 n where n is the number of events in this case 460 188 9 points times 12 783 days in the 1979 2013 period time 4 outputs per day and h s and u 10 are the mean values of the swh and wind speed at 10 m these statistical parameters have been computed for jja and djf for nine grid points centred at each area respective key point see white triangle on panels a in figs 4 8 and geographic positions in table 1 and can be seen on table 3 the california ebc mostly on the norwest african sector area stands out as the area where in summer locally generated waves are highest more extreme and carry more energy fig 4 and table 2 nevertheless the summer wave field along the canary ebc shows that wind sea dominated wave fields are more prevalent compared to off shore california and to the remaining southern hemisphere ebc areas in jja wind sea dominated wave events occur 48 4 of the times table 3a when the hs u 10 are under the fully developed curve fig 9d in the canary ebc this is in fact higher than in california 43 5 in jja and humboldt benguela and west australia 20 3 27 9 and 24 1 respectively in djf the southern hemisphere summer also along the canary ebc the summer wave field is less scattered i e more compact along the fully developed sea state and its mean centre value since the mean distance of the swell and wind sea events to this curve are 0 53 and 0 31 table 3b are lower than in any other area as is the standard distance 1 90 table 3c on the other hand in djf wind sea events along the canary ebc off shore northwest africa are low occurring only 8 1 of the times table 3a which is lower than in california west australia is the ebc area with lowest wind sea dominated winter events only 4 1 in jja table 3a this occurs because there is virtually no local wind in winter along west australia fig 1 and ranjha et al 2013 although strikingly similar as mentioned before the characteristics of the southern hemisphere regional wave fields along the three ebc have some differences compared to the california and canary ebc areas summer djf wind sea swell dominated events are lower higher than in the northern hemisphere this occurs mostly due to the lower seasonality of the wind along the southern ocean storm belt in the pacific atlantic and indian sectors generating waves that propagate as swell even in summer that reach the southern hemisphere ebc areas for example the mean wind speed along west australia is relatively high in djf higher than along the humboldt and benguela and comparable to the california in jja figs 1 and 10 nevertheless the swell intake in the indian ocean is so high that prevents wind sea events to prevail in that area to a certain extent the same occurs off shore chile and namibia angola a summary of the mean hs h s s and h s w values in the same nine grid points mentioned above centered each area respective key point for jja and djf as well as for the respective summer months june to august and december to february are shown in table 4 the mean hs during austral summer along the three southern hemisphere ebc is higher than in california and canary ebc areas in jja that occurs due to the intake of swell in the southern hemisphere since in those three areas in djf the mean h s s is considerably higher than the mean h s w there the summer difference between h s s and h s w along california and canary ebc is smaller when looking at the mean monthly values as in fig 10 clear peak monthly mean h s w values can be identified june for california and july for canary in the northern hemisphere areas which is not the case in the southern hemisphere areas where the mean h s w is almost the same throughout the austral summer the summer mean h s w offshore chile and namibia angola is lower than in california but higher than along the california ebc the summer mean hs along the west australia is the highest of the five ebc areas with the highest summer mean h s s and the same mean h s w as in california 5 concluding remarks a qualitative analysis of the wave climate over the mid latitudes western coastal areas along the five ebc systems has been presented based on the era interim reanalysis wave data the analysis used the swell wind sea partition from the wave model wam and the swell and wind sea parameters available in era interim data set as in e g hanley et al 2010 and semedo et al 2008 2011 2014 despite the relatively coarse resolution of era interim 0 7 in the atmospheric parameters and 1 in the wave parameters it can be seen as an adequate data set even in these coastal areas ranjha et al 2013 and lima et al 2018 allowing a coherent relative comparison between the five areas of interest the strong seasonality of the coastal winds along the five ebc ranjha et al 2013 lima et al 2018 and fig 1 has been shown to have a direct influence on the locally generated waves triggering a peculiar regional wave climate strongly dominated by swell in the winter when the local mean local wind speed is low and high wind sea waves in summer when the along coast wind speed increases and is responsible for the locally generated waves the locally generated waves along the ebc in extreme wind speed situations become high of the order of 2 2 5 m table 2 and panels a on figs 4 8 which can be seen as considerably high if we look at the areas downwind of capes and coastal headlands as limited fetch areas since these local waves are young waves they are also relatively short lengthened and hence rather steep not shown posing serious threats to coastal community seafarers such as fishing vessels or summer tourism boating activity it should be noted that the five main ocean upwelling systems lay exactly along the mid latitude western coasts due to the strong summer wind speed these cold upwelled nutrient reach waters are responsible for the rich fishing resources mainly in summer when coastal fishing activity is stronger vallis 2000 leitão et al 2014 the direct effect of the summer intensified wind speeds on the local wave field in the western mid latitudes coastal areas along the five ebc has been studied a qualitative study of the wave fields in these areas has been presented by comparing swell remote and wind sea local waves quantifying their relative weight not only in terms of their swh but also on their mean and extreme energy content the h s w role compared to h s s in summer is highest than in any of the remaining four ebc areas offshore california extreme wind sea wave heights are highest 2 4 m have almost the same mean height and mean wave energy flux as swell and have the highest spectral weight of the five ebc areas see table 2 despite the distance between them the wave climates along these five ebc areas are strikingly similar for example the california ebc area wave field is rather similar to the australia ebc one figs 2 and 3 and tables 2 4 where for example the summer mean h s w is the same and the swell wind sea weight h s s h s w is only lower in australia because of the higher mean swell wave heights there the reason for the similarities between the five areas lays in the fact that the atmospheric synoptic and regional scales responsible for the winds and waves basin wide and regionally share similar mechanisms although similar the characteristics of the southern hemisphere regional wave fields along the three ebc have some differences compared to the california and canary ebc areas these differences being due mostly to the lower seasonality of the southern ocean storm belt generating waves that propagate equatorward as swell even during the austral summer and defining regional and ocean basin scale wave climates a study of how waves impact the regional climates of the mid latitude continental coastal areas and consequent impact in land remains to be studied it can be assumed that during summer when wind sea waves are more prevalent and the wave field is more prone to wave breaking and white capping the wave induce turbulence further induced the mixing of the ocean surface layer this mixing should therefore decrease the sst in the wind sea dominated areas where the wind speed is highest and contribute to the local thermal pressure gradient and ultimately to an increase of the wind speed the study of the impact of enhanced wind speed and cllj in the lee of capes and headlands on the atmosphere has been studied nuss et al 2000 patricola and chang 2016 the direct impact of these enhanced wind speeds due to expansion fan processes in the local upwelling and sst and on how locally generated waves interact with the upwelled cold waters remains to be studied also the interaction of the locally generated waves and the local wave driven currents stronger in summer as shown by carrasco et al 2014 and the larger scale ebc is a subject that should be addressed in future research climate change impact on the wind fields along the ebc systems has been the subject or recent research miranda et al 2013 semedo et al 2016 cardoso et al 2016 soares et al 2016 2017 it has been shown that

24094,we assess the impact of the southern annular mode sam on global ocean wind waves using 30 years of wave data from a wave model hindcast that is forced with high resolution surface winds from the ncep cfsr reanalysis our primary focus is on the wave field and swell influence in the southern hemisphere and we apply our analysis to each of the four temperate zone seasons comprising march may mam june august jja september november son and december february djf statistically significant anomalies in significant wave height hs peak wave period tp and zonal wave energy flux cge are found to covary with local variations in surface zonal wind induced by the low and high polarity phases of the sam the signature of the sam in ocean surface waves extends beyond local wind generated forcing in the southern hemisphere extratropics to remote forcing in the northern hemisphere extratropics during djf with the associated atmospheric signal resembling a tropically forced rossby wave train this has a significant impact on surface waves in the central north pacific and north atlantic oceans the el niño southern oscillation enso acts to weaken the link between the sam and northern hemisphere winter climate with the zonal wind divergence anomalies amplifying over the tropical pacific ocean when we exclude el niño and la niña years from the analysis this remote link to the sam thus occurs independent of enso via sam driven changes to the tropical atmospheric circulation suggesting that the sam may provide a useful predictive signal for the northern hemisphere during djf the sam also influences the occurrence of daily low below the 5th percentile and high above the 95th percentile wave conditions emphasizing that the sam may be a valuable source of predictable wave variability from sub weekly to seasonal timescales future work should explore wave data suitable for trend analysis considering the positive trend in the sam over recent decades 1 introduction the southern annular mode sam e g trenberth 1979 rogers and van loon 1982 mo and white 1985 or antarctic oscillation thompson and wallace 1998 plays a dominant role in the high and mid latitude climate of the southern hemisphere as an intrinsic mode of atmospheric variability the sam arises through a positive feedback between zonal mean wind anomalies and eddy momentum fluxes and has a characteristic time scale of about two weeks lorenz and hartmann 2001 fluctuations in the sam result from anomalous baroclinic wave activity in the extratropical storm track in association with fluctuations of the westerly jet stream in its high polarity phase a poleward shifted jet stream is associated with enhanced baroclinic wave activity that propagates upward and equatorward thus providing momentum fluxes that reinforce the zonal wind anomalies against surface drag and causing the wind anomalies to drift poleward with a largely zonally symmetric equivalent barotropic structure e g gong and wang 1999 thompson and wallace 2000 subsequently the mid latitude westerly wind belt shifts poleward characterizing the high index polarity or positive phase of the sam conversely an equatorward shift in the mid latitude westerly winds and reduction of baroclinic wave activity in the storm track characterizes the negative sam phase e g fyfe 2003 the sam influences variations in southern hemisphere weather and climate and drives variations in the circulation in the southern ocean over a wide range of timescales from daily to seasonal specifically impacts of the sam on weekly and monthly rainfall variability and extremes have been reported over australia e g hendon et al 2007 risbey et al 2009 marshall et al 2012 marshall et al 2014 new zealand renwick and thompson 2006 south america silvestri and vera 2003 south africa reason and rouault 2005 and in the northern hemisphere zheng et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the sam has been linked to antarctic temperature variations e g thompson and solomon 2002 and sea ice distribution e g lefebvre et al 2004 hall and visbeck 2002 southern ocean surface temperature e g watterson 2000 2001 and biology e g lovenduski and gruber 2005 via its wind driven impact on surface heat fluxes and ekman drift the importance of understanding these relationships to the sam is underscored by the recent shift in the sam towards a more positive phase which is shown to contribute to observed long term trends over the southern hemisphere e g thompson and wallace 2000 kushner et al 2001 haylock et al 2006 the purpose of this paper is to extend studies of the impact of ocean and explore its impact on global ocean wind waves the relationships between global ocean surface waves and large scale atmospheric climate variability have previously been investigated e g kushnir et al 1997 wang and swail 2001 dodet et al 2010 hemer et al 2010 izaguirre et al 2011 bosserelle et al 2011 semedo et al 2011 fan et al 2012 stopa et al 2013 including the impact of the madden julian oscillation marshall et al 2015 hemer et al 2010 identified that the principal mode of inter annual variability of the southern hemisphere wave variability was significantly related to the sam focusing on the local wind generated forcing in the southern hemisphere extra tropics and the consequent implications for swell waves that propagated equatorward in the major oceans basins despite this relationship detailed analysis of this relationship has not been undertaken the sam is a probable candidate for driving significant surface wave variations due to its large spatial scale hemispheric and temporal scale up to a season further with increasing evidence to suggest an influence of the sam on the northern hemisphere climate e g nan and li 2003 wu et al 2009 sun 2010 sun et al 2010 the relationship between the sam and northern hemisphere surface wind wave fields should be considered for example liu et al 2015 proposes an ocean atmosphere coupled bridge as a key process by which the sam signal in september november son can transmit to the northern hemisphere in december february djf in this mechanism near surface heat in the southern ocean is redistributed by sam driven changes in surface zonal wind the sst signal can then persist into djf via the memory of sst and upon its release into the atmosphere modify the upward branch of the hadley cell the meridional circulation of the northern hemisphere is thus affected and an anomalous djf climate signal emerges at the surface an important aspect of this inter hemispheric teleconnection to the sam is its independence from enso liu et al 2015 other recent work has also reported an enso independent relationship between the sam and atmospheric variability in the tropics during djf ding et al 2014 documenting and understanding the modulation of global ocean surface waves by the sam can help underpin development of subseasonal predictive capability of ocean surface waves with practical benefits that include anticipating wave induced coastal inundation this understanding will also be of benefit to the long term management of coasts projected 21st century changes to the sam are sensitive to the rate of ozone recovery and to greenhouse gas emission scenarios under a low rcp2 6 emission scenario ozone recovery are expected to dominate giving a small equatorward jet shift greenhouse gas emissions are expected to dominate under a high rcp8 5 emission scenario giving an ongoing poleward jet shift christensen et al 2013 climate driven variability of the surface wave field is being increasingly recognized as a significant influence on shoreline position stability particularly in the context of projected future sea level rise hemer et al 2013 barnard et al 2015 whether a low or high ghg emission scenario plays out changes to the sam will likely shift the equilibrium wave field for parts of the global ocean with potential consequent implications for coastal sediment budgets and shoreline stability we assess the impact of the sam on surface waves using the global output from a high resolution hindcast of a surface wave model forced by surface winds from a 31 year reanalysis a description of the global ocean wave hindcast and its suitability for our study along with the compositing approach to extract the sam signals are provided in section 2 the impacts of the sam on surface waves are presented in section 3 and a summary and conclusions are provided in section 4 including implications for sub weekly to seasonal prediction of global surface wave variations 2 surface wave hindcast and sam compositing 2 1 surface wave hindcast the centre for australian weather and climate research cawcr wave hindcast dataset durrant et al 2014 is a high resolution global product created using the wavewatch iii model version 4 08 tolman 1991 2014 with 10 m winds and sea ice concentration prescribed from the recent climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 for the period 1979 2010 available hourly and at 0 3 0 3 horizontal resolution the cfsr data provides an unprecedented depiction of global surface winds with sufficient representation of small scale high amplitude variability in lieu of continuous global records of ocean surface waves the cawcr wave hindcast provides global wave data at a spatial resolution of 0 4 and at an hourly temporal resolution good agreement is found globally for bias and root mean square error relative to available satellite altimeter and buoy observations detailed assessments of the quality of this wave hindcast is presented for the australian region in hemer et al 2017 and globally with focus on southern pacific island region in durrant et al 2013 a description of its improvements over previously used products is also summarized in marshall et al 2015 here we utilize significant wave height hs peak period tp and wave energy flux cge from the large number of gridded variables available these three represent the most commonly observed wave variable hs the length of the waves and thus indication of the source of waves tp where locally generated wind sea will have short wave periods and distally generated swell will have longer wave periods and the power of the waves cge providing an indication of the potential force of the waves on coastal or offshore infrastructure cge depends on hs and the period t thus c g e ρ g 2 h s 2 t 64 π where ρ is the water density and g is the gravitational acceleration we are interested in assessing impacts of the sam on both the magnitude and direction of surface wave energy so we express the cge scalar field as a vector quantity to resolve the directional response by using peak wave direction dp for deriving zonal and meridional components of cge where dp is decomposed into vector components and the cge scalar quantity comprises the magnitude of the total vector for all surface wave fields assessed in this study we calculate anomalies relative to the annual climatology we note that temporally varying sea ice concentration leads to a temporally varying mask around the ice edge in the cawcr hindcast to ease calculations the grid points that are periodically masked have been removed from our analysis for each season consequently we do not consider the sam s influence on wave fields in regions where the sam has an impact on sea ice extent e g lefebvre et al 2004 hall and visbeck 2002 and vice versa e g raphael et al 2011 as such this affects only a small area and does not impede our detection of the sam s impact otherwise there exist biases in the hindcast that can be attributed to errors in the forcing wind field durrant et al 2013 for instance a known inhomogeneity in cfsr winds chawla et al 2013 results in an over prediction of wave heights in mid latitudes in the early part of the hindcast a common problem shared by global wave hindcast datasets this leads to spurious trends in the wave data durrant et al 2014 however while biases in the wind can directly impact the wave field output in some cases in other situations wind biases can have compensating effects on errors in the wave model durrant et al 2013 the focus of this previous work is on time averaged biases and so the limitations discussed in these studies do not necessarily hinder our composite analysis of climate variability on the subseasonal timescale for example we find that trend removal has little impact on our results not shown rather the spurious trends in the wave data documented by durrant et al 2014 will impact long term climate studies using this data we therefore refrain from performing trend analysis on this dataset 2 2 sam compositing we diagnose impacts of the sam on global ocean surface waves by constructing an index of the sam that captures the variability of mean sea level pressure mslp around the mid latitudes of the southern hemisphere e g gong and wang 1999 marshall 2003 marshall et al 2012 using cfsr data i e from the same reanalysis dataset prescribed for the cawcr wave hindcast daily sam indices are obtained by projecting daily zonal mean mslp anomalies onto the leading empirical orthogonal function eof of observed monthly mean mslp anomalies between 25 s and 75 s after removing the seasonal cycle from the data and weighting each grid point by the square root of the cosine of latitude e g marshall et al 2012 the daily sam index is then normalized by the standard deviation of the monthly sam index the eof analysis is conducted on the base period 1979 to 2009 and each eof is based on the covariance matrix the high index polarity positive phase of the sam occurs when the pressure anomaly is low on the pole and the midlatitude westerly jet is shifted poleward conversely the low index polarity negative phase of the sam occurs when the pressure anomaly is high on the pole and the midlatitude westerly jet is shifted equatorward positive and negative sam phases are defined to occur when index values exceed one standard deviation σ about the mean i e 1σ and 1σ respectively to first order the positive and negative phases exhibit approximate symmetry in their broad scale atmospheric characteristics including their opposite signed but otherwise similar impacts on australian climate anomalies hendon et al 2007 and extremes marshall et al 2014 the seasonal meridional shift in the mean position of the subtropical ridge between djf and jja june august due to the progression of the australian monsoon trough and poleward contraction of the extratropical westerly jet influences the spatial characteristics of the sam at mid latitudes so we perform our assessment using subsets of daily mean data for each temperate zone season mam march may jja son and djf 3 results 3 1 ocean wave response we show the climatological mean fields for surface zonal wind and hs fig 1 and for tp and cge fig 2 calculated for each season to provide context for understanding the sam induced wave anomalies each variable is derived directly from wavewatch iii output files following definitions provided in tolman 2014 with tp determined as the inverse of the wave peak frequency f p key features of the mean surface zonal wind in the southern hemisphere are dominant westerlies at mid high latitudes poleward of about 25 s in jja and 30 s in djf where the sam has a strong signal not shown poleward of 60 s due to the ice mask in the hindcast data mean trade easterlies prevail in the subtropics year round except over the maritime continent in djf and the northwest australian shelf in son and djf where the mean winds in these seasons are westerly in the mean surface wave fields hs maximizes in the higher latitudes where surface westerly winds are strongest tp tends to increase to the east which indicates swell propagation from the west and cge shows wave energy propagating from the extratropics to the tropics the following analyses present composites of pertinent fields of interest stratified according to season and sam phase the number of days n for each season pertaining to positive and negative sam phases is shown in table 1 to calculate statistical significance of composite anomalies we use a standard t test student 1908 but reduce the number of degrees of freedom to account for autocorrelation of the sam index the effective sample size is n e f f n 1 ρ 1 ρ where ρ is the lag 1 autocorrelation of the sam index at daily timescales e g wilks 2006 which produces results similar to calculating n eff as the aggregated number of discrete sam episodes accordingly the sample size is effectively reduced by a factor of 0 7 0 8 as indicated in table 1 in order to facilitate interpretation of the wind wave response to the sam we first provide composite mslp anomalies fig 3 and zonal wind anomalies fig 4 to show the spatial structure of the sam in all seasons negative mslp anomalies occur at high latitudes and positive mslp anomalies occur at mid latitudes with anomalous westerly flow centered near 60 s juxtaposed against anomalous easterly flow centered near 35 s we note the meridional shift in the location of peak easterlies between jja 30 35 s and djf 35 40 s consistent with the seasonal migration of the subtropical ridge we also note a clear link to the northern hemisphere extratropics in djf when a weak but significant north south dipole anomaly appears in the central north pacific comprising westerlies to the north and easterlies to the south during the positive sam phase and roughly the opposite during the negative sam phase this indicates an anomalous anticyclone during positive sam and cyclone during negative sam in the central north pacific not shown here in the southern hemispheric projections of fig 3 but seen later in the global analysis of fig 8 there also appears a hint of a signal in the north atlantic ocean comprising easterlies centred on 60 n and westerlies centered on 40 n during the positive sam phase in djf indicating cyclonic flow only the westerly signal appears significant the easterly anomaly is seen contoured with a magnitude of 1 ms 1 near 320 330 e together these patterns resemble a rossby wave train emanating away from the tropics into the winter hemisphere such as occurs in response to tropical forcing associated with sst anomalies e g trenberth et al 1998 in addition previous studies have shown the sam to be anticorrelated with enso in djf such that a positive sam is often associated with la niña and a negative sam is often associated with el niño e g zhou and yu 2004 carvalho et al 2005 ding et al 2012 it therefore stands to reason that enso could be at the heart of this inter hemispheric high latitude teleconnection via i its relationship to the sam and ii its role as a tropical heating source for rossby wave propagation into the northern hemisphere however in section 3 3 we show this teleconnection to be independent of enso consistent with recent work e g liu et al 2015 and that enso rather acts to dampen the northern hemispheric response the composite evolution of the global response of ocean surface waves to the sam is explored for hs anomalies in fig 5 tp anomalies in fig 6 and zonal cge anomalies in fig 7 with shading applied for statistically significant anomalies to 95 confidence interpretation of the sam wave anomalies is aided by referencing the zonal wind anomalies fig 4 and the mean wind and wave fields figs 1 and 2 in general hs anomalies are largest over the southern hemisphere extratropics concomitant with the strong zonal wind signature of the sam here positive hs anomalies occur where sam westerly anomalies act on mean state westerly winds in a high latitude zonal band during the positive sam phase up to around 1 m and in mid latitude nodes centered near 40 s during the negative sam phase up to 0 6 m conversely negative hs anomalies of similar magnitude occur concurrently with easterly anomalies in these regions i e at high latitudes during the negative sam phase and at mid latitudes during the positive sam phase a notable feature is the protrusion of the high latitude wind anomaly into the mid latitudes around 250 e and the resulting equatorward expansion of positive hs anomalies during the positive sam phase and negative hs anomalies during the negative sam phase again amplified where the sam wind anomalies act on a strong mean state the northern hemisphere extratropical wind features are also reflected in the hs field with anomalies of up to 0 3 0 4 m occurring in the central north pacific and north atlantic oceans in djf these appear statistically significant for the negative phase of the sam tp anomalies in fig 6 demonstrate the broad scale impact of the sam in directly forcing surface waves primarily in the mid high latitudes of the southern hemisphere tp anomalies are statistically significant and strongest across the southern and south pacific oceans concurrent with the large anomalies in zonal cge the increase in tp towards the eastern pacific and the in phase variation of tp with hs suggest that the anomalous wave growth in the positive sam phase increased tp and reduction in the negative sam phase decreased tp is primarily generated by ocean swell the annular characteristic of the sam influences the strength of tp anomalies whereby large positive negative tp anomalies relate to the large zonal breadth of westerlies easterlies similar responses occur in the tropical pacific and indian oceans and in the north atlantic during djf although less pronounced for these remote regions with the in phase associations between tp and hs again being indicative of swell signals in some scarce regions however such as east of new zealand year round and south of alaska during jja local wave generation dominates and thus the tp and hs signals appear out of phase the region to the east of new zealand is sheltered from the influence of southern ocean swell and to the south of alaska local wave generation is high with little to no swell contribution note also the strong significant signal in tp on the northwest australian shelf which we consider in the following section with a closer look at the sam wave response around the australian coastline zonal cge anomalies in fig 7 also broadly reflect the sam zonal wind signal with positive values indicating wave energy anomalies emanating from the west towards the east and negative values indicating wave energy anomalies emanating from the east towards the west as previously stated the climatological mean fields for cge fig 2 show wave energy propagating with a meridional component from the extra tropics to the tropics as swell propagates along the great circle paths thus these zonal anomalies should be interpreted as not only a change in magnitude of cge but also a rotation in direction of the wave energy flux 3 2 australian coastal wave response significant wave responses to the sam occur around the australian coastline year round varying in their spatial extent from season to season during the positive sam phase negative hs anomalies of amplitude 0 1 0 2 m are seen along the northwest australian shelf primarily during son and djf similar magnitude negative anomalies of hs are also seen off the southwest australian coast in all seasons fig 5 in jja these negative anomalies extend halfway along the western australian coastline these coastal impacts are approximately equal and opposite during the negative sam phase and thus the sam induces a strong and significant impact on wave height in the vicinity of the leeuwin current 0 3 0 4 m during its peak flow in jja smith et al 1991 pearce 1997 these impacts are associated with i easterly wind anomalies during the positive sam phase and ii westerly wind anomalies during the negative sam phase fig 3 acting on a westerly mean state fig 1 for the east coast of australia the greatest impacts on hs occur during djf and jja again with amplitudes around 0 1 0 2 m for djf the response appears somewhat non linear the positive sam phase sees a weak increase in hs that hugs the south eastern coastline from around brisbane 27 s 153 e to tasmania this is seemingly a response to anti clockwise rotation of the south westerly wave fluxes fig 6 resulting in a greater contribution of swell energy propagating into the tasman sea during the negative sam phase a decrease in hs is seen further to the north along the queensland east coast the sam impact on hs during jja shows an increase along the queensland and northern territory coastlines between the tropic of capricorn 23 5 s and darwin 12 s 131 e during the positive sam phase and a decrease along the great barrier reef during the negative sam phase these impacts are associated with i easterly wind anomalies during the positive sam phase and ii westerly wind anomalies during the negative sam phase acting on an easterly mean state the strongest impact on australian coastal tp anomalies in fig 6 appears on the northwest australian shelf with amplitudes up to around 2 s importantly these values are about half of the climatological mean fig 2 and thus highlight a strong shadow zone that suggests a directional shift in the southern ocean generated swell component of the wave field north west cape on the northwest shelf separates two distinct wave regimes owing to the change in influence of swell generated in the southern ocean versus waves generated in the eastern tropical indian ocean greenslade et al 2018 here the swell observed on the northwest shelf is generated in the indian ocean extra tropics which propagates north eastwards to the shelf during the positive phase of the sam the wave energy flux is rotated anti clockwise and energy which would have propagated onto the northwest shelf is now blocked by north west cape consequently the wave regime north of the cape is sensitive to the phase of the sam positive sam is associated with lower hs tp and cge in almost all seasons elsewhere around the australian coast the strongest impacts on anomalous tp are found around tasmania and the southeast in most seasons extending up from the southern ocean in this region a protrusion of hs anomalies occurs from higher latitudes during mam and jja this is particularly seen around tasmania in both seasons and into the great australian bight in mam such that they are of opposite sign to those in son and djf which are sourced from the mid latitudes this is also the case for zonal cge anomalies in fig 7 otherwise wave energy flux anomalies around the australian coastline are from the east during the positive sam phase a general anti clockwise rotation of the south westerly cge vectors and from the west during the negative sam phase a clockwise rotation in line with the orientation of zonal wind anomalies around the continent 3 3 enso influence the positive sam phase is significantly correlated with the cool phase of the el niño southern oscillation enso in djf using data on timescales from daily marshall et al 2012 to seasonal l heureux and thompson 2006 hendon et al 2007 we therefore consider the possible impact of enso on our results by repeating the mslp zonal wind and wave field calculations of figs 3 7 for djf but excluding el niño and la niña episodes in order to isolate the impact of the sam during neutral enso years this reduces the djf sample sizes by a factor of about a half for the positive sam phase and two thirds for the negative sam phase table 1 we note that we also repeated the analyses for the other seasons with enso years excluded but there was little change to our results not shown global mslp composite anomalies in fig 8 highlight the northern hemispheric link to the sam with the emergence of an anticyclone over the central north pacific and a cyclone over the north atlantic ocean during the positive sam which weakens considerably with the inclusion of enso years not shown a signal of comparable strength and opposite sign occurs over the central north pacific during the negative sam phase composite anomalies for 10 m zonal wind hs tp and cge in fig 8 also show a strong intensification of the northern hemisphere extratropical signal compared with when enso years are included figs 4 7 particularly over the north atlantic ocean during the positive sam phase only the positive wave field anomalies centered near 30 n during the negative sam phase are similar in strength but the region of significance is reduced when enso years are excluded this indicates that el niño and la niña play a key role in offsetting this signal indeed the 10 m zonal wind composite of fig 8 strong sam without enso years indicates a region of strong divergence anomalies over the equatorial western central pacific that appears relatively weak in fig 4 strong sam with enso years and thus the sam shows a clear link to variations in the atmospheric circulation of the tropics that are independent of enso this signal is consistent with the role of upper level tropical divergence in driving these tropical extratropical teleconnections via the hadley cell e g hoskins and karoly 1981 the impact on zonal wind here is reflected in the hs field with statistically significant anomalies of up to 0 8 m occurring in the north atlantic and up to 0 6 m in the central north pacific during neutral enso years when the sam is positive these signals are about twice the strength of those seen when enso years are included moreover the remote north atlantic signal is of comparable strength to the directly forced signal in the southern hemisphere courtesy of the large amplitude westerly wind anomalies fig 4 that act on a strong westerly mean state fig 1 the other wave fields show similar amplifications of the northern hemisphere signal in djf during neutral enso years peak period anomalies occur with amplitudes up to about 0 8 s in the north atlantic and central north pacific c f 0 4 s in fig 7 wave energy flux anomalies occur up to 50 kw m 1 in the north atlantic c f 30 kw m 1 in fig 6 and 30 kw m 1 in the central north pacific c f 25 kw m 1 the former of which represents about half of the mean amplitude fig 2 these remotely forced signals point to a significant and stronger teleconnection between the sam and northern hemisphere winter climate during neutral enso years compared with active enso years consistent with recent work that also reports an enso independent link between the sam and northern hemisphere extratropical climate liu et al 2015 this result deserves further investigation beyond the scope of the present study 3 4 shifts in low and high wave conditions we now explore how the sam acts to modulate the tails of the distribution of hs i e how the sam acts to cause shifts in occurrence of low and high wave conditions low wave conditions are defined as occurring when hs anomalies are below the 5th percentile and high wave conditions when hs anomalies are above the 95th percentile fig 9 shows the 5th left column and 95th right column percentile thresholds relative to the mean hs shown in fig 1 to vary mostly in latitude with zonal uniformity over the globe and the largest excursions in the extratropics these spatial patterns reflect the variance in hs occurring strongest at mid high latitudes not shown where the mean hs is highest outside of the tropics the 95th percentile threshold anomaly is about 0 5 m stronger than the 5th percentile thresholds which stems from the strongly positively skewed distribution of hs not shown in the tropics the high and low thresholds are similar indicating that hs is more normally distributed at lower mean wind speeds based on these 5th and 95th percentile thresholds we compute the probability of occurrence of low and high wave conditions for positive and negative sam phases by counting the number of instances at each grid location for which the hs anomaly is i less than the 5th percentile threshold and ii greater than the 95th percentile threshold and then dividing by the total number of samples in each sam phase in fig 10 for the 5th percentile and 11 for the 95th percentile we express probability composites as ratios relative to the mean probability of occurrence nominally 0 05 probability ratios greater than one indicates an increased likelihood of low wave conditions in fig 10 and high wave conditions in fig 11 conversely probabilities less than one indicate decreased likelihood of occurrence ratios are shaded only when significantly different from one at 95 confidence using a z score test for event probabilities spiegel 1961 probabilities of low and high wave conditions are broadly consistent with the spatial variations in hs anomalies seen in fig 5 in general significant decreases in the likelihood of low wave conditions fig 10 and increases in the likelihood of high wave conditions fig 11 occur at high latitudes during the positive sam phase and at mid latitudes during the negative sam phase in conjunction with regions of positive hs anomalies fig 5 conversely significant increases in the likelihood of low wave conditions and decreases in the likelihood of high wave conditions generally occur at mid latitudes during the positive sam phase and at high latitudes during the negative sam phase in conjunction with negative hs anomalies fig 5 note that high ratios in fig 10 and low ratios in fig 11 use blue shading whereas low ratios in fig 10 and high ratios in fig 11 use orange shading for easy comparison with negative blue and positive orange shading of anomalies in fig 5 notably with australian coastal impacts in mind the increase in the probability of high wave conditions during the negative sam phase fig 11 is up to twice the mean probability of occurrence in association with the anomalies in westerly wind fig 4 and positive hs fig 5 furthermore the sam teleconnections to the central north pacific and north atlantic ocean also occur here again concurrent with hs anomalies these teleconnections are again enhanced in djf when enso years are excluded from the analysis not shown we also note with interest the high probability of low wave conditions that spans the western coast of south america during the negative sam phase in djf and mam and the high probability of low wave conditions along the indonesian coast during the positive sam phase fig 10 considering the positive trend in the sam over recent decades e g marshall 2003 the latter may suggest declining wave conditions along the indonesian surf coast in general the probability ratios for low wave conditions are stronger than for high wave conditions reflecting the slightly weaker negative thresholds for low wave occurrence 1 5 2 0 m at mid latitudes compared with high wave occurrence 2 0 2 5 m 4 summary and concluding remarks this paper assesses the impact of the sam on global ocean wind waves during each of the four temperate zone seasons using 30 years of high resolution wave data from the cawcr wave hindcast anomalies in hs tp and cge show a strong and significant response over the southern hemisphere extratropics year round concomitant with the strong zonal wind signature of the sam in regions dominated by mean westerlies increases in hs of up to 1 m occur concurrently with westerly anomalies while negative hs anomalies of similar magnitude occur concurrently with easterly anomalies wave impacts occur around the australian coast at various times of year with amplitudes of 0 3 0 4 m off the southwest coast year round 0 1 0 2 m on the northwest australian shelf in son and djf and 0 1 0 2 m along the east coast in jja and djf the tasmanian coast experiences wave impacts primarily from higher latitudes in mam and jja which extend also into the great australian bight in mam tp and zonal cge anomalies broadly reflect the sam zonal wind signal in directly forcing surface waves primarily in the mid high latitudes of the southern hemisphere moreover the increase in tp towards the eastern pacific and the in phase variation of tp with hs suggest the wave anomalies are primarily generated by an increase in contribution from the swell component of the wave spectrum the strength of tp anomalies varies with the zonal wind fetch over the southern ocean and the strongest impact on tp anomalies around the australian coast is on the northwest shelf with amplitudes up to around 2 s approximately half of the climatological mean surface wind and wave variables offer a useful climate diagnostic for resolving a remote teleconnection to the northern hemisphere extratropics in djf when an atmospheric signal emerges resembling a tropically forced rossby wave train this has a significant impact on surface waves in the central north pacific and north atlantic oceans where anomalies of up to 0 3 0 4 m around 5 10 of the mean amplitude occur for hs 0 4 s about 5 of the mean amplitude for tp and 30 kw m 1 about 30 of the mean amplitude for zonal cge the zonal wind patterns suggest anticyclonic cyclonic responses over the central north pacific ocean anticyclonic during positive sam and north atlantic ocean cyclonic during positive sam these remote signals amplify significantly when we exclude el niño and la niña years from the analysis indicating that enso plays a key role in offsetting the link between the sam and northern hemisphere winter climate this appears to be related to a weakening of zonal wind divergence anomalies over the tropical pacific ocean when the sam is strong during active enso years importantly this remote link to the sam occurs independent of enso via changes to the tropical atmospheric circulation hadley cell consistent with recent studies the sam also imposes a strong and significant influence on the occurrence of low and high wave conditions defined when hs anomalies are below the 5th percentile and above the 95th percentile respectively in general significant increases in the likelihood of high wave conditions and decreases in the likelihood of low wave conditions correspond to regions where the sam induces positive hs anomalies notably a two fold increase in the probability of high wave conditions occurs in the australian region again the impact of the sam extends to the central north pacific and north atlantic ocean concurrent with hs anomalies the modulation of surface wave activity by the sam presented here supports the results of a similar analysis for the madden julian oscillation by marshall et al 2015 in suggesting potential predictability of global wave variations on the subseasonal timescale which could have tremendous practical benefit good progress has been made in improving the depiction of the sam in global forecast models and predictability of the sam has been demonstrated out to lead times approaching three weeks e g marshall et al 2012 climatologically driven changes in the wave climate are increasingly being recognized as a key influence on coastal erosion and accretion patterns and consequent shoreline position for the world s coasts e g barnard et al 2015 similarly coastal engineers are beginning to consider pre emptive coastal management options to limit damage to storm wave events davidson et al 2017 subseasonal predictability of surface wave variations associated with the sam and other climate drivers has the potential to provide coastal managers with sufficient and timely information that could enable them to make decisions that could protect or limit coastal communities and infrastructure from severe wave damage thus subseasonal predictability of surface wave variations resulting from the sam should now be investigated acknowledgements this study was

24094,we assess the impact of the southern annular mode sam on global ocean wind waves using 30 years of wave data from a wave model hindcast that is forced with high resolution surface winds from the ncep cfsr reanalysis our primary focus is on the wave field and swell influence in the southern hemisphere and we apply our analysis to each of the four temperate zone seasons comprising march may mam june august jja september november son and december february djf statistically significant anomalies in significant wave height hs peak wave period tp and zonal wave energy flux cge are found to covary with local variations in surface zonal wind induced by the low and high polarity phases of the sam the signature of the sam in ocean surface waves extends beyond local wind generated forcing in the southern hemisphere extratropics to remote forcing in the northern hemisphere extratropics during djf with the associated atmospheric signal resembling a tropically forced rossby wave train this has a significant impact on surface waves in the central north pacific and north atlantic oceans the el niño southern oscillation enso acts to weaken the link between the sam and northern hemisphere winter climate with the zonal wind divergence anomalies amplifying over the tropical pacific ocean when we exclude el niño and la niña years from the analysis this remote link to the sam thus occurs independent of enso via sam driven changes to the tropical atmospheric circulation suggesting that the sam may provide a useful predictive signal for the northern hemisphere during djf the sam also influences the occurrence of daily low below the 5th percentile and high above the 95th percentile wave conditions emphasizing that the sam may be a valuable source of predictable wave variability from sub weekly to seasonal timescales future work should explore wave data suitable for trend analysis considering the positive trend in the sam over recent decades 1 introduction the southern annular mode sam e g trenberth 1979 rogers and van loon 1982 mo and white 1985 or antarctic oscillation thompson and wallace 1998 plays a dominant role in the high and mid latitude climate of the southern hemisphere as an intrinsic mode of atmospheric variability the sam arises through a positive feedback between zonal mean wind anomalies and eddy momentum fluxes and has a characteristic time scale of about two weeks lorenz and hartmann 2001 fluctuations in the sam result from anomalous baroclinic wave activity in the extratropical storm track in association with fluctuations of the westerly jet stream in its high polarity phase a poleward shifted jet stream is associated with enhanced baroclinic wave activity that propagates upward and equatorward thus providing momentum fluxes that reinforce the zonal wind anomalies against surface drag and causing the wind anomalies to drift poleward with a largely zonally symmetric equivalent barotropic structure e g gong and wang 1999 thompson and wallace 2000 subsequently the mid latitude westerly wind belt shifts poleward characterizing the high index polarity or positive phase of the sam conversely an equatorward shift in the mid latitude westerly winds and reduction of baroclinic wave activity in the storm track characterizes the negative sam phase e g fyfe 2003 the sam influences variations in southern hemisphere weather and climate and drives variations in the circulation in the southern ocean over a wide range of timescales from daily to seasonal specifically impacts of the sam on weekly and monthly rainfall variability and extremes have been reported over australia e g hendon et al 2007 risbey et al 2009 marshall et al 2012 marshall et al 2014 new zealand renwick and thompson 2006 south america silvestri and vera 2003 south africa reason and rouault 2005 and in the northern hemisphere zheng et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the sam has been linked to antarctic temperature variations e g thompson and solomon 2002 and sea ice distribution e g lefebvre et al 2004 hall and visbeck 2002 southern ocean surface temperature e g watterson 2000 2001 and biology e g lovenduski and gruber 2005 via its wind driven impact on surface heat fluxes and ekman drift the importance of understanding these relationships to the sam is underscored by the recent shift in the sam towards a more positive phase which is shown to contribute to observed long term trends over the southern hemisphere e g thompson and wallace 2000 kushner et al 2001 haylock et al 2006 the purpose of this paper is to extend studies of the impact of ocean and explore its impact on global ocean wind waves the relationships between global ocean surface waves and large scale atmospheric climate variability have previously been investigated e g kushnir et al 1997 wang and swail 2001 dodet et al 2010 hemer et al 2010 izaguirre et al 2011 bosserelle et al 2011 semedo et al 2011 fan et al 2012 stopa et al 2013 including the impact of the madden julian oscillation marshall et al 2015 hemer et al 2010 identified that the principal mode of inter annual variability of the southern hemisphere wave variability was significantly related to the sam focusing on the local wind generated forcing in the southern hemisphere extra tropics and the consequent implications for swell waves that propagated equatorward in the major oceans basins despite this relationship detailed analysis of this relationship has not been undertaken the sam is a probable candidate for driving significant surface wave variations due to its large spatial scale hemispheric and temporal scale up to a season further with increasing evidence to suggest an influence of the sam on the northern hemisphere climate e g nan and li 2003 wu et al 2009 sun 2010 sun et al 2010 the relationship between the sam and northern hemisphere surface wind wave fields should be considered for example liu et al 2015 proposes an ocean atmosphere coupled bridge as a key process by which the sam signal in september november son can transmit to the northern hemisphere in december february djf in this mechanism near surface heat in the southern ocean is redistributed by sam driven changes in surface zonal wind the sst signal can then persist into djf via the memory of sst and upon its release into the atmosphere modify the upward branch of the hadley cell the meridional circulation of the northern hemisphere is thus affected and an anomalous djf climate signal emerges at the surface an important aspect of this inter hemispheric teleconnection to the sam is its independence from enso liu et al 2015 other recent work has also reported an enso independent relationship between the sam and atmospheric variability in the tropics during djf ding et al 2014 documenting and understanding the modulation of global ocean surface waves by the sam can help underpin development of subseasonal predictive capability of ocean surface waves with practical benefits that include anticipating wave induced coastal inundation this understanding will also be of benefit to the long term management of coasts projected 21st century changes to the sam are sensitive to the rate of ozone recovery and to greenhouse gas emission scenarios under a low rcp2 6 emission scenario ozone recovery are expected to dominate giving a small equatorward jet shift greenhouse gas emissions are expected to dominate under a high rcp8 5 emission scenario giving an ongoing poleward jet shift christensen et al 2013 climate driven variability of the surface wave field is being increasingly recognized as a significant influence on shoreline position stability particularly in the context of projected future sea level rise hemer et al 2013 barnard et al 2015 whether a low or high ghg emission scenario plays out changes to the sam will likely shift the equilibrium wave field for parts of the global ocean with potential consequent implications for coastal sediment budgets and shoreline stability we assess the impact of the sam on surface waves using the global output from a high resolution hindcast of a surface wave model forced by surface winds from a 31 year reanalysis a description of the global ocean wave hindcast and its suitability for our study along with the compositing approach to extract the sam signals are provided in section 2 the impacts of the sam on surface waves are presented in section 3 and a summary and conclusions are provided in section 4 including implications for sub weekly to seasonal prediction of global surface wave variations 2 surface wave hindcast and sam compositing 2 1 surface wave hindcast the centre for australian weather and climate research cawcr wave hindcast dataset durrant et al 2014 is a high resolution global product created using the wavewatch iii model version 4 08 tolman 1991 2014 with 10 m winds and sea ice concentration prescribed from the recent climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 for the period 1979 2010 available hourly and at 0 3 0 3 horizontal resolution the cfsr data provides an unprecedented depiction of global surface winds with sufficient representation of small scale high amplitude variability in lieu of continuous global records of ocean surface waves the cawcr wave hindcast provides global wave data at a spatial resolution of 0 4 and at an hourly temporal resolution good agreement is found globally for bias and root mean square error relative to available satellite altimeter and buoy observations detailed assessments of the quality of this wave hindcast is presented for the australian region in hemer et al 2017 and globally with focus on southern pacific island region in durrant et al 2013 a description of its improvements over previously used products is also summarized in marshall et al 2015 here we utilize significant wave height hs peak period tp and wave energy flux cge from the large number of gridded variables available these three represent the most commonly observed wave variable hs the length of the waves and thus indication of the source of waves tp where locally generated wind sea will have short wave periods and distally generated swell will have longer wave periods and the power of the waves cge providing an indication of the potential force of the waves on coastal or offshore infrastructure cge depends on hs and the period t thus c g e ρ g 2 h s 2 t 64 π where ρ is the water density and g is the gravitational acceleration we are interested in assessing impacts of the sam on both the magnitude and direction of surface wave energy so we express the cge scalar field as a vector quantity to resolve the directional response by using peak wave direction dp for deriving zonal and meridional components of cge where dp is decomposed into vector components and the cge scalar quantity comprises the magnitude of the total vector for all surface wave fields assessed in this study we calculate anomalies relative to the annual climatology we note that temporally varying sea ice concentration leads to a temporally varying mask around the ice edge in the cawcr hindcast to ease calculations the grid points that are periodically masked have been removed from our analysis for each season consequently we do not consider the sam s influence on wave fields in regions where the sam has an impact on sea ice extent e g lefebvre et al 2004 hall and visbeck 2002 and vice versa e g raphael et al 2011 as such this affects only a small area and does not impede our detection of the sam s impact otherwise there exist biases in the hindcast that can be attributed to errors in the forcing wind field durrant et al 2013 for instance a known inhomogeneity in cfsr winds chawla et al 2013 results in an over prediction of wave heights in mid latitudes in the early part of the hindcast a common problem shared by global wave hindcast datasets this leads to spurious trends in the wave data durrant et al 2014 however while biases in the wind can directly impact the wave field output in some cases in other situations wind biases can have compensating effects on errors in the wave model durrant et al 2013 the focus of this previous work is on time averaged biases and so the limitations discussed in these studies do not necessarily hinder our composite analysis of climate variability on the subseasonal timescale for example we find that trend removal has little impact on our results not shown rather the spurious trends in the wave data documented by durrant et al 2014 will impact long term climate studies using this data we therefore refrain from performing trend analysis on this dataset 2 2 sam compositing we diagnose impacts of the sam on global ocean surface waves by constructing an index of the sam that captures the variability of mean sea level pressure mslp around the mid latitudes of the southern hemisphere e g gong and wang 1999 marshall 2003 marshall et al 2012 using cfsr data i e from the same reanalysis dataset prescribed for the cawcr wave hindcast daily sam indices are obtained by projecting daily zonal mean mslp anomalies onto the leading empirical orthogonal function eof of observed monthly mean mslp anomalies between 25 s and 75 s after removing the seasonal cycle from the data and weighting each grid point by the square root of the cosine of latitude e g marshall et al 2012 the daily sam index is then normalized by the standard deviation of the monthly sam index the eof analysis is conducted on the base period 1979 to 2009 and each eof is based on the covariance matrix the high index polarity positive phase of the sam occurs when the pressure anomaly is low on the pole and the midlatitude westerly jet is shifted poleward conversely the low index polarity negative phase of the sam occurs when the pressure anomaly is high on the pole and the midlatitude westerly jet is shifted equatorward positive and negative sam phases are defined to occur when index values exceed one standard deviation σ about the mean i e 1σ and 1σ respectively to first order the positive and negative phases exhibit approximate symmetry in their broad scale atmospheric characteristics including their opposite signed but otherwise similar impacts on australian climate anomalies hendon et al 2007 and extremes marshall et al 2014 the seasonal meridional shift in the mean position of the subtropical ridge between djf and jja june august due to the progression of the australian monsoon trough and poleward contraction of the extratropical westerly jet influences the spatial characteristics of the sam at mid latitudes so we perform our assessment using subsets of daily mean data for each temperate zone season mam march may jja son and djf 3 results 3 1 ocean wave response we show the climatological mean fields for surface zonal wind and hs fig 1 and for tp and cge fig 2 calculated for each season to provide context for understanding the sam induced wave anomalies each variable is derived directly from wavewatch iii output files following definitions provided in tolman 2014 with tp determined as the inverse of the wave peak frequency f p key features of the mean surface zonal wind in the southern hemisphere are dominant westerlies at mid high latitudes poleward of about 25 s in jja and 30 s in djf where the sam has a strong signal not shown poleward of 60 s due to the ice mask in the hindcast data mean trade easterlies prevail in the subtropics year round except over the maritime continent in djf and the northwest australian shelf in son and djf where the mean winds in these seasons are westerly in the mean surface wave fields hs maximizes in the higher latitudes where surface westerly winds are strongest tp tends to increase to the east which indicates swell propagation from the west and cge shows wave energy propagating from the extratropics to the tropics the following analyses present composites of pertinent fields of interest stratified according to season and sam phase the number of days n for each season pertaining to positive and negative sam phases is shown in table 1 to calculate statistical significance of composite anomalies we use a standard t test student 1908 but reduce the number of degrees of freedom to account for autocorrelation of the sam index the effective sample size is n e f f n 1 ρ 1 ρ where ρ is the lag 1 autocorrelation of the sam index at daily timescales e g wilks 2006 which produces results similar to calculating n eff as the aggregated number of discrete sam episodes accordingly the sample size is effectively reduced by a factor of 0 7 0 8 as indicated in table 1 in order to facilitate interpretation of the wind wave response to the sam we first provide composite mslp anomalies fig 3 and zonal wind anomalies fig 4 to show the spatial structure of the sam in all seasons negative mslp anomalies occur at high latitudes and positive mslp anomalies occur at mid latitudes with anomalous westerly flow centered near 60 s juxtaposed against anomalous easterly flow centered near 35 s we note the meridional shift in the location of peak easterlies between jja 30 35 s and djf 35 40 s consistent with the seasonal migration of the subtropical ridge we also note a clear link to the northern hemisphere extratropics in djf when a weak but significant north south dipole anomaly appears in the central north pacific comprising westerlies to the north and easterlies to the south during the positive sam phase and roughly the opposite during the negative sam phase this indicates an anomalous anticyclone during positive sam and cyclone during negative sam in the central north pacific not shown here in the southern hemispheric projections of fig 3 but seen later in the global analysis of fig 8 there also appears a hint of a signal in the north atlantic ocean comprising easterlies centred on 60 n and westerlies centered on 40 n during the positive sam phase in djf indicating cyclonic flow only the westerly signal appears significant the easterly anomaly is seen contoured with a magnitude of 1 ms 1 near 320 330 e together these patterns resemble a rossby wave train emanating away from the tropics into the winter hemisphere such as occurs in response to tropical forcing associated with sst anomalies e g trenberth et al 1998 in addition previous studies have shown the sam to be anticorrelated with enso in djf such that a positive sam is often associated with la niña and a negative sam is often associated with el niño e g zhou and yu 2004 carvalho et al 2005 ding et al 2012 it therefore stands to reason that enso could be at the heart of this inter hemispheric high latitude teleconnection via i its relationship to the sam and ii its role as a tropical heating source for rossby wave propagation into the northern hemisphere however in section 3 3 we show this teleconnection to be independent of enso consistent with recent work e g liu et al 2015 and that enso rather acts to dampen the northern hemispheric response the composite evolution of the global response of ocean surface waves to the sam is explored for hs anomalies in fig 5 tp anomalies in fig 6 and zonal cge anomalies in fig 7 with shading applied for statistically significant anomalies to 95 confidence interpretation of the sam wave anomalies is aided by referencing the zonal wind anomalies fig 4 and the mean wind and wave fields figs 1 and 2 in general hs anomalies are largest over the southern hemisphere extratropics concomitant with the strong zonal wind signature of the sam here positive hs anomalies occur where sam westerly anomalies act on mean state westerly winds in a high latitude zonal band during the positive sam phase up to around 1 m and in mid latitude nodes centered near 40 s during the negative sam phase up to 0 6 m conversely negative hs anomalies of similar magnitude occur concurrently with easterly anomalies in these regions i e at high latitudes during the negative sam phase and at mid latitudes during the positive sam phase a notable feature is the protrusion of the high latitude wind anomaly into the mid latitudes around 250 e and the resulting equatorward expansion of positive hs anomalies during the positive sam phase and negative hs anomalies during the negative sam phase again amplified where the sam wind anomalies act on a strong mean state the northern hemisphere extratropical wind features are also reflected in the hs field with anomalies of up to 0 3 0 4 m occurring in the central north pacific and north atlantic oceans in djf these appear statistically significant for the negative phase of the sam tp anomalies in fig 6 demonstrate the broad scale impact of the sam in directly forcing surface waves primarily in the mid high latitudes of the southern hemisphere tp anomalies are statistically significant and strongest across the southern and south pacific oceans concurrent with the large anomalies in zonal cge the increase in tp towards the eastern pacific and the in phase variation of tp with hs suggest that the anomalous wave growth in the positive sam phase increased tp and reduction in the negative sam phase decreased tp is primarily generated by ocean swell the annular characteristic of the sam influences the strength of tp anomalies whereby large positive negative tp anomalies relate to the large zonal breadth of westerlies easterlies similar responses occur in the tropical pacific and indian oceans and in the north atlantic during djf although less pronounced for these remote regions with the in phase associations between tp and hs again being indicative of swell signals in some scarce regions however such as east of new zealand year round and south of alaska during jja local wave generation dominates and thus the tp and hs signals appear out of phase the region to the east of new zealand is sheltered from the influence of southern ocean swell and to the south of alaska local wave generation is high with little to no swell contribution note also the strong significant signal in tp on the northwest australian shelf which we consider in the following section with a closer look at the sam wave response around the australian coastline zonal cge anomalies in fig 7 also broadly reflect the sam zonal wind signal with positive values indicating wave energy anomalies emanating from the west towards the east and negative values indicating wave energy anomalies emanating from the east towards the west as previously stated the climatological mean fields for cge fig 2 show wave energy propagating with a meridional component from the extra tropics to the tropics as swell propagates along the great circle paths thus these zonal anomalies should be interpreted as not only a change in magnitude of cge but also a rotation in direction of the wave energy flux 3 2 australian coastal wave response significant wave responses to the sam occur around the australian coastline year round varying in their spatial extent from season to season during the positive sam phase negative hs anomalies of amplitude 0 1 0 2 m are seen along the northwest australian shelf primarily during son and djf similar magnitude negative anomalies of hs are also seen off the southwest australian coast in all seasons fig 5 in jja these negative anomalies extend halfway along the western australian coastline these coastal impacts are approximately equal and opposite during the negative sam phase and thus the sam induces a strong and significant impact on wave height in the vicinity of the leeuwin current 0 3 0 4 m during its peak flow in jja smith et al 1991 pearce 1997 these impacts are associated with i easterly wind anomalies during the positive sam phase and ii westerly wind anomalies during the negative sam phase fig 3 acting on a westerly mean state fig 1 for the east coast of australia the greatest impacts on hs occur during djf and jja again with amplitudes around 0 1 0 2 m for djf the response appears somewhat non linear the positive sam phase sees a weak increase in hs that hugs the south eastern coastline from around brisbane 27 s 153 e to tasmania this is seemingly a response to anti clockwise rotation of the south westerly wave fluxes fig 6 resulting in a greater contribution of swell energy propagating into the tasman sea during the negative sam phase a decrease in hs is seen further to the north along the queensland east coast the sam impact on hs during jja shows an increase along the queensland and northern territory coastlines between the tropic of capricorn 23 5 s and darwin 12 s 131 e during the positive sam phase and a decrease along the great barrier reef during the negative sam phase these impacts are associated with i easterly wind anomalies during the positive sam phase and ii westerly wind anomalies during the negative sam phase acting on an easterly mean state the strongest impact on australian coastal tp anomalies in fig 6 appears on the northwest australian shelf with amplitudes up to around 2 s importantly these values are about half of the climatological mean fig 2 and thus highlight a strong shadow zone that suggests a directional shift in the southern ocean generated swell component of the wave field north west cape on the northwest shelf separates two distinct wave regimes owing to the change in influence of swell generated in the southern ocean versus waves generated in the eastern tropical indian ocean greenslade et al 2018 here the swell observed on the northwest shelf is generated in the indian ocean extra tropics which propagates north eastwards to the shelf during the positive phase of the sam the wave energy flux is rotated anti clockwise and energy which would have propagated onto the northwest shelf is now blocked by north west cape consequently the wave regime north of the cape is sensitive to the phase of the sam positive sam is associated with lower hs tp and cge in almost all seasons elsewhere around the australian coast the strongest impacts on anomalous tp are found around tasmania and the southeast in most seasons extending up from the southern ocean in this region a protrusion of hs anomalies occurs from higher latitudes during mam and jja this is particularly seen around tasmania in both seasons and into the great australian bight in mam such that they are of opposite sign to those in son and djf which are sourced from the mid latitudes this is also the case for zonal cge anomalies in fig 7 otherwise wave energy flux anomalies around the australian coastline are from the east during the positive sam phase a general anti clockwise rotation of the south westerly cge vectors and from the west during the negative sam phase a clockwise rotation in line with the orientation of zonal wind anomalies around the continent 3 3 enso influence the positive sam phase is significantly correlated with the cool phase of the el niño southern oscillation enso in djf using data on timescales from daily marshall et al 2012 to seasonal l heureux and thompson 2006 hendon et al 2007 we therefore consider the possible impact of enso on our results by repeating the mslp zonal wind and wave field calculations of figs 3 7 for djf but excluding el niño and la niña episodes in order to isolate the impact of the sam during neutral enso years this reduces the djf sample sizes by a factor of about a half for the positive sam phase and two thirds for the negative sam phase table 1 we note that we also repeated the analyses for the other seasons with enso years excluded but there was little change to our results not shown global mslp composite anomalies in fig 8 highlight the northern hemispheric link to the sam with the emergence of an anticyclone over the central north pacific and a cyclone over the north atlantic ocean during the positive sam which weakens considerably with the inclusion of enso years not shown a signal of comparable strength and opposite sign occurs over the central north pacific during the negative sam phase composite anomalies for 10 m zonal wind hs tp and cge in fig 8 also show a strong intensification of the northern hemisphere extratropical signal compared with when enso years are included figs 4 7 particularly over the north atlantic ocean during the positive sam phase only the positive wave field anomalies centered near 30 n during the negative sam phase are similar in strength but the region of significance is reduced when enso years are excluded this indicates that el niño and la niña play a key role in offsetting this signal indeed the 10 m zonal wind composite of fig 8 strong sam without enso years indicates a region of strong divergence anomalies over the equatorial western central pacific that appears relatively weak in fig 4 strong sam with enso years and thus the sam shows a clear link to variations in the atmospheric circulation of the tropics that are independent of enso this signal is consistent with the role of upper level tropical divergence in driving these tropical extratropical teleconnections via the hadley cell e g hoskins and karoly 1981 the impact on zonal wind here is reflected in the hs field with statistically significant anomalies of up to 0 8 m occurring in the north atlantic and up to 0 6 m in the central north pacific during neutral enso years when the sam is positive these signals are about twice the strength of those seen when enso years are included moreover the remote north atlantic signal is of comparable strength to the directly forced signal in the southern hemisphere courtesy of the large amplitude westerly wind anomalies fig 4 that act on a strong westerly mean state fig 1 the other wave fields show similar amplifications of the northern hemisphere signal in djf during neutral enso years peak period anomalies occur with amplitudes up to about 0 8 s in the north atlantic and central north pacific c f 0 4 s in fig 7 wave energy flux anomalies occur up to 50 kw m 1 in the north atlantic c f 30 kw m 1 in fig 6 and 30 kw m 1 in the central north pacific c f 25 kw m 1 the former of which represents about half of the mean amplitude fig 2 these remotely forced signals point to a significant and stronger teleconnection between the sam and northern hemisphere winter climate during neutral enso years compared with active enso years consistent with recent work that also reports an enso independent link between the sam and northern hemisphere extratropical climate liu et al 2015 this result deserves further investigation beyond the scope of the present study 3 4 shifts in low and high wave conditions we now explore how the sam acts to modulate the tails of the distribution of hs i e how the sam acts to cause shifts in occurrence of low and high wave conditions low wave conditions are defined as occurring when hs anomalies are below the 5th percentile and high wave conditions when hs anomalies are above the 95th percentile fig 9 shows the 5th left column and 95th right column percentile thresholds relative to the mean hs shown in fig 1 to vary mostly in latitude with zonal uniformity over the globe and the largest excursions in the extratropics these spatial patterns reflect the variance in hs occurring strongest at mid high latitudes not shown where the mean hs is highest outside of the tropics the 95th percentile threshold anomaly is about 0 5 m stronger than the 5th percentile thresholds which stems from the strongly positively skewed distribution of hs not shown in the tropics the high and low thresholds are similar indicating that hs is more normally distributed at lower mean wind speeds based on these 5th and 95th percentile thresholds we compute the probability of occurrence of low and high wave conditions for positive and negative sam phases by counting the number of instances at each grid location for which the hs anomaly is i less than the 5th percentile threshold and ii greater than the 95th percentile threshold and then dividing by the total number of samples in each sam phase in fig 10 for the 5th percentile and 11 for the 95th percentile we express probability composites as ratios relative to the mean probability of occurrence nominally 0 05 probability ratios greater than one indicates an increased likelihood of low wave conditions in fig 10 and high wave conditions in fig 11 conversely probabilities less than one indicate decreased likelihood of occurrence ratios are shaded only when significantly different from one at 95 confidence using a z score test for event probabilities spiegel 1961 probabilities of low and high wave conditions are broadly consistent with the spatial variations in hs anomalies seen in fig 5 in general significant decreases in the likelihood of low wave conditions fig 10 and increases in the likelihood of high wave conditions fig 11 occur at high latitudes during the positive sam phase and at mid latitudes during the negative sam phase in conjunction with regions of positive hs anomalies fig 5 conversely significant increases in the likelihood of low wave conditions and decreases in the likelihood of high wave conditions generally occur at mid latitudes during the positive sam phase and at high latitudes during the negative sam phase in conjunction with negative hs anomalies fig 5 note that high ratios in fig 10 and low ratios in fig 11 use blue shading whereas low ratios in fig 10 and high ratios in fig 11 use orange shading for easy comparison with negative blue and positive orange shading of anomalies in fig 5 notably with australian coastal impacts in mind the increase in the probability of high wave conditions during the negative sam phase fig 11 is up to twice the mean probability of occurrence in association with the anomalies in westerly wind fig 4 and positive hs fig 5 furthermore the sam teleconnections to the central north pacific and north atlantic ocean also occur here again concurrent with hs anomalies these teleconnections are again enhanced in djf when enso years are excluded from the analysis not shown we also note with interest the high probability of low wave conditions that spans the western coast of south america during the negative sam phase in djf and mam and the high probability of low wave conditions along the indonesian coast during the positive sam phase fig 10 considering the positive trend in the sam over recent decades e g marshall 2003 the latter may suggest declining wave conditions along the indonesian surf coast in general the probability ratios for low wave conditions are stronger than for high wave conditions reflecting the slightly weaker negative thresholds for low wave occurrence 1 5 2 0 m at mid latitudes compared with high wave occurrence 2 0 2 5 m 4 summary and concluding remarks this paper assesses the impact of the sam on global ocean wind waves during each of the four temperate zone seasons using 30 years of high resolution wave data from the cawcr wave hindcast anomalies in hs tp and cge show a strong and significant response over the southern hemisphere extratropics year round concomitant with the strong zonal wind signature of the sam in regions dominated by mean westerlies increases in hs of up to 1 m occur concurrently with westerly anomalies while negative hs anomalies of similar magnitude occur concurrently with easterly anomalies wave impacts occur around the australian coast at various times of year with amplitudes of 0 3 0 4 m off the southwest coast year round 0 1 0 2 m on the northwest australian shelf in son and djf and 0 1 0 2 m along the east coast in jja and djf the tasmanian coast experiences wave impacts primarily from higher latitudes in mam and jja which extend also into the great australian bight in mam tp and zonal cge anomalies broadly reflect the sam zonal wind signal in directly forcing surface waves primarily in the mid high latitudes of the southern hemisphere moreover the increase in tp towards the eastern pacific and the in phase variation of tp with hs suggest the wave anomalies are primarily generated by an increase in contribution from the swell component of the wave spectrum the strength of tp anomalies varies with the zonal wind fetch over the southern ocean and the strongest impact on tp anomalies around the australian coast is on the northwest shelf with amplitudes up to around 2 s approximately half of the climatological mean surface wind and wave variables offer a useful climate diagnostic for resolving a remote teleconnection to the northern hemisphere extratropics in djf when an atmospheric signal emerges resembling a tropically forced rossby wave train this has a significant impact on surface waves in the central north pacific and north atlantic oceans where anomalies of up to 0 3 0 4 m around 5 10 of the mean amplitude occur for hs 0 4 s about 5 of the mean amplitude for tp and 30 kw m 1 about 30 of the mean amplitude for zonal cge the zonal wind patterns suggest anticyclonic cyclonic responses over the central north pacific ocean anticyclonic during positive sam and north atlantic ocean cyclonic during positive sam these remote signals amplify significantly when we exclude el niño and la niña years from the analysis indicating that enso plays a key role in offsetting the link between the sam and northern hemisphere winter climate this appears to be related to a weakening of zonal wind divergence anomalies over the tropical pacific ocean when the sam is strong during active enso years importantly this remote link to the sam occurs independent of enso via changes to the tropical atmospheric circulation hadley cell consistent with recent studies the sam also imposes a strong and significant influence on the occurrence of low and high wave conditions defined when hs anomalies are below the 5th percentile and above the 95th percentile respectively in general significant increases in the likelihood of high wave conditions and decreases in the likelihood of low wave conditions correspond to regions where the sam induces positive hs anomalies notably a two fold increase in the probability of high wave conditions occurs in the australian region again the impact of the sam extends to the central north pacific and north atlantic ocean concurrent with hs anomalies the modulation of surface wave activity by the sam presented here supports the results of a similar analysis for the madden julian oscillation by marshall et al 2015 in suggesting potential predictability of global wave variations on the subseasonal timescale which could have tremendous practical benefit good progress has been made in improving the depiction of the sam in global forecast models and predictability of the sam has been demonstrated out to lead times approaching three weeks e g marshall et al 2012 climatologically driven changes in the wave climate are increasingly being recognized as a key influence on coastal erosion and accretion patterns and consequent shoreline position for the world s coasts e g barnard et al 2015 similarly coastal engineers are beginning to consider pre emptive coastal management options to limit damage to storm wave events davidson et al 2017 subseasonal predictability of surface wave variations associated with the sam and other climate drivers has the potential to provide coastal managers with sufficient and timely information that could enable them to make decisions that could protect or limit coastal communities and infrastructure from severe wave damage thus subseasonal predictability of surface wave variations resulting from the sam should now be investigated acknowledgements this study was supported through funding from the earth system and climate change hub of the australian government s national environmental science programme as part of the coastal hazards project 2 10 our global ocean surface wave data was generated as part of the pacific australia climate change science and adaptation planning paccsap program we thank dr tom durrant for work on a previous manuscript using this data and the anonymous journal reviewers for providing helpful comments and suggestions
