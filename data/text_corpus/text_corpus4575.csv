22875,antarctic krill euphausia superba is one of the most abundant commercial species in the world and still has great potential for further development and utilization it is however very important that the resource is utilized in a sustainable manner in terms of efficiency and selectivity which can be enhanced through proper design of pelagic trawls that are used for harvesting the species pelagic trawls rely heavily on hydrodynamic forces acting on the netting to form desirable shapes it is thus crucial to understand hydrodynamic forces acting on the trawl to predict its performance a large antarctic krill trawl with a net opening circumference of 200 m was designed for a fishing vessel 2855 kw and analyzed by numerical simulation and physical model tests a numerical model of antarctic krill trawl was established based on the finite element method the principle of minimum potential energy was employed to determine the equilibrium configuration and the tension distribution of the trawl in a uniform current the newton raphson method was applied to solve the equilibrium equation a series of physical model tests were conducted in a flume tank to verify the result from numerical simulation the results showed that the trawl with a net opening circumference of 200 m had superior hydrodynamic performance and could be well matched with fishing vessels of the class for the efficient production of antarctic krill this paper demonstrates the use of scientific methods for the design of large antarctic krill trawls and the application of numerical simulation to study the hydrodynamic performance keywords antarctic krill trawl numerical simulation physical model test 1 introduction antarctic krill euphausia superba is one of the most abundant fishery resources in the world it is estimated that its biomass can reach 100 million tons atkinson et al 2009 with the landing of about 300 000 tons in recent years nicol and foster 2016 it remains one of the largest underexploited stocks in the world nicol et al 2012 therefore there are potentials for further development and utilization antarctic krill is rich in protein and fat and is the largest renewable animal protein bank krill oil is of high quality with the effect of preventing disease and enhancing immune system costanzo et al 2016 sustainable utilization with sound management will ensure its long term contribution to the supply of healthy seafood or premium feed for cultured animals both are essential for a growing world population antarctic krill is a mesopelagic species therefore pelagic trawl is the mainly fishing gear for harvesting the species commercial harvesting of antarctic krill started in the 1970s mainly by the former ussr japan republic of korea and more recently by norway and china nicol and foster 2016 norway has dominated landing of antarctic krill since 2010 in 2014 norway landed about 166 000 tons of krill about 58 of total landing followed by republic of korea and china nicol and foster 2016 chinese vessels started fishing for antarctic krill in 2009 lack of knowledge about distribution of the resources and poor design of the trawl have led to low catch rates low catch quality and poor financial returns there are many issues with trawls used by chinese vessels for example large drag force of the trawl mismatching between fishing gear and fishing vessel longer time for hauling the net due to long length of body net net breaking and low spread of the net opening these issues result in higher fuel consumption which contributes to greenhouse gas emission and increases cost of operation poor product quality which results in low value and suboptimal prices and lower catch rates better design of the krill trawl would contribute to better resource utilization higher value from the resource and lower environmental impact from the fishing operation we therefore undertook a study to improve the performance of the pelagic trawl for the chinese krill fleet both japanese eight panel trawl 272 m circumference of net opening 143 m length of net and korean four panel trawl 252 m 125 m have been used in the long da fishing vessel it is said that the low production and quality of catch are resulted from the slower towing speeds and longer hauling time because these two trawls were too large and the body nets were too long in our study a new four panel trawl 200 m 114 m was designed with smaller circumference and shorter body net the methods for studying hydrodynamic performance of fishing gear include model testing numerical simulation and full scale tests at sea nguyen et al 2015 many researchers have designed and improved trawls and studied its hydrodynamic performance wan et al 2002a used the finite element method to analyze the static response of fishing nets and ropes in a uniform current solving the nonlinear equilibrium equation of flexible gear structure and calculating equilibrium configuration and tension distribution of longlines plane nets and gillnets in a uniform flow the accuracy of the numerical method was then verified by flume tank experiments wan et al 2002b 2004 priour 2009 developed a numerical tool dedicated to the automatic optimization of the trawl design based on a finite element method for flexible netting structures in order to reduce the drag per swept area two methods of optimization of the trawl design have been compared priour and khaled 2009 the hydrodynamic performance analysis and optimization of antarctic krill trawl were carried out by means of model tests feng et al 2012 xu et al 2015 li et al 2017 a novel numerical optimization technique using spatial fish distribution consisting of modifying the design of all panels of the trawl was presented and adapted to minimize an objective function of the drag to mouth area ratio khaled et al 2012 khaled et al 2013 then applied a numerical method for optimization of the cable lengths in trawls with respect to the ratio between the estimated trawl drag and the predicted catch efficiency in this paper a new antarctic krill trawl was designed with potential application by chinese krill trawlers in the antarctic its hydrodynamic performance was studied by means of numerical simulation and model tests in a flume tank in addition the simulated results were compared with the experimental results in order to assess the validity of numerical simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 numerical method 2 1 1 modelling of the elements of an antarctic krill trawl an antarctic krill trawl system is made up of nets cables and other gear components such as otter boards because of limitations in the size of the flume tank described below the trawl model in this study did not include otter boards the net is considered as a regular articulated structure that is composed of a large number of mesh bars the cable can be divided into several segments both mesh bars and cable segments are considered as straight discrete elements fig 1 thus the whole trawl system is discretized into finite elements wang and shao 1997 if we call each end of the element a node accordingly the trawl can be modelled as an assemble of the discrete elements articulated at their nodes wan et al 2004 2 1 2 basic equations when the trawl moves in water at a constant speed or is set in a uniform current its elements will incur significant relative displacement from any initial state to the deformed state according to the above hypotheses the total potential energy π for the discrete trawl system can be expressed as follows wan et al 2004 1 i 1 f f i d i g 1 m t g l g d i l g 0 g 1 m l g 0 2 e a g t g 2 where f i is the equivalent nodal load on the ith node d i is the nodal displacement of the ith node t g is the axial force of the gth element l g0 is the initial length of the gth element l g d i is the length of the gth element after deformation a g is cross section area of the gth element e is the young s modulus of the material f is the nodal degree of freedom and m is the number of the element on the right side of eq 1 the first term represents the load potential energy of the structure the second term represents the strain energy of the axial force and the third term represents the work done by the axial force cui 2005 e a g and l g0 in eq 1 are constants during the movement of the trawl system both d i and t g are unknown and l g d i and f i are functions of d i and t g wan et al 2004 as stated in the previous work wan et al 2002a for the purpose of determining the equilibrium configuration of the antarctic krill trawl system the principle of the minimum potential energy is applied according to the principle the total potential energy becomes an absolute minimum when the system is under equilibrium state i e π d i 0 and π t g 0 in order to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equation the newton raphson method was adopted wan et al 2002a firstly the drag of elements was calculated under the assumed equilibrium shape of the trawl and keep it constant with this constant drag an iterative equilibrium state can be obtained by newton raphson iterative scheme secondly the drag was updated under the iterative equilibrium state and the iterative scheme was run again with the updated drag finally the desired solution i e real equilibrium state can be converged by such iterating calculation 2 1 3 hydrodynamic loading models in eq 1 the external forces acting on the elements include those resulting from gravity weight and buoyancy hydrodynamic loads and other external forces the hydrodynamic load is calculated by the hydrodynamic loading model which is the truss model the cross flow principle is applied hoerner 1965 as shown in fig 2 the current velocity v is divided into two components the normal component v n and the tangential component v t the normal drag coefficient c n and the tangential drag coefficient c t are calculated as follows choc and casarella 1971 2 c n 1 1 4 r e n 0 50 30 r e n 2 33 10 5 3 c t π μ 0 55 r e n 1 2 0 084 r e n 2 3 c n and c t are calculated according to reynolds number re n where re n ρv n d μ ρ is the density of fluid d is the diameter of the element μ is the coefficient of fluid viscosity the normal hydrodynamic load f n of the truss model is calculated as 4 f n 1 2 c n ρ d l v n v n where l is the length of the element the tangential hydrodynamic load f t is calculated similarly 2 2 physical model test 2 2 1 design of the antarctic krill trawl the antarctic krill trawl is designed for the target vessel f v long da of china national fisheries corp with the main engine power of 2855 kw and towed at 2 to 3 kn the main characteristic parameters of the vessel are given in table 1 assuming that 20 of engine power will be available to tow the trawl a four panel diamond mesh antarctic krill trawl of 200 m 114 m was designed the ratio of the net length to the circumference of the net opening was 57 it is believed that a trawl with a ratio of about 55 has a better spreading performance a 1 25 scale λ 25 model of the trawl was manufactured based on tauti s law with the small scale ratio λ 5 the expanded view of the trawl model is shown in fig 3 main specification and parameters of full scale trawl and model trawl are provided in table 2 2 2 2 setup of flume model test a series of physical model tests were conducted at the flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology japan the size of the flume tank was 22 m length 8 35 m width 3 05 m height the basic setup of the flume model test is shown in fig 4 the end of leg where top and bottom legs joined was connected to the tension meter which was fixed on a rod and the space between the tension meters was set to 1 8m in order to set the horizontal spreading ratio the ratio of horizontal distance of wingend to length of ground rope to 50 floats were added to the headline and weights were suspended at the lower wingends the towing speed of the trawl was set to 1 5 3 5 kn full scale at 0 5 kn intervals to cover the full range of operational speeds the full scale towing speed was converted to the flow velocity of flume experiment model speed according to tauti s law 2 3 data processing a trawl is towed by a fishing vessel therefore the energy efficiency of the trawler is very important in this paper energy efficiency is expressed by the coefficient of energy consumption c e representing the energy consumed by filtering water of unit volume when trawling which was calculated by the following formula xu 2004 5 c e 3 472 f h w where f is the drag force of the trawl net h is the height of net opening w is the horizontal distance of wingend it was easy to find that the higher the coefficient of energy consumption was the lower the energy efficiency could be 3 results 3 1 drag force fig 5 shows the calculated drag forces from numerical simulation and the measured drag force from flume tank and converted to the full scale in both cases the drag force increased with the square of the towing speed at the towing speed of 3 kn the drag force of the trawl was about 230 kn it can be seen that the calculated drag force and the measured drag force are very similar with slightly larger differences about 11 at lower towing speeds overall there was an average relative error of about 5 2 between the experimental values and the calculated values within the speed range from 1 5 to 3 5 kn 3 2 in pull force in pull force which would correspond to the lift force of otter boards at equilibrium is the inward pulling force acting at the end of the leg fig 6 showed the in pull forces from model tests and numerical simulations with the increase of towing speed the in pull force increased almost linearly the in pull force of the trawl was about 18 kn at towing speed of 3 kn the differences between the experimental values and the simulated values were relatively large about 7 at higher towing speeds the mean difference between the experimental values and the simulated values was about 4 5 3 3 headline height headline height or the height of net opening refers to the vertical distance between the midpoints of headline and ground rope the experimental values and simulated values of headline height are presented in fig 7 it can be seen that the headline height decreased with the increase of towing speed at the towing speed of 3 kn the headline height of net opening was about 15 m and the vertical spreading ratio the ratio of headline height to circumference of net opening was about 7 5 when the towing speed was low the simulated value was greater than the experimental value with a difference of about 11 at the highest towing speed 3 5 kn the simulated value was slightly lower than the experimental value overall the mean difference was about 7 2 3 4 coefficient of energy consumption the coefficients of energy consumption from numerical simulations and model tests are shown in fig 8 the coefficient of energy consumption increased with the square of the towing speed the higher the towing speed the greater the coefficient of energy consumption when towing speed was 3 kn the coefficient of energy consumption was about 3 kw h 104m3 1 when the towing speed was relatively low the error between the experimental value and the simulated value was relatively large about 14 the simulated results were generally close to the experimental results and the average relative error was about 10 6 3 5 shape and tension distribution of antarctic krill trawl shape and tension distribution of the trawl model at different incoming velocities are shown in fig 9 the trawl generally looked like a uniform cone as the incoming velocity increased the overall position of the trawl moved back with legs showing as straight lines and the angle between legs getting smaller both headline and ground rope showed catenary shapes at low velocity the headline moved up significantly and as the velocity increased the headline moved down and back with the increase of the velocity the trawl mouth opening gradually declined the part of net body presented as a conical shape while the codend presented as a cylindrical shape the tension of net body and codend of the trawl model was smaller the tension of belly line was greater and the tension of the front part of belly line was greater than that of the back part the tension of leg was the greatest with that of the top leg greater than the bottom leg 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper a large antarctic krill trawl 200 m 114 m was designed for f v long da with the main engine power of 2855 kw and its hydrodynamic performance was studied on the basis of flume tank model experiment the numerical simulation was carried out by using the finite element method the accuracy of the numerical simulation was verified by comparing the experimental results from flume tank tests with the numerical simulation results through flume tank tests we obtained hydrodynamic performance and characteristics of the new trawl when towing speed was 3 kn the drag force was about 230 kn and the in pull force was about 18 kn at that towing speed the vertical spreading ratio was about 7 5 and the coefficient of energy consumption was about 3 kw h 104m3 1 at this point the towing force of the vessel was about 280 kn matching the drag force of the trawl fairly well considering additional towing power required for otter boards and towing warps antarctic krill trawl otter boards usually have a large aspect ratio and its lift coefficient is about 1 2 in the working range of angles of attack liu et al 2015 it was estimated that the area of otter board required would be about 15 m2 the smaller the in pull force the smaller the required size of the otter boards which would be beneficial to reducing drag of the trawl system the coefficient of energy consumption of an antarctic krill trawl with similar main dimensions was about 3 5 kw h 104m3 1 at the towing speed of 3 kn and vertical spreading ratio was about 7 5 when horizontal spreading ratio was about 50 xu et al 2015 in other words the antarctic krill trawl we designed had superior hydrodynamic performance and would be beneficial when applied to commercial fishing operations the simulated results of the antarctic krill trawl hydrodynamic performance were very close to the experimental results from the flume tank the average relative error between drag forces from flume tank model tests and numerical simulations was about 5 2 while that for the in pull forces was about 4 5 similarly the average relative error between heights of net opening from flume model tests and numerical simulations was about 7 2 the average differences between coefficients of energy consumption from flume tank model tests and numerical simulations was about 10 6 greater at lower towing speeds the discrepancies between the simulated results and experimental results might have arisen from the following sources that were difficult to avoid and control a the current velocity was not perfectly uniform in the flume tank moe et al 2010 b the error could be caused by the numerical method such as the differences between the real net wire and the truss c other possible sources include the setting of the trawl and the system might have been slightly tilted or the measurement error of instruments the shape and tension distribution of the antarctic krill trawl calculated by numerical simulation provide us opportunity to examine more closely on the shape and tension of the net cable and other parts which made up the trawl system such as net stacking netting deformation or tension concentration which are related to net and cable breaking and fishing performance the distribution of tension in the newly designed net was uniform and the shape of the trawl was smooth with no mutation occurred when the velocity was changed the tensions of the net ran toward the wingends along the belly line directly and then was transferred along the legs to the otter boards the tensions of bottom leg and belly line were greater therefore it is suggested that thicker cables and ropes be used for these components in addition the gore ropes of the codend should also be thickened because they will bear larger pulling forces when hauling with a large catch numerical simulation can accurately predict the experimental results and can also achieve the outcomes that cannot be obtained from model tests more importantly the use of computer based numerical modelling and simulation is encouraged during the early stages of design for validating design concepts as a fast and convenient method nguyen et al 2015 we therefore conclude that the numerical simulation described in this paper can provide scientific guidance for further optimization of the design for antarctic krill trawls acknowledgements the study was supported by the development of antarctic krill trawl project 20150256 of china national fisheries corp china and the physical model test of the trawl was conducted at the flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology japan

m 114 m was designed for f v long da with the main engine power of 2855 kw and its hydrodynamic performance was studied on the basis of flume tank model experiment the numerical simulation was carried out by using the finite element method the accuracy of the numerical simulation was verified by comparing the experimental results from flume tank tests with the numerical simulation results through flume tank tests we obtained hydrodynamic performance and characteristics of the new trawl when towing speed was 3 kn the drag force was about 230 kn and the in pull force was about 18 kn at that towing speed the vertical spreading ratio was about 7 5 and the coefficient of energy consumption was about 3 kw h 104m3 1 at this point the towing force of the vessel was about 280 kn matching the drag force of the trawl fairly well considering additional towing power required for otter boards and towing warps antarctic krill trawl otter boards usually have a large aspect ratio and its lift coefficient is about 1 2 in the working range of angles of attack liu et al 2015 it was estimated that the area of otter board required would be about 15 m2 the smaller the in pull force the smaller the required size of the otter boards which would be beneficial to reducing drag of the trawl system the coefficient of energy consumption of an antarctic krill trawl with similar main dimensions was about 3 5 kw h 104m3 1 at the towing speed of 3 kn and vertical spreading ratio was about 7 5 when horizontal spreading ratio was about 50 xu et al 2015 in other words the antarctic krill trawl we designed had superior hydrodynamic performance and would be beneficial when applied to commercial fishing operations the simulated results of the antarctic krill trawl hydrodynamic performance were very close to the experimental results from the flume tank the average relative error between drag forces from flume tank model tests and numerical simulations was about 5 2 while that for the in pull forces was about 4 5 similarly the average relative error between heights of net opening from flume model tests and numerical simulations was about 7 2 the average differences between coefficients of energy consumption from flume tank model tests and numerical simulations was about 10 6 greater at lower towing speeds the discrepancies between the simulated results and experimental results might have arisen from the following sources that were difficult to avoid and control a the current velocity was not perfectly uniform in the flume tank moe et al 2010 b the error could be caused by the numerical method such as the differences between the real net wire and the truss c other possible sources include the setting of the trawl and the system might have been slightly tilted or the measurement error of instruments the shape and tension distribution of the antarctic krill trawl calculated by numerical simulation provide us opportunity to examine more closely on the shape and tension of the net cable and other parts which made up the trawl system such as net stacking netting deformation or tension concentration which are related to net and cable breaking and fishing performance the distribution of tension in the newly designed net was uniform and the shape of the trawl was smooth with no mutation occurred when the velocity was changed the tensions of the net ran toward the wingends along the belly line directly and then was transferred along the legs to the otter boards the tensions of bottom leg and belly line were greater therefore it is suggested that thicker cables and ropes be used for these components in addition the gore ropes of the codend should also be thickened because they will bear larger pulling forces when hauling with a large catch numerical simulation can accurately predict the experimental results and can also achieve the outcomes that cannot be obtained from model tests more importantly the use of computer based numerical modelling and simulation is encouraged during the early stages of design for validating design concepts as a fast and convenient method nguyen et al 2015 we therefore conclude that the numerical simulation described in this paper can provide scientific guidance for further optimization of the design for antarctic krill trawls acknowledgements the study was supported by the development of antarctic krill trawl project 20150256 of china national fisheries corp china and the physical model test of the trawl was conducted at the flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology japan 
22876,in this paper a robust control scheme is developed for time varying formation of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with disturbances under input saturation firstly the reference trajectory of the follower is defined using a body fixed coordinate transformation based on the leader position and predetermined time varying formation next three new additional control terms are proposed to handle the input saturation and underactuation problems of auvs respectively on the basis of the above the robust formation control law is designed incorporating a disturbance observer into the dynamic surface control dsc method where the disturbance observer is constructed to online estimate unknown time varying disturbances the designed formation control law does not depend on the leader s acceleration due to using dsc and the mass matrix in the dynamic model of auvs is non diagonal which is more realistic strict stability analysis indicates that the designed robust formation control law can make auvs achieve the predefined time varying formation while guaranteeing uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals of the auv formation closed loop control systems simulation results on three auvs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control scheme keywords autonomous underwater vehicles additional control time varying formation control input saturation disturbance observer 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs play an important role in underwater operations such as ocean sampling mapping minesweeping and floor survey li et al 2015 yan and yu 2018 cui et al 2017 deploying multiple vehicles implies shorter time for completing these tasks and consequently cost saving formation control is a fundamental problem of multiple auv cooperation and is mainly divided into four approaches including behavior based balch and arkin 1998 jia and li 2007 virtual structure lewis and tan 1997 artificial potential field ge and fua 2005 fua et al 2007 and leader follower cui et al 2010 peng et al 2013 especially leader follower approach has drawn a lot of attention in recent years due to its simplicity and extendability edwards et al 2004 he et al 2018 xiang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 cui et al 2012 li and wang 2013 qi and cai 2016 2018 in the leader follower approach the leader tracks a predefined path and the followers maintain a desired geometric configuration with the leader a global leader can be designated and the group formation can be assigned based on the global leaders reference trajectory since auvs are always exposed to unpredictable and inevitable external environment disturbances their disturbance cancellation problem is crucial in the formation control design the related works can be found in qi 2014 peng et al 2014 2015 for fully actuated multiple auvs considering the composite disturbances consisting of unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances a robust adaptive coordinated tracking control scheme was proposed in qi 2014 where the adaptive robust control term was designed to compensated the disturbances for fully actuated multiple auvs with dynamic uncertainties and time varying disturbances a predictor based neural networks dynamic surface distributed coordinated control scheme peng et al 2014 and an observer based output feedback containment control scheme peng et al 2015 were presented respectively in both of which the bounds of disturbances together with dynamic uncertainties were approximated by neural network however auvs in practice are mostly underactuated which means that the number of their actuators are fewer than the degrees of freedom of their movement the formation control of multiple underactuated auvs has received a considerable amount of attentions ghommam and saad 2014 park 2015 huang et al 2016 in the presence of uncertain dynamics and bounded unknown disturbances ghommam et al ghommam and saad 2014 investigated a coordinated controller for a group of underactuated auvs where the adaptive technique was used to estimate unknown system parameters and the bound of disturbances and a coordinate transformation was introduced to overcome the control difficulty caused by underactuation of auvs in park 2015 an adaptive neural network formation controller was developed for multiple auvs with unknown hydrodynamic damping terms and bounded disturbances it should be noted that the additional control input together with a novel approach angle was introduced to solve the problem of underactuation huang et al 2016 proposed a sliding mode formation controller for multiple auvs subject to the ocean disturbances comparing with the aforementioned literature in the matter of disturbance cancellation the disturbance observer do based control has less conservativeness for the trajectory tracking problem of underactuated surface vessels with unknown time varying disturbances do 2010 proposed a robust tracking controller where the disturbances were estimated online by do and compensated in the control design simultaneously considering the modelling uncertainties and unknown time varying disturbances of underactuated auvs dai et al 2017 developed a do based neural network tracking controller in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances lu et al 2018 investigated the leader follower formation problem of multiple underactuated surface vessels a robust adaptive formation control scheme was presented using the minimal learning parameter algorithm and do on the other hand input saturation is a potential problem for the auv motion control system since the commanded control inputs calculated by the controller possibly exceed the constraints of the maximum forces and moment that the propulsion system can produce this would give rise to the degraded performance and even instability of the auv motion control system recently the input saturation problem has been extensively researched in the field of ocean engineering such as dynamic positioning of ship du et al 2016 trajectory tracking control of surface vessels zheng et al 2017 park et al 2017 chen et al 2009 path following of auv yu et al 2017 and formation control of auvs shojaei 2015 2016 li et al 2017 in the presence of input saturation and unknown disturbances for multiple underactuated auvs shojaei proposed a leader follower formation controller based on neural network in the horizonal plane shojaei 2015 and three dimension space shojaei 2016 respectively in both of which a generalized saturation function is introduced to reduce the risk of actuator saturation li et al 2017 investigated a leader follower formation controller the input saturation problem was handled using model predictive control method the aforementioned formation control involves a fixed formation configuration from a practical viewpoint considering the time varying formation configuration is more general and has the following benefits covering the greater part of complex environments collision avoidance the more flexible formation and less dependence on the leaders trajectory the time varying formation configuration is more popular in practice motivated by the above discussion a robust time varying formation control problem is investigated for underactuated auvs subject to unknown time varying disturbances under input saturation in this paper the main contributions lie in that 1 a novel additional control based on nussbaum function is proposed to handle the underactuation of auv such that the assumption on the passive boundedness of sway velocity in peng et al 2013 lu et al 2018 is discarded 2 the time varying formation control is achieved for underactuated auvs for the first time in the simultaneous presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input saturation 3 the unknown time varying disturbances are online estimated by the do and compensated in the control design such that the proposed robust formation control law has less conservativeness the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the problem formulation and preliminaries section 3 details the robust formation control design section 4 contains a simulation example to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme finally section 5 gathers concluding remarks about this work 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 autonomous underwater vehicle model we consider the time varying formation of auvs in the horizontal plane for constant depth applications such as seabed surveys neglecting the motions in heave roll and pitch the mathematical model of the auv can be described as cui et al 2010 1a η j ψ ν 1b m ν c ν ν d ν ν τ d t where η x y ψ t is the position vector of the auv in the earth fixed frame consisting of the position x y and yaw angle ψ 0 2 π ν u v r t is the velocity vector of the auv in the body fixed frame consisting of the surge velocity u the sway velocity v and the yaw

respectively j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 m m 11 0 0 0 m 22 m 23 0 m 23 m 33 c ν 0 0 m 22 v m 23 r 0 0 m 11 u m 22 v m 23 r m 11 u 0 d ν d 11 u 0 0 0 d 22 v r d 23 v r 0 d 32 v r d 33 v r m

includes a non diagonal item m 23 because the shapes and masses of auv bow and stern are always different m is the mass of the auv x u y v y r and n r are the added masses i z is the moment of inertia in yaw x u x u u y u y v v y v r y r v y r n v n v v n v r n r v and n r are referred to as hydrodynamic derivatives x g is the x coordinate of the auv center of gravity in the body fixed frame τ τ u 0 τ r t is the control input vector consisting of the surge force the sway force which is zero due to the underactuation of the auv and the yaw moment in practice the control forces and moment are subject to saturation nonlinearities due to the physical limitations of thrusters which can be described as follows 2 τ i τ m i if τ c i τ m i τ m i if τ c i τ m i τ c i otherwise i u r where τ m u and τ m r represent the saturation limits herein we define τ c τ c u 0 τ c r t as the command control signal to be designed later notate δ τ τ c τ representing the inconsistency between the command and the actual control signals d t d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t t is the composite disturbance vector accounting for unmodeled dynamics and unknown environmental disturbances assumption 1 the composite disturbance d i i 1 2 3 is bounded yet unknown time varying and there exists 3 d t p with p being an unknown positive constant remark 1 in practice the environmental disturbances are always changing unpredictable and limited in energy the disturbances acting on the auvs can be viewed as the unknown bounded yet unknown time varying signals with the finite changing rates the unmodeled dynamics of auvs which refers to the fidelity of the dynamic model usually exists here they are lumped together as the composite disturbances 2 2 state transformation note that the yaw moment control acts directly on the sway dynamics because the matrix m includes a non diagonal item m 23 this will cause the difficulty in the control design in order to overcome this problem we introduce the following state transformation park 2015 do 2010 4 x x m 23 m 22 cos ψ y y m 23 m 22 sin ψ v v m 23 m 22 r then the auv mathematical model 1 can be transformed as 5 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r 6 u f

trajectory η r of the follower v f is shifted by the predefined time varying distance l l f and angle γ l f relative to the trajectory η l of the leader as shown in fig 1 cui et al 2010 then a formation control problem is changed into a tracking control problem the control objective in this paper is to design a robust time varying formation control law for the auvs in the presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input saturation under assumption 1 such that the follower v f can track the leader v l with the predefined time varying distance l l f and angle γ l f the trajectory η l of the leader and its first two time derivatives are bounded the time varying distance l l f and angle γ l f and their first two time derivatives are bounded 2 4 preliminaries

predetermined time varying formation 17 x r x l l l f cos γ l f ψ l y r y l l l f sin γ l f ψ l ψ r ψ l then we design the tracking control law such that the trajectory η f x f y f ψ f t of the

approach angle park et al 2017 given by 19 ψ α atan y e x e tanh x e 2 y e 2 δ ψ r 1 tanh x e 2 y e 2 δ where δ is a positive design constant in contrast to ghommam and saad 2014 ji et al 2007 herein the approach angle does not contain the auv velocity data according to 3 4 6 and 18 one gets 20a x e u f cos ψ f v f sin ψ f u l cos ψ l v l sin ψ l l l f γ l f r l sin γ l f ψ l l l f cos γ l f ψ l

proposed to deal with input saturation the additional control term t λ 2 in 24b is proposed to handle the underactuation of the auv which not only eliminates the necessity to separately prove the stability of sway dynamics but also discard the assumption that the sway velocity is passive bounded remark 4 a similar study using the additional control can be found in park et al 2017 however in this paper we introduce the nussbaum function to the additional control t λ i by means of the auxiliary dynamic system 25 as a result the challenge of the boundedness analysis of λ i is easily solved

auvs are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust formation control scheme the detailed dynamic parameters of the auv are obtained from park 2015 the saturation limits of the control inputs of the auv are listed in table 1 in order to illustrate that the proposed control scheme can make the auvs achieve arbitrary time varying formation and is robust to disturbances we do simulations in the following two cases case 1 we consider three auvs shape a formation in the formation setup one auv is viewed as leader to generate the trajectory of the leader the control inputs for the leader are chosen as follows 45 0 t 100 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 n m 100 t 150 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 01 n m 150 t 200 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 01 n m t 200 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 n m the composite

followers trajectories in horizontal plane which indicates that the formation is well established fig 2 b shows the errors of the followers positions and the reference trajectories which indicates that the leader and the followers can achieve predetermined formation with satisfactory control performance the corresponding control inputs are plotted in fig 2 c which shows that they are bounded and reasonable fig 2 d and e show that the estimates for bounded unknown time varying disturbances are satisfactory fig 2 f and g show the variations of nussbaum gains n χ i and parameters χ i respectively which are also bounded it is obviously seen from the simulation results that the designed robust formation control law for the underactuated auvs in the presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input saturation achieve the satisfactory formation control performance case 2 the initial conditions and control law design parameters are the same as those in case 1 the control input for the leader is chosen as 47 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 n m the desired time varying distance and relative angle between the leader and the followers are taken as l l f 1 10 sin 0 1 t m γ l f 1 π 2

sin π 8 t n m the simulation results are presented using solid lines in fig 3 a g it can be seen that the developed robust time varying formation control law exhibits satisfactory control performance for predetermined time varying formation of auvs under inputs saturation and has the good robustness against unknown time varying disturbances remark 5 in the simulations we firstly choose the design

system is stable further we properly regulate the other design parameters γ i ϑ i γ χ p u and p r satisfying positive to get the satisfactory control performance the chosen design parameters could affect the results of simulations an amount of simulations done in many scenarios show that the larger the parameters k 1 k 2 k 3 k 0 γ i and γ χ are the better the control accuracy is while the

22876,in this paper a robust control scheme is developed for time varying formation of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with disturbances under input saturation firstly the reference trajectory of the follower is defined using a body fixed coordinate transformation based on the leader position and predetermined time varying formation next three new additional control terms are proposed to handle the input saturation and underactuation problems of auvs respectively on the basis of the above the robust formation control law is designed incorporating a disturbance observer into the dynamic surface control dsc method where the disturbance observer is constructed to online estimate unknown time varying disturbances the designed formation control law does not depend on the leader s acceleration due to using dsc and the mass matrix in the dynamic model of auvs is non diagonal which is more realistic strict stability analysis indicates that the designed robust formation control law can make auvs achieve the predefined time varying formation while guaranteeing uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals of the auv formation closed loop control systems simulation results on three auvs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control scheme keywords autonomous underwater vehicles additional control time varying formation control input saturation disturbance observer 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs play an important role in underwater operations such as ocean sampling mapping minesweeping and floor survey li et al 2015 yan and yu 2018 cui et al 2017 deploying multiple vehicles implies shorter time for completing these tasks and consequently cost saving formation control is a fundamental problem of multiple auv cooperation and is mainly divided into four approaches including behavior based balch and arkin 1998 jia and li 2007 virtual structure lewis and tan 1997 artificial potential field ge and fua 2005 fua et al 2007 and leader follower cui et al 2010 peng et al 2013 especially leader follower approach has drawn a lot of attention in recent years due to its simplicity and extendability edwards et al 2004 he et al 2018 xiang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 cui et al 2012 li and wang 2013 qi and cai 2016 2018 in the leader follower approach the leader tracks a predefined path and the followers maintain a desired geometric configuration with the leader a global leader can be designated and the group formation can be assigned based on the global leaders reference trajectory since auvs are always exposed to unpredictable and inevitable external environment disturbances their disturbance cancellation problem is crucial in the formation control design the related works can be found in qi 2014 peng et al 2014 2015 for fully actuated multiple auvs considering the composite disturbances consisting of unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances a robust adaptive coordinated tracking control scheme was proposed in qi 2014 where the adaptive robust control term was designed to compensated the disturbances for fully actuated multiple auvs with dynamic uncertainties and time varying disturbances a predictor based neural networks dynamic surface distributed coordinated control scheme peng et al 2014 and an observer based output feedback containment control scheme peng et al 2015 were presented respectively in both of which the bounds of disturbances together with dynamic uncertainties were approximated by neural network however auvs in practice are mostly underactuated which means that the number of their actuators are fewer than the degrees of freedom of their movement the formation control of multiple underactuated auvs has received a considerable amount of attentions ghommam and saad 2014 park 2015 huang et al 2016 in the presence of uncertain dynamics and bounded unknown disturbances ghommam et al ghommam and saad 2014 investigated a coordinated controller for a group of underactuated auvs where the adaptive technique was used to estimate unknown system parameters and the bound of disturbances and a coordinate transformation was introduced to overcome the control difficulty caused by underactuation of auvs in park 2015 an adaptive neural network formation controller was developed for multiple auvs with unknown hydrodynamic damping terms and bounded disturbances it should be noted that the additional control input together with a novel approach angle was introduced to solve the problem of underactuation huang et al 2016 proposed a sliding mode formation controller for multiple auvs subject to the ocean disturbances comparing with the aforementioned literature in the matter of disturbance cancellation the disturbance observer do based control has less conservativeness for the trajectory tracking problem of underactuated surface vessels with unknown time varying disturbances do 2010 proposed a robust tracking controller where the disturbances were estimated online by do and compensated in the control design simultaneously considering the modelling uncertainties and unknown time varying disturbances of underactuated auvs dai et al 2017 developed a do based neural network tracking controller in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances lu et al 2018 investigated the leader follower formation problem of multiple underactuated surface vessels a robust adaptive formation control scheme was presented using the minimal learning parameter algorithm and do on the other hand input saturation is a potential problem for the auv motion control system since the commanded control inputs calculated by the controller possibly exceed the constraints of the maximum forces and moment that the propulsion system can produce this would give rise to the degraded performance and even instability of the auv motion control system recently the input saturation problem has been extensively researched in the field of ocean engineering such as dynamic positioning of ship du et al 2016 trajectory tracking control of surface vessels zheng et al 2017 park et al 2017 chen et al 2009 path following of auv yu et al 2017 and formation control of auvs shojaei 2015 2016 li et al 2017 in the presence of input saturation and unknown disturbances for multiple underactuated auvs shojaei proposed a leader follower formation controller based on neural network in the horizonal plane shojaei 2015 and three dimension space shojaei 2016 respectively in both of which a generalized saturation function is introduced to reduce the risk of actuator saturation li et al 2017 investigated a leader follower formation controller the input saturation problem was handled using model predictive control method the aforementioned formation control involves a fixed formation configuration from a practical viewpoint considering the time varying formation configuration is more general and has the following benefits covering the greater part of complex environments collision avoidance the more flexible formation and less dependence on the leaders trajectory the time varying formation configuration is more popular in practice motivated by the above discussion a robust time varying formation control problem is investigated for underactuated auvs subject to unknown time varying disturbances under input saturation in this paper the main contributions lie in that 1 a novel additional control based on nussbaum function is proposed to handle the underactuation of auv such that the assumption on the passive boundedness of sway velocity in peng et al 2013 lu et al 2018 is discarded 2 the time varying formation control is achieved for underactuated auvs for the first time in the simultaneous presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input saturation 3 the unknown time varying disturbances are online estimated by the do and compensated in the control design such that the proposed robust formation control law has less conservativeness the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the problem formulation and preliminaries section 3 details the robust formation control design section 4 contains a simulation example to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme finally section 5 gathers concluding remarks about this work 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 autonomous underwater vehicle model we consider the time varying formation of auvs in the horizontal plane for constant depth applications such as seabed surveys neglecting the motions in heave roll and pitch the mathematical model of the auv can be described as cui et al 2010 1a η j ψ ν 1b m ν c ν ν d ν ν τ d t where η x y ψ t is the position vector of the auv in the earth fixed frame consisting of the position x y and yaw angle ψ 0 2 π ν u v r t is the velocity vector of the auv in the body fixed frame consisting of the surge velocity u the sway velocity v and the yaw

includes a non diagonal item m 23 because the shapes and masses of auv bow and stern are always different m is the mass of the auv x u y v y r and n r are the added masses i z is the moment of inertia

0 τ r t is the control input vector consisting of the surge force the sway force which is zero due to the underactuation of the auv and the yaw moment in practice the control forces and moment are subject to saturation nonlinearities due to the physical limitations of thrusters which can be described as follows 2 τ i τ m i if τ c i τ m i τ m i if τ c i τ m i τ c i otherwise i u r where τ m u and τ m r represent the saturation limits herein we define τ c τ c u 0 τ c r t as the command control signal to be designed later notate δ τ τ c τ representing the inconsistency between the command and the actual control signals d t d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t t is the composite disturbance vector accounting for unmodeled dynamics and unknown environmental disturbances assumption 1 the composite disturbance d i i 1 2 3 is bounded yet unknown time varying and there exists 3 d t p with p being an unknown positive constant remark 1 in practice the environmental disturbances are always changing unpredictable and limited in energy the disturbances acting on the auvs can be viewed as the unknown bounded yet unknown time varying signals with the finite changing rates the unmodeled dynamics of auvs which refers to the fidelity of the dynamic model usually exists here they are lumped together as the composite disturbances 2 2 state transformation note that the yaw moment control acts directly on the sway dynamics because the matrix m includes a non diagonal item m 23 this will cause the difficulty in the control design in order to overcome this problem we introduce the following state transformation park 2015 do 2010 4 x x m 23 m 22 cos ψ y y m 23 m 22 sin ψ v v m 23 m 22 r then the auv mathematical model 1 can be transformed as 5 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r 6 u f

trajectory η r of the follower v f is shifted by the predefined time varying distance l l f and angle γ l f relative to the trajectory η l of the leader as shown in fig 1 cui et al 2010 then a formation control problem is changed into a tracking control problem the control objective in this paper is to design a robust time varying formation control law for the auvs in the presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input saturation under assumption 1 such that the follower v f can track the leader v l with the predefined time varying distance l l f and angle γ l f the trajectory η l of the leader and its first two time derivatives are bounded the time varying distance l l f and angle γ l f and their first two time derivatives are bounded 2 4 preliminaries

proposed to deal with input saturation the additional control term t λ 2 in 24b is proposed to handle the underactuation of the auv which not only eliminates the necessity to separately prove the stability of sway dynamics but also discard the assumption that the sway velocity is passive bounded remark 4 a similar study using the additional control can be found in park et al 2017 however in

ultimately bounded for all v 0 b 0 hence the auv can follow the specified leader with the predefined time varying distance l l f and angle γ l f from 17 and 18 further it is known from 18 24 21 and

bounded from 25 thus all signals in the closed loop control system are uniformly ultimately bounded for all v 0 b 0 theorem 1 is proved 4 simulations in this section the simulation studies on three auvs are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust formation control scheme the detailed dynamic parameters of the auv are obtained from park 2015 the saturation limits of the control inputs of the auv are listed in table 1 in order to illustrate that the proposed control scheme can make the auvs achieve arbitrary time varying formation and is robust to disturbances we do simulations in the following two cases case 1 we consider three auvs shape a formation in the formation setup one auv is viewed as leader to generate the trajectory of the leader the control inputs for the leader are chosen as follows 45 0 t 100 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 n m 100 t 150 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 01 n m 150 t 200 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 01 n m t 200 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 n m the composite disturbance vector is chosen as 46 d t 0 1 sin 0 05 t π 3 0 05 sin π 10 t n 0 2 sin 0 04 t π 3 0 05 sin π 10 t n 0 2 sin 0 05 t π 3 0 1 sin π 10 t n m choose the initial states of the leader as η l 0 0 m 0 m π 4 rad t and υ l 0 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s t choose the initial states of the followers as η f 1 0 15 m 15 m 0 rad t υ f 1 0 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s t η f 2 0 15 m 15 m 0 rad t υ f 2 0 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s t the desired distance and relative angle between the leader and the followers are taken as l l f 1 5 m γ l f 1 π 2 rad l l f 2 5 m γ l f 2 π 2 rad control parameters and gains are selected as k 1 0 03 k 2 3 k 3 80 k 0 d i a g 2 2 2 γ 1 20 γ 2 30 γ 3 30 ϑ 1 40 ϑ 2 50 ϑ 3 40 γ χ 0 08 p u 8 and p r 8 the simulation results are plotted using solid lines in fig 2 a g fig 2 a shows the leader and followers trajectories in horizontal plane which indicates that the formation is well established fig 2 b shows the errors of the followers positions and the reference trajectories which indicates that the leader and the followers can achieve predetermined formation with satisfactory control performance the corresponding control inputs are plotted in fig 2 c which shows that they are bounded and reasonable fig 2 d and e show that the estimates for bounded unknown time varying disturbances are satisfactory fig 2 f and g show the variations of nussbaum gains n χ i and parameters χ i respectively which are also bounded it is obviously seen from the simulation results that the designed robust formation control law for the underactuated auvs in the presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input saturation achieve the satisfactory formation control performance case 2 the initial conditions and control law design parameters are the same as those in case 1 the control input for the leader is chosen as 47 τ u l 0 2 n τ r l 0 n m the desired time varying distance and relative angle between the leader and the followers are taken as l l f 1 10 sin 0 1 t m γ l f 1 π 2 rad l l f 2 10 sin 0 1 t m γ l f 2 π 2 rad the composite disturbance vector is chosen as 48 d t 0 1 0 1 sin 0 08 t π 2 0 05 sin π 8 t n 0 1 0 2 sin 0 04 t π 2 0 05 sin π 8 t n 0 2 sin 0 08 t π 2 0 1 sin π 8 t n m the simulation results are presented using solid lines in fig 3 a g it can be seen that the developed robust time varying formation control law exhibits satisfactory control performance for predetermined time varying formation of auvs under inputs saturation and has the good robustness against unknown time varying disturbances remark 5 in the simulations we firstly choose the design parameters k 1 k 2 k 3 and k 0 satisfying k 1 2 k 2 3 2 k 3 max 1 2 m 11 1 2 m 22 m 23 m 22 2 δ and λ min k 0 1 2 max 1 2 m 11 1 2 m 22 m 23 2 δ m 22 2 δ through the trial and error to ensure that the system is stable further we properly regulate the other design parameters γ i ϑ i γ χ p u and p r satisfying positive to get the satisfactory control performance the chosen design parameters could affect the results of simulations an amount of simulations done in many scenarios show that the larger the parameters k 1 k 2 k 3 k 0 γ i and γ χ are the better the control accuracy is while the larger the control signal is 5 conclusions simultaneously taking into account unknown time varying ocean disturbances and input saturation the problem of time varying formation control for multiple underactuated auvs has been solved in this paper a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate the compound disturbances induced unmodeled dynamic and ocean disturbances three new additional control terms are proposed to handle the input saturation and underactuation problems of auvs respectively stability analysis shows that uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed loop signals was

equations of motion to the irrotational flow past a rigid body in an ideal fluid lamb 1932 newman 1979 computation of the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on basic and simple geometries was possible but the added mass and inertial forces of complex geometries was a challenging problem for these approaches moreover the free water surface and viscous effects were not included in most of the calculations new advances in computer technology in the second half of the last century enabled us to manage such difficulties it has become possible to solve averaged momentum equations around the simple or complex geometries including viscous and free surface effects thus numerous computational applications have been conducted by the researchers which has brought the verification and validation problem lately researchers proposed several solution verification methods based on richardson extrapolation re technique which is helpful in determining the uncertainties in the computations numerical uncertainties as well as experimental uncertainty have frequently been included in the calculations yet ship model experiments have still been essential part of design when validation is concerned ship maneuvering experiments are generally separated into two categories free running model tests and captive model tests cmt lewis 1989 since the free running experiments are the primary concern of this study detailed information about the cmt will not be given but one can find them in the related reference free running tests are generally preferred for its quick response and being close to the real conditions it should be mentioned that local flow or the effects of individual parameters cannot be obtained by this type of experiments ankudinov 1993 in free running tests the geometrically similar ship model is equipped with a propulsion unit which is a stock propeller generally for the most part and control surfaces like the full scale ship then definite maneuvers e g turning circle zig zag spiral etc are performed using a remote controller device it is assumed that the scale effects are negligible so that full scale maneuvering characteristics are obtained a study was conducted by carrica et al 2013 to compute the standard maneuvers of a surface combatant at model and full scale the unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver cfdship iowa v4 was used in order to solve the fluid flow around the hull the ship model was free to 6dof degree of freedom motions which was achieved by employing the overset grid technique according to this technique the grid cells are classified into several types such as fringe hole donor etc the flow properties are transferred between overset region boundaries and background region cells benek et al 1986 carrica et al 2013 simulated two types of maneuvers turning circle with 35 rudder deflection and 20 20 zig zag test the simulations were performed at mid and high froude numbers using constant rpm propulsion corresponding to the self propulsion points differences between cfd computational fluid dynamics and experiments were found within 10 for both maneuvers they stated that urans computations of maneuvers are feasible however a realistic and sufficient propeller models remain to be solved they intended to implement a vortex lattice propeller code puf 14 to the cfdship iowa to provide much improved propeller modelling sadat hosseini et al 2015 assessed the capabilities of cfd and potential flow pf methods for course keeping of fully appended model 5415 in irregular waves they implemented the jonswap spectrum for various wave headings at a froude number of 0 248 cfd simulations were conducted with n 32 wave components while n 400 wave components were used for pf simulations the effects of wave component numbers were studied the results were validated against experimental data in terms of 6 dof degree of freedom motions and wave elevation the cfdship iowa v4 5 was used for the viscous flow simulations huang et al 2008 for pf simulations a non linear strip theory based code fredyn developed by the cooperative research navies crnav group was employed de kat and paulling 2001 a simplified body force method was used for the propeller by using the open water curves which were defined as a second order polynomial fit of the experimental kt j and kq j curves it was remarked that the trends versus wave headings for statistical results of the primary and secondary variables and raos were often well predicted by both cfd and pf large roll motions particularly for the case with passive fins at 105 wave heading were observed in near beam wave conditions shen et al 2015 implemented the dynamic overset grid technique into naoe foam sjtu solver developed by using open source code openfoam they stated that computational results were comparable with experimental data of resistance free surface elevation wake flow and self propulsion factor even though relatively coarse grids were used a grid convergence study also performed for the open water propeller tests of kp505 and bare hull kcs model carrica et al 2016 studied the kcs container ship on a zig zag maneuver in shallow water experimentally and numerically experiments were performed at flanders hydraulics research for the workshop on verification and validation of ship maneuvering simulation methods nmri 2015 the test conditions for both experiments and numerical simulations were fn 0 095 and h t 1 2 cfd simulations were carried out with directly discretized rudder and propeller they achieved good grid convergence in large grid uncertainties as well as time evolutions of different variables the standard deviations of repeated experiments were below 3 for all key variables of maneuvers it was clearly stated that cfd proved its capability of solving such highly complex problems and provided significant insight of the flow e g local velocity and pressure fields three dimensional vorticial structures etc wang et al 2017 used the naoe foam sjtu cfd solver to simulate the free running tests of onr tumblehome ship model simulations were performed using overset grid technique and 6dof module with twin actual rotating propellers and moving rudders the revolutions corresponding to the self propulsion points were computed in calm water at two different approach speeds their computational results were in good agreement with the benchmark data taken from tokyo 2015 cfd workshop in ship hydrodynamics nmri 2015 they achieved free running simulations under course keeping control but computational cost was still very high about two weeks to complete one simulation case they referred to simulate standard maneuvers e g turning circle and zigzag maneuvers in different heading waves as future works duman 2016 performed several cfd simulations using an unsteady rans solver software star ccm which was based on finite volume method to compute the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on a surface combatant model 5415 with 46 588 scale ratio during static pmm planar motion mechanism maneuvers e g static rudder pure drift and rudder drift computational results were used to obtain the maneuvering coefficients according to theoretical model abkowitz 1964 and validated with the available experimental data the free surface effects were included into the calculations and hull was assumed to be fixed during all computations it was demonstrated that urans approach was quite capable of capturing the integral values and free surface deformations even for coarser grids the results were used as input to a matlab code developed within this study to solve equations of motion the fast time simulations fts of turning circle and zig zag maneuvers were carried out and results were published in duman and bal 2017 in a following study the dynamic overset grid chimera technique has been implemented to simulate pure sway motion of the same ship model duman et al 2018 the computational results were validated with the experimental data in terms of hydrodynamic forces and moments and also hydrodynamic derivatives grid convergence study was conducted to calculate the uncertainty in the computations the comparison errors of sway acceleration terms were about 15 and 22 for medium grid quality which can be considered as acceptable results he is currently working on simulating other oscillatory pmm maneuvers such as pure yaw yaw drift etc and definite maneuvers in recent years system identification si methods which are mainly used to determine the maneuverability hydrodynamic coefficients have become very popular running numerous maneuvering simulations using cfd is very expensive araki et al 2012 conducted a study to examine which free running trial gives the best maneuvering coefficients using si thus the number of cfd simulations can be reduced they showed that several cfd free running simulations can be enough for maneuvering performance prediction than performing many numbers of captive model experiments another study for estimating parameters of practical ship maneuvering models was presented by bonci et al 2015 they combined the si procedure with the rans computations it was stated that the use of cfd in maneuvering simulations for si is very helpful in cfd a major problem noise in the recorded data can be much less than the experimental ones gavrilin and steen 2017 conducted a study to introduce the application of simplified auxiliary models metamodels for moderate turning motions of two ships two case studies were presented and vesim which is developed by the norwegian marine technology research institute marintek was used to validate the original maneuvering models ross 2008 they demonstrated the main application of metamodels in the generation of validation benchmarks from in service recorded data where the uncertainties were unknown except for wind it was stated that the metamodels can also be used for other applications such as correction of standard imo trials liu et al 2017 developed an integrated empirical model for maneuvering predictions of inland ships in the yangtze river they aimed to find the most suitable maneuvering model for such ships without performing extensive experimental tests the dynamic equations of motion they applied was described in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 it was concluded that the maneuvering characteristics of the reference inland vessels can roughly be captured by their model they emphasized the importance of initial conditions on the accuracy of maneuvering predictions the main objective of this study is to develop a new empirical formula that predicts the turning circle parameters tcps in a quick way the problem addressed here is to provide a correlation in which the performance parameters can be calculated depending on the ship advance speed and rudder deflection angle traditionally empirical formulas are derived by using the full scale sea trial or model test data obtained for a certain ship type designer may not always have these opportunities due to both economic and time constraints novelty of the presented method is that the empirical formulas are formed according to the results of cfd analyses today cfd method is known to be robust repeatable and reliable pre processing may take time e g discretization of the computational domain verification of the method validation etc however once this step is succeeded for a certain ship hydrodynamic analyses can easily be performed in this study several turning maneuver simulations have been performed in a range of 0 25 0 41 froude numbers and 10 35 rudder angles by using unsteady rans solver software dynamic overset grid technique has been used in the hydrodynamic analyses propulsion of the ship model during dms is achieved by using singular forces acting from the propeller position free surface effects have been taken into consideration a study for the verification and the validation of the computational method has been conducted empirical coefficients for the proposed model have been calculated by linear regression analysis empirical results have been compared with those of computed by cfd simulations the capability of the presented method has been discussed 2 mathematical background in the cartesian coordinate system the averaged continuity and momentum equations can be written in tensor notation as follows for an incompressible flow with constant viscosity coefficient and assuming there are no body forces acting on the hull

turbulence model realizable k ε is used to solve the reynolds stress term in the rans equations for turbulence model a wall function is implemented to calculate the velocity profiles near the no slip boundaries 2 1 choice of time step the time step has been determined according to the ittc cfd recommendations for transient solutions ittc 2011 ittc proposes the formula δ t 0 005 0 01 l b p v where lbp is the length between perpendiculars and v is the ship advance speed a verification study has been conducted in order to determine the uncertainty due to time step size 2 2 overset grid technique the grid embedding technique or dynamic overset grid enables the grid system to move freely with the moving rigid body in this study the computational domain is constructed using two main parts background and overset regions the flow data has been transmitted using embedded boundaries between these regions unlike the conventional boundaries overset region boundaries have the flexibility of arbitrary orientation without any deformation according to this technique the grid cells are classified into several types such as fringe hole donor etc the flow properties are transferred between overset region boundaries and background region cells benek et al 1986 2 3 grid resolution and boundary conditions there are two computational domains used in this study the first one is a conventional numerical towing tank with appropriate dimensions fig 1 and the second one is a numerical basin large enough to simulate realistically the turning maneuver simulations fig 2 front top and bottom faces are defined as velocity inlets where the multi phase fluid flows in ve x direction for the resistance prediction calculations port and starboard faces are assigned as symmetry planes the back face of the background domain is set to pressure outlet the hull surfaces are considered as no slip walls where the normal and tangential velocities of the fluid particles are both zero on the surfaces no slip condition there is a small difference between the boundary conditions of resistance prediction and turning circle simulations in the dms velocity of the multi phase fluid is set to zero at inlet faces during the turning simulations while the other boundary conditions remained the same since the ship is fixed in the resistance simulations the free surface deformations move rapidly along with the flow velocity to the lateral boundaries and the pressure outlet boundary of the computational domain where a damping function is necessary near the boundaries to prevent the computational errors but it is not needed for turning circle simulations therefore damping function which is generally used to suppress the free surface deformation near the boundaries is not enabled during turning circle simulations computational domain dimensions are given in table 1 in non dimensional form here upstream is in the ve x direction and starboard is in the ve y direction the other boundaries are explained on figs 1 and 2 the computational domain is subdivided into hexahedral elements by the finite volume method fvm grid refinements are done near the free water surface sonar dome and the wake zone fig 3 3 empirical approach for turning maneuver one of the most important factors that affects the turning performance of a surface ship is the advance speed these effects can be up to the second order or third order of the velocity at mid and relatively high froude numbers respectively in a turning motion rudder deflection angle becomes also very important within generally first order it is here assumed that the turning circle parameters tcps depends on the first order of the rudder deflection and second order of the ship advance speed eqn 4 4 a i j v i 2 b i j v i c i j δ i j t c p i j here v is the ship advance speed m s δ is the rudder deflection radian and a b and c are the constant coefficients computed from the linear regression analyses applied to the numerical results tcps can be defined as the steady turning diameter std tactical diameter tad advance or transfer values the present method is based on solving three by three linear algebraic equations where the unknowns are the empirical coefficients a b and c given in eqn 4 in the proposed empirical formula index i stands for the triple velocity combinations while j indicates the rudder deflection tables 14 15 e g let s take δ 28 which is j 2 in table 15 then the linear algebraic system for all velocity combinations will take form as follows 5 2 242 2 2 242 0 488 1 914 2 1 914 0 488

the right hand sides are set to std values of the related cases the augmented matrices of each three by three matrix are reduced to the row reduced echelon form by applying simple matrix operations in order to obtain the unknown coefficients this procedure is repeated for other rudder deflections j 1 2 3 4 and empirical coefficients are calculated four three by three matrices are created for one rudder deflection and all velocity combinations therefore four different values of each coefficient a b and c at one rudder deflection are obtained the arithmetic mean values of each coefficient are calculated at each rudder deflection eqn 6 6 a j i 1 4 a i j 4 b j i 1 4 b i j 4 j 1 2 3 4 c j i 1 4 c i j 4 since these coefficients change at every rudder deflection an expression is needed to calculate them depending on the rudder deflection a 3rd order polynomial function can be written for each coefficient eqn 7 7 a k 1 δ 3 k 2 δ 2 k 3 δ k 4 b l 1 δ 3 l 2 δ 2 l 3 δ l 4 c m 1 δ 3 m 2 δ 2 m 3 δ m 4 where k l and m are the constants obtained from polynomial curve fitting once a b and c are known any tcp value of the vessel at a random advance speed and rudder deflection can be calculated from the proposed formula eqn 4 note that those who apply this model will not only replace the advance speed and rudder angle but also recalculate the empirical coefficients a b c by using the polynomial functions eqn 7 it should be noted that when the right hand sides of the three by three matrices are set to std values as in the above example eqn 5 the empirical coefficients can only be used for std predictions this process can be repeated by changing the right hand sides of the three by three matrices with the corresponding turning circle simulation results for other tcp predictions 4 computational results a surface combatant model 5415 has been chosen for the hydrodynamic analyses 3 dimensional geometry is shown in fig 4 the scale ratio is 46 588 which is also known as 5512 in literature the model has a length of 3 048m and a draft of 0 132m other principal parameters are given in table 2 the main purpose for choosing this geometry is the availability of experimental data provided by the previous studies 4 1 verification three different solution verification methods based on richardson extrapolation re have been implemented to obtain uncertainties in the computations at 0 41 froude number the first one grid convergence index gci method was developed by roache 1994 while the other two methods were proposed by the study of correction factor cf stern et al 2001 and factors of safety fs xing and stern 2010 an important parameter in grid independence study is the refinement factor i e the magnification or reduction of the total cell numbers that form the whole computational domain the ittc guidelines ittc 2008 recommend this factor to be between square root two and two since the computational domain cannot be refined with an exact value due to the mesh algorithm the refinement factors were calculated by considering the total cell numbers eqn 8 8 r 21 n 1 n 2 1 3 r 32 n 2 n 3 1 3 where n1 n2 and n3 are the total cell numbers and n3 n2 n1 the difference between any numerical scalar result between two different grids can be calculated as follows 9 e 21 x 2 x 1 e 32 x 3 x 2 there are four types of convergence conditions phillips and roy 2014 10 1 r 0 o s c i l l a t o r y c o n v e r g e n c e 0 r 1 m o n o t o n i c c o n v e r g e n c e r 1 o s c i l l a t o r y d i v e r g e n c e r 1 m o n o t o n i c d i v e r g e n c e the convergence condition is the ratio of e values as given below 11 r e 21 e 32 total uncertainty in the computations is represented with the summation of grid and time step uncertainties eqn 12 three different grid qualities and time step sizes have been used for the uncertainty assessment 12 δ δ s p a t i a l δ t e m p o r a l the uncertainties in the computations were calculated as 0 48 3 00 and 11 08 for the fine grid at froude number of 0 41 with gci cf and fs methods respectively since the relative error between fine and medium grids is about 1 35 see table 3 medium grid has been used in all the simulations reported in this study to reduce the computational cost note that the second order accuracy pth was used for the estimations of uncertainties in spatial discretization detailed information about the uncertainty assessment can be found in celik et al 2008 stern et al 2001 and xing and stern 2010 the uncertainties according to each solution verification method are also given in table 4 here p represents the ratio of observed order of accuracy pre which is obtained by re to the theoretical one pth the convergence ratio indicates that the solution converges monotonically the fs method is found to be more conservative than the others for spatial discretization the highest uncertainty value has been taken into consideration to stay in the safe side the time step uncertainty analysis has been conducted by changing the time step size on the fine grid quality scalar results and uncertainty calculations for time step uncertainty analysis are given in tables 5 6 a notable result is that the convergence condition of time step uncertainty assessment differs from spatial discretization i e oscillatory convergence is observed in time step uncertainty analysis the uncertainties were calculated as 2 29 4 85 and 4 17 for small medium and large time step sizes at 0 41 froude number with gci cf and fs methods respectively here the maximum uncertainty value is obtained by the cf method thus total uncertainty is equal to the sum of spatial and temporal uncertainties that is 15 93 eqn 12 4 2 validation the computational method has been validated by comparing cfd simulation results with other numerical experimental and empirical results in literature tactical and steady turning diameters at 0 28 froude number are given in tables 7 8 here duman and bal 2017 and hajivand and mousavizadegan 2015 performed fast time maneuvering simulations ftms to calculate the tactical and steady turning diameters while turning circle is directly simulated in the present study it can be noted that dms method gives much lower tad compared to the experiments two important factors can be mentioned here the initial settings and the difference in propulsion system the maneuvering motions are very sensitive to the initial conditions propulsion on the other hand is achieved by the singular body forces located at the same position and direction with the propellers which means that there are no 3 dimensional effects caused by the actual propellers there are several methods to provide a thrust in free running simulations such as actual propeller body force method based on the actuator disk theory and singular force of these methods the closest one to the real condition is of course the actual propeller but this method takes too much time in cfd simulations therefore it is not feasible a single simulation has been performed at 0 41 froude number at self propulsion point using body force method and the results were compared with those of singular force method the open water propeller data of model 4058 a stock propeller has been used in order to obtain thrust with body force propeller method simman 2014 std value by singular force analysis was computed as 2 48lbp while it was 2 18lbp by body force method the turning speeds for singular force and body force methods were reduced to 1 18 m s and 1 56 m s respectively note that the advance speed corresponding to 0 41 froude number is 2 242 m s although there are differences in the dynamics around the hull between these two methods the propeller effects are not included the critical point in this study is to present a fast responding technique one can use cfd with a different propeller model and this method presented here can also use this input the results of singular force method on the other hand have acceptable accuracy it should be noted that hereafter the tcps are given as non dimensionalized with lbp std values are compared with other ftms results and those of empirical methods the linear model represents the analytical solution of linear equation of motion in the horizontal plane with experimentally determined hydrodynamic coefficients table 8 as expected std obtained by dms is higher than that of linear model std by dms is also in good agreement with the non linear ftms results total resistance without twin rudder at 0 41 froude number is calculated as 22 1834n while it is measured as 23 3067n in the experiments conducted at iihr iowa hydraulic research center the relative error between cfd and experiment is found as 4 82 table 9 4 3 turning circle simulations before starting dms the total resistance values of twin rudder appended hull should be computed straight ahead towing simulations have been carried out at each froude number to compute the resistance of rudder appended hull table 10 an interesting result is observed between bare hull and appended hull resistance values at 0 41 froude number bare hull resistance seems to be slightly higher than the twin rudder appended hull see tables 9 and 10 a similar result has also been previously reported by duman et al 2017 reduction of the dynamic pressure due to the accelerating fluid particles around rudders may cause some decrement in the wave resistance by reducing the free water surface elevation in the same vertical alignment total resistance values are then divided by two and used as single forces acting on the hull from the propeller positions in the turning circle simulations the ship model starts with an advance speed that corresponds to the froude number the twin rudder are fixed at a constant deflection angle during the simulations the results of each cfd simulation in the test matrix see table 12 are given in table 11 here δ is the rudder deflection r is the turning rate and β is drift angle loss of speed during the turning motion is given as the percentage of advance speed that corresponds to the froude number free surface deformations during the turning maneuver at fn 0 41 and δ 35 have been captured and shown at t 69s in fig 5 after the hull has started to move the asymmetrical wave pattern can easily be seen as a feature of turning motion in fig 5 wave elevations are given in meters velocity vectors of fluid particles around the hull have also been plotted for areas under free water surface on the transversal section planes in figs 6 8 here x is the longitudinal distance from the gravity center of the hull x lbp represents the nondimensional longitudinal distance from the gravity center ve for the aft and ve for the bow direction the circular motions of the particles are generally formed around the bilge keels shown with red arrows in fig 7 a black coloured guide curve in fig 7 is used to show the moving direction of the vessel it comes from x y and continues to x y direction vorticial structures are also presented in figs 9 and 10 vortices are explicitly formed around the bilge keels in both sides port and starboard of the hull based on the virtual data figs 6 10 it can be noted that the medium mesh gives a suitable balance between accuracy and computational time the vortex structures have successfully been captured those data can also be used as a reference information for other possible studies in future for comparison on the same topic 4 4 empirical method the test matrix see table 12 involves sixteen cases so that the triple combinations of these simulation results are used to generate the linear algebraic system after the calculations additional simulations are performed to check the empirical method table 13 the procedure explained in chapter 3 is followed in order to calculate the unknown coefficients in the proposed formula eqn 4 here a b and c are the mean values at each rudder angle eqn 6 the empirical coefficients are calculated by using std values obtained by the cfd simulations in the right hand side of eqn 4 for each rudder deflection one averaged value of coefficient a b or c can be calculated see table 16 therefore an expression is needed for the calculation of these coefficients depending on the rudder deflection fig 11 since there are four values for each coefficient a 3rd order polynomial function can be written eqn 14 14 a s t d 44 59 δ 3 50 29 δ 2 17 36 δ 1 31 b s t d 149 84 δ 3 164 31 δ 2 54 86 δ 3 21 c s t d 529 87 δ 3 929 46 δ 2 542 35 δ 115 18 std values calculated by the presented method are shown in fig 12 and compared with dms results in table 17 it can clearly be seen that the proposed method successfully predicts the std values for the test matrix std of a ship goes to infinity as the rudder angle approaches to zero this is a problem for matrix operations therefore the empirical approach presented here is limited in the range of test matrix of rudder angles it should be noted that the empirical model is considered as a symmetric model where the tcps for negative rudder angles are equal to the positive ones the relative errors in the std calculation between dms and presented empirical method are also shown in fig 13 the errors are quite small between 20 and 35 rudder deflections for all froude numbers under 20 rudder angle the same is true at every speed error is increasing the highest errors are seen at the lowest froude number the low speed problems in cfd are often difficult to solve because boundary layer thickness around the no slip walls can reach unexpected values changes of error in the range of 10 25 rudder deflections are sharper than the higher rudder deflections the main reason may be the assumption of linear change of the rudder angle further studies can be done to improve the presented method the same procedure is followed to obtain other expressions for longitudinal and transversal forces during the turning motion the empirical coefficients are calculated by replacing the right hand side in eqn 4 with surge and sway forces obtained from dms with urans eqns 15 and 16 longitudinal and transversal forces calculated by the presented method are shown in fig 14 15 a x 34 43 δ 3 35 64 δ 2 3 82 δ 10 31 b x 145 86 δ 3 174 16 δ 2 22 12 δ 20 63 c x 901 16 δ 3 1584 84 δ 2 992 79 δ 223 75 16 a y 530 34 δ 3 692 49 δ 2 301 23 δ 26 95 b y 1630 53 δ 3 2107 15 δ 2 914 09 δ 95 37 c y 4327 24 δ 3 5692 01 δ 2 2335 16 δ 224 19 additional cases are performed to check the empirical results table 18 at 0 50 froude number which corresponds to a very high speed the error between dms and empirical approach is about 11 as it is known the resistance depends on advance speed up to its 6th order since the presented method has considered the 2nd order of velocity it can be said that these results are satisfactory enough however the empirical results at 15 of rudder deflection are a bit more different than that of dms it may be due to the linear assumption of rudder deflection in eqn 4 4 5 another application onr hull the presented method has also been used to determine the std of onr tumblehome surface combatant model which is similar to the dtmb 5415 in terms of geometric properties fig 15 this model has a length of 3 147m 72 6 kg displacement and 0 535 block coefficient other specifications of the hull form can be found in the related references turning circle tests of this model were performed by sadat hosseini et al 2011 in iihr wave basin in calm water condition turning tests were carried out at 0 10 and 0 20 froude numbers for 25 and 35 rudder deflections comparison between experimental and empirical results is given in table 19 the test matrix of the present study includes mid and relatively high froude numbers therefore results at fn 0 10 are a little high but still acceptable the results show that the presented method works well at high rudder angles and moderate advance speeds 5 conclusions a novel and fast method is presented in this study in order to determine turning circle performance parameters of a surface combatant hull form at medium and relatively high froude numbers several turning circle maneuvering simulations have been carried out by using unsteady rans solver using overset grid technique numerical method has been verified by three different solution verification methods in terms of grid size and time step size total uncertainties in the computations have been evaluated validation has been done by comparing cfd results with the available experimental data after verification and validation the computational results have been processed by the help of linear regression analysis a cfd based empirical formula is developed for predicting tcps expressions are given in 3rd order polynomial form to calculate the unknown empirical coefficients at each rudder deflection angle it is noted that dms can be successfully solved by coarser grids spatial and temporal convergences in hydrodynamic analyses have been achieved computational results are in good agreement with the experiments comparisons with other studies indicate that the present method works well estimations of tcps within the test matrix by the presented method are fine while acceptable results are obtained for outside of the test matrix stds longitudinal and transversal forces during the turning maneuver are calculated it is also shown that tcps of onr tumblehome which has geometric similarity with dtmb 5415 can be predicted by the present method at initial design stage it is possible to create a similar correlation for each parameter of the turning maneuver by changing the right hand side of the proposed formula with experimental or numerical results the present method will be further developed to include the geometric parameters thus a more practical and comprehensive model can be developed appendix a

equations of motion to the irrotational flow past a rigid body in an ideal fluid lamb 1932 newman 1979 computation of the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on basic and simple geometries was possible but the added mass and inertial forces of complex geometries was a challenging problem for these approaches moreover the free water surface and viscous effects were not included in most of the calculations new advances in computer technology in the second half of the last century enabled us to manage such difficulties it has become possible to solve averaged momentum equations around the simple or complex geometries including viscous and free surface effects thus numerous computational applications have been conducted by the researchers which has brought the verification and validation problem lately researchers proposed several solution verification methods based on richardson extrapolation re technique which is helpful in determining the uncertainties in the computations numerical uncertainties as well as experimental uncertainty have frequently been included in the calculations yet ship model experiments have still been essential part of design when validation is concerned ship maneuvering experiments are generally separated into two categories free running model tests and captive model tests cmt lewis 1989 since the free running experiments are the primary concern of this study detailed information about the cmt will not be given but one can find them in the related reference free running tests are generally preferred for its quick response and being close to the real conditions it should be mentioned that local flow or the effects of individual parameters cannot be obtained by this type of experiments ankudinov 1993 in free running tests the geometrically similar ship model is equipped with a propulsion unit which is a stock propeller generally for the most part and control surfaces like the full scale ship then definite maneuvers e g turning circle zig zag spiral etc are performed using a remote controller device it is assumed that the scale effects are negligible so that full scale maneuvering characteristics are obtained a study was conducted by carrica et al 2013 to compute the standard maneuvers of a surface combatant at model and full scale the unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver cfdship iowa v4 was used in order to solve the fluid flow around the hull the ship model was free to 6dof degree of freedom motions which was achieved by employing the overset grid technique according to this technique the grid cells are classified into several types such as fringe hole donor etc the flow properties are transferred between overset region boundaries and background region cells benek et al 1986 carrica et al 2013 simulated two types of maneuvers turning circle with 35 rudder deflection and 20 20 zig zag test the simulations were performed at mid and high froude numbers using constant rpm propulsion corresponding to the self propulsion points differences between cfd computational fluid dynamics and experiments were found within 10 for both maneuvers they stated that urans computations of maneuvers are feasible however a realistic and sufficient propeller models remain to be solved they intended to implement a vortex lattice propeller code puf 14 to the cfdship iowa to provide much improved propeller modelling sadat hosseini et al 2015 assessed the capabilities of cfd and potential flow pf methods for course keeping of fully appended model 5415 in irregular waves they implemented the jonswap spectrum for various wave headings at a froude number of 0 248 cfd simulations were conducted with n 32 wave components while n 400 wave components were used for pf simulations the effects of wave component numbers were studied the results were validated against experimental data in terms of 6 dof degree of freedom motions and wave elevation the cfdship iowa v4 5 was used for the viscous flow simulations huang et al 2008 for pf simulations a non linear strip theory based code fredyn developed by the cooperative research navies crnav group was employed de kat and paulling 2001 a simplified body force method was used for the propeller by using the open water curves which were defined as a second order polynomial fit of the experimental kt j and kq j curves it was remarked that the trends versus wave headings for statistical results of the primary and secondary variables and raos were often well predicted by both cfd and pf large roll motions particularly for the case with passive fins at 105 wave heading were observed in near beam wave conditions shen et al 2015 implemented the dynamic overset grid technique into naoe foam sjtu solver developed by using open source code openfoam they stated that computational results were comparable with experimental data of resistance free surface elevation wake flow and self propulsion factor even though relatively coarse grids were used a grid convergence study also performed for the open water propeller tests of kp505 and bare hull kcs model carrica et al 2016 studied the kcs container ship on a zig zag maneuver in shallow water experimentally and numerically experiments were performed at flanders hydraulics research for the workshop on verification and validation of ship maneuvering simulation methods nmri 2015 the test conditions for both experiments and numerical simulations were fn 0 095 and h t 1 2 cfd simulations were carried out with directly discretized rudder and propeller they achieved good grid convergence in large grid uncertainties as well as time evolutions of different variables the standard deviations of repeated experiments were below 3 for all key variables of maneuvers it was clearly stated that cfd proved its capability of solving such highly complex problems and provided significant insight of the flow e g local velocity and pressure fields three dimensional vorticial structures etc wang et al 2017 used the naoe foam sjtu cfd solver to simulate the free running tests of onr tumblehome ship model simulations were performed using overset grid technique and 6dof module with twin actual rotating propellers and moving rudders the revolutions corresponding to the self propulsion points were computed in calm water at two different approach speeds their computational results were in good agreement with the benchmark data taken from tokyo 2015 cfd workshop in ship hydrodynamics nmri 2015 they achieved free running simulations under course keeping control but computational cost was still very high about two weeks to complete one simulation case they referred to simulate standard maneuvers e g turning circle and zigzag maneuvers in different heading waves as future works duman 2016 performed several cfd simulations using an unsteady rans solver software star ccm which was based on finite volume method to compute the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on a surface combatant model 5415 with 46 588 scale ratio during static pmm planar motion mechanism maneuvers e g static rudder pure drift and rudder drift computational results were used to obtain the maneuvering coefficients according to theoretical model abkowitz 1964 and validated with the available experimental data the free surface effects were included into the calculations and hull was assumed to be fixed during all computations it was demonstrated that urans approach was quite capable of capturing the integral values and free surface deformations even for coarser grids the results were used as input to a matlab code developed within this study to solve equations of motion the fast time simulations fts of turning circle and zig zag maneuvers were carried out and results were published in duman and bal 2017 in a following study the dynamic overset grid chimera technique has been implemented to simulate pure sway motion of the same ship model duman et al 2018 the computational results were validated with the experimental data in terms of hydrodynamic forces and moments and also hydrodynamic derivatives grid convergence study was conducted to calculate the uncertainty in the computations the comparison errors of sway acceleration terms were about 15 and 22 for medium grid quality which can be considered as acceptable results he is currently working on simulating other oscillatory pmm maneuvers such as pure yaw yaw drift etc and definite maneuvers in recent years system identification si methods which are mainly used to determine the maneuverability hydrodynamic coefficients have become very popular running numerous maneuvering simulations using cfd is very expensive araki et al 2012 conducted a study to examine which free running trial gives the best maneuvering coefficients using si thus the number of cfd simulations can be reduced they showed that several cfd free running simulations can be enough for maneuvering performance prediction than performing many numbers of captive model experiments another study for estimating parameters of practical ship maneuvering models was presented by bonci et al 2015 they combined the si procedure with the rans computations it was stated that the use of cfd in maneuvering simulations for si is very helpful in cfd a major problem noise in the recorded data can be much less than the experimental ones gavrilin and steen 2017 conducted a study to introduce the application of simplified auxiliary models metamodels for moderate turning motions of two ships two case studies were presented and vesim which is developed by the norwegian marine technology research institute marintek was used to validate the original maneuvering models ross 2008 they demonstrated the main application of metamodels in the generation of validation benchmarks from in service recorded data where the uncertainties were unknown except for wind it was stated that the metamodels can also be used for other applications such as correction of standard imo trials liu et al 2017 developed an integrated empirical model for maneuvering predictions of inland ships in the yangtze river they aimed to find the most suitable maneuvering model for such ships without performing extensive experimental tests the dynamic equations of motion they applied was described in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 it was concluded that the maneuvering characteristics of the reference inland vessels can roughly be captured by their model they emphasized the importance of initial conditions on the accuracy of maneuvering predictions the main objective of this study is to develop a new empirical formula that predicts the turning circle parameters tcps in a quick way the problem addressed here is to provide a correlation in which the performance parameters can be calculated depending on the ship advance speed and rudder deflection angle traditionally empirical formulas are derived by using the full scale sea trial or model test data obtained for a certain ship type designer may not always have these opportunities due to both economic and time constraints novelty of the presented method is that the empirical formulas are formed according to the results of cfd analyses today cfd method is known to be robust repeatable and reliable pre processing may take time e g discretization of the computational domain verification of the method validation etc however once this step is succeeded for a certain ship hydrodynamic analyses can easily be performed in this study several turning maneuver simulations have been performed in a range of 0 25 0 41 froude numbers and 10 35 rudder angles by using unsteady rans solver software dynamic overset grid technique has been used in the hydrodynamic analyses propulsion of the ship model during dms is achieved by using singular forces acting from the propeller position free surface effects have been taken into consideration a study for the verification and the validation of the computational method has been conducted empirical coefficients for the proposed model have been calculated by linear regression analysis empirical results have been compared with those of computed by cfd simulations the capability of the presented method has been discussed 2 mathematical background in the cartesian coordinate system the averaged continuity and momentum equations can be written in tensor notation as follows for an incompressible flow with constant viscosity coefficient and assuming there are no body forces acting on the hull

turbulence model realizable k ε is used to solve the reynolds stress term in the rans equations for turbulence model a wall function is implemented to calculate the velocity profiles near the no slip boundaries 2 1 choice of time step the time step has been determined according to the ittc cfd recommendations for transient solutions ittc 2011 ittc proposes the formula δ t 0 005 0 01 l b p v where lbp is the length between perpendiculars and v is the ship advance speed a verification study has been conducted in order to determine the uncertainty due to time step size 2 2 overset grid technique the grid embedding technique or dynamic overset grid enables the grid system to move freely with the moving rigid body in this study the computational domain is constructed using two main parts background and overset regions the flow data has been transmitted using embedded boundaries between these regions unlike the conventional boundaries overset region boundaries have the flexibility of arbitrary orientation without any deformation according to this technique the grid cells are classified into several types such as fringe hole donor etc the flow properties are transferred between overset region boundaries and background region cells benek et al 1986 2 3 grid resolution and boundary conditions there are two computational domains used in this study the first one is a conventional numerical towing tank with appropriate dimensions fig 1 and the second one is a numerical basin large enough to simulate realistically the turning maneuver simulations fig 2 front top and bottom faces are defined as velocity inlets where the multi phase fluid flows in ve x direction for the resistance prediction calculations port and starboard faces are assigned as symmetry planes the back face of the background domain is set to pressure outlet the hull surfaces are considered as no slip walls where the normal and tangential velocities of the fluid particles are both zero on the surfaces no slip condition there is a small difference between the boundary conditions of resistance prediction and turning circle simulations in the dms velocity of the multi phase fluid is set to zero at inlet faces during the turning simulations while the other boundary conditions remained the same since the ship is fixed in the resistance simulations the free surface deformations move rapidly along with the flow velocity to the lateral boundaries and the pressure outlet boundary of the computational domain where a damping function is necessary near the boundaries to prevent the computational errors but it is not needed for turning circle simulations therefore damping function which is generally used to suppress the free surface deformation near the boundaries is not enabled during turning circle simulations computational domain dimensions are given in table 1 in non dimensional form here upstream is in the ve x direction and starboard is in the ve y direction the other boundaries are explained on figs 1 and 2 the computational domain is subdivided into hexahedral elements by the finite volume method fvm grid refinements are done near the free water surface sonar dome and the wake zone fig 3 3 empirical approach for turning maneuver one of the most important factors that affects the turning performance of a surface ship is the advance speed these effects can be up to the second order or third order of the velocity at mid and relatively high froude numbers respectively in a turning motion rudder deflection angle becomes also very important within generally first order it is here assumed that the turning circle parameters tcps depends on the first order of the rudder deflection and second order of the ship advance speed eqn 4 4 a i j v i 2 b i j v i c i j δ i j t c p i j here v is the ship advance speed m s δ is the rudder deflection radian and a b and c are the constant coefficients computed from the linear regression analyses applied to the numerical results tcps can be defined as the steady turning diameter std tactical diameter tad advance or transfer values the present method is based on solving three by three linear algebraic equations where the unknowns are the empirical coefficients a b and c given in eqn 4 in the proposed empirical formula index i stands for the triple velocity combinations while j indicates the rudder deflection tables 14 15 e g let s take δ 28 which is j 2 in table 15 then the linear algebraic system for all velocity combinations will take form as follows 5 2 242 2 2 242 0 488 1 914 2 1 914 0 488

the right hand sides are set to std values of the related cases the augmented matrices of each three by three matrix are reduced to the row reduced echelon form by applying simple matrix operations in order to obtain the unknown coefficients this procedure is repeated for other rudder deflections j 1 2 3 4 and empirical coefficients are calculated four three by three matrices are created for one rudder deflection and all velocity combinations therefore four different values of each coefficient a b and c at one rudder deflection are obtained the arithmetic mean values of each coefficient are calculated at each rudder deflection eqn 6 6 a j i 1 4 a i j 4 b j i 1 4 b i j 4 j 1 2 3 4 c j i 1 4 c i j 4 since these coefficients change at every rudder deflection an expression is needed to calculate them depending on the rudder deflection a 3rd order polynomial function can be written for each coefficient eqn 7 7 a k 1 δ 3 k 2 δ 2 k 3 δ k 4 b l 1 δ 3 l 2 δ 2 l 3 δ l 4 c m 1 δ 3 m 2 δ 2 m 3 δ m 4 where k l and m are the constants obtained from polynomial curve fitting once a b and c are known any tcp value of the vessel at a random advance speed and rudder deflection can be calculated from the proposed formula eqn 4 note that those who apply this model will not only replace the advance speed and rudder angle but also recalculate the empirical coefficients a b c by using the polynomial functions eqn 7 it should be noted that when the right hand sides of the three by three matrices are set to std values as in the above example eqn 5 the empirical coefficients can only be used for std predictions this process can be repeated by changing the right hand sides of the three by three matrices with the corresponding turning circle simulation results for other tcp predictions 4 computational results a surface combatant model 5415 has been chosen for the hydrodynamic analyses 3 dimensional geometry is shown in fig 4 the scale ratio is 46 588 which is also known as 5512 in literature the model has a length of 3 048m and a draft of 0 132m other principal parameters are given in table 2 the main purpose for choosing this geometry is the availability of experimental data provided by the previous studies 4 1 verification three different solution verification methods based on richardson extrapolation re have been implemented to obtain uncertainties in the computations at 0 41 froude number the first one grid convergence index gci method was developed by roache 1994 while the other two methods were proposed by the study of correction factor cf stern et al 2001 and factors of safety fs xing and stern 2010 an important parameter in grid independence study is the refinement factor i e the magnification or reduction of the total cell numbers that form the whole computational domain the ittc guidelines ittc 2008 recommend this factor to be between square root two and two since the computational domain cannot be refined with an exact value due to the mesh algorithm the refinement factors were calculated by considering the total cell numbers eqn 8 8 r 21 n 1 n 2 1 3 r 32 n 2 n 3 1 3 where n1 n2 and n3 are the total cell numbers and n3 n2 n1 the difference between any numerical scalar result between two different grids can be calculated as follows 9 e 21 x 2 x 1 e 32 x 3 x 2 there are four types of convergence conditions phillips and roy 2014 10 1 r 0 o s c i l l a t o r y c o n v e r g e n c e 0 r 1 m o n o t o n i c c o n v e r g e n c e r 1 o s c i l l a t o r y d i v e r g e n c e r 1 m o n o t o n i c d i v e r g e n c e the convergence condition is the ratio of e values as given below 11 r e 21 e 32 total uncertainty in the computations is represented with the summation of grid and time step uncertainties eqn 12 three different grid qualities and time step sizes have been used for the uncertainty assessment 12 δ δ s p a t i a l δ t e m p o r a l the uncertainties in the computations were calculated as 0 48 3 00 and 11 08 for the fine grid at froude number of 0 41 with gci cf and fs methods respectively since the relative error between fine and medium grids is about 1 35 see table 3 medium grid has been used in all the simulations reported in this study to reduce the computational cost note that the second order accuracy pth was used for the estimations of uncertainties in spatial discretization detailed information about the uncertainty assessment can be found in celik et al 2008 stern et al 2001 and xing and stern 2010 the uncertainties according to each solution verification method are also given in table 4 here p represents the ratio of observed order of accuracy pre which is obtained by re to the theoretical one pth the convergence ratio indicates that the solution converges monotonically the fs method is found to be more conservative than the others for spatial discretization the highest uncertainty value has been taken into consideration to stay in the safe side the time step uncertainty analysis has been conducted by changing the time step size on the fine grid quality scalar results and uncertainty calculations for time step uncertainty analysis are given in tables 5 6 a notable result is that the convergence condition of time step uncertainty assessment differs from spatial discretization i e oscillatory convergence is observed in time step uncertainty analysis the uncertainties were calculated as 2 29 4 85 and 4 17 for small medium and large time step sizes at 0 41 froude number with gci cf and fs methods respectively here the maximum uncertainty value is obtained by the cf method thus total uncertainty is equal to the sum of spatial and temporal uncertainties that is 15 93 eqn 12 4 2 validation the computational method has been validated by comparing cfd simulation results with other numerical experimental and empirical results in literature tactical and steady turning diameters at 0 28 froude number are given in tables 7 8 here duman and bal 2017 and hajivand and mousavizadegan 2015 performed fast time maneuvering simulations ftms to calculate the tactical and steady turning diameters while turning circle is directly simulated in the present study it can be noted that dms method gives much lower tad compared to the experiments two important factors can be mentioned here the initial settings and the difference in propulsion system the maneuvering motions are very sensitive to the initial conditions propulsion on the other hand is achieved by the singular body forces located at the same position and direction with the propellers which means that there are no 3 dimensional effects caused by the actual propellers there are several methods to provide a thrust in free running simulations such as actual propeller body force method based on the actuator disk theory and singular force of these methods the closest one to the real condition is of course the actual propeller but this method takes too much time in cfd simulations therefore it is not feasible a single simulation has been performed at 0 41 froude number at self propulsion point using body force method and the results were compared with those of singular force method the open water propeller data of model 4058 a stock propeller has been used in order to obtain thrust with body force propeller method simman 2014 std value by singular force analysis was computed as 2 48lbp while it was 2 18lbp by body force method the turning speeds for singular force and body force methods were reduced to 1 18 m s and 1 56 m s respectively note that the advance speed corresponding to 0 41 froude number is 2 242 m s although there are differences in the dynamics around the hull between these two methods the propeller effects are not included the critical point in this study is to present a fast responding technique one can use cfd with a different propeller model and this method presented here can also use this input the results of singular force method on the other hand have acceptable accuracy it should be noted that hereafter the tcps are given as non dimensionalized with lbp std values are compared with other ftms results and those of empirical methods the linear model represents the analytical solution of linear equation of motion in the horizontal plane with experimentally determined hydrodynamic coefficients table 8 as expected std obtained by dms is higher than that of linear model std by dms is also in good agreement with the non linear ftms results total resistance without twin rudder at 0 41 froude number is calculated as 22 1834n while it is measured as 23 3067n in the experiments conducted at iihr iowa hydraulic research center the relative error between cfd and experiment is found as 4 82 table 9 4 3 turning circle simulations before starting dms the total resistance values of twin rudder appended hull should be computed straight ahead towing simulations have been carried out at each froude number to compute the resistance of rudder appended hull table 10 an interesting result is observed between bare hull and appended hull resistance values at 0 41 froude number bare hull resistance seems to be slightly higher than the twin rudder appended hull see tables 9 and 10 a similar result has also been previously reported by duman et al 2017 reduction of the dynamic pressure due to the accelerating fluid particles around rudders may cause some decrement in the wave resistance by reducing the free water surface elevation in the same vertical alignment total resistance values are then divided by two and used as single forces acting on the hull from the propeller positions in the turning circle simulations the ship model starts with an advance speed that corresponds to the froude number the twin rudder are fixed at a constant deflection angle during the simulations the results of each cfd simulation in the test matrix see table 12 are given in table 11 here δ is the rudder deflection r is the turning rate and β is drift angle loss of speed during the turning motion is given as the percentage of advance speed that corresponds to the froude number free surface deformations during the turning maneuver at fn 0 41 and δ 35 have been captured and shown at t 69s in fig 5 after the hull has started to move the asymmetrical wave pattern can easily be seen as a feature of turning motion in fig 5 wave elevations are given in meters velocity vectors of fluid particles around the hull have also been plotted for areas under free water surface on the transversal section planes in figs 6 8 here x is the longitudinal distance from the gravity center of the hull x lbp represents the nondimensional longitudinal distance from the gravity center ve for the aft and ve for the bow direction the circular motions of the particles are generally formed around the bilge keels shown with red arrows in fig 7 a black coloured guide curve in fig 7 is used to show the moving direction of the vessel it comes from x y and continues to x y direction vorticial structures are also presented in figs 9 and 10 vortices are explicitly formed around the bilge keels in both sides port and starboard of the hull based on the virtual data figs 6 10 it can be noted that the medium mesh gives a suitable balance between accuracy and computational time the vortex structures have successfully been captured those data can also be used as a reference information for other possible studies in future for comparison on the same topic 4 4 empirical method the test matrix see table 12 involves sixteen cases so that the triple combinations of these simulation results are used to generate the linear algebraic system after the calculations additional simulations are performed to check the empirical method table 13 the procedure explained in chapter 3 is followed in order to calculate the unknown coefficients in the proposed formula eqn 4 here a b and c are the mean values at each rudder angle eqn 6 the empirical coefficients are calculated by using std values obtained by the cfd simulations in the right hand side of eqn 4 for each rudder deflection one averaged value of coefficient a b or c can be calculated see table 16 therefore an expression is needed for the calculation of these coefficients depending on the rudder deflection fig 11 since there are four values for each coefficient a 3rd order polynomial function can be written eqn 14 14 a s t d 44 59 δ 3 50 29 δ 2 17 36 δ 1 31 b s t d 149 84 δ 3 164 31 δ 2 54 86 δ 3 21 c s t d 529 87 δ 3 929 46 δ 2 542 35 δ 115 18 std values calculated by the presented method are shown in fig 12 and compared with dms results in table 17 it can clearly be seen that the proposed method successfully predicts the std values for the test matrix std of a ship goes to infinity as the rudder angle approaches to zero this is a problem for matrix operations therefore the empirical approach presented here is limited in the range of test matrix of rudder angles it should be noted that the empirical model is considered as a symmetric model where the tcps for negative rudder angles are equal to the positive ones the relative errors in the std calculation between dms and presented empirical method are also shown in fig 13 the errors are quite small between 20 and 35 rudder deflections for all froude numbers under 20 rudder angle the same is true at every speed error is increasing the highest errors are seen at the lowest froude number the low speed problems in cfd are often difficult to solve because boundary layer thickness around the no slip walls can reach unexpected values changes of error in the range of 10 25 rudder deflections are sharper than the higher rudder deflections the main reason may be the assumption of linear change of the rudder angle further studies can be done to improve the presented method the same procedure is followed to obtain other expressions for longitudinal and transversal forces during the turning motion the empirical coefficients are calculated by replacing the right hand side in eqn 4 with surge and sway forces obtained from dms with urans eqns 15 and 16 longitudinal and transversal forces calculated by the presented method are shown in fig 14 15 a x 34 43 δ 3 35 64 δ 2 3 82 δ 10 31 b x 145 86 δ 3 174 16 δ 2 22 12 δ 20 63 c x 901 16 δ 3 1584 84 δ 2 992 79 δ 223 75 16 a y 530 34 δ 3 692 49 δ 2 301 23 δ 26 95 b y 1630 53 δ 3 2107 15 δ 2 914 09 δ 95 37 c y 4327 24 δ 3 5692 01 δ 2 2335 16 δ 224 19 additional cases are performed to check the empirical results table 18 at 0 50 froude number which corresponds to a very high speed the error between dms and empirical approach is about 11 as it is known the resistance depends on advance speed up to its 6th order since the presented method has considered the 2nd order of velocity it can be said that these results are satisfactory enough however the empirical results at 15 of rudder deflection are a bit more different than that of dms it may be due to the linear assumption of rudder deflection in eqn 4 4 5 another application onr hull the presented method has also been used to determine the std of onr tumblehome surface combatant model which is similar to the dtmb 5415 in terms of geometric properties fig 15 this model has a length of 3 147m 72 6 kg displacement and 0 535 block coefficient other specifications of the hull form can be found in the related references turning circle tests of this model were performed by sadat hosseini et al 2011 in iihr wave basin in calm water condition turning tests were carried out at 0 10 and 0 20 froude numbers for 25 and 35 rudder deflections comparison between experimental and empirical results is given in table 19 the test matrix of the present study includes mid and relatively high froude numbers therefore results at fn 0 10 are a little high but still acceptable the results show that the presented method works well at high rudder angles and moderate advance speeds 5 conclusions a novel and fast method is presented in this study in order to determine turning circle performance parameters of a surface combatant hull form at medium and relatively high froude numbers several turning circle maneuvering simulations have been carried out by using unsteady rans solver using overset grid technique numerical method has been verified by three different solution verification methods in terms of grid size and time step size total uncertainties in the computations have been evaluated validation has been done by comparing cfd results with the available experimental data after verification and validation the computational results have been processed by the help of linear regression analysis a cfd based empirical formula is developed for predicting tcps expressions are given in 3rd order polynomial form to calculate the unknown empirical coefficients at each rudder deflection angle it is noted that dms can be successfully solved by coarser grids spatial and temporal convergences in hydrodynamic analyses have been achieved computational results are in good agreement with the experiments comparisons with other studies indicate that the present method works well estimations of tcps within the test matrix by the presented method are fine while acceptable results are obtained for outside of the test matrix stds longitudinal and transversal forces during the turning maneuver are calculated it is also shown that tcps of onr tumblehome which has geometric similarity with dtmb 5415 can be predicted by the present method at initial design stage it is possible to create a similar correlation for each parameter of the turning maneuver by changing the right hand side of the proposed formula with experimental or numerical results the present method will be further developed to include the geometric parameters thus a more practical and comprehensive model can be developed appendix a

22878,long term extreme wave analysis is performed using a spatial approach applied to hindcast data to study the sensitivity of extrapolated quantiles of significant wave height to different hindcast calibration methods and distribution functions the probabilistic moments and l moments are analyzed as well as several extreme value distribution functions the estimation of extreme values is addressed in two parts 1 numerical modeling of wind and wave hindcasts with improved accuracy under extreme conditions 2 investigation and tests of fit of extreme value distributions using the regional frequency analysis therefore the main goal of this paper is to show how hindcast data calibrated to account for extreme events can influence and improve return value estimates results show that simplistic calibrations such as a linear regression applied to input winds and quick modifications on the numerical wave model do not significantly improve the representation of the peak of storms which has a small impact on the reliability of shape parameters of the quantile functions the construction of a new wave hindcast using satellite winds inside extreme cyclones led to a reduction of the bias at higher percentiles and additional improvement of the distribution tail and its shape these elements combined with a robust extreme analysis methodology such as the regional frequency analysis and thorough choice of the distribution function produced reliable spatial return values of significant wave height keywords extreme waves regional frequency analysis hindcast uncertainty long term distributions extreme value analysis 1 introduction extreme values of significant wave height are among the most important parameters for design and management of offshore platforms coastal structures ship routing and harbors thus accurate estimations of long term extreme quantiles also referred to as return values are extremely important for several activities in coastal and open waters including general marine safety when considering the significant wave height hs this accuracy is even more important due to the quadratic dependence of wave energy to hs as discussed by dean and dalrymple 1991 among others the extreme value analysis eva is the area of statistics that has been developed for decades addressing the extrapolation of probabilistic distribution functions adjusted to historical datasets embrechets et al 1997 coles 2007 and goda 2010 have careful theoretical descriptions of eva the main goal is to calculate reliable extreme values for a variety of return periods such as 10 years typically for tow routes 20 years for ship designs 50 and 100 years for oil gas platforms and coastal structures and 1000 years for areas vulnerable to hurricanes such statistical parameters are also important to the renewable energy sector that has rapidly expanded during the last few years as studied by viselli et al 2015 an interesting discussion about extreme waves and their impact on coasts and society is provided by hansom et al 2015 the process of calculating return values involves some steps including i selection of long and reliable input datasets ii definition of statistically independent events iii analysis and choice of optimal distribution functions that properly represent the extreme percentiles iv extrapolation of the cumulative distribution function to certain probabilities of non exceedance associated with long return periods and v calculation of confidence intervals for the return values each step is vulnerable to uncertainties and different sources of errors that can be difficult to identify and to track which become important issues larsen et al 2015 orimolade et al 2016 investigated the uncertainty of extreme waves fitted to hindcast data jones et al 2018 recently quantified the uncertainty in estimation of extreme winds and waves using bayesian analysis the first step to select the input dataset depends on the availability of long and high quality measurements with a good sampling rate ferreira and guedes soares 1998 have applied the peaks over threshold pot approach to buoy data from the portuguese coast while sartini et al 2015 obtained return values of hs along the italian coast based on hindcast data and buoy data applying the pot approach however due to a lack of observations extreme wave analysis is often based directly on numerical wave hindcasts li et al 2016 which imposes additional sources of errors regions of the globe with less in situ measurements e g heave pitch roll buoys such as the south atlantic ocean become more dependent on hindcast data for the application of evas furthermore the small density of measurements at certain locations impacts on the data assimilation process of numerical simulations which also increases the errors of hindcasts especially under extreme conditions campos et al 2018 based on these questions the present paper studies the process of estimating extreme quantiles of hs using properly calibrated hindcast data from the south atlantic mainly in the area offshore of brazil the main goal is to use different hindcasts and probability density functions as sensitivity tests analyzing the impact on the probabilistic moments distribution parameters and extrapolated quantiles therefore the focus is on steps i and iii listed above one may ask why not simply use altimeter data when buoy measurements are not available however satellites with polar orbit have coarse time sampling at fixed locations cooper and forristall 1997 that is insufficient to properly represent the peak of storms which is critical for extreme wave analyses as discussed by alves and young 2004 the study of robinson and tawn 2000 found that the effect of the observation frequency of altimeters can lead to an underestimation of the return values of up to 15 wimmer et al 2006 obtained return values from satellite data that are 37 smaller than those estimated by fitting distribution to all the data indeed satellite observations are valuable sources of information especially due to spatial coverage and support in hindcast calibration however the application of eva using satellite data solely is not recommended in order to study extreme values over the domain covering the southern areas of brazil as well as evaluating the regional impacts of different hindcasts and distributions a spatial approach of extreme analysis becomes necessary the use of spatial statistics is growing very fast in recent years lerma et al 2015 compares two methods of extreme analysis using a spatial approach their implemented statistical processing method was based on the approach of bernardara et al 2014 using the rfa for pot samples the regional frequency analysis rfa based on l moments developed by hosking and wallis 1997 is a robust and practical method that has been widely applied in environmental analyses over the last few years lucas et al 2012a 2012b weiss et al 2014a campos and guedes soares 2016a 2018 and vanem et al 2017 are examples of applications of rfa to calculate regional extreme waves using hindcast data the rfa exploits the information from similar sites inside a statistically homogeneous region by assuming common extremal behavior in the region weiss et al 2014a the method derives from the fact that more robust results can be reached by pooling all data samples together than by using only a single sample campos and guedes soares 2016a therefore the extreme analysis and estimation of return values were performed entirely based on the rfa and the theory of hosking and wallis 1997 section 2 is devoted to numerical modeling hindcast construction and assessments the wind and wave hindcasts utilized in this paper were developed and described by alves et al 2017 and campos et al 2018 based on modified ncep winds and calibrated wavewatch iii simulations section 3 is dedicated to the rfa and extrapolation process section 4 presents the most important results and discussion addressing the impact of hindcasts and distributions on return values sections 5 and 6 summarize the discussion conclusions and recommendations for future studies 2 wave hindcasting south and southeastern brazilian waters are strongly affected by low pressure atmospheric systems especially in the autumn and winter with strong winds from the southwest and waves from the south the most extreme conditions of winds storm surges and waves are associated with sub tropical and extra tropical cyclones as discussed by campos et al 2012 the brazilian wave climate was investigated by parente 1999 and pinho 2003 where the most extreme waves recorded reached 7 m of significant wave height the combination of cyclogenetic areas with lack of in situ measurements creates challenging conditions to construct accurate wind and wave hindcasts of extreme events teixeira et al 1995 and holthuijsen et al 1996 among others have emphasized the importance of accurate wind fields in the ability of wave models to properly determine the wave fields cavaleri et al 2007 and rogers et al 2012 discuss the uncertainties and source of errors associated with numerical wave modeling the impact of such errors goes beyond the misrepresented peak of the storms usually assessed as high root mean square errors rmse and low correlation coefficients cc but it also impacts on the probabilistic domain i e the misrepresentation of probabilistic moments and the tail of the distributions fig 1 for example shows a comparison between two probability densities from a metocean buoy measurement and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep saha et al 2010 besides the underestimated winds of cfsr compared to the measurements the impact on the probabilistic domain is remarkable especially considering the large discrepancy of skewness in the left plot of fig 1 the first aspect to consider is the complexity of the behavior of the errors involving atmospheric reanalyses campos and guedes soares 2016b 2017 have studied the spatial distribution errors among various commonly used reanalyses in the north atlantic considering both the input winds and the produced wave fields looking at the average and extreme conditions the differences can be more severe during cyclones as is illustrated by fig 2 when a strong cyclone generated at the mouth of rio de la plata forced extreme waves towards the coast of argentina uruguay and brazil fig 2a and b highlight the irregular distribution of the error of 10 m winds in space the largest cfsr errors are contained within the cyclone with most areas underestimated and a few locations where cfsr overestimates the satellite winds far from the cyclone errors tend to be smaller indicating the difficulties of cfsr to represent turbulent and stormy conditions in particular larsen et al 2012 analyzed this problem associated with numerical simulations pointing to the effect of small temporal and spatial resolutions of reanalysis which is reflected in the spectral domain as an energy deficit in the mesoscale range fig 2d presents the heterogeneous occurrence of cyclones in the western portions of the south atlantic ocean with hot colors indicating locations where cfsr is expected to present less accurate winds therefore based on fig 2 it is possible to visualize that reanalysis winds the most important source of errors in wave modeling in deep waters according to cavaleri et al 2007 have a very complex distribution of errors this depends on location severity and meteorological system it suggests that simplistic linear regression calibration functions are possibly insufficient to properly improve the representation of surface winds under extreme conditions inspired by this problem alves et al 2017 developed and compared two wind calibration methods the first is a univariate linear regression function with parameters estimated from metocean buoys a quick and simple solution widely applied by consultancies in the private sector the second is a new method where cyclonic winds extreme intensities are separated from the background fields mild intensities and then calibrated independently the cyclonic winds where cfsr reaches up to 25 of underestimation are blended with scatterometers using the quikscat jpl 2001 and seawinds ncdc noaa zhang et al 2006 databases the non cyclonic winds with much smaller errors up to 5 can be calibrated using a linear regression or can remain without any calibration the new cyclonic winds are then re inserted into the background field to compose the final wind data this novel method is inspired by kurihara et al 1993 details and results about it can be found in alves et al 2017 and campos et al 2018 the inclusion of scatterometer data within the cyclones creates wind fields with more detailed information inside a turbulent area where mesoscale processes and sharp contours intensify the wind speeds the discussion about the temporal and spatial scale of extreme events is extremely important as addressed by larsén et al 2015 and larsén et al 2012 who developed approaches for correcting the smoothing effect from numerical models which deteriorate extreme wind quantiles the inclusion of satellite data as proposed by alves et al 2017 already addresses this issue in a different way focused on the most important areas inside the storms campos et al 2018 took the new wind databases constructed by alves et al 2017 together with the original cfsr winds to analyze the impact of different wind calibrations on the wave fields using wavewatch iii tolman et al 2014 furthermore an additional calibration is applied to the source terms st4 ardhuin et al 2010 of wavewatch iii where the parameter β m a x that controls the transfer of momentum from the surface wind to the wave spectrum is modified four different β m a x were tested the default 1 33 from tolman et al 2014 for ncep winds and higher values of 1 44 1 55 and 1 66 the impact of different β m a x on the accuracy of the model is thoroughly analyzed by campos et al 2018 the wind and wave calibrations led to nine wave hindcasts presented in table 1 which are applied as inputs to the evas and return value calculations in the next section all wave hindcasts have the same time and space resolution of 1 h and 12 respectively besides the results of campos et al 2018 fig 3 shows an additional illustration of the surface winds and the effect of calibrations on the wave fields it is possible to see side by side the different input winds and the impact on the significant wave heights the anomaly field is plotted instead of the variables themselves in order to highlight the differences where hot colors indicate that the new winds and waves are greater than the reference fig 3 a1 and fig 3 a2 without any calibration and cold colors where new winds and waves are lower than the reference map fig 3 b1 and b2 are the most different from the default hindcasts because they are entirely based on a completely independent wind source the seawinds database maps of fig 3 c1 and c2 associated with the calibration using a linear regression uplift the intensities by a small amount around 6 but it is insufficient to correct the underestimation of cyclonic winds that can reach 25 plots of fig 3 d1 and d2 shows the effect of the new methodology proposed by alves et al 2017 and campos et al 2018 where the cfsr winds for non cyclonic areas which are shown to have very good skill are maintained while the cyclonic winds are corrected campos et al 2018 performed a detailed assessment of the wave hindcasts using altimeter and buoy data including an important evaluation of hs error as a function of sea severity by using increasing percentiles the authors argued that proper calibration of cyclonic winds produced a better representation of the peak of storms mainly above the 93rd percentile however under non cyclonic conditions or when the wind fetch is extremely large winds still required some calibration the combination of both calibrations of hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw in fig 3 e1 and e2 led to the best results with linear regression applied to ambient conditions and satellite data merged inside the cyclones the main goal of campos et al 2018 was to correct the large deterioration of the hindcast with increasing percentiles severity they found that modifying the parameter β m a x of wavewatch iii generates similar results to calibrating wind intensity with a linear regression function it reduces the bias but has a minor impact on the rmse and the correlation coefficient cc most importantly these simplistic calibration methods do not correct the increase of bias with percentile this was only achieved by properly improving the cyclonic winds separately the new methodology allowed the percentage error of hs to reduce from 14 to less than 8 for extreme waves when compared to altimeter and buoy data campos et al 2018 although observations still retain errors that cannot be neglected they have much higher accuracy and precision than non calibrated wave hindcasts janssen et al 2007 for example estimated and compared the errors of hs from buoys satellites and models providing an interesting discussion on this matter the next step is now entering these different wave hindcasts on the statistical model to evaluate the impact on the probabilistic domain li et al 2016 constructed different hindcasts with distinct wind fields applied to long term extreme wave analyses instead of using wavewatch iii they used the wave model wam4 and surface winds from ecmwf and ncep li et al 2016 concluded that the hindcast forced by winds from ecmwf are better than those forced by ncep winds however it is well known that wam4 source terms and parameterization are optimized for ecmwf winds while the wavewatch iii model nowadays has the option of optimized parameters for both ecmwf and ncep winds tolman et al 2014 the use of ncep winds as well as the wavewacth iii model is justified in campos et al 2018 3 long term extremes using regional frequency analysis the assessment and analysis of return values based on different hindcasts using a single location would have a very low statistical significance for this reason regional frequency analysis becomes crucial the complete development of the theory and instructions for practical applications are described by hosking and wallis 1997 a suitable adaptation of rfa to extreme waves can be found in campos and guedes soares 2016a and vanem et al 2017 so only a very short summary of the most i μ i mportant features of rfa is described below the rfa suggests that including neighboring grid points into the statistical modeling improves the estimate of probability distribution functions and hence the return values the rfa is applied in four steps 1 calculation of l moments 2 definitions of statistically homogeneous regions so called regionalization 3 probabilistic distribution choice and goodness of fit test 4 final regional quantile function from where return values are calculated a key aspect of rfa is the process of pooling grid points into homogeneous regions which can be achieved by a method originally referred to as the index flood method which was renamed to the local index method by campos et al 2018 consider a dataset at n locations with sample size n i and empirical data q i j j 1 n i let q i f 0 f 1 be the quantile function of the frequency distribution at site i the rfa assumption is that frequency distributions at n sites are nearly the same apart from a site specific factor 1 q i f μ i q f i 1 n μ i is this factor named the local index at location i which is calculated as the mean of the quantiles of interest q f is the dimensionless quantile function common to every site regional growth curve in practice the rescaled data q i j q i j μ i j 1 n i i 1 n is applied to directly calculate q f which is the dimensionless regional quantile function within a homogeneous region there is only one q f per region and it is multiplied by at each grid point to obtain the site specific quantile function and return values campos and guedes soares 2016s l moments are simple linear combinations of the commonly used probability weighted moments developed by hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 suggest using l moment ratios instead of other estimators because they can be easily applied to obtain the shape scale and location parameters of many families of probability distribution functions with the advantage of being less subjective to bias in estimation the three most important l moment ratios are l cv from coefficient of variation l skewness and l kurtosis which are the basis of the applications of rfa as l moment ratios are related to the coefficient of variation skewness and kurtosis they can be used to investigate the impact of different wave hindcasts developed in the previous section on the probabilistic domain which is intrinsic to the shape of the empirical distributions independent events were selected from the hindcast databases and a site dependent threshold was applied to select the 80 highest events at each grid point that can be used to apply the next steps of rfa as explained by campos and guedes soares 2016s fig 4 shows the l moment ratios of the default hindcast ww3cfsr d left column compared with new calibrated hindcasts ww3cfsr lr ww3cfsr lr qssw and ww3cfsr b1 66 fig 4 a1 in the first row represents the l cv where locations with higher waves and large variances more vulnerable to cyclones and extreme events have larger l cvs the second row fig 4 a2 shows the variation of the skewness in space while the third row fig 4 a3 the kurtosis in general regions close to the coast tend to have larger l skewness and l kurtosis the linear regression calibration of input winds ww3cfsr lr as well as the calibration of β m a x parameter in the wave model generated a small impact on l cv l skewness and l kurtosis which also present a smooth variation in space however the inclusion of satellite winds within the cyclones led to a large impact on the l moment ratios with very sharp variation in space for l cv ww3cfsr lr qssw produced higher values than ww3cfsr d at most sites on the other hand l skewness and l kurtosis depend strongly on location it is interesting to note that extreme events in brazil are rare in nature with occurrences mainly during the autumn and winter moreover the impact of extreme cyclones is felt on hs only after the 93rd percentile even so the adjustment of cyclonic winds substantially modifies the pattern of l moment ratios once the l moments are calculated regionalization becomes straightforward lucas et al 2011 and weiss et al 2014b studied the regionalization of extreme events of hs with interesting discussions that complement the theory of hosking and wallis 1997 basically a discordancy measure is first calculated at each grid point associated with an initial statistically homogeneous region sites with l moments completely distinct from their neighbors are excluded then a heterogeneity measure is applied to each region in order to assure a minimum level of homogeneity which allows the application of the local index method from the l moment ratio maps of fig 4 a1 a2 a3 it is possible to divide the domain into five statistically homogeneous regions the whole process can be found in the preliminary results of campos and guedes soares 2016a regionalization may appear to be a one step process but it actually depends on several re definitions of boundaries with subsequent calculations of the heterogeneous test the optimal configuration is presented in fig 5 where five regions are shown with their grid points the original high resolution of the hindcasts 0 2 leads to a high correlation at neighboring points that might compromise the assumptions of the rfa therefore the same heterogeneity test developed by hosking and wallis 1997 was applied to properly select the grid points within each region with a new resolution varying from 1 0 to 1 4 furthermore some coastal points with higher discrepancies were later excluded to generate a better homogeneity of the regions 1 2 and 3 since the focus of the present study is not on coastal waters in the next steps when analyses of each region become exhaustive region 2 followed by region 1 and 3 will be selected as locations with the most intense offshore industry ship routing and containing the most heavily populated coastal cities the basis of the local index method and the rfa is represented by fig 6 containing the empirical probability density functions for region 2 only the shaded salmon density function is the regional pdf representing the whole of region 2 and plotted on top black are the density functions of each grid point as the black densities closely follow the salmon densities with very similar shape the region can be confirmed as being homogeneous the differences among four plots a to d are related to different input data of hs from four hindcasts discussed in the last section the comparison between four plots corroborates with the previous discussion related to fig 4 the two plots b and d of fig 6 associated with hindcasts ww3cfsr lr and ww3cfsr b1 66 are similar to each other and not so different from plot a of the hindcast default ww3cfsr d it looks like these two calibration methods increase the variance and displace the mean without significantly changing the shape of the tail consequently the occurrence of higher values of hs becomes larger but the extremal behavior of the storms is not significantly modified meanwhile fig 6c from hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw where the cyclones were calibrated separately has a longer tail and a smaller peak of the density in the y axis similar comparative behavior was verified at other statistically homogeneous regions of fig 5 in terms of rfa the results so far consist of l moments calculated at each grid point for nine hindcasts which can be applied to fit nine regional quantile functions at each region another interesting investigation is the best distribution function for each region and hindcast several options of distribution functions are available and have been extensively tested sulis et al 2017 compared results from common methods of extreme wave analysis using hindcast data the authors recommend considering gpd as one of the best performing and credible candidates devis morales et al 2017 considered the distributions gumbel generalized extreme value weibull and pareto to their extreme analysis using hindcast data niroomandi et al 2018 also constructed a hindcast based on cfsr ncep winds for long term extreme analysis comparing gev and pot in the extreme value analysis besides the standard probability functions muraleedharan et al 2012 studied the davies quantile function which later you and callaghan 2013 found it overestimated the extreme quantiles in order to have a complete assessment of all distributions suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 the following distributions are considered generalized pareto distribution gpd generalized extreme value distribution gev pearson type iii pt iii weibull generalized logistic distribution gld and kappa the statistical assessments of distributions are based on goodness of fit tests followed by visual evaluation of qqplots the goodness of fit tests selected include the traditional chi squared greenwood and nikulin 1996 and kolmogorov smirnov test hazewinkel 1994 an additional test called z test suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 was also conducted to better evaluate the shape of the tail of the distributions in summary it compares the regional average kurtosis with the fitted regional distribution kurtosis divided by the standard deviation of the kurtosis within each region hosking and wallis 1997 a distribution is accepted when z 1 64 the final choice of distribution is not an easy task especially because it involves five different homogeneous regions with different wave climates nine different hindcasts six possible distribution functions and three goodness of fit tests one distribution for example can be the best for certain regions and not recommended to others the same is valid for the input hindcasts with the fact that the best skilled hindcast physical domain does not guarantee a better fit in the probabilistic domain inevitably the result will be composed of a group of best distributions but it is recommended to reduce as much as possible the number of options in order to avoid completely different distributions in neighboring regions to avoid sharp gradients at the boundaries of the regions the first assumption is whenever it is possible to select simple statistical models such as three parametric functions instead of the four parametric kappa distribution in addition a higher importance is given to the z test as well as to the test result associated with better hindcasts since the goal is to combine an accurate hindcast with a well fitted distribution analyses pointed to gpd weibull pt iii and glo as the best distributions among the options it was verified by qq plots that gpd underestimates the top percentiles while glo severely overestimates them and therefore both were excluded finally the results pointed to weibull and pt iii as the best choices with very similar results li et al 2016 also obtained good results using pt iii distribution and muraleedharan et al 2012 among many others using weibull distribution fig 7 shows the three parameters of the weibull distribution calculated for the entire domain as well as the differences between the calibrated hindcast from the default hindcast ww3cfsr d without any calibration fig 7 a1 shows the location parameter where southern locations have higher values as expected due to severe wind conditions with higher wave heights the differences between calibrated hindcasts to default ww3cfsr d for the location parameter are mostly positive over the entire domain which indicates that the new hindcasts uplifted the overall severity of the wave conditions confirming the results of campos et al 2018 fig 7 b1 and d1 have similar smooth variations in space different than c1 moving to the scale parameter of the weibull distribution plots b2 and d2 become more similar with higher values compared to ww3cfsr d at locations where the waves are higher an expected impact associated with the effect of the linear regression and uplift of β m a x parameter of wavewatch iii the largest differences between calibration methods are seen in the bottom row of plots of fig 7 related to the shape parameter plots b3 and d3 have almost no impact on the shape of the distribution for the entire domain while using blended satellites within the cyclones led to a large difference in the shape of the distribution function therefore the impacts of simplistic calibrations of b plots linear regression of wind speeds and d plots uplift of the parameter β m a x inside the wave model are reasonably similar to each other and completely different from c plots improvement of cyclonic areas using satellite data in fig 7 regarding the weibull distribution the strong and intrinsic relationship between extreme winds and extreme waves in the probabilistic domain has also recently been studied by jones et al 2018 4 impact of hindcasts and distributions on extrapolated quantiles section 2 studied wind and wave calibrations and defined the best hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw while section 3 studied regional frequency analysis and defined the best distributions for the south and southeast of brazil weibull and pt iii before fitting these distributions to the input data from ww3cfsr lr qssw which would provide the most reliable results it is essential to evaluate the impact of such differences on the extrapolation quantiles unless very long measurements covering several decades are available which is rare the calculation of return values involves extrapolation this process is discussed by goda 2010 hosking and wallis 1997 and recently by orimolade et al 2016 who also performed an extreme wave analysis based on hindcast data norwegian reanalysis 10 km nora10 they also highlight the importance of investigating different statistical methods for quantile extrapolations and concluded that although it is difficult to define the best statistical procedure the results give knowledge of the possible range of extrapolated significant wave heights the process of extrapolation inevitably amplifies the uncertainties and errors contained in the input dataset and distribution fit e g guedes soares and scotto 2001 coles 2007 explains how to turn return period years into probability of non exceedance that is applied to the quantile function inverse of the cdf to obtain the return value hosking and wallis 1997 provide a practical explanation on how to replicate the process using rfa once the local indexes μ ˆ i are calculated for each site and the regional quantile function q ˆ is estimated the final quantile function at each site is obtained by applying equation 1 therefore the l moments are used to estimate q ˆ f that is multiplied by the local index to obtain n quantile functions q ˆ i f at each site i finally q ˆ i f can be traditionally extrapolated with the probability of non exceedance f obtained as campos and guedes soares 2016a 2 f 1 p 1 1 n e n e r p n y where n is the total number of independent events used to calculate the l moments and distribution parameters y the duration of the input data r p the return period years n e the expected number of events to occur in r p years and p is the probability of occurrence fig 8 represents the regional quantile function of region 2 analyzing the impact of steps i and iii described in the introduction associated with the hindcasts and distributions on extreme values with return periods of up to 100 years fig 8 a shows the return values calculated using the weibull distribution applied to the nine hindcasts constructed by campos et al 2018 and described in section 2 as expected the hindcasts that severely underestimate the measurements for example ww3cfsr d present the lowest return values while the hindcast completely forced with satellite wind data ww3sw which overestimates the measurements resulted in very high return values although providing a small impact on the very high percentiles the linear regression has been shown to increase the extrapolated waves cyan curve of fig 8 a by approximately 10 however the proper correction of cyclonic winds using satellite ww3cfsr lr qssw added around 0 4 m approximately 6 to the 100 year wave on top of the hindcast ww3cfsr lr devis morales et al 2017 discussed that underestimated wave modeling events can lead to smaller return values than expected which is quantified by fig 8 a in the southeast of brazil fig 8 b shows the six distribution functions applied to the best hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw it confirms the large overestimation of glo and underestimation of gpd as discussed previously the distributions pt iii and weibull generate very similar return values even for long return periods fig 8 c illustrates a combination of nine hindcasts and six distributions composing 54 different growth curves the large spread of this combination increases with return periods and for 100 years the return values of hs can vary from 6 3 to 9 7 m fig 8 c shows the spread of the extrapolated quantiles but in the present case it does not represent the uncertainty of the results because the input errors of the hindcasts and the goodness of fit tests of the distributions have been studied therefore by excluding the hindcasts with low skills and the distributions with poor fits it is possible to narrow the spread down finally by selecting the most accurate hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw and the distribution with the best fit weibull it is possible to apply the last steps of the rfa and equations 2 and 3 to obtain reliable regional growth curves for the five regions of fig 5 results are presented in fig 9 where the return values are plotted together with the 95 confidence intervals for regions 1 2 and 3 these regional quantile functions can be utilized to easily obtain at site quantile functions using local indexes μ ˆ i for each grid point as stated by vanem et al 2017 rfa produces narrower uncertainty bounds and more robust estimation of extreme quantiles which is confirmed by the dashed lines close to the solid lines of fig 9 even for longer return periods thus from fig 9 it is possible to directly extract return values and 95 confidence intervals for several return periods for different applications and interests as initially described typically 10 20 50 and 100 years using rfa the same is valid for any grid point shown by fig 5 which emphasizes the great practical value of such methodology the main physical explanation for the progressive increasing of extreme quantiles of hs when moving from region 1 to region 3 towards the south is the fetch positioning of cyclones reboita et al 2010 studied the climatology of cyclogenesis and cyclone tracks in the south atlantic ocean and campos et al 2012 analyzed the impact on the extreme wave climate it works as a balance between location and intensity where the most extreme winds are mainly located at southern latitudes with large fetches that propagate eastwards it generates the highest waves in brazil with south and southwest directions that propagate dispersively towards the north passing from the southernmost states of brazil region 3 to the southeast of the country region 2 until it reaches region 1 with a calmer wave climate and higher influence from the semi stationary anticyclone therefore the influence of extra tropical cyclones in region 3 leads to a longer tail and high variance while the smaller waves and strong influence of calm to moderate winds from the subtropical anticyclone in region 1 lead to a shorter tail and smaller variance these regional differences in the wind and wave climates were successfully captured by the rfa methodology 5 final discussion this paper has investigated the sensitivity of extrapolated quantiles of significant wave height to different hindcast calibration methods and distribution functions using a spatial approach the wave modeling and hindcast construction is based on campos et al 2018 and preliminary developments of the statistical modeling are presented by campos and guedes soares 2016 the long discussion involving these two studies as well as results presented in the previous sections can be summarized by figs 7 and 8 the linear calibration of the input winds and the uplift of the parameter β m a x within the wave model are important to reduce the severe underestimation of ww3cfsr d as pointed to by fig 8 a but it did not improve the shape of the tail of the distributions associated with extreme events fig 7 b3 and d3 campos et al 2018 concludes that the proper calibration of cyclonic winds leads to an improvement of extreme percentiles above the 93rd level as well as the accuracy at the peak of storms looking at the physical domain only moving to the probabilistic domain the consequence of such calibration is the impact on the shape of the empirical distribution function fig 6 and consequently the shape parameter of weibull distribution fig 7 c3 therefore the linear regression calibration of the surface winds and the uplift of β m a x within the wave model are important to displace the l cv and location parameter while proper calibration of the cyclonic areas is essential to improve the l skewness l kurtosis and the shape parameter of the distribution functions as a reminder campos et al 2018 reduced the underestimation of the peak of storms from 14 to 8 but there is still space for further improvements that are essential for long term extreme analyses one suggestion is to test the wind corrections based on post processing techniques developed by larsen et al 2012 and larsen et al 2015 which focused on the spectral and probabilistic domains to develop a clever and practical calibration of hindcasts under extreme events another relevant step is to consider the study of babanin et al 2012 and kim et al 2016 who applied a coupled model umcm that integrates ocean atmospheric and wave components to produce current wind and wave data under extreme conditions the coupling of numerical models integrated with data assimilation techniques is essential to further improve the simulation of extreme waves regarding fig 9 and reliable results it is important to highlight that from the five steps involving extreme analysis initially described only steps i and iii have been addressed here although the present study applied a non conventional hindcast technique and robust statistical modeling it did not count for historical trends that may subsist in long term datasets as studied by muraleedharan et al 2016 in order to properly handle this problem vanem 2015 developed non stationary extreme value models to analyze trends in the wave climate due to climate change his results suggest that intra period trends are not significant however statistically significant inter period changes are important and the effect of a climatic trend should be considered especially for longer time periods a thorough analysis of the inter annual variability of extreme hs must be performed by identifying the synoptic patterns that generate extreme waves together with its variability looking at the climate system as a whole as performed by izaguirre et al 2012 another study to consider for further improvements is niroomandi et al 2018 who characterized the spatial and temporal variabilities of extreme hs and long term trends by applying an empirical orthogonal function analysis 6 conclusions based on previous studies such as goda 2010 orimolade et al 2016 and jones et al 2018 we believe that the accuracy of hindcast data is essential for long term extreme value analyses however when time is a constraint simplistic solutions tend to be applied to improve the reliability of wave hindcasts under extreme conditions including linear regression of input winds and quick modifications in the numerical wave model it has been shown that they are indeed useful to reduce the severe underestimation of extrapolated quantiles of hs by approximately 10 fig 8a but it is well known that the extreme conditions in brazil are associated with cyclones campos et al 2012 and the specific calibration of fetches is essential which leads to an additional increase of approximately 6 of the return values linked to 100 years return periods in brazil the application of the rfa extends these improvements by increasing the robustness of the statistical model when several grid points inside a homogeneous region are pooled together as well as carefully choosing the best distribution function using the z test which better evaluates the shape of the distribution tails an important topic in this study therefore we conclude that calibrations of input hindcasts when applied to evas should not only improve the bias and rmse of the bulk statistics which displace the mean and increase the variance of the distributions but should also improve the representation of the shape of the distribution by carefully handling the cyclonic winds results of rfa applied to properly calibrated wave hindcasts led to 100 year hs of 9 5 m in the south of brazil and 6 5 m in the southeast of brazil with local indexes calculated at each grid point with a resolution of 12 which make it possible to quickly obtain a precise return value at each site finally although the evas have been segmented into several steps using hindcast data estimating extreme events should always consider the process as a whole considering the hindcast uncertainties studied by cavaleri et al 2007 and rogers et al 2012 as well as the statistical uncertainties studied by orimolade et al 2016 and jones et al 2018 among others moreover despite the advances in these areas and future methodologies yet to come we believe that long term in situ observation campaigns will always be essential to guarantee reliable estimation of return values especially in the south atlantic ocean acknowledgments the

22878,long term extreme wave analysis is performed using a spatial approach applied to hindcast data to study the sensitivity of extrapolated quantiles of significant wave height to different hindcast calibration methods and distribution functions the probabilistic moments and l moments are analyzed as well as several extreme value distribution functions the estimation of extreme values is addressed in two parts 1 numerical modeling of wind and wave hindcasts with improved accuracy under extreme conditions 2 investigation and tests of fit of extreme value distributions using the regional frequency analysis therefore the main goal of this paper is to show how hindcast data calibrated to account for extreme events can influence and improve return value estimates results show that simplistic calibrations such as a linear regression applied to input winds and quick modifications on the numerical wave model do not significantly improve the representation of the peak of storms which has a small impact on the reliability of shape parameters of the quantile functions the construction of a new wave hindcast using satellite winds inside extreme cyclones led to a reduction of the bias at higher percentiles and additional improvement of the distribution tail and its shape these elements combined with a robust extreme analysis methodology such as the regional frequency analysis and thorough choice of the distribution function produced reliable spatial return values of significant wave height keywords extreme waves regional frequency analysis hindcast uncertainty long term distributions extreme value analysis 1 introduction extreme values of significant wave height are among the most important parameters for design and management of offshore platforms coastal structures ship routing and harbors thus accurate estimations of long term extreme quantiles also referred to as return values are extremely important for several activities in coastal and open waters including general marine safety when considering the significant wave height hs this accuracy is even more important due to the quadratic dependence of wave energy to hs as discussed by dean and dalrymple 1991 among others the extreme value analysis eva is the area of statistics that has been developed for decades addressing the extrapolation of probabilistic distribution functions adjusted to historical datasets embrechets et al 1997 coles 2007 and goda 2010 have careful theoretical descriptions of eva the main goal is to calculate reliable extreme values for a variety of return periods such as 10 years typically for tow routes 20 years for ship designs 50 and 100 years for oil gas platforms and coastal structures and 1000 years for areas vulnerable to hurricanes such statistical parameters are also important to the renewable energy sector that has rapidly expanded during the last few years as studied by viselli et al 2015 an interesting discussion about extreme waves and their impact on coasts and society is provided by hansom et al 2015 the process of calculating return values involves some steps including i selection of long and reliable input datasets ii definition of statistically independent events iii analysis and choice of optimal distribution functions that properly represent the extreme percentiles iv extrapolation of the cumulative distribution function to certain probabilities of non exceedance associated with long return periods and v calculation of confidence intervals for the return values each step is vulnerable to uncertainties and different sources of errors that can be difficult to identify and to track which become important issues larsen et al 2015 orimolade et al 2016 investigated the uncertainty of extreme waves fitted to hindcast data jones et al 2018 recently quantified the uncertainty in estimation of extreme winds and waves using bayesian analysis the first step to select the input dataset depends on the availability of long and high quality measurements with a good sampling rate ferreira and guedes soares 1998 have applied the peaks over threshold pot approach to buoy data from the portuguese coast while sartini et al 2015 obtained return values of hs along the italian coast based on hindcast data and buoy data applying the pot approach however due to a lack of observations extreme wave analysis is often based directly on numerical wave hindcasts li et al 2016 which imposes additional sources of errors regions of the globe with less in situ measurements e g heave pitch roll buoys such as the south atlantic ocean become more dependent on hindcast data for the application of evas furthermore the small density of measurements at certain locations impacts on the data assimilation process of numerical simulations which also increases the errors of hindcasts especially under extreme conditions campos et al 2018 based on these questions the present paper studies the process of estimating extreme quantiles of hs using properly calibrated hindcast data from the south atlantic mainly in the area offshore of brazil the main goal is to use different hindcasts and probability density functions as sensitivity tests analyzing the impact on the probabilistic moments distribution parameters and extrapolated quantiles therefore the focus is on steps i and iii listed above one may ask why not simply use altimeter data when buoy measurements are not available however satellites with polar orbit have coarse time sampling at fixed locations cooper and forristall 1997 that is insufficient to properly represent the peak of storms which is critical for extreme wave analyses as discussed by alves and young 2004 the study of robinson and tawn 2000 found that the effect of the observation frequency of altimeters can lead to an underestimation of the return values of up to 15 wimmer et al 2006 obtained return values from satellite data that are 37 smaller than those estimated by fitting distribution to all the data indeed satellite observations are valuable sources of information especially due to spatial coverage and support in hindcast calibration however the application of eva using satellite data solely is not recommended in order to study extreme values over the domain covering the southern areas of brazil as well as evaluating the regional impacts of different hindcasts and distributions a spatial approach of extreme analysis becomes necessary the use of spatial statistics is growing very fast in recent years lerma et al 2015 compares two methods of extreme analysis using a spatial approach their implemented statistical processing method was based on the approach of bernardara et al 2014 using the rfa for pot samples the regional frequency analysis rfa based on l moments developed by hosking and wallis 1997 is a robust and practical method that has been widely applied in environmental analyses over the last few years lucas et al 2012a 2012b weiss et al 2014a campos and guedes soares 2016a 2018 and vanem et al 2017 are examples of applications of rfa to calculate regional extreme waves using hindcast data the rfa exploits the information from similar sites inside a statistically homogeneous region by assuming common extremal behavior in the region weiss et al 2014a the method derives from the fact that more robust results can be reached by pooling all data samples together than by using only a single sample campos and guedes soares 2016a therefore the extreme analysis and estimation of return values were performed entirely based on the rfa and the theory of hosking and wallis 1997 section 2 is devoted to numerical modeling hindcast construction and assessments the wind and wave hindcasts utilized in this paper were developed and described by alves et al 2017 and campos et al 2018 based on modified ncep winds and calibrated wavewatch iii simulations section 3 is dedicated to the rfa and extrapolation process section 4 presents the most important results and discussion addressing the impact of hindcasts and distributions on return values sections 5 and 6 summarize the discussion conclusions and recommendations for future studies 2 wave hindcasting south and southeastern brazilian waters are strongly affected by low pressure atmospheric systems especially in the autumn and winter with strong winds from the southwest and waves from the south the most extreme conditions of winds storm surges and waves are associated with sub tropical and extra tropical cyclones as discussed by campos et al 2012 the brazilian wave climate was investigated by parente 1999 and pinho 2003 where the most extreme waves recorded reached 7 m of significant wave height the combination of cyclogenetic areas with lack of in situ measurements creates challenging conditions to construct accurate wind and wave hindcasts of extreme events teixeira et al 1995 and holthuijsen et al 1996 among others have emphasized the importance of accurate wind fields in the ability of wave models to properly determine the wave fields cavaleri et al 2007 and rogers et al 2012 discuss the uncertainties and source of errors associated with numerical wave modeling the impact of such errors goes beyond the misrepresented peak of the storms usually assessed as high root mean square errors rmse and low correlation coefficients cc but it also impacts on the probabilistic domain i e the misrepresentation of probabilistic moments and the tail of the distributions fig 1 for example shows a comparison between two probability densities from a metocean buoy measurement and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep saha et al 2010 besides the underestimated winds of cfsr compared to the measurements the impact on the probabilistic domain is remarkable especially considering the large discrepancy of skewness in the left plot of fig 1 the first aspect to consider is the complexity of the behavior of the errors involving atmospheric reanalyses campos and guedes soares 2016b 2017 have studied the spatial distribution errors among various commonly used reanalyses in the north atlantic considering both the input winds and the produced wave fields looking at the average and extreme conditions the differences can be more severe during cyclones as is illustrated by fig 2 when a strong cyclone generated at the mouth of rio de la plata forced extreme waves towards the coast of argentina uruguay and brazil fig 2a and b highlight the irregular distribution of the error of 10 m winds in space the largest cfsr errors are contained within the cyclone with most areas underestimated and a few locations where cfsr overestimates the satellite winds far from the cyclone errors tend to be smaller indicating the difficulties of cfsr to represent turbulent and stormy conditions in particular larsen et al 2012 analyzed this problem associated with numerical simulations pointing to the effect of small temporal and spatial resolutions of reanalysis which is reflected in the spectral domain as an energy deficit in the mesoscale range fig 2d presents the heterogeneous occurrence of cyclones in the western portions of the south atlantic ocean with hot colors indicating locations where cfsr is expected to present less accurate winds therefore based on fig 2 it is possible to visualize that reanalysis winds the most important source of errors in wave modeling in deep waters according to cavaleri et al 2007 have a very complex distribution of errors this depends on location severity and meteorological system it suggests that simplistic linear regression calibration functions are possibly insufficient to properly improve the representation of surface winds under extreme conditions inspired by this problem alves et al 2017 developed and compared two wind calibration methods the first is a univariate linear regression function with parameters estimated from metocean buoys a quick and simple solution widely applied by consultancies in the private sector the second is a new method where cyclonic winds extreme intensities are separated from the background fields mild intensities and then calibrated independently the cyclonic winds where cfsr reaches up to 25 of underestimation are blended with scatterometers using the quikscat jpl 2001 and seawinds ncdc noaa zhang et al 2006 databases the non cyclonic winds with much smaller errors up to 5 can be calibrated using a linear regression or can remain without any calibration the new cyclonic winds are then re inserted into the background field to compose the final wind data this novel method is inspired by kurihara et al 1993 details and results about it can be found in alves et al 2017 and campos et al 2018 the inclusion of scatterometer data within the cyclones creates wind fields with more detailed information inside a turbulent area where mesoscale processes and sharp contours intensify the wind speeds the discussion about the temporal and spatial scale of extreme events is extremely important as addressed by larsén et al 2015 and larsén et al 2012 who developed approaches for correcting the smoothing effect from numerical models which deteriorate extreme wind quantiles the inclusion of satellite data as proposed by alves et al 2017 already addresses this issue in a different way focused on the most important areas inside the storms campos et al 2018 took the new wind databases constructed by alves et al 2017 together with the original cfsr winds to analyze the impact of different wind calibrations on the wave fields using wavewatch iii tolman et al 2014 furthermore an additional calibration is applied to the source terms st4 ardhuin et al 2010 of wavewatch iii where the parameter β m a x that controls the transfer of momentum from the surface wind to the wave spectrum is modified four different β m a x were tested the default 1 33 from tolman et al 2014 for ncep winds and higher values of 1 44 1 55 and 1 66 the impact of different β m a x on the accuracy of the model is thoroughly analyzed by campos et al 2018 the wind and wave calibrations led to nine wave hindcasts presented in table 1 which are applied as inputs to the evas and return value calculations in the next section all wave hindcasts have the same time and space resolution of 1 h and 12 respectively besides the results of campos et al 2018 fig 3 shows an additional illustration of the surface winds and the effect of calibrations on the wave fields it is possible to see side by side the different input winds and the impact on the significant wave heights the anomaly field is plotted instead of the variables themselves in order to highlight the differences where hot colors indicate that the new winds and waves are greater than the reference fig 3 a1 and fig 3 a2 without any calibration and cold colors where new winds and waves are lower than the reference map fig 3 b1 and b2 are the most different from the default hindcasts because they are entirely based on a completely independent wind source the seawinds database maps of fig 3 c1 and c2 associated with the calibration using a linear regression uplift the intensities by a small amount around 6 but it is insufficient to correct the underestimation of cyclonic winds that can reach 25 plots of fig 3 d1 and d2 shows the effect of the new methodology proposed by alves et al 2017 and campos et al 2018 where the cfsr winds for non cyclonic areas which are shown to have very good skill are maintained while the cyclonic winds are corrected campos et al 2018 performed a detailed assessment of the wave hindcasts using altimeter and buoy data including an important evaluation of hs error as a function of sea severity by using increasing percentiles the authors argued that proper calibration of cyclonic winds produced a better representation of the peak of storms mainly above the 93rd percentile however under non cyclonic conditions or when the wind fetch is extremely large winds still required some calibration the combination of both calibrations of hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw in fig 3 e1 and e2 led to the best results with linear regression applied to ambient conditions and satellite data merged inside the cyclones the main goal of campos et al 2018 was to correct the large deterioration of the hindcast with increasing percentiles severity they found that modifying the parameter β m a x of wavewatch iii generates similar results to calibrating wind intensity with a linear regression function it reduces the bias but has a minor impact on the rmse and the correlation coefficient cc most importantly these simplistic calibration methods do not correct the increase of bias with percentile this was only achieved by properly improving the cyclonic winds separately the new methodology allowed the percentage error of hs to reduce from 14 to less than 8 for extreme waves when compared to altimeter and buoy data campos et al 2018 although observations still retain errors that cannot be neglected they have much higher accuracy and precision than non calibrated wave hindcasts janssen et al 2007 for example estimated and compared the errors of hs from buoys satellites and models providing an interesting discussion on this matter the next step is now entering these different wave hindcasts on the statistical model to evaluate the impact on the probabilistic domain li et al 2016 constructed different hindcasts with distinct wind fields applied to long term extreme wave analyses instead of using wavewatch iii they used the wave model wam4 and surface winds from ecmwf and ncep li et al 2016 concluded that the hindcast forced by winds from ecmwf are better than those forced by ncep winds however it is well known that wam4 source terms and parameterization are optimized for ecmwf winds while the wavewatch iii model nowadays has the option of optimized parameters for both ecmwf and ncep winds tolman et al 2014 the use of ncep winds as well as the wavewacth iii model is justified in campos et al 2018 3 long term extremes using regional frequency analysis the assessment and analysis of return values based on different hindcasts using a single location would have a very low statistical significance for this reason regional frequency analysis becomes crucial the complete development of the theory and instructions for practical applications are described by hosking and wallis 1997 a suitable adaptation of rfa to extreme waves can be found in campos and guedes soares 2016a and vanem et al 2017 so only a very short summary of the most i μ i mportant features of rfa is described below the rfa suggests that including neighboring grid points into the statistical modeling improves the estimate of probability distribution functions and hence the return values the rfa is applied in four steps 1 calculation of l moments 2 definitions of statistically homogeneous regions so called regionalization 3 probabilistic distribution choice and goodness of fit test 4 final regional quantile function from where return values are calculated a key aspect of rfa is the process of pooling grid points into homogeneous regions which can be achieved by a method originally referred to as the index flood method which was renamed to the local index method by campos et al 2018 consider a dataset at n locations with sample size n i and empirical data q i j j 1 n i let q i f 0 f 1 be the quantile function of the frequency distribution at site i the rfa assumption is that frequency distributions at n sites are nearly the same apart from a site specific factor 1 q i f μ i q f i 1 n μ i is this factor named the local index at location i which is calculated as the mean of the quantiles of interest q f is the dimensionless quantile function common to every site regional growth curve in practice the rescaled data q i j q i j μ i j 1 n i i 1 n is applied to directly calculate q f which is the dimensionless regional quantile function within a homogeneous region there is only one q f per region and it is multiplied by at each grid point to obtain the site specific quantile function and return values campos and guedes soares 2016s l moments are simple linear combinations of the commonly used probability weighted moments developed by hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 suggest using l moment ratios instead of other estimators because they can be easily applied to obtain the shape scale and location parameters of many families of probability distribution functions with the advantage of being less subjective to bias in estimation the three most important l moment ratios are l cv from coefficient of variation l skewness and l kurtosis which are the basis of the applications of rfa as l moment ratios are related to the coefficient of variation skewness and kurtosis they can be used to investigate the impact of different wave hindcasts developed in the previous section on the probabilistic domain which is intrinsic to the shape of the empirical distributions independent events were selected from the hindcast databases and a site dependent threshold was applied to select the 80 highest events at each grid point that can be used to apply the next steps of rfa as explained by campos and guedes soares 2016s fig 4 shows the l moment ratios of the default hindcast ww3cfsr d left column compared with new calibrated hindcasts ww3cfsr lr ww3cfsr lr qssw and ww3cfsr b1 66 fig 4 a1 in the first row represents the l cv where locations with higher waves and large variances more vulnerable to cyclones and extreme events have larger l cvs the second row fig 4 a2 shows the variation of the skewness in space while the third row fig 4 a3 the kurtosis in general regions close to the coast tend to have larger l skewness and l kurtosis the linear regression calibration of input winds ww3cfsr lr as well as the calibration of β m a x parameter in the wave model generated a small impact on l cv l skewness and l kurtosis which also present a smooth variation in space however the inclusion of satellite winds within the cyclones led to a large impact on the l moment ratios with very sharp variation in space for l cv ww3cfsr lr qssw produced higher values than ww3cfsr d at most sites on the other hand l skewness and l kurtosis depend strongly on location it is interesting to note that extreme events in brazil are rare in nature with occurrences mainly during the autumn and winter moreover the impact of extreme cyclones is felt on hs only after the 93rd percentile even so the adjustment of cyclonic winds substantially modifies the pattern of l moment ratios once the l moments are calculated regionalization becomes straightforward lucas et al 2011 and weiss et al 2014b studied the regionalization of extreme events of hs with interesting discussions that complement the theory of hosking and wallis 1997 basically a discordancy measure is first calculated at each grid point associated with an initial statistically homogeneous region sites with l moments completely distinct from their neighbors are excluded then a heterogeneity measure is applied to each region in order to assure a minimum level of homogeneity which allows the application of the local index method from the l moment ratio maps of fig 4 a1 a2 a3 it is possible to divide the domain into five statistically homogeneous regions the whole process can be found in the preliminary results of campos and guedes soares 2016a regionalization may appear to be a one step process but it actually depends on several re definitions of boundaries with subsequent calculations of the heterogeneous test the optimal configuration is presented in fig 5 where five regions are shown with their grid points the original high resolution of the hindcasts 0 2 leads to a high correlation at neighboring points that might compromise the assumptions of the rfa therefore the same heterogeneity test developed by hosking and wallis 1997 was applied to properly select the grid points within each region with a new resolution varying from 1 0 to 1 4 furthermore some coastal points with higher discrepancies were later excluded to generate a better homogeneity of the regions 1 2 and 3 since the focus of the present study is not on coastal waters in the next steps when analyses of each region become exhaustive region 2 followed by region 1 and 3 will be selected as locations with the most intense offshore industry ship routing and containing the most heavily populated coastal cities the basis of the local index method and the rfa is represented by fig 6 containing the empirical probability density functions for region 2 only the shaded salmon density function is the regional pdf representing the whole of region 2 and plotted on top black are the density functions of each grid point as the black densities closely follow the salmon densities with very similar shape the region can be confirmed as being homogeneous the differences among four plots a to d are related to different input data of hs from four hindcasts discussed in the last section the comparison between four plots corroborates with the previous discussion related to fig 4 the two plots b and d of fig 6 associated with hindcasts ww3cfsr lr and ww3cfsr b1 66 are similar to each other and not so different from plot a of the hindcast default ww3cfsr d it looks like these two calibration methods increase the variance and displace the mean without significantly changing the shape of the tail consequently the occurrence of higher values of hs becomes larger but the extremal behavior of the storms is not significantly modified meanwhile fig 6c from hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw where the cyclones were calibrated separately has a longer tail and a smaller peak of the density in the y axis similar comparative behavior was verified at other statistically homogeneous regions of fig 5 in terms of rfa the results so far consist of l moments calculated at each grid point for nine hindcasts which can be applied to fit nine regional quantile functions at each region another interesting investigation is the best distribution function for each region and hindcast several options of distribution functions are available and have been extensively tested sulis et al 2017 compared results from common methods of extreme wave analysis using hindcast data the authors recommend considering gpd as one of the best performing and credible candidates devis morales et al 2017 considered the distributions gumbel generalized extreme value weibull and pareto to their extreme analysis using hindcast data niroomandi et al 2018 also constructed a hindcast based on cfsr ncep winds for long term extreme analysis comparing gev and pot in the extreme value analysis besides the standard probability functions muraleedharan et al 2012 studied the davies quantile function which later you and callaghan 2013 found it overestimated the extreme quantiles in order to have a complete assessment of all distributions suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 the following distributions are considered generalized pareto distribution gpd generalized extreme value distribution gev pearson type iii pt iii weibull generalized logistic distribution gld and kappa the statistical assessments of distributions are based on goodness of fit tests followed by visual evaluation of qqplots the goodness of fit tests selected include the traditional chi squared greenwood and nikulin 1996 and kolmogorov smirnov test hazewinkel 1994 an additional test called z test suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 was also conducted to better evaluate the shape of the tail of the distributions in summary it compares the regional average kurtosis with the fitted regional distribution kurtosis divided by the standard deviation of the kurtosis within each region hosking and wallis 1997 a distribution is accepted when z 1 64 the final choice of distribution is not an easy task especially because it involves five different homogeneous regions with different wave climates nine different hindcasts six possible distribution functions and three goodness of fit tests one distribution for example can be the best for certain regions and not recommended to others the same is valid for the input hindcasts with the fact that the best skilled hindcast physical domain does not guarantee a better fit in the probabilistic domain inevitably the result will be composed of a group of best distributions but it is recommended to reduce as much as possible the number of options in order to avoid completely different distributions in neighboring regions to avoid sharp gradients at the boundaries of the regions the first assumption is whenever it is possible to select simple statistical models such as three parametric functions instead of the four parametric kappa distribution in addition a higher importance is given to the z test as well as to the test result associated with better hindcasts since the goal is to combine an accurate hindcast with a well fitted distribution analyses pointed to gpd weibull pt iii and glo as the best distributions among the options it was verified by qq plots that gpd underestimates the top percentiles while glo severely overestimates them and therefore both were excluded finally the results pointed to weibull and pt iii as the best choices with very similar results li et al 2016 also obtained good results using pt iii distribution and muraleedharan et al 2012 among many others using weibull distribution fig 7 shows the three parameters of the weibull distribution calculated for the entire domain as well as the differences between the calibrated hindcast from the default hindcast ww3cfsr d without any calibration fig 7 a1 shows the location parameter where southern locations have higher values as expected due to severe wind conditions with higher wave heights the differences between calibrated hindcasts to default ww3cfsr d for the location parameter are mostly positive over the entire domain which indicates that the new hindcasts uplifted the overall severity of the wave conditions confirming the results of campos et al 2018 fig 7 b1 and d1 have similar smooth variations in space different than c1 moving to the scale parameter of the weibull distribution plots b2 and d2 become more similar with higher values compared to ww3cfsr d at locations where the waves are higher an expected impact associated with the effect of the linear regression and uplift of β m a x parameter of wavewatch iii the largest differences between calibration methods are seen in the bottom row of plots of fig 7 related to the shape parameter plots b3 and d3 have almost no impact on the shape of the distribution for the entire domain while using blended satellites within the cyclones led to a large difference in the shape of the distribution function therefore the impacts of simplistic calibrations of b plots linear regression of wind speeds and d plots uplift of the parameter β m a x inside the wave model are reasonably similar to each other and completely different from c plots improvement of cyclonic areas using satellite data in fig 7 regarding the weibull distribution the strong and intrinsic relationship between extreme winds and extreme waves in the probabilistic domain has also recently been studied by jones et al 2018 4 impact of hindcasts and distributions on extrapolated quantiles section 2 studied wind and wave calibrations and defined the best hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw while section 3 studied regional frequency analysis and defined the best distributions for the south and southeast of brazil weibull and pt iii before fitting these distributions to the input data from ww3cfsr lr qssw which would provide the most reliable results it is essential to evaluate the impact of such differences on the extrapolation quantiles unless very long measurements covering several decades are available which is rare the calculation of return values involves extrapolation this process is discussed by goda 2010 hosking and wallis 1997 and recently by orimolade et al 2016 who also performed an extreme wave analysis based on hindcast data norwegian reanalysis 10 km nora10 they also highlight the importance of investigating different statistical methods for quantile extrapolations and concluded that although it is difficult to define the best statistical procedure the results give knowledge of the possible range of extrapolated significant wave heights the process of extrapolation inevitably amplifies the uncertainties and errors contained in the input dataset and distribution fit e g guedes soares and scotto 2001 coles 2007 explains how to turn return period years into probability of non exceedance that is applied to the quantile function inverse of the cdf to obtain the return value hosking and wallis 1997 provide a practical explanation on how to replicate the process using rfa once the local indexes μ ˆ i are calculated for each site and the regional quantile function q ˆ is estimated the final quantile function at each site is obtained by applying equation 1 therefore the l moments are used to estimate q ˆ f that is multiplied by the local index to obtain n quantile functions q ˆ i f at each site i finally q ˆ i f can be traditionally extrapolated with the probability of non exceedance f obtained as campos and guedes soares 2016a 2 f 1 p 1 1 n e n e r p n y where n is the total number of independent events used to calculate the l moments and distribution parameters y the duration of the input data r p the return period years n e the expected number of events to occur in r p years and p is the probability of occurrence fig 8 represents the regional quantile function of region 2 analyzing the impact of steps i and iii described in the introduction associated with the hindcasts and distributions on extreme values with return periods of up to 100 years fig 8 a shows the return values calculated using the weibull distribution applied to the nine hindcasts constructed by campos et al 2018 and described in section 2 as expected the hindcasts that severely underestimate the measurements for example ww3cfsr d present the lowest return values while the hindcast completely forced with satellite wind data ww3sw which overestimates the measurements resulted in very high return values although providing a small impact on the very high percentiles the linear regression has been shown to increase the extrapolated waves cyan curve of fig 8 a by approximately 10 however the proper correction of cyclonic winds using satellite ww3cfsr lr qssw added around 0 4 m approximately 6 to the 100 year wave on top of the hindcast ww3cfsr lr devis morales et al 2017 discussed that underestimated wave modeling events can lead to smaller return values than expected which is quantified by fig 8 a in the southeast of brazil fig 8 b shows the six distribution functions applied to the best hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw it confirms the large overestimation of glo and underestimation of gpd as discussed previously the distributions pt iii and weibull generate very similar return values even for long return periods fig 8 c illustrates a combination of nine hindcasts and six distributions composing 54 different growth curves the large spread of this combination increases with return periods and for 100 years the return values of hs can vary from 6 3 to 9 7 m fig 8 c shows the spread of the extrapolated quantiles but in the present case it does not represent the uncertainty of the results because the input errors of the hindcasts and the goodness of fit tests of the distributions have been studied therefore by excluding the hindcasts with low skills and the distributions with poor fits it is possible to narrow the spread down finally by selecting the most accurate hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw and the distribution with the best fit weibull it is possible to apply the last steps of the rfa and equations 2 and 3 to obtain reliable regional growth curves for the five regions of fig 5 results are presented in fig 9 where the return values are plotted together with the 95 confidence intervals for regions 1 2 and 3 these regional quantile functions can be utilized to easily obtain at site quantile functions using local indexes μ ˆ i for each grid point as stated by vanem et al 2017 rfa produces narrower uncertainty bounds and more robust estimation of extreme quantiles which is confirmed by the dashed lines close to the solid lines of fig 9 even for longer return periods thus from fig 9 it is possible to directly extract return values and 95 confidence intervals for several return periods for different applications and interests as initially described typically 10 20 50 and 100 years using rfa the same is valid for any grid point shown by fig 5 which emphasizes the great practical value of such methodology the main physical explanation for the progressive increasing of extreme quantiles of hs when moving from region 1 to region 3 towards the south is the fetch positioning of cyclones reboita et al 2010 studied the climatology of cyclogenesis and cyclone tracks in the south atlantic ocean and campos et al 2012 analyzed the impact on the extreme wave climate it works as a balance between location and intensity where the most extreme winds are mainly located at southern latitudes with large fetches that propagate eastwards it generates the highest waves in brazil with south and southwest directions that propagate dispersively towards the north passing from the southernmost states of brazil region 3 to the southeast of the country region 2 until it reaches region 1 with a calmer wave climate and higher influence from the semi stationary anticyclone therefore the influence of extra tropical cyclones in region 3 leads to a longer tail and high variance while the smaller waves and strong influence of calm to moderate winds from the subtropical anticyclone in region 1 lead to a shorter tail and smaller variance these regional differences in the wind and wave climates were successfully captured by the rfa methodology 5 final discussion this paper has investigated the sensitivity of extrapolated quantiles of significant wave height to different hindcast calibration methods and distribution functions using a spatial approach the wave modeling and hindcast construction is based on campos et al 2018 and preliminary developments of the statistical modeling are presented by campos and guedes soares 2016 the long discussion involving these two studies as well as results presented in the previous sections can be summarized by figs 7 and 8 the linear calibration of the input winds and the uplift of the parameter β m a x within the wave model are important to reduce the severe underestimation of ww3cfsr d as pointed to by fig 8 a but it did not improve the shape of the tail of the distributions associated with extreme events fig 7 b3 and d3 campos et al 2018 concludes that the proper calibration of cyclonic winds leads to an improvement of extreme percentiles above the 93rd level as well as the accuracy at the peak of storms looking at the physical domain only moving to the probabilistic domain the consequence of such calibration is the impact on the shape of the empirical distribution function fig 6 and consequently the shape parameter of weibull distribution fig 7 c3 therefore the linear regression calibration of the surface winds and the uplift of β m a x within the wave model are important to displace the l cv and location parameter while proper calibration of the cyclonic areas is essential to improve the l skewness l kurtosis and the shape parameter of the distribution functions as a reminder campos et al 2018 reduced the underestimation of the peak of storms from 14 to 8 but there is still space for further improvements that are essential for long term extreme analyses one suggestion is to test the wind corrections based on post processing techniques developed by larsen et al 2012 and larsen et al 2015 which focused on the spectral and probabilistic domains to develop a clever and practical calibration of hindcasts under extreme events another relevant step is to consider the study of babanin et al 2012 and kim et al 2016 who applied a coupled model umcm that integrates ocean atmospheric and wave components to produce current wind and wave data under extreme conditions the coupling of numerical models integrated with data assimilation techniques is essential to further improve the simulation of extreme waves regarding fig 9 and reliable results it is important to highlight that from the five steps involving extreme analysis initially described only steps i and iii have been addressed here although the present study applied a non conventional hindcast technique and robust statistical modeling it did not count for historical trends that may subsist in long term datasets as studied by muraleedharan et al 2016 in order to properly handle this problem vanem 2015 developed non stationary extreme value models to analyze trends in the wave climate due to climate change his results suggest that intra period trends are not significant however statistically significant inter period changes are important and the effect of a climatic trend should be considered especially for longer time periods a thorough analysis of the inter annual variability of extreme hs must be performed by identifying the synoptic patterns that generate extreme waves together with its variability looking at the climate system as a whole as performed by izaguirre et al 2012 another study to consider for further improvements is niroomandi et al 2018 who characterized the spatial and temporal variabilities of extreme hs and long term trends by applying an empirical orthogonal function analysis 6 conclusions based on previous studies such as goda 2010 orimolade et al 2016 and jones et al 2018 we believe that the accuracy of hindcast data is essential for long term extreme value analyses however when time is a constraint simplistic solutions tend to be applied to improve the reliability of wave hindcasts under extreme conditions including linear regression of input winds and quick modifications in the numerical wave model it has been shown that they are indeed useful to reduce the severe underestimation of extrapolated quantiles of hs by approximately 10 fig 8a but it is well known that the extreme conditions in brazil are associated with cyclones campos et al 2012 and the specific calibration of fetches is essential which leads to an additional increase of approximately 6 of the return values linked to 100 years return periods in brazil the application of the rfa extends these improvements by increasing the robustness of the statistical model when several grid points inside a homogeneous region are pooled together as well as carefully choosing the best distribution function using the z test which better evaluates the shape of the distribution tails an important topic in this study therefore we conclude that calibrations of input hindcasts when applied to evas should not only improve the bias and rmse of the bulk statistics which displace the mean and increase the variance of the distributions but should also improve the representation of the shape of the distribution by carefully handling the cyclonic winds results of rfa applied to properly calibrated wave hindcasts led to 100 year hs of 9 5 m in the south of brazil and 6 5 m in the southeast of brazil with local indexes calculated at each grid point with a resolution of 12 which make it possible to quickly obtain a precise return value at each site finally although the evas have been segmented into several steps using hindcast data estimating extreme events should always consider the process as a whole considering the hindcast uncertainties studied by cavaleri et al 2007 and rogers et al 2012 as well as the statistical uncertainties studied by orimolade et al 2016 and jones et al 2018 among others moreover despite the advances in these areas and future methodologies yet to come we believe that long term in situ observation campaigns will always be essential to guarantee reliable estimation of return values especially in the south atlantic ocean acknowledgments the

22879,the paper proposes a risk assessment methodology to be applied at the design selection phase of an oilfield development the main objective of the approach is to support the decision makers in the selection process of the development concept of an oilfield based on risk considerations the methodology assesses the risk level of a pipeline system identifying the pipeline groups contributing the most to the risk during the operating life of the system the risk level of the pipeline systems at the design selection phase enables the decision makers to rank the alternative scenarios in terms of risks expected losses the proposed methodology is applied to four alternative oilfield development concepts according to the decision variables adopted for each production system the results of the risk assessment methodology provide relevant knowledge on the weaknesses of the pipeline systems and subsystems reducing the inherent uncertainties to develop an oilfield at the design phase furthermore the methodology reduces the time and effort required to conduct a full quantitative risk analysis qra for all alternative design concepts keywords oilfield development decision making process pipeline risk assessment subsea pipelines 1 introduction the development concept design is an important phase to exploit an oilfield iyer and grossmann 1998 considered the development of an oilfield as a long planning project with large number of decision variables and resource constraints barnes et al 2007 established that the major element of the viability of an offshore oil project is the production system gu and gudmestad 2011 identified the uncertainty as the major challenge in decision making process during the development of hydrocarbon fields and the minimization of the uncertainty is the main goal of the decision analysis gu and gudmestad 2011 also established the cost benefit analysis and the risk acceptance criteria as the two main principles that the decision makers should consider to assess alternatives under uncertainty according to jaafari 2001 the uncertainty in a project is defined as the probability that the objective function does not reach its planned target value several authors addressed the design of the production system of an oilfield development chang et al 2015 lin et al 2013 redutskiy 2017 rodriguez sanchez et al 2012 chang et al 2015 analysed the well placement problem to develop an oil and gas field presenting a multiple objective optimization model aiming the minimization of the geological uncertainty and maximization of the mean net present value npv lin et al 2013 proposed a methodology to determine the enhancement value that flexibility provides in an offshore oilfield development mitigating the production system uncertainty redutskiy 2017 provided a multi stage stochastic programming approach to cover the relevant engineering issues of an oilfield development and the oil production while addressing the geophysical uncertainty related to the development of the reservoir rodriguez sanchez et al 2012 assigned probability distributions to the most relevant variables e g volume of reserves oil and gas price and expenditure associated associated to the net present value npv to assist the selection of the most viable concept nevertheless the published research works focus only on long term financial aspects according to rausand 2011 risk acceptance criteria are used as basis for the decisions that require a choice among alternatives the assessment of the risk level of the system allows the decision makers to consider what can be expected or unexpected in the system supporting measures to handle the risk bai and bai 2014 several research works discuss the risk assessment applied to the offshore production and process systems aljaroudi et al 2015 andersen and mostue 2012 asbjornslett and rausand 1999 bariha et al 2016 teixeira et al 2008 zhang et al 2017b andersen and mostue 2012 studied the impact of the risk analysis and the risk management approaches applied in the oil and gas industry asbjornslett and rausand 1999 proposed a vulnerability analysis to verify if the production system can endure hazards and survive to different types of accidental events zhang et al 2017b provided a fuzzy risk matrix method to analyse the failure events during the installation of subsea collet connectors aljaroudi et al 2015 bariha et al 2016 and teixeira et al 2008 conducted a risk assessment a hazard and a reliability analysis of subsea pipelines respectively however these works focused mainly on assessing the integrity of the systems and do not use the risk as a decision supporting tool furthermore crawley and grant 1997 yasseri and bahai 2018 prem et al 2010 and yang and mannan 2010 addressed the risk assessment as a decision making tool in oil and gas systems and chemical industry processes at the concept selection phase crawley and grant 1997 presented a risk assessment tool based on risk building blocks for each item of hazardous equipment to be applied in new offshore oil and gas fields one advantage of the tool is the rapid re assessment of the risk levels yasseri and bahai 2018 provided a framework for availability assessment of the subsea distribution systems the method maps the system s components and their dependencies the main advantage is that the generic data used at an early stage of the system architecture can be refined when more information becomes available and then be maintained as the system ages during the operational phase prem et al 2010 developed an approach to express the risks of the process plants the work established the risk metrics that serve as leading indicators to measure the portfolio risks enabling a better risk informed decision making the advantages of the methodology are the risk identification the overall cost benefit analysis and the screening of the most risky scenarios and critical equipment yang and mannan 2010 proposed a dynamic operational risk assessment methodology for risk analysis in oil gas and chemical industries the probabilistic method integrates stochastic and dynamics modelling to evaluate the operational risk an advantage is that the dynamic operational failure probability can be evaluated by the component test inspection intervals and the repair times even so none of the cited works used the risk assessment of the subsea pipeline as a tool in decision making process the extreme event of oil leakage due to pipeline failure can produce catastrophic consequences causing huge environment damages material loss and even loss of human lives drumond et al 2018 the objective of the present work is to develop a methodology that can incorporate the risk among the pipeline system alternatives to support the decision makers at the design phase of an oilfield this paper assesses the risk level of a pipeline system encompassing the pipelines as individual elements and their contribution to the subsea production system a semi quantitative risk assessment tool is used to evaluate the pipeline failure probability and the severity of the failure the potential risk level of a pipeline reflects the impact on the production loss and it is used to assess if the pipeline system meets the safety criterion 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology description the methodology consists of three main steps the conceptual design phase the pipeline system definition and the risk assessment of the pipeline systems at the conceptual design phase the methodology applies the concept matrix presented by rodriguez sanchez et al 2012 to establish the main features of the development of the new concepts the main decision variables of this matrix are the type of the hydrocarbon production pattern the type of well drilling the subsea layout the hub concept the type of subsea processing strategy the carbon dioxide removal co2 and the type of production export system section 2 2 addresses the meaning of each decision variable the second step consists in the description of the pipeline system of each alternative concept the pipelines are aggregated into groups with the same characteristics and functions e g group of flowlines that transport the produced hydrocarbon from the wellhead to the manifold the final step of the methodology is the risk assessment of the pipeline system at this point the evaluation of the failure frequencies and the assessment of the risk level of each pipeline group serve as input data to the semi quantitative tool the tool incorporates the severity and likelihood criteria and evaluates the risk level of each alternative pipeline system section 2 4 addresses in detail the pipeline risk assessment process fig 1 shows the methodology steps to assess the risk index in the present work 2 2 conceptual design phase according to bai and bai 2010 there are two main conceptual designs for the development of a new oilfield discovery the tie back and the stand alone developments in the tieback oilfield development the production of the wells is tied to an existing infrastructure located far away from the field which can be positioned offshore or onshore furthermore the employment of a stand alone field development concept requires a new offshore facility to storage and pre process the produced hydrocarbon from an operational perspective the basic concepts of an oilfield development commonly applied to exploit the oilfields in shallow water are not appropriated to exploit deep and ultra deep water oilfields due to the severe environmental conditions and the flow assurance uncertainties for that reasons variations of the traditional concepts of oilfield development are being studied to accomplish the new oilfield challenges 2 2 1 decision variables the development of an oilfield depends on the specific requirements and project experiences from the operators table 1 presents the combinations of the decision variables assumed in this research work the type of the hydrocarbon production pattern and the type of well drilling are important variables related to the reservoir exploration and the economic value of the project the types of the hydrocarbon production are the oil pattern the oil and gas pattern or the gas pattern thus the two major types of well drilling are the vertical and directional drilling where the horizontal drilling is a type of the directional drilling speight 2015 the horizontal wells have many advantages when compared to vertical wells such as the improvement of the recovery factor of the hydrocarbon production the variable subsea layout describes the complex arrangement of the subsea equipment and components bai and bai 2010 established that a proper well layout is a trade off between spreading the wells out to improve the recovery factor and the cost savings of grouping the wells in clusters bai and bai 2010 also presented four different arrangements of the subsea layout the satellite well system the template well system the clustered satellite well system and the daisy chain well system the satellite well system spread out the wells along the reservoir and the wells are connected directly to the platforms the template well system groups the wells closely using the template manifold that also serves as drilling guidance and support for others equipment the clustered satellite well system groups few satellite wells in a cluster manifold placed near to the respective wells to collect all the production the daisy chain well system joins in series two or more satellite wells in the same pipeline the daisy chain well system also allows the round trip pigging loop along each route by dual flowlines to ensure continuous production even if one of the flowlines fail fig 2 shows these subsea layouts the hub concept decision variable is the driver solution to identify the field development concept as tieback or stand alone the hub may be located onshore or offshore lin et al 2013 when deciding about the type of offshore hub concept it is important to decide on the type of the tree system dry or wet tree bai and bai 2010 identified as the key aspects of the decision on dry or wet tree systems the reservoir recovery mechanism the well placement the subsea equipment the subsea processing requirements and the type of the maritime unit the subsea processing sp variable is an important technical issue concerning the field production life associated with the reservoir production profile anikpo and beltrami 2015 proposed a field development strategy to accommodate the subsea processing aiming the acceleration of the production rate and the improvement of the flow assurance benefits the authors analysed the planning of the field architecture to accommodate the subsea processing at the beginning of the production life without costly modifications early subsea processing or the implementation of the subsea processing after the middle of the project life that will require some modifications late subsea processing the co2 removal is a safety and environmental policy variable nowadays the minimum release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere has been a requirement the gas absorption process and the power production plant are examples of solutions used for sequestration of the high content of co2 mondal et al 2012 windén et al 2014 zhou and wang 2014 according to mondal et al 2012 an efficient co2 removal process uses membranes technology as the semi permeable barriers to separate co2 from the fuel gas zhou and wang 2014 presented an attractive solution called gas to wire concept the authors considered the generation of electricity from gas and the transmission of the power via subsea cables as an efficient concept more recently the allam cycle has been proposed as a system that capture around 100 of the co2 content allam et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2018 the production export system is a logistics decision variable the logistics challenge to export the production increases proportionally with the distance of the oilfield from the coast both production transportation alternatives export pipeline and shuttle tankers present advantages and disadvantages according to ulstein et al 2007 one of the main constraints to export oil and gas by pipelines is the production capacity of the pipe moreover rosa et al 2018 considered that the complexity of shuttle tankers operation arises mainly due to the production inventory constraints and the harsh environmental conditions 2 3 pipeline system definition the pipeline system is composed by the gathering system and the export system zhang et al 2017a proposed that the functions of the gathering system are to collect dispose and transport the produced hydrocarbons from the wells to an offshore platform or to a central collection point bruschi et al 2015 considered that one of the preferred option to export the total collected hydrocarbons is through pipelines pipeline export system dnv gl 2017 categorized pipelines according to the diameter as small pipelines diameter around 50 8 406 4 mm transport pipelines with medium diameter diameter around 457 2 609 6 mm and transport pipelines with larger diameter diameter larger than 0 660 m the pipeline diameters vary according to the expected pressure and the fluid flow rate bariha et al 2016 nowadays new reservoir discoveries in deep and ultra deepwater require the improvement of the pipeline performance arjomandi and taheri 2011 bruschi et al 2015 in the context of the present paper the pipeline performance includes the operational and the structural performance according to teixeira et al 2019 due to high levels of the external pressure that pipelines are subjected in deep and ultra deepwater the pipelines are designed mainly to resist to collapse estefen et al 2009 addressed the pipeline performance in order to achieve the flow assurance in deepwater environment improving the thermal insulation properties of the pipelines due to the low temperature of the subsea environment the first concept of the rigid pipelines is the single steel wall pipe system that has a direct relation with the external pressure being the wall thickness of the pipe proportional to the external pressure bai 2001 kaiser 2017 new concepts of rigid pipelines include the pipe in pipe and the pipeline sandwich which consist of two pipes with different diameters concentric inner and outer pipes arjomandi and taheri 2011 the inner pipe is referred to as the production pipe and the outer pipe provides an external layer to protect the carried hydrocarbon from the surrounding environment moreover the annulus layer is the main difference between the two concepts the pipe in pipe technology allows the annular space to be filled with non structural insulation materials with known thermal insulation properties whereas the annulus of sandwich pipes is filled with solid materials to provide thermal insulation properties and good mechanical resistance bi and hao 2016 castello and estefen 2007 the flexible pipes are structurally composed by overlapping layers of different materials yue et al 2013 presented that the goal of the subsea flexible pipes is to adjust each layer to fit the purpose and to be designed to resist the specific types of loads of an oilfield according to witz 1996 the helical reinforcement wires or strips and the polymeric layers leak proof capacity are the main components of the flexible pipe in summary the pipeline system comprises all subsea pipelines employed to transport the hydrocarbons from the wellhead to the hub onshore or offshore following the decision variables of each alternative development concept the pipelines need to be grouped according to their function diameter and material properties 2 4 pipeline risk assessment in this section the semi quantitative risk assessment tool to evaluate the risk of pipeline systems and the risk of oil leakage is presented the severity and failure frequency estimates identify the pipelines that can produce the greatest impact on safety and environment 2 4 1 pipeline frequency of failure the leak failure frequencies for different types of pipes recommended by dnv gl 2017 are shown in table 2 dnv gl recommended failures rates are based on various data sources such as the parloc and the concawe for offshore pipelines and the mcs advanced subsea engineering for risers the pipeline failure frequencies are also available in the literature bariha et al 2016 estimated from the historical data the pipeline failure rate of 2 1 10 4 per km per year for small diameter pipes and 7 1 10 4 per km per year for large diameter pipes stefani and peter 2010 suggested the oil and gas pipeline failure rate of 3 51 10 4 per km per year from u s dot phmsa in alternative to historical data structural reliability methods can be applied to assess the probability of pipeline failure different design equations can be used to predict the probability of several failure modes of pipelines according to teixeira et al 2008 the annual burst failure probability ranges from 2 3 10 4 for an intact pipeline to 2 3 10 2 for a corroded pipe later teixeira et al 2019 adopted several design equations to assess the probability of failure of pipes subjected to external pressure for a corrosion level d t corrosion depth d to thickness t ratio of 0 1 the probability of failure equals 7 0 10 5 and for a corrosion level d t of 0 2 the probability of failure equals 2 3 10 2 calculated using the dnv collapse strength formulation dnv 2013 before applying the recommended failures frequencies it is important to judge how different loads or defects may affect the integrity of a specific pipe due to the numerous individual factors influencing the failure frequency taking into account all the available information on a specific pipe dnv gl 2017 also presented a model to estimate the failure frequency for rigid pipelines the dnv gl model establishes that the most significant parameter when calculating the failure frequency is the pipeline diameter and the common practice has been to use a simple model where the failure frequency is proportional to pipeline length because some failure mechanisms are partially length dependent however the model considers that only half of the failure modes are proportional to the pipeline length according to the pipeline diameter dnv gl 2017 considers that there is a correlation among the external interference factors and the corrosion failures pipelines with larger diameters have larger resistance against external interferences and can withstand more corrosion than pipelines with a small diameter however the pipelines with large diameters particularly in deep and ultra deep waters are subjected to high levels of external pressure and are prone to collapse failures netto 2010 the failures related with the material defects and the corrosion can be associated with the length of pipelines therefore long pipelines have lower failure frequencies per unit length than short pipelines as long pipes have typically larger diameters it is difficult to determine the isolated effect of the length of the pipeline on its failure rate in order to obtain more accurate assessments dnv gl 2017 categorises the pipelines according to their diameter a model is proposed to estimate the failure frequencies for each category of pipelines the annual failure frequency of rigid pipelines with small diameter 50 8 406 4 mm can be estimated as 1 ff f km pipeline length f pipeline f draggedanchor where f km is the failure factor proportional to pipeline length equals 4 4 10 4 per km year f pipeline equals 2 3 10 3 per km year is the failure factor related to failures that are not dependent of the pipeline length f draggedanchor is the failure factor related to dragged anchors from ships underway and equals 1 9 10 7 per km year for rigid pipelines with larger diameters 457 2 660 4 mm the model predicts the annual failure frequency as 2 ff f km pipeline length f score pipeline characteristic f draggedanchor where f km is the failure factor proportional to pipeline length f score is the factor that refers to the length independent failures both factors vary according to the diameter of the pipe f draggedanchor is the failure factor related to dragged anchors from ships underway table 3 presents the values of the factors pipeline characteristic reflects the semi quantitative assessment of the failure mechanisms e g internal and external corrosion buckling fatigue and free spam based upon the experts knowledge the failure mechanism is evaluated according to its level of importance on a scoring scale the score of each mechanism of failure ranges from zero to ten being zero the minimum score and ten the maximum score the sum of the scores quantifies the total effect on a specific pipeline fig 3 shows the calculation approach used to determine the pipeline failure frequency the likelihood of the system failure corresponds to an event of oil leakage if at least one pipe fails individual group or system assuming independence between the failures of individual pipeline elements the total likelihood of pipeline system failure is given as 3 l k 1 1 1 ff1 1 ff2 1 ff i j where i is an individual pipeline j is a group of pipes and k is the pipeline system 2 4 2 risk level and risk matrix the first step of the risk assessment methodology is the hazards identification and the potential consequences of the pipeline leakage a qualitative analysis determines that the undesirable event is the failure of one pipeline and the extreme undesirable scenario is the occurrence of failures in all of the pipelines that belong to the system at the same time in the present paper the risk index is expressed according to the financial loss of the production flow rate through the pipelines by the likelihood of the pipe failure following this approach one scale to categorize the severity level and another scale to rank the pipeline frequency of failure are defined the severity criterion s is related to the hydrocarbon production transported by the pipeline and the corresponding financial loss of the production considering the amount of fluid flowing through it the financial loss proposed in the present paper does not include the costs to clean up the oil spill on the sea surface the costs to avoid the spill propagation and the costs of the ecological impact due to the uncertainties associated with the trajectory of an oil spill this problem was addressed by sebastião and guedes soares 2007 who developed an oil spill model to support decisions on spill response operations therefore the financial loss proposed only accounts for the production loss or in other words the total production of oil flowing through the pipes consequently the severity criterion scale is a function of the amount of the oil production transported by the pipelines multiplied by the oil barrel price as shown in table 4 table 5 shows the likelihood criterion l scale of the pipeline failure frequency the scale categorises the probability of the leakage failure from the lowest likelihood level when only one pipeline fails to the total likelihood of the pipeline system failure the risk matrix allows the assessment of the likelihood and the severity criteria of the pipeline leakage failure ni et al 2010 presented three basic rules to produce the risk matrix the first rule defines risk as a combination of the severity and its probability of occurrence the second one proposes different levels of severity likelihood and output risk indices by qualitative descriptions and scales furthermore the last rule defines the risk index by a logic implication of if a probability is p and severity is c then the risk is r ni et al 2010 also established that the most used calculation process to express the risk level is the expected value which can also be referred to as an equivalent expected loss eel as follows 4 risk eel severity probability us year this way the risk index of a certain scenario depends on the severity and likelihood values expressed by the eel the risk matrix assumed in this paper consists of 25 cells 5 5 of risk indices and assumes three categories of risk levels table 6 1 low l when the equivalent expected loss is lower than or equal to 28 072 00 us year green colour 2 medium m for values of the equivalent expected loss greater than 28 072 00 us year and lower than 280 720 00 us year yellow colour 3 high h for values of the equivalent expected loss greater than 280 720 00 us year red colour 3 case study the main objective of the proposed methodology is to support the decision makers in the selection of the most viable concept of the field development based on risk considerations the main challenge during the design selection phase is the study of various concepts to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each one the pre salt oilfield located in santos basin brazil is adopted as a realistic case study to generalize the oilfield case scenario and the discussion of the results some assumptions are adopted about the oilfield characteristics section 3 1 and decision variables section 3 2 in particular four alternative oilfield development concepts conventional subsea to shore hybrid and allam cycle scenarios are analysed by the proposed methodology the main results and the final remarks are presented in sections 3 3 and 3 4 respectively 3 1 oilfield characteristics assumptions the undeveloped oilfield adopted in this research work is the same target field presented by wang et al 2018 which is analogous to the pre salt fields located at the santos basin in brazil some authors addressed the challenges of the santos basin beltrão et al 2009 camozzato et al 2015 cruz et al 2016 filho et al 2009 nakano et al 2009 as for example the long distance from the coast to the oilfield the larger oilfield area the ultra deepwater depth and so on the target field studied by wang et al 2018 is located around 300 km from the coast with the total area of about 300 km2 and water depth between 2100 m and 2500 m the ultra deepwater environment implies that all the subsea pipelines equipment and components positioned on the seabed withstand high pressures and low temperatures moreover the expected production profile presents a huge volume of light oil and gas high carbon dioxide co2 content and water production the approximated production life of the field is 27 years and the total number of production wells is 66 the hydrocarbon production rate of each well is 8000 barrels per day bbl day as reported by wang et al 2018 the total amount of production wells 66 wells is divided into 12 production clusters where each cluster manifold collects the oil and gas production from four or six wells the position of the production wells and cluster manifolds are kept the same for each alternative concept 3 2 decision variables assumptions the decision variables type of the hydrocarbon production pattern type of well drilling and subsea layout for all the alternative concepts of the field development maintain the same characteristics the oil and gas production the horizontal drilling and the clustered satellite well layout thus the variation of the concepts will depend on the combination of the subsea processing the hub concept the co2 removal and the production export system variables the present work adopts the oil and gas production scenario located in santos basin and brazil is one of the largest oil and gas producer however the methodology can be applied to any hydrocarbon production type the present paper considers the horizontal wells as the only type of drilling of the design alternatives aiming the maximization of the recovery factor according to joshi 1991 the horizontal well drains larger reservoir volume three dimensional ellipse area than the vertical well cylindrical area it is also adopted the clustered satellite wells layout due to the benefits of using the cluster manifolds in larger reservoirs located in deep and ultra deepwater such as the possibility of injecting chemical agents to mitigate the problem of production flow avoiding the formation of hydrates the minimization of pipeline length that reduces the production losses and the required flow pressure moreover it also reduces the riser weight as the weight is dependent on the number of risers connected to the platform and the reservoir depth hong et al 2018 rosa et al 2018 wang et al 2016 2014 2012 however the application of the cluster manifold in a subsea system can affect the production flow rate of wells connected to manifold for all combinations of wells connected to each cluster manifold and all combinations of manifold locations the well production performances can be assessed therefore a production flow analysis needs to be conducted to maximize the oilfield production and flow assurance during the design concept of the subsea production system 3 3 results and discussion in this section four alternative oilfield development concepts conventional subsea to shore hybrid and allam cycle scenarios are defined according to the decision variables adopted for each one of the production systems a detailed description of the main features of the pipeline systems is also provided to serve as input for the next step of the methodology then the semi quantitative risk assessment tool evaluates the risk level of each pipeline group used to transport the hydrocarbons production and export pipelines as the final step of the methodology 3 3 1 oilfield development concept 1 3 3 1 1 conventional stand alone decision variables the first step of the methodology defines the decision variables of the field development concept table 7 the conventional stand alone production concept is characterized by the oil and gas production the horizontal drilling the subsea layout of 66 satellite production wells clustered into 12 groups no subsea processing defined at the conceptual stage late sp and adopts the wet tree system to all wells furthermore the total oil production is exported by shuttle tankers and the reinjection of all produced gas into the reservoir is considered due to the high content of co2 moreover the high production flow rate of each well 8000 bbl d allows only three clusters of wells to be connected to one floating production storage offloading fpso platform to do not exceed the facility capacity of 150 000 bbl d this constraint implies that four fpsos are necessary for pre processing and storage the total production of the oilfield fig 4 shows the subsea arrangement of the production wells and the connections of the subsea production pipelines with the fpsos 3 3 1 2 conventional stand alone pipeline system definition in the conventional concept the pipeline system has four main subsystems of pipes according to the number of fpsos each pipeline subsystem is connected with one fpso the pipelines are aggregated in three groups the group of flowlines that transport the production from wells to the cluster manifold with the small diameter of 101 6 mm which carry the production of 8000 bbl day the group of flowlines that transport the joint well production of 44 000 bbl day from the cluster manifold to the base of the riser or touch down point tdp the diameter of the pipes is 203 2 mm the group of risers that connect the seafloor and the offshore unit the group of the risers have the same diameter than the pipelines from the cluster manifolds 203 2 mm and transport the same amount of the hydrocarbon production 44 000 bbl day 3 3 1 3 conventional stand alone pipeline risk assessment the methodology assesses and compares the risk level of the system made of flexible and rigid pipes the design of the pipeline system is composed only by the gathering system meaning that all pipes have diameter smaller than 406 4 mm table 8 presents the main pipeline groups features total number of pipes diameter average length and the hydrocarbon production flow rate and the risk assessment results severity s likelihood l equivalent expected loss eel and risk level rl of the pipelines groups the combination of severity s and likelihood l of the group of flowlines identified as cluster manifold touch down point tdp presents the highest risk level of the pipeline system of flexible pipes with an equivalent expected loss of 42 108 0 us year this corresponds to a medium risk level 28 072 00 eel 280 720 00 us year although the severity of this group is the same of the group of risers its likelihood is higher due to the pipelines average length that is almost twice of the group of risers the risk level of the pipeline system without clusters manifolds is also assessed in this case all wells are connected directly to platform for this evaluation there is only two groups of pipes the group of flowlines connecting the wells to the touch down point tdp and the group of risers the average length of the flowline groups is 5 6 km and the hydrocarbon flow rate per pipe is 8000 bbl day in addition the average frequency of failure of the group of flowlines made of flexibles pipes is 1 62 10 2 per year and the equivalent expect loss is 8253 5 us year the average frequency of failure of this group made of rigid pipes is 5 39 10 3 per year and the equivalent expect loss of 2752 9 us year the riser group has average length and failure of frequencies identical to the ones of the scenario using the cluster manifold therefore the hydrocarbon flow rate per pipe is 8000 bbl day and the equivalent expected loss equals 1888 4 us year for flexible pipes and 510 4 us year for rigid pipes the risk level of both groups of pipes is assessed as low for the system of flexible and rigid pipes the main reasons of the low risk level are the direct path well to platform and the hydrocarbon flow rate through pipes which is the same as the well production 8000 bbl day reducing the severity ranking 3 3 2 oilfield development concept 2 3 3 2 1 subsea to shore decision variables in this concept all the production is exported directly to shore which means that in this configuration there are no offshore facilities this concept is also known as subsea to shore table 9 presents the decision variables adopted for the development of the subsea to shore concept the onshore facility is around 300 km far from the oilfield thus because of the presence of water and carbon dioxide in the production profile the total production is sent to the subsea processing system to reduce the flow assurance uncertainties the subsea processing is adopted as an alternative for the offshore unit moreover the clustered subsea layout of 66 production wells is assumed to maintain the same arrangement the 12 clusters are divided into two groups of six clusters and for each group there is one subsea processing system early sp the reliability and availability analysis of the subsea processing system to be applied in ultra deepwater is out of the scope of the present paper the paper addresses only the use of a two phase subsea separator gas liquid as an alternative concept of an early stage of the subsea processing after the subsea processing separated pipelines will export the gas phase and the liquid phase oil and water fig 5 presents the subsea to shore concept 3 3 2 2 subsea to shore pipeline system definition the pipeline system of the subsea to shore field development has two main subsystems of pipes corresponding to the two subsea processing systems subsea separator for each subsystem three groups of pipelines are considered the group of flowlines from the wells to the cluster manifolds with a small diameter of 101 6 mm that transport the production of 8000 bbl day the group of flowlines from the manifold to the subsea processing system that transport the joint production of 44 000 bbl day with a diameter of 203 2 mm the group of the export pipelines that export the joint production from the subsea processing systems to shore each export pipeline has the diameter of 508 0 mm and transports the total oil production of 264 000 bbl d 3 3 2 3 subsea to shore pipeline risk assessment the subsea to shore field development concept employs the gathering and the export pipeline systems the gathering system divides the total production into two groups of six clusters and sends the production to two subsea separators afterwards the export system transports the oil production to shore by two rigid export pipelines the methodology assesses the failure frequency of the production pipeline system as flexible and rigid and the export pipelines as rigid single wall steel and rigid sandwich the main difference between the failure frequency assessment of the rigid export pipelines as rigid single wall steel and rigid sandwich is the total score of the parameter pipeline characteristics the rigid sandwich pipe presents a good mechanical resistance to the external pressure which avoids possible buckling of the line and in addition it has a good thermal insulation minimizing the external and internal corrosion furthermore the rigid sandwich pipelines consisting of the concentric pipes with the annulus filled with the structural material prevents failures due to loads from trawl boards for example table 10 presents the total scores of the failures mechanisms for the rigid single wall and the rigid sandwich pipes table 11 summarizes the main pipeline group features and the risk assessment results one group with medium risk level is the group of flexible flowlines from the cluster manifold to the subsea separator eel is 110 603 6 us year the main reason is the high length of the pipelines average length of 13 15 km the group of export pipelines is also assessed as medium risk the severity of the export pipes is evaluated as extreme s 5 and their rating level of the likelihood is classified as possible l 3 however the equivalent expected loss eel of the rigid single wall export pipes is 96 174 6 us year which is higher than the eel of 36 212 8 us year of the rigid sandwich export pipe 3 3 3 oilfield development concept 3 3 3 3 1 hybrid stand alone decision variables for this field development concept the hybrid stand alone oilfield development combines the conventional stand alone development using offshore facilities with the subsea to shore development employing the subsea processing system subsea separators the strategy to use the subsea processing in an early stage of the field development aims to reduce the water treatment area on the platform and consequently increasing the oil pre processing area it also implies that more wells can be connected to the offshore unit table 12 presents the main decision variables adopted instead of four fpsos used in the conventional stand alone concept to produce and storage the total production only two fpsos are needed for this alternative according to wang et al 2018 it is necessary to plan the production sequence of the wells to does not exceed the fpsos capacities wang et al 2018 presented the availability of this alternative concept looking also at the flow assurance of the new design more information about the feasibility of the hybrid stand alone development concept is provided by wang et al 2018 the hybrid stand alone alternative aggregates six cluster manifolds for each fpso the early subsea processing strategy is implemented for every two clusters of wells with the same production profile and the clusters have the same distance to the subsea processing aiming to reduce the backpressure at the subsea separator the produced water is reinjected directly into the reservoir and the reinjection alternates with the produced gas water alternating gas recovery fig 6 illustrates the production pipeline systems of the hybrid stand alone alternative concept 3 3 3 2 hybrid stand alone pipeline system definition the pipeline system consider each fpsos as individual subsystems of the concept the groups of production pipes are the flowlines that connect the wells to the manifolds with the small diameter of 101 6 mm and transport the production of 8000 bbl day the flowlines that transport the hydrocarbon production from the cluster manifolds to the subsea processing carrying the joint production of 44 000 bbl day and the diameter of the pipes equals 203 2 mm the hydrocarbon flowlines that link the subsea processing and the base of the risers touch down points tdp transporting the production flow rate of 88 000 bbl day with diameter of 203 2 mm the group of risers that transport the production flow rate of 88 000 bbl day with diameter of 203 2 mm 3 3 3 3 hybrid stand alone pipeline risk assessment all the pipes of the hybrid concept are part of the gathering system the methodology assess the failure frequency of the pipeline system made of flexible and rigid pipes table 13 presents the main pipeline group features and the risk assessment results the pipelines with the highest risk level are the flowlines group subsea processing touch down point tdp the risk level of the group of flexible pipes is assessed as medium with an equivalent expected loss of 129 131 2 us year although the severity of the group of flexible flowlines is the same of the risers the evaluated likelihood is higher the main reason is the higher length of the pipes the average length equals 8 32 km instead of 2 3 km of riser length 3 3 4 oilfield development concept 4 3 3 4 1 allam cycle stand alone decision variables the allam cycle stand alone field development consists of a new non conventional concept first the concept combines the application of dry and the wet tree systems as the fpso is not prepared to adopt the dry tree system a spar floating production unit is used for this case the spar platform serves to implement the dry wells to reinject the produced gas into the reservoir and receives the total hydrocarbon flow from the 66 wet production wells thus another function of the platform is the production of electricity using the allam cycle power plant table 14 presents the decision variables considered in this production concept after the separation process on the spar topside the liquid phase is offloaded to one fpso located near to the spar to pre process the oil and treat the water the water is reinjected into the reservoir moreover the oil export system assumed for this concept is the oil tanker for this development there are two subsystems of spars connected to two fpsos the clusters of wells are aggregated into two groups of six clusters for each subsystem spar fpso fig 7 shows the pipeline system of the allam cycle stand alone oilfield development 3 3 4 2 allam cycle stand alone pipeline system the pipeline systems is analogous to the pipeline arrangement of the conventional stand alone field development concept the direct paths manifold platform transport and rise the produced flow from the seabed to the spar platform without passing by any other subsea equipment i e subsea separator three groups compose the pipeline system the group of flowlines that transport the production from the wells 8000 bbl day to manifolds with diameter of 101 6 mm the flowlines with the diameter of 203 2 mm connecting the cluster manifolds to the touch down points tdp with the joint production of 44 000 bbl day the group of risers with the same diameter of 203 2 mm that transport the same amount of the hydrocarbon production from the manifold 44 000 bbl day 3 3 4 3 allam cycle stand alone pipeline risk assessment the pipeline system of flexible and rigid pipelines is assessed table 15 summarizes the main features and the risk assessment results of the system the group of pipes with the highest risk level is the group of flowlines that transport the production from the manifolds to the touch down points tdp assessed as medium risk with an equivalent expected loss of 72 987 2 us year it is possible to verify that the risk level of the allam cycle stand alone field development concept is similar to the conventional stand alone concept due to the similarities of the gathering system configuration 3 4 final remarks the production and the pipeline systems are different among the oilfield concepts the proposed methodology defines the decision variables for each development concept and in accordance with the decision variables the pipeline systems are established the semi quantitative risk assessment tool evaluates the risk levels of the system considering the flowlines and risers as flexible rigid and the export pipelines considered as rigid single wall and rigid sandwich pipelines the results of the risk levels of the pipeline systems ranked the alternative scenarios to develop the oilfield the subsea to shore development concept is the only pipeline system with an extreme severity ranking s 5 for the export pipeline group the maximum failure likelihood l 4 is obtained for the flowlines from the cluster manifold to subsea separator group of pipes the risk level of the subsea to shore pipeline system is compromised by the transportation of all production by two export pipelines if a failure event occurs in one export pipeline half of the total production is lost the hybrid stand alone development concept has the second highest severity ranking assessed as moderate s 3 due to the joint production from every two clusters to one subsea separator moreover the length of the group of pipes that connect the cluster manifolds and the subsea separator are the highest of the system increasing their failure frequency to level likely l 4 the conventional and allam cycle stand alone development concepts are evaluated with the maximum severity level of minor s 2 regarding failure frequency both concepts have also the maximum likelihood level considered as likely l 4 the main benefit of the pipelines arrangement applied in the conventional and allam cycle concepts is the transportation of the total production of each cluster manifold by a single path cluster manifold platform the direct path with low hydrocarbon flowrate reduces the severity and consequently decreases the equivalent expected loss eel 4 conclusions the paper presents a semi quantitative risk assessment tool to evaluate the risk level of the subsea pipeline systems during the concept selection phase of an oilfield development the approach starts with the development of the concept matrix that specifies the main decision variables and alternatives relevant for the field development a detailed description of the main features of the pipeline systems serves as input for the semi quantitative tool the pipeline system is then defined in terms of groups of pipes aggregated according to their dimensions and functions allowing the assessment of severity and likelihood levels of a leakage event the final step of the methodology is the assessment of an equivalent expected loss eel to quantify the risk level of each group of pipes the proposed methodology is applied to four alternative oilfield development concepts conventional subsea to shore hybrid and allam cycle scenarios according to the decision variables adopted for each production system the approach identified the pipeline groups with the greatest impact on the expected loss of a leakage event the results indicate that the pipeline systems of flexible pipes present higher frequencies of failures and consequently higher risk levels in comparison with the pipeline systems of rigid pipes flowlines and risers the evaluated pipelines failure frequencies are in line with those reported in the literature the results of the risk assessment methodology provide relevant knowledge on the weaknesses of the pipeline systems and subsystems reducing the inherent uncertainties to develop an oilfield at the design phase the assessment of the risk index at the design selection phase is the major element of the proposed methodology as it enables the decision makers to rank the alternative concepts in terms of risks expected losses this study therefore contributes with a risk assessment methodology to be used as a decision making support tool at the concept selection for oilfield development the identification of the risks of the pipelines groups also impacts the operational safety of the pipeline systems as it allows the definition of the maintenance plans and the measures to handle mitigate and control the risks at the selection phase moreover the structured semi quantitative evaluation of risks reduces the time and effort required to conduct a full quantitative risk analysis qra for all alternative concepts acknowledgements this work which has been financed by embrapii coppe unit subsea technology was performed within the project submarine systems which is conducted in cooperation

22879,the paper proposes a risk assessment methodology to be applied at the design selection phase of an oilfield development the main objective of the approach is to support the decision makers in the selection process of the development concept of an oilfield based on risk considerations the methodology assesses the risk level of a pipeline system identifying the pipeline groups contributing the most to the risk during the operating life of the system the risk level of the pipeline systems at the design selection phase enables the decision makers to rank the alternative scenarios in terms of risks expected losses the proposed methodology is applied to four alternative oilfield development concepts according to the decision variables adopted for each production system the results of the risk assessment methodology provide relevant knowledge on the weaknesses of the pipeline systems and subsystems reducing the inherent uncertainties to develop an oilfield at the design phase furthermore the methodology reduces the time and effort required to conduct a full quantitative risk analysis qra for all alternative design concepts keywords oilfield development decision making process pipeline risk assessment subsea pipelines 1 introduction the development concept design is an important phase to exploit an oilfield iyer and grossmann 1998 considered the development of an oilfield as a long planning project with large number of decision variables and resource constraints barnes et al 2007 established that the major element of the viability of an offshore oil project is the production system gu and gudmestad 2011 identified the uncertainty as the major challenge in decision making process during the development of hydrocarbon fields and the minimization of the uncertainty is the main goal of the decision analysis gu and gudmestad 2011 also established the cost benefit analysis and the risk acceptance criteria as the two main principles that the decision makers should consider to assess alternatives under uncertainty according to jaafari 2001 the uncertainty in a project is defined as the probability that the objective function does not reach its planned target value several authors addressed the design of the production system of an oilfield development chang et al 2015 lin et al 2013 redutskiy 2017 rodriguez sanchez et al 2012 chang et al 2015 analysed the well placement problem to develop an oil and gas field presenting a multiple objective optimization model aiming the minimization of the geological uncertainty and maximization of the mean net present value npv lin et al 2013 proposed a methodology to determine the enhancement value that flexibility provides in an offshore oilfield development mitigating the production system uncertainty redutskiy 2017 provided a multi stage stochastic programming approach to cover the relevant engineering issues of an oilfield development and the oil production while addressing the geophysical uncertainty related to the development of the reservoir rodriguez sanchez et al 2012 assigned probability distributions to the most relevant variables e g volume of reserves oil and gas price and expenditure associated associated to the net present value npv to assist the selection of the most viable concept nevertheless the published research works focus only on long term financial aspects according to rausand 2011 risk acceptance criteria are used as basis for the decisions that require a choice among alternatives the assessment of the risk level of the system allows the decision makers to consider what can be expected or unexpected in the system supporting measures to handle the risk bai and bai 2014 several research works discuss the risk assessment applied to the offshore production and process systems aljaroudi et al 2015 andersen and mostue 2012 asbjornslett and rausand 1999 bariha et al 2016 teixeira et al 2008 zhang et al 2017b andersen and mostue 2012 studied the impact of the risk analysis and the risk management approaches applied in the oil and gas industry asbjornslett and rausand 1999 proposed a vulnerability analysis to verify if the production system can endure hazards and survive to different types of accidental events zhang et al 2017b provided a fuzzy risk matrix method to analyse the failure events during the installation of subsea collet connectors aljaroudi et al 2015 bariha et al 2016 and teixeira et al 2008 conducted a risk assessment a hazard and a reliability analysis of subsea pipelines respectively however these works focused mainly on assessing the integrity of the systems and do not use the risk as a decision supporting tool furthermore crawley and grant 1997 yasseri and bahai 2018 prem et al 2010 and yang and mannan 2010 addressed the risk assessment as a decision making tool in oil and gas systems and chemical industry processes at the concept selection phase crawley and grant 1997 presented a risk assessment tool based on risk building blocks for each item of hazardous equipment to be applied in new offshore oil and gas fields one advantage of the tool is the rapid re assessment of the risk levels yasseri and bahai 2018 provided a framework for availability assessment of the subsea distribution systems the method maps the system s components and their dependencies the main advantage is that the generic data used at an early stage of the system architecture can be refined when more information becomes available and then be maintained as the system ages during the operational phase prem et al 2010 developed an approach to express the risks of the process plants the work established the risk metrics that serve as leading indicators to measure the portfolio risks enabling a better risk informed decision making the advantages of the methodology are the risk identification the overall cost benefit analysis and the screening of the most risky scenarios and critical equipment yang and mannan 2010 proposed a dynamic operational risk assessment methodology for risk analysis in oil gas and chemical industries the probabilistic method integrates stochastic and dynamics modelling to evaluate the operational risk an advantage is that the dynamic operational failure probability can be evaluated by the component test inspection intervals and the repair times even so none of the cited works used the risk assessment of the subsea pipeline as a tool in decision making process the extreme event of oil leakage due to pipeline failure can produce catastrophic consequences causing huge environment damages material loss and even loss of human lives drumond et al 2018 the objective of the present work is to develop a methodology that can incorporate the risk among the pipeline system alternatives to support the decision makers at the design phase of an oilfield this paper assesses the risk level of a pipeline system encompassing the pipelines as individual elements and their contribution to the subsea production system a semi quantitative risk assessment tool is used to evaluate the pipeline failure probability and the severity of the failure the potential risk level of a pipeline reflects the impact on the production loss and it is used to assess if the pipeline system meets the safety criterion 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology description the methodology consists of three main steps the conceptual design phase the pipeline system definition and the risk assessment of the pipeline systems at the conceptual design phase the methodology applies the concept matrix presented by rodriguez sanchez et al 2012 to establish the main features of the development of the new concepts the main decision variables of this matrix are the type of the hydrocarbon production pattern the type of well drilling the subsea layout the hub concept the type of subsea processing strategy the carbon dioxide removal co2 and the type of production export system section 2 2 addresses the meaning of each decision variable the second step consists in the description of the pipeline system of each alternative concept the pipelines are aggregated into groups with the same characteristics and functions e g group of flowlines that transport the produced hydrocarbon from the wellhead to the manifold the final step of the methodology is the risk assessment of the pipeline system at this point the evaluation of the failure frequencies and the assessment of the risk level of each pipeline group serve as input data to the semi quantitative tool the tool incorporates the severity and likelihood criteria and evaluates the risk level of each alternative pipeline system section 2 4 addresses in detail the pipeline risk assessment process fig 1 shows the methodology steps to assess the risk index in the present work 2 2 conceptual design phase according to bai and bai 2010 there are two main conceptual designs for the development of a new oilfield discovery the tie back and the stand alone developments in the tieback oilfield development the production of the wells is tied to an existing infrastructure located far away from the field which can be positioned offshore or onshore furthermore the employment of a stand alone field development concept requires a new offshore facility to storage and pre process the produced hydrocarbon from an operational perspective the basic concepts of an oilfield development commonly applied to exploit the oilfields in shallow water are not appropriated to exploit deep and ultra deep water oilfields due to the severe environmental conditions and the flow assurance uncertainties for that reasons variations of the traditional concepts of oilfield development are being studied to accomplish the new oilfield challenges 2 2 1 decision variables the development of an oilfield depends on the specific requirements and project experiences from the operators table 1 presents the combinations of the decision variables assumed in this research work the type of the hydrocarbon production pattern and the type of well drilling are important variables related to the reservoir exploration and the economic value of the project the types of the hydrocarbon production are the oil pattern the oil and gas pattern or the gas pattern thus the two major types of well drilling are the vertical and directional drilling where the horizontal drilling is a type of the directional drilling speight 2015 the horizontal wells have many advantages when compared to vertical wells such as the improvement of the recovery factor of the hydrocarbon production the variable subsea layout describes the complex arrangement of the subsea equipment and components bai and bai 2010 established that a proper well layout is a trade off between spreading the wells out to improve the recovery factor and the cost savings of grouping the wells in clusters bai and bai 2010 also presented four different arrangements of the subsea layout the satellite well system the template well system the clustered satellite well system and the daisy chain well system the satellite well system spread out the wells along the reservoir and the wells are connected directly to the platforms the template well system groups the wells closely using the template manifold that also serves as drilling guidance and support for others equipment the clustered satellite well system groups few satellite wells in a cluster manifold placed near to the respective wells to collect all the production the daisy chain well system joins in series two or more satellite wells in the same pipeline the daisy chain well system also allows the round trip pigging loop along each route by dual flowlines to ensure continuous production even if one of the flowlines fail fig 2 shows these subsea layouts the hub concept decision variable is the driver solution to identify the field development concept as tieback or stand alone the hub may be located onshore or offshore lin et al 2013 when deciding about the type of offshore hub concept it is important to decide on the type of the tree system dry or wet tree bai and bai 2010 identified as the key aspects of the decision on dry or wet tree systems the reservoir recovery mechanism the well placement the subsea equipment the subsea processing requirements and the type of the maritime unit the subsea processing sp variable is an important technical issue concerning the field production life associated with the reservoir production profile anikpo and beltrami 2015 proposed a field development strategy to accommodate the subsea processing aiming the acceleration of the production rate and the improvement of the flow assurance benefits the authors analysed the planning of the field architecture to accommodate the subsea processing at the beginning of the production life without costly modifications early subsea processing or the implementation of the subsea processing after the middle of the project life that will require some modifications late subsea processing the co2 removal is a safety and environmental policy variable nowadays the minimum release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere has been a requirement the gas absorption process and the power production plant are examples of solutions used for sequestration of the high content of co2 mondal et al 2012 windén et al 2014 zhou and wang 2014 according to mondal et al 2012 an efficient co2 removal process uses membranes technology as the semi permeable barriers to separate co2 from the fuel gas zhou and wang 2014 presented an attractive solution called gas to wire concept the authors considered the generation of electricity from gas and the transmission of the power via subsea cables as an efficient concept more recently the allam cycle has been proposed as a system that capture around 100 of the co2 content allam et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2018 the production export system is a logistics decision variable the logistics challenge to export the production increases proportionally with the distance of the oilfield from the coast both production transportation alternatives export pipeline and shuttle tankers present advantages and disadvantages according to ulstein et al 2007 one of the main constraints to export oil and gas by pipelines is the production capacity of the pipe moreover rosa et al 2018 considered that the complexity of shuttle tankers operation arises mainly due to the production inventory constraints and the harsh environmental conditions 2 3 pipeline system definition the pipeline system is composed by the gathering system and the export system zhang et al 2017a proposed that the functions of the gathering system are to collect dispose and transport the produced hydrocarbons from the wells to an offshore platform or to a central collection point bruschi et al 2015 considered that one of the preferred option to export the total collected hydrocarbons is through pipelines pipeline export system dnv gl 2017 categorized pipelines according to the diameter as small pipelines diameter around 50 8 406 4 mm transport pipelines with medium diameter diameter around 457 2 609 6 mm and transport pipelines with larger diameter diameter larger than 0 660 m the pipeline diameters vary according to the expected pressure and the fluid flow rate bariha et al 2016 nowadays new reservoir discoveries in deep and ultra deepwater require the improvement of the pipeline performance arjomandi and taheri 2011 bruschi et al 2015 in the context of the present paper the pipeline performance includes the operational and the structural performance according to teixeira et al 2019 due to high levels of the external pressure that pipelines are subjected in deep and ultra deepwater the pipelines are designed mainly to resist to collapse estefen et al 2009 addressed the pipeline performance in order to achieve the flow assurance in deepwater environment improving the thermal insulation properties of the pipelines due to the low temperature of the subsea environment the first concept of the rigid pipelines is the single steel wall pipe system that has a direct relation with the external pressure being the wall thickness of the pipe proportional to the external pressure bai 2001 kaiser 2017 new concepts of rigid pipelines include the pipe in pipe and the pipeline sandwich which consist of two pipes with different diameters concentric inner and outer pipes arjomandi and taheri 2011 the inner pipe is referred to as the production pipe and the outer pipe provides an external layer to protect the carried hydrocarbon from the surrounding environment moreover the annulus layer is the main difference between the two concepts the pipe in pipe technology allows the annular space to be filled with non structural insulation materials with known thermal insulation properties whereas the annulus of sandwich pipes is filled with solid materials to provide thermal insulation properties and good mechanical resistance bi and hao 2016 castello and estefen 2007 the flexible pipes are structurally composed by overlapping layers of different materials yue et al 2013 presented that the goal of the subsea flexible pipes is to adjust each layer to fit the purpose and to be designed to resist the specific types of loads of an oilfield according to witz 1996 the helical reinforcement wires or strips and the polymeric layers leak proof capacity are the main components of the flexible pipe in summary the pipeline system comprises all subsea pipelines employed to transport the hydrocarbons from the wellhead to the hub onshore or offshore following the decision variables of each alternative development concept the pipelines need to be grouped according to their function diameter and material properties 2 4 pipeline risk assessment in this section the semi quantitative risk assessment tool to evaluate the risk of pipeline systems and the risk of oil leakage is presented the severity and failure frequency estimates identify the pipelines that can produce the greatest impact on safety and environment 2 4 1 pipeline frequency of failure the leak failure frequencies for different types of pipes recommended by dnv gl 2017 are shown in table 2 dnv gl recommended failures rates are based on various data sources such as the parloc and the concawe for offshore pipelines and the mcs advanced subsea engineering for risers the pipeline failure frequencies are also available in the literature bariha et al 2016 estimated from the historical data the pipeline failure rate of 2 1 10 4 per km per year for small diameter pipes and 7 1 10 4 per km per year for large diameter pipes stefani and peter 2010 suggested the oil and gas pipeline failure rate of 3 51 10 4 per km per year from u s dot phmsa in alternative to historical data structural reliability methods can be applied to assess the probability of pipeline failure different design equations can be used to predict the probability of several failure modes of pipelines according to teixeira et al 2008 the annual burst failure probability ranges from 2 3 10 4 for an intact pipeline to 2 3 10 2 for a corroded pipe later teixeira et al 2019 adopted several design equations to assess the probability of failure of pipes subjected to external pressure for a corrosion level d t corrosion depth d to thickness t ratio of 0 1 the probability of failure equals 7 0 10 5 and for a corrosion level d t of 0 2 the probability of failure equals 2 3 10 2 calculated using the dnv collapse strength formulation dnv 2013 before applying the recommended failures frequencies it is important to judge how different loads or defects may affect the integrity of a specific pipe due to the numerous individual factors influencing the failure frequency taking into account all the available information on a specific pipe dnv gl 2017 also presented a model to estimate the failure frequency for rigid pipelines the dnv gl model establishes that the most significant parameter when calculating the failure frequency is the pipeline diameter and the common practice has been to use a simple model where the failure frequency is proportional to pipeline length because some failure mechanisms are partially length dependent however the model considers that only half of the failure modes are proportional to the pipeline length according to the pipeline diameter dnv gl 2017 considers that there is a correlation among the external interference factors and the corrosion failures pipelines with larger diameters have larger resistance against external interferences and can withstand more corrosion than pipelines with a small diameter however the pipelines with large diameters particularly in deep and ultra deep waters are subjected to high levels of external pressure and are prone to collapse failures netto 2010 the failures related with the material defects and the corrosion can be associated with the length of pipelines therefore long pipelines have lower failure frequencies per unit length than short pipelines as long pipes have typically larger diameters it is difficult to determine the isolated effect of the length of the pipeline on its failure rate in order to obtain more accurate assessments dnv gl 2017 categorises the pipelines according to their diameter a model is proposed to estimate the failure frequencies for each category of pipelines the annual failure frequency of rigid pipelines with small diameter 50 8 406 4 mm can be estimated as 1 ff f km pipeline length f pipeline f draggedanchor where f km is the failure factor proportional to pipeline length equals 4 4 10 4 per km year f pipeline equals 2 3 10 3 per km year is the failure factor related to failures that are not dependent of the pipeline length f draggedanchor is the failure factor related to dragged anchors from ships underway and equals 1 9 10 7 per km year for rigid pipelines with larger diameters 457 2 660 4 mm the model predicts the annual failure frequency as 2 ff f km pipeline length f score pipeline characteristic f draggedanchor where f km is the failure factor proportional to pipeline length f score is the factor that refers to the length independent failures both factors vary according to the diameter of the pipe f draggedanchor is the failure factor related to dragged anchors from ships underway table 3 presents the values of the factors pipeline characteristic reflects the semi quantitative assessment of the failure mechanisms e g internal and external corrosion buckling fatigue and free spam based upon the experts knowledge the failure mechanism is evaluated according to its level of importance on a scoring scale the score of each mechanism of failure ranges from zero to ten being zero the minimum score and ten the maximum score the sum of the scores quantifies the total effect on a specific pipeline fig 3 shows the calculation approach used to determine the pipeline failure frequency the likelihood of the system failure corresponds to an event of oil leakage if at least one pipe fails individual group or system assuming independence between the failures of individual pipeline elements the total likelihood of pipeline system failure is given as 3 l k 1 1 1 ff1 1 ff2 1 ff i j where i is an individual pipeline j is a group of pipes and k is the pipeline system 2 4 2 risk level and risk matrix the first step of the risk assessment methodology is the hazards identification and the potential consequences of the pipeline leakage a qualitative analysis determines that the undesirable event is the failure of one pipeline and the extreme undesirable scenario is the occurrence of failures in all of the pipelines that belong to the system at the same time in the present paper the risk index is expressed according to the financial loss of the production flow rate through the pipelines by the likelihood of the pipe failure following this approach one scale to categorize the severity level and another scale to rank the pipeline frequency of failure are defined the severity criterion s is related to the hydrocarbon production transported by the pipeline and the corresponding financial loss of the production considering the amount of fluid flowing through it the financial loss proposed in the present paper does not include the costs to clean up the oil spill on the sea surface the costs to avoid the spill propagation and the costs of the ecological impact due to the uncertainties associated with the trajectory of an oil spill this problem was addressed by sebastião and guedes soares 2007 who developed an oil spill model to support decisions on spill response operations therefore the financial loss proposed only accounts for the production loss or in other words the total production of oil flowing through the pipes consequently the severity criterion scale is a function of the amount of the oil production transported by the pipelines multiplied by the oil barrel price as shown in table 4 table 5 shows the likelihood criterion l scale of the pipeline failure frequency the scale categorises the probability of the leakage failure from the lowest likelihood level when only one pipeline fails to the total likelihood of the pipeline system failure the risk matrix allows the assessment of the likelihood and the severity criteria of the pipeline leakage failure ni et al 2010 presented three basic rules to produce the risk matrix the first rule defines risk as a combination of the severity and its probability of occurrence the second one proposes different levels of severity likelihood and output risk indices by qualitative descriptions and scales furthermore the last rule defines the risk index by a logic implication of if a probability is p and severity is c then the risk is r ni et al 2010 also established that the most used calculation process to express the risk level is the expected value which can also be referred to as an equivalent expected loss eel as follows 4 risk eel severity probability us year this way the risk index of a certain scenario depends on the severity and likelihood values expressed by the eel the risk matrix assumed in this paper consists of 25 cells 5 5 of risk indices and assumes three categories of risk levels table 6 1 low l when the equivalent expected loss is lower than or equal to 28 072 00 us year green colour 2 medium m for values of the equivalent expected loss greater than 28 072 00 us year and lower than 280 720 00 us year yellow colour 3 high h for values of the equivalent expected loss greater than 280 720 00 us year red colour 3 case study the main objective of the proposed methodology is to support the decision makers in the selection of the most viable concept of the field development based on risk considerations the main challenge during the design selection phase is the study of various concepts to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each one the pre salt oilfield located in santos basin brazil is adopted as a realistic case study to generalize the oilfield case scenario and the discussion of the results some assumptions are adopted about the oilfield characteristics section 3 1 and decision variables section 3 2 in particular four alternative oilfield development concepts conventional subsea to shore hybrid and allam cycle scenarios are analysed by the proposed methodology the main results and the final remarks are presented in sections 3 3 and 3 4 respectively 3 1 oilfield characteristics assumptions the undeveloped oilfield adopted in this research work is the same target field presented by wang et al 2018 which is analogous to the pre salt fields located at the santos basin in brazil some authors addressed the challenges of the santos basin beltrão et al 2009 camozzato et al 2015 cruz et al 2016 filho et al 2009 nakano et al 2009 as for example the long distance from the coast to the oilfield the larger oilfield area the ultra deepwater depth and so on the target field studied by wang et al 2018 is located around 300 km from the coast with the total area of about 300 km2 and water depth between 2100 m and 2500 m the ultra deepwater environment implies that all the subsea pipelines equipment and components positioned on the seabed withstand high pressures and low temperatures moreover the expected production profile presents a huge volume of light oil and gas high carbon dioxide co2 content and water production the approximated production life of the field is 27 years and the total number of production wells is 66 the hydrocarbon production rate of each well is 8000 barrels per day bbl day as reported by wang et al 2018 the total amount of production wells 66 wells is divided into 12 production clusters where each cluster manifold collects the oil and gas production from four or six wells the position of the production wells and cluster manifolds are kept the same for each alternative concept 3 2 decision variables assumptions the decision variables type of the hydrocarbon production pattern type of well drilling and subsea layout for all the alternative concepts of the field development maintain the same characteristics the oil and gas production the horizontal drilling and the clustered satellite well layout thus the variation of the concepts will depend on the combination of the subsea processing the hub concept the co2 removal and the production export system variables the present work adopts the oil and gas production scenario located in santos basin and brazil is one of the largest oil and gas producer however the methodology can be applied to any hydrocarbon production type the present paper considers the horizontal wells as the only type of drilling of the design alternatives aiming the maximization of the recovery factor according to joshi 1991 the horizontal well drains larger reservoir volume three dimensional ellipse area than the vertical well cylindrical area it is also adopted the clustered satellite wells layout due to the benefits of using the cluster manifolds in larger reservoirs located in deep and ultra deepwater such as the possibility of injecting chemical agents to mitigate the problem of production flow avoiding the formation of hydrates the minimization of pipeline length that reduces the production losses and the required flow pressure moreover it also reduces the riser weight as the weight is dependent on the number of risers connected to the platform and the reservoir depth hong et al 2018 rosa et al 2018 wang et al 2016 2014 2012 however the application of the cluster manifold in a subsea system can affect the production flow rate of wells connected to manifold for all combinations of wells connected to each cluster manifold and all combinations of manifold locations the well production performances can be assessed therefore a production flow analysis needs to be conducted to maximize the oilfield production and flow assurance during the design concept of the subsea production system 3 3 results and discussion in this section four alternative oilfield development concepts conventional subsea to shore hybrid and allam cycle scenarios are defined according to the decision variables adopted for each one of the production systems a detailed description of the main features of the pipeline systems is also provided to serve as input for the next step of the methodology then the semi quantitative risk assessment tool evaluates the risk level of each pipeline group used to transport the hydrocarbons production and export pipelines as the final step of the methodology 3 3 1 oilfield development concept 1 3 3 1 1 conventional stand alone decision variables the first step of the methodology defines the decision variables of the field development concept table 7 the conventional stand alone production concept is characterized by the oil and gas production the horizontal drilling the subsea layout of 66 satellite production wells clustered into 12 groups no subsea processing defined at the conceptual stage late sp and adopts the wet tree system to all wells furthermore the total oil production is exported by shuttle tankers and the reinjection of all produced gas into the reservoir is considered due to the high content of co2 moreover the high production flow rate of each well 8000 bbl d allows only three clusters of wells to be connected to one floating production storage offloading fpso platform to do not exceed the facility capacity of 150 000 bbl d this constraint implies that four fpsos are necessary for pre processing and storage the total production of the oilfield fig 4 shows the subsea arrangement of the production wells and the connections of the subsea production pipelines with the fpsos 3 3 1 2 conventional stand alone pipeline system definition in the conventional concept the pipeline system has four main subsystems of pipes according to the number of fpsos each pipeline subsystem is connected with one fpso the pipelines are aggregated in three groups the group of flowlines that transport the production from wells to the cluster manifold with the small diameter of 101 6 mm which carry the production of 8000 bbl day the group of flowlines that transport the joint well production of 44 000 bbl day from the cluster manifold to the base of the riser or touch down point tdp the diameter of the pipes is 203 2 mm the group of risers that connect the seafloor and the offshore unit the group of the risers have the same diameter than the pipelines from the cluster manifolds 203 2 mm and transport the same amount of the hydrocarbon production 44 000 bbl day 3 3 1 3 conventional stand alone pipeline risk assessment the methodology assesses and compares the risk level of the system made of flexible and rigid pipes the design of the pipeline system is composed only by the gathering system meaning that all pipes have diameter smaller than 406 4 mm table 8 presents the main pipeline groups features total number of pipes diameter average length and the hydrocarbon production flow rate and the risk assessment results severity s likelihood l equivalent expected loss eel and risk level rl of the pipelines groups the combination of severity s and likelihood l of the group of flowlines identified as cluster manifold touch down point tdp presents the highest risk level of the pipeline system of flexible pipes with an equivalent expected loss of 42 108 0 us year this corresponds to a medium risk level 28 072 00 eel 280 720 00 us year although the severity of this group is the same of the group of risers its likelihood is higher due to the pipelines average length that is almost twice of the group of risers the risk level of the pipeline system without clusters manifolds is also assessed in this case all wells are connected directly to platform for this evaluation there is only two groups of pipes the group of flowlines connecting the wells to the touch down point tdp and the group of risers the average length of the flowline groups is 5 6 km and the hydrocarbon flow rate per pipe is 8000 bbl day in addition the average frequency of failure of the group of flowlines made of flexibles pipes is 1 62 10 2 per year and the equivalent expect loss is 8253 5 us year the average frequency of failure of this group made of rigid pipes is 5 39 10 3 per year and the equivalent expect loss of 2752 9 us year the riser group has average length and failure of frequencies identical to the ones of the scenario using the cluster manifold therefore the hydrocarbon flow rate per pipe is 8000 bbl day and the equivalent expected loss equals 1888 4 us year for flexible pipes and 510 4 us year for rigid pipes the risk level of both groups of pipes is assessed as low for the system of flexible and rigid pipes the main reasons of the low risk level are the direct path well to platform and the hydrocarbon flow rate through pipes which is the same as the well production 8000 bbl day reducing the severity ranking 3 3 2 oilfield development concept 2 3 3 2 1 subsea to shore decision variables in this concept all the production is exported directly to shore which means that in this configuration there are no offshore facilities this concept is also known as subsea to shore table 9 presents the decision variables adopted for the development of the subsea to shore concept the onshore facility is around 300 km far from the oilfield thus because of the presence of water and carbon dioxide in the production profile the total production is sent to the subsea processing system to reduce the flow assurance uncertainties the subsea processing is adopted as an alternative for the offshore unit moreover the clustered subsea layout of 66 production wells is assumed to maintain the same arrangement the 12 clusters are divided into two groups of six clusters and for each group there is one subsea processing system early sp the reliability and availability analysis of the subsea processing system to be applied in ultra deepwater is out of the scope of the present paper the paper addresses only the use of a two phase subsea separator gas liquid as an alternative concept of an early stage of the subsea processing after the subsea processing separated pipelines will export the gas phase and the liquid phase oil and water fig 5 presents the subsea to shore concept 3 3 2 2 subsea to shore pipeline system definition the pipeline system of the subsea to shore field development has two main subsystems of pipes corresponding to the two subsea processing systems subsea separator for each subsystem three groups of pipelines are considered the group of flowlines from the wells to the cluster manifolds with a small diameter of 101 6 mm that transport the production of 8000 bbl day the group of flowlines from the manifold to the subsea processing system that transport the joint production of 44 000 bbl day with a diameter of 203 2 mm the group of the export pipelines that export the joint production from the subsea processing systems to shore each export pipeline has the diameter of 508 0 mm and transports the total oil production of 264 000 bbl d 3 3 2 3 subsea to shore pipeline risk assessment the subsea to shore field development concept employs the gathering and the export pipeline systems the gathering system divides the total production into two groups of six clusters and sends the production to two subsea separators afterwards the export system transports the oil production to shore by two rigid export pipelines the methodology assesses the failure frequency of the production pipeline system as flexible and rigid and the export pipelines as rigid single wall steel and rigid sandwich the main difference between the failure frequency assessment of the rigid export pipelines as rigid single wall steel and rigid sandwich is the total score of the parameter pipeline characteristics the rigid sandwich pipe presents a good mechanical resistance to the external pressure which avoids possible buckling of the line and in addition it has a good thermal insulation minimizing the external and internal corrosion furthermore the rigid sandwich pipelines consisting of the concentric pipes with the annulus filled with the structural material prevents failures due to loads from trawl boards for example table 10 presents the total scores of the failures mechanisms for the rigid single wall and the rigid sandwich pipes table 11 summarizes the main pipeline group features and the risk assessment results one group with medium risk level is the group of flexible flowlines from the cluster manifold to the subsea separator eel is 110 603 6 us year the main reason is the high length of the pipelines average length of 13 15 km the group of export pipelines is also assessed as medium risk the severity of the export pipes is evaluated as extreme s 5 and their rating level of the likelihood is classified as possible l 3 however the equivalent expected loss eel of the rigid single wall export pipes is 96 174 6 us year which is higher than the eel of 36 212 8 us year of the rigid sandwich export pipe 3 3 3 oilfield development concept 3 3 3 3 1 hybrid stand alone decision variables for this field development concept the hybrid stand alone oilfield development combines the conventional stand alone development using offshore facilities with the subsea to shore development employing the subsea processing system subsea separators the strategy to use the subsea processing in an early stage of the field development aims to reduce the water treatment area on the platform and consequently increasing the oil pre processing area it also implies that more wells can be connected to the offshore unit table 12 presents the main decision variables adopted instead of four fpsos used in the conventional stand alone concept to produce and storage the total production only two fpsos are needed for this alternative according to wang et al 2018 it is necessary to plan the production sequence of the wells to does not exceed the fpsos capacities wang et al 2018 presented the availability of this alternative concept looking also at the flow assurance of the new design more information about the feasibility of the hybrid stand alone development concept is provided by wang et al 2018 the hybrid stand alone alternative aggregates six cluster manifolds for each fpso the early subsea processing strategy is implemented for every two clusters of wells with the same production profile and the clusters have the same distance to the subsea processing aiming to reduce the backpressure at the subsea separator the produced water is reinjected directly into the reservoir and the reinjection alternates with the produced gas water alternating gas recovery fig 6 illustrates the production pipeline systems of the hybrid stand alone alternative concept 3 3 3 2 hybrid stand alone pipeline system definition the pipeline system consider each fpsos as individual subsystems of the concept the groups of production pipes are the flowlines that connect the wells to the manifolds with the small diameter of 101 6 mm and transport the production of 8000 bbl day the flowlines that transport the hydrocarbon production from the cluster manifolds to the subsea processing carrying the joint production of 44 000 bbl day and the diameter of the pipes equals 203 2 mm the hydrocarbon flowlines that link the subsea processing and the base of the risers touch down points tdp transporting the production flow rate of 88 000 bbl day with diameter of 203 2 mm the group of risers that transport the production flow rate of 88 000 bbl day with diameter of 203 2 mm 3 3 3 3 hybrid stand alone pipeline risk assessment all the pipes of the hybrid concept are part of the gathering system the methodology assess the failure frequency of the pipeline system made of flexible and rigid pipes table 13 presents the main pipeline group features and the risk assessment results the pipelines with the highest risk level are the flowlines group subsea processing touch down point tdp the risk level of the group of flexible pipes is assessed as medium with an equivalent expected loss of 129 131 2 us year although the severity of the group of flexible flowlines is the same of the risers the evaluated likelihood is higher the main reason is the higher length of the pipes the average length equals 8 32 km instead of 2 3 km of riser length 3 3 4 oilfield development concept 4 3 3 4 1 allam cycle stand alone decision variables the allam cycle stand alone field development consists of a new non conventional concept first the concept combines the application of dry and the wet tree systems as the fpso is not prepared to adopt the dry tree system a spar floating production unit is used for this case the spar platform serves to implement the dry wells to reinject the produced gas into the reservoir and receives the total hydrocarbon flow from the 66 wet production wells thus another function of the platform is the production of electricity using the allam cycle power plant table 14 presents the decision variables considered in this production concept after the separation process on the spar topside the liquid phase is offloaded to one fpso located near to the spar to pre process the oil and treat the water the water is reinjected into the reservoir moreover the oil export system assumed for this concept is the oil tanker for this development there are two subsystems of spars connected to two fpsos the clusters of wells are aggregated into two groups of six clusters for each subsystem spar fpso fig 7 shows the pipeline system of the allam cycle stand alone oilfield development 3 3 4 2 allam cycle stand alone pipeline system the pipeline systems is analogous to the pipeline arrangement of the conventional stand alone field development concept the direct paths manifold platform transport and rise the produced flow from the seabed to the spar platform without passing by any other subsea equipment i e subsea separator three groups compose the pipeline system the group of flowlines that transport the production from the wells 8000 bbl day to manifolds with diameter of 101 6 mm the flowlines with the diameter of 203 2 mm connecting the cluster manifolds to the touch down points tdp with the joint production of 44 000 bbl day the group of risers with the same diameter of 203 2 mm that transport the same amount of the hydrocarbon production from the manifold 44 000 bbl day 3 3 4 3 allam cycle stand alone pipeline risk assessment the pipeline system of flexible and rigid pipelines is assessed table 15 summarizes the main features and the risk assessment results of the system the group of pipes with the highest risk level is the group of flowlines that transport the production from the manifolds to the touch down points tdp assessed as medium risk with an equivalent expected loss of 72 987 2 us year it is possible to verify that the risk level of the allam cycle stand alone field development concept is similar to the conventional stand alone concept due to the similarities of the gathering system configuration 3 4 final remarks the production and the pipeline systems are different among the oilfield concepts the proposed methodology defines the decision variables for each development concept and in accordance with the decision variables the pipeline systems are established the semi quantitative risk assessment tool evaluates the risk levels of the system considering the flowlines and risers as flexible rigid and the export pipelines considered as rigid single wall and rigid sandwich pipelines the results of the risk levels of the pipeline systems ranked the alternative scenarios to develop the oilfield the subsea to shore development concept is the only pipeline system with an extreme severity ranking s 5 for the export pipeline group the maximum failure likelihood l 4 is obtained for the flowlines from the cluster manifold to subsea separator group of pipes the risk level of the subsea to shore pipeline system is compromised by the transportation of all production by two export pipelines if a failure event occurs in one export pipeline half of the total production is lost the hybrid stand alone development concept has the second highest severity ranking assessed as moderate s 3 due to the joint production from every two clusters to one subsea separator moreover the length of the group of pipes that connect the cluster manifolds and the subsea separator are the highest of the system increasing their failure frequency to level likely l 4 the conventional and allam cycle stand alone development concepts are evaluated with the maximum severity level of minor s 2 regarding failure frequency both concepts have also the maximum likelihood level considered as likely l 4 the main benefit of the pipelines arrangement applied in the conventional and allam cycle concepts is the transportation of the total production of each cluster manifold by a single path cluster manifold platform the direct path with low hydrocarbon flowrate reduces the severity and consequently decreases the equivalent expected loss eel 4 conclusions the paper presents a semi quantitative risk assessment tool to evaluate the risk level of the subsea pipeline systems during the concept selection phase of an oilfield development the approach starts with the development of the concept matrix that specifies the main decision variables and alternatives relevant for the field development a detailed description of the main features of the pipeline systems serves as input for the semi quantitative tool the pipeline system is then defined in terms of groups of pipes aggregated according to their dimensions and functions allowing the assessment of severity and likelihood levels of a leakage event the final step of the methodology is the assessment of an equivalent expected loss eel to quantify the risk level of each group of pipes the proposed methodology is applied to four alternative oilfield development concepts conventional subsea to shore hybrid and allam cycle scenarios according to the decision variables adopted for each production system the approach identified the pipeline groups with the greatest impact on the expected loss of a leakage event the results indicate that the pipeline systems of flexible pipes present higher frequencies of failures and consequently higher risk levels in comparison with the pipeline systems of rigid pipes flowlines and risers the evaluated pipelines failure frequencies are in line with those reported in the literature the results of the risk assessment methodology provide relevant knowledge on the weaknesses of the pipeline systems and subsystems reducing the inherent uncertainties to develop an oilfield at the design phase the assessment of the risk index at the design selection phase is the major element of the proposed methodology as it enables the decision makers to rank the alternative concepts in terms of risks expected losses this study therefore contributes with a risk assessment methodology to be used as a decision making support tool at the concept selection for oilfield development the identification of the risks of the pipelines groups also impacts the operational safety of the pipeline systems as it allows the definition of the maintenance plans and the measures to handle mitigate and control the risks at the selection phase moreover the structured semi quantitative evaluation of risks reduces the time and effort required to conduct a full quantitative risk analysis qra for all
