5110,epikarst fissures filled with soil efs are important factors controlling karst hydrological processes and ecological hydrological functions the efs are common in karst rocky desertification areas and it is important to understand the hydraulic properties and hydrological characteristics of efs for vegetation restoration in this study we analysed the soil moisture content dynamics of surface soil and efs in a rocky desertification environment to explore the influencing factors of soil moisture variation a typical epikarst fissure was selected as the sample site in the rocky desertification area of the karst plateau gorge beipanjiang catchment guizhou province in southwest china and surface soil was used as the control site from may 12 2018 to january 10 2020 soil moisture content data for the efs profile 20 80 140 200 and 260 cm and the surface soil profile 20 and 40 cm were monitored synchronously at 30 min intervals simultaneously soil samples were collected to measure the physical properties the results show that the difference in vegetation cover and soil physical properties is the main reason for the difference in soil water dynamics between the shallow efs and surface soil the shallow efs hydraulic connectivity is better and the mean values of total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of shallow efs are 15 6 and 69 5 higher than those of the surface soil respectively the seasonal variations in soil moisture in the shallow efs are obvious the soil moisture rainfall response and dry wet alternation are fast the seasonal variations in soil moisture in the surface soil are relatively stable and the soil water retention time is long in the efs profile the hydraulic connectivity of the shallow soil 0 40 cm are obviously better than those in the middle and lower layers 40 280 cm which affected the response speed and retention time of soil water at different depths in conclusion the vertical hydraulic connectivity of the efs profile is quite different and is shown to be significantly different from the surface soil hydrology these results are helpful for understanding the ecohydrological process of epikarst keywords karst rocky desertification soil moisture epikarst fissure soil hydrology 1 introduction the global karst area is approximately 22 million km2 accounting for 15 of the total land area and providing water for 20 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2007 the karst area of china is the largest and most widely distributed accounting for approximately 1 3 of the total national land area 3 4 million km2 which is mainly distributed in southwest china wang et al 2004 karst landforms have the characteristics of slow soil formation rates uncoordinated soil and water resources high exposure rates of bedrock and high spatial heterogeneity long term strong karstification has formed a unique dual surface and underground hydrological structure due to sufficient rainfall lack of water and soil on the surface poor function of soil and water regulation and storage and unreasonable human activities xu et al 2013 zhao and hou 2019 soil erosion in this area is serious and even rocky desertification has formed since the 1970s mangin 1973 found that there is a perched aquifer on the top of the vadose zone so he first proposed the concept of epikarst from the perspective of hydrogeography and then williams 1983 defined it as a subcutaneous zone from the perspective of karst dynamics epikarst is the first karst development layer below the surface a transitional zone connecting the karst dual hydrological structure the main space for the storage and migration of surface soil and water and an important factor for controlling the development of karst geomorphology and ecohydrological function soil and epikarst evolve together to form a complex hydrological system klimchouk 2004 williams 2008 the epikarst fissures filled with soil efs are mainly determined by the surface soil forming bedrock and the rocks that form karst fissure pipelines and the soil plays a role in promoting the development of fissures in karst rocky desertification areas because the soil is shallow and the bedrock is exposed abundant precipitation and high temperature provide favourable conditions for rock weathering and dissolution thus forming the characteristics of rock fragmentation crack development and good connectivity resulting in a large amount of surface leakage soil filling in the fissures zhou et al 2012 rocky desertification will change the rainfall runoff process reduce the retention time of precipitation on the surface and the resistance of slope flow and increase the permeability of the underground system with soil leakage in the fissures jiang et al 2014 due to the bare rock of the slope a large amount of precipitation penetrates directly into epikarst fissures through the soil layer in the process of infiltration fissures and joints are preferred for seepage which is one of the main reasons for the extremely low runoff of slopes in the rocky desertification area peng and wang 2012 green et al 2014 it has been reported that soil water in shallow karst fissures is an important source of plant water querejeta et al 2007 nie et al 2012 found that in the karst environment of bare rocks the water absorption of vegetation mainly depends on the soil water in rock fissures and the water use efficiency of plants in fissured soil is higher than that in surface soil in addition liu et al 2019 reported that the degree of epikarst fissure development determines the coverage of woody and herbaceous plants and the well developed fissure structure is more suitable for the growth of trees with deep roots yan et al 2019 considered that the most suitable vegetation types for ecological restoration in karst rocky desertification areas are deep rooted plants especially those with strong root penetration these studies show that fissure soil plays a key role in vegetation growth and restoration in karst areas and epikarst fissures are the best place for vegetation restoration peng et al 2020 therefore understanding the hydraulic properties and hydrological processes of efs is of great significance to vegetation restoration in karst rocky desertification areas unlike most areas the soil moisture in karst areas is more easily affected by topography soil structure and spatial heterogeneity yang et al 2019 zhang and berndtsson 1988 therefore in the complex micro geomorphology and fissure development environment soil water recharge may be more complex chen et al 2017 fissures soil distribution and permeability are the main factors controlling the dynamics of the water cycle in epikarst and efs has a hysteretic regulating effect on rainfall infiltration williams 2008 there is no soil cover in the epikarst of a severe rocky desertification environment and the infiltration mainly depends on the development degree of fissures in the epikarst the infiltration of precipitation is mainly controlled by the vertical conductivity of the epikarst in contrast the infiltration is mainly controlled by the soil permeability soil structure determines the distribution pattern and hydrological path of soil water lin 2010 similarly the soil epikarst structure has an important influence on the hydrological process in efss which controls the storage retention and infiltration process of karst water and is accompanied by the multi influence of soil preferential flow and matrix flow dasgupta et al 2006 in recent years the hydraulic properties and hydrological processes of efs have gradually become a research hotspot and have attracted the attention of scholars yang et al 2016 evaluated the hydraulic properties of three fissured soils in the huanjiang area of guangxi china and considered that the soil properties and stratification characteristics in the fissures are important factors determining the ecohydrological function of the efss lange et al 2010 found that the epikarst storage capacity also has an impact on the hydrological process and the water storage capacity of soil and rock in the unsaturated zone is the main factor of underground water seepage and recharge according to the results of rainfall simulation experiments fu et al 2015c 2016 found that the existence of efss obviously improves the water storage capacity of epikarst and the initial moisture condition of soil is the factor controlling the surface hydrological process only by studying the soil epikarst system can we fully understand the soil hydrological process in epikarst however most previous studies have only focused on surface soil or shallow fissure soil which limits the in depth understanding of the underground hydrological process of karst however the flow path of soil epikarst usually shows high heterogeneity fu et al 2015c so it is very difficult to observe directly moreover due to the influence of exposed rocks and gravel in their soils the hydrological process of efss may be more complex in rocky desertification areas so little is known about the hydrology of efss in rocky desertification areas the main purposes of this study are as follows 1 determine the difference in soil moisture variations between surface soil and shallow efs and its influencing factors 2 provide an analysis of soil moisture dynamics in the efs profile and 3 reveal the influence of soil hydraulic properties on its hydrological process 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in the ecohydrological observation station of the state engineering technology institute for karst desertification control in the beipanjiang catchment zhenfeng county guizhou province southwest china fig 1 with an area of approximately 26 km2 it belongs to the sub watershed of the middle reaches of the beipan river basin the total length of the basin is 449 km and the drainage area is 26557 km2 the beipanjiang catchment is part of the guizhou plateau and is located on the southeast side of the qinghai tibet plateau which is a typical type of karst plateau gorge landform since the cenozoic the area has been subjected to a strong intermittent tilting tectonic uplift movement neotectonic movement strong crustal deformation rapid undercutting of rivers and strong regional tectonic activity xiong 1995 the uplifted base level of erosion continues to enable the vertical erosion of groundwater in addition there is obvious differential weathering of carbonate rocks in the process of weathering and dissolution resulting in the interweaving of folds and fractures the joints of bedrock and epikarst fissures continue to expand and deepen the groundwater in this part preferentially infiltrates and dissolves gradually forming a unique dual hydrological structure in this area fig 2 the basic hydrological structure of the area can be divided into six types fig 2 the slope units are mainly slope surface flow and interflow in the upper part of the vadose zone there are mainly subcutaneous flow and vadose flow in the weathered fissure of bedrock which constitute fissure flow and in the underground hydrological system the underground pipeline flow is composed of shaft flow and subterranean rivers the epikarst belongs to the unsaturated zone with subcutaneous flow and vadose flow as the main hydrological types in the joint or fracture with good permeability the water flows under the influence of gravity to form a vertical fissure fig 2 this area is dominated by a middle subtropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1052 mm mainly from may to october a mean annual temperature of 18 4 and an altitude of 450 1350 m the lithology is dolomitic limestone of the middle triassic system and the soil type is calcareous soil in the history of the area after serious human made destruction and farming activities zhao and hou 2019 soil erosion is serious forming serious rocky desertification and the rock exposure rate is as high as 70 the soil texture is sticky and heavy the soil layer is thin and discontinuous and most of them are concentrated in depressions karst karrens or fissures most of the primary epikarst fissures are developed below the ground in the karst area which cannot be directly observed in the study area most of the observable fissures were formed during the production and excavation of the local quarry which also made this study feasible according to the previous investigation of 64 excavated fissures in the study area the average depth of the fissures is 260 16 cm table s1 we selected a typical epikarst fissure lx in the lower part of the catchment to study fig 1 lx was excavated in october 2017 the length of lx is 330 cm the vertical depth is 280 cm the top width is 30 cm and the bottom width is 25 cm fig 3 a the top of lx is covered with loose soil soil loss by surface runoff and basically no vegetation development at the same time at a horizontal distance of 50 cm from the top of lx flat land was selected as the control site of surface soil up the thickness of the soil was approximately 50 cm the overlying shrub and grass were developed and the root system was more evenly distributed fig 3a 2 2 sampling and measurements soil samples were collected in december 2017 a thickness of 20 cm of soil on the exposed side in the fissure was removed before collecting the lx soil samples and the litter on the upper part of up was cleared after that we referred to the undisturbed fissure soil sampling method of yang et al 2016 and stainless steel cutting rings 5 cm height and 5 cm diameter were used to collect undisturbed 0 50 cm soil samples from up and lx at a height of 5 cm in each layer and a height of 10 cm in each layer at 50 260 cm from lx disturbed soil was collected at two sample sites at the same time after the samples were collected five soil moisture sensors ech2o 5te meter group inc pullman wa usa were installed at lx at 20 lx20 80 lx80 140 lx140 200 lx200 and 260 lx260 cm from top to bottom to monitor the dynamic changes in soil moisture in the efs profile fig 3b at the same time two soil moisture sensors were installed at 20 up20 and 40 up40 cm in the up profile fig 3c dasgupta et al 2006 considered that the optimal way to study hydrological process of efs is in situ monitoring which requires bedrock excavation however once the excavated profile is exposed to air properties of the fissure soil may change during the monitoring period as the surrounding environment changes yang et al 2016 to avoid the above effects during the monitoring period we used cement to strengthen and seal the exposed side of the lx after installing the sensor fig 3b after that we covered the fissure with sunshade cloth and impervious plastic film to prevent rainfall disturbing the internal soil directly from the side of the fissure fig 3d soil moisture was recorded on the data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa every 30 min from may 12 2018 to january 10 2020 609 days the weather station atmos meter group inc pullman wa usa is located 50 m away from the efs monitoring sites and the collected data include air temperature precipitation relative humidity and atmospheric pressure the frequency of recording data is synchronized with the soil moisture sensor the experiment of soil properties was analysed in the stateengineeringtechnologyinstitutefor karstdesertificationcontrol soil bulk density total porosity capillary porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were measured by undisturbed soil samples non undisturbed soil samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve to analyse the soil particle composition using a laser particle size analyser eyetech ankersmid group inc nijverdal dh ned 2 3 wavelet coherence analysis the wavelet coherence analysis localizes the correlation coefficients of two time series in the time and frequency domains wavelet coherence can identify the similarity of spatial patterns between two spatial series in this study we use the morlet wavelet transform ω 6 and wavelet coherence toolbox provided by grinsted et al 2004 and the code is available at http noc ac uk using science crosswavelet wavelet coherence the wavelet coherence of two time series is defined as follows grinsted et al 2004 1 coherence s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where x and y are two time series w n xy s is the interactive wavelet power of the time series x and y w n x s and w n y s are wavelet transforms of time series x and y respectively and s is a smoothing operator the wavelet coherence value is 0 1 which represents the local information of the linear relationship between the two processes 2 4 statistical

cm soil layer the mean values of total porosity and ks of lx are 15 6 and 69 5 higher respectively than those of up the mean values of bulk density total porosity and ks in the 0 40 cm soil layer of lx are significantly different from those in the 40 280 cm soil layer the mean values of total porosity and ks in the 0 40 cm soil layer are 33 7 and 488 6 higher respectively than those in the 40 280 cm soil layer and the mean value of bulk density is 15 5 lower than that in the 40 280 cm soil layer the coefficient of variation in bulk density is lx 0 40 cm cv 5 5 up 0 40 cm cv 4 5 lx 40 280 cm cv 3 1 the total porosity is lx 0 40 cm cv 3 9 up 0 40 cm cv 3 3 lx 40 280 cm cv 2 1 and the ks is lx 0 40 cm cv 41 6 up 0 40 cm cv 28 7 lx 40 280 cm cv 8 5 fig 4 shows the soil particle composition information of the up and lx profiles up showed that with increasing depth clay and silt gradually increased and sand gradually decreased lx showed that with increasing depth clay gradually increased and silt and sand gradually decreased the mean value of the soil particle composition in up 0 40 cm is silt sand clay lx 0 40 cm is silt sand clay and lx 40 280 cm is silt clay sand table 1 the 40 280 cm soil layer of lx is 81 3 more than that of the 0 40 cm clay layer 13 6 less for silt and 42 4 less for sand the mean value of clay in the 40 280 cm soil layer increased by 81 3 compared with the 0 40 cm layer at lx which decreased by 13 6 for silt and decreased by 42 4 for sand 3 2 dynamic characteristics of soil moisture during the monitoring period the mean daily rainfall is 3 2 mm the mean daily temperature is 22 4 c and the mean soil moisture exhibits the following order lx200 lx140 lx260 up40 up20 lx80 lx20 table 2 the coefficient of variation in soil moisture in the upper part of lx is higher than that in the upper part of up and the coefficient of variation in soil moisture in the lower part of lx is relatively lower fig 5 shows the dynamic changes in soil moisture in the soil profiles of up and lx which correspond to the changes in air temperature and rainfall the precipitation is mainly concentrated from may to october and accompanied by continuous high temperatures there was a significant difference in soil moisture content dynamics in the upper part between up and lx the soil moisture in the 20 80 cm soil layer of lx shows obvious alternations of dry and wet with seasonal variation indicating that it is strongly affected by temperature and rainfall and has a strong correlation with the seasonal cycle however the seasonal variation in soil moisture in the 20 40 cm soil layer of up is relatively stable indicating that the retention time of shallow soil water in up is longer than that of lx the soil moisture in the 120 260 cm soil layer of lx was significantly higher than that in the 20 80 cm soil layer table 2 and the retention time was relatively long fig 5 it should be noted that when the daily rainfall exceeds 50 mm the soil moisture of lx200 can reach 36 3 3 the response of soil moisture to rainfall events based on the monitoring data of the sensor we counted the changes in the sensor data in 14 typical rainfall events 20 mm in general with increasing soil depth the hysteresis in the soil moisture content peak is stronger fig 6 moreover according to the cumulative rainfall the response to the first increase in soil moisture was used to analyse the response hysteresis of rainfall at different depths for the up and lx profiles fig 7 the mean value of the cumulative rainfall of the first increase in soil moisture in 14 rainfall events has the following order lx260 24 6 mm lx80 24 2 mm lx200 22 8 mm up40 21 9 mm up20 20 5 mm lx140 18 5 mm lx20 13 6 mm the results show that the response speed of rainfall in the lx profile has the following order lx20 lx140 lx200 lx80 lx260 3 4 wavelet coherence analysis of soil moisture at various soil depths as shown in table 3 the spearman rank correlation coefficients rs of soil moisture between different soil depths in up and lx were statistically significant p 0 01 the dynamic variations in soil moisture at different depths were similar during the monitoring period indicating that there is temporal stability in the soil water during rainfall events the correlation coefficient between up20 and up40 was relatively high rs 0 950 in lx the highest correlation coefficients are lx80 and lx140 rs 0 952 and the lowest are lx200 and lx260 rs 0 798 to explore the similarity and difference in shallow soil water dynamics between up and lx we used the wavelet coherency analysis to study the correlation between up20 and lx20 at different time scales as shown in fig 8 under rainfall conditions there was a significant correlation between up20 and lx20 on the scale of 8 d but a lower correlation in the dry season on the time scale of 16 d except for a few cases there was a significant positive correlation in most cases fig 9 shows the time series correlations of soil moisture among different depths of lx and the correspondence to rainfall events on the scale of 8 d in the time series most of the significant positive correlations exist when there are rainfall events but the correlation is obviously poor during the dry period during the rainy season in 2019 may october there was a significant positive correlation between soil moisture at almost all depths on the scale of 8 d for adjacent depths lx20 and lx80 showed a significant positive correlation in the whole time series on the scale of 32 d however the significant areas of lx80 and lx140 lx140 and lx200 lx200 and lx260 decreased significantly on the scale of 32 d and the significant areas of lx140 and lx200 were the lowest it is worth noting that the significant areas of lx20 and lx140 in all wavelet correlation analyses of fig 9 are the highest indicating that the factors affecting soil moisture at the two depths are the most similar 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic difference in shallow soil moisture between lx and up the shallow soil water in karst areas is a complex process affected by rainfall drought interval vegetation type soil structure and exposed rocks and karst areas have stronger spatiotemporal heterogeneity than other areas chen et al 2017 li et al 2014 2017 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 this study showed that under rainfall conditions the soil moisture content dynamics of up20 and lx20 showed a significant positive correlation at almost all time scales while the drought period led to their low correlation on a short time scale fig 8 according to the dynamic characteristics of shallow soil water for up and lx fig 5 the rainfall response of the lx shallow soil moisture is fast and the dry wet alternation and seasonal variation are obvious but the soil moisture of up is relatively high the seasonal variation is relatively stable and the retention time of soil water is long fu et al 2015a b proposed that the high content of gravel in the soil in karst rocky desertification areas is an important characteristic different from non karst areas crushed stone increases the temperature of shallow soil and promotes evaporation cousin et al 2003 meanwhile a higher gravel content is accompanied by a high infiltration capacity in the soil which makes it easier for water to migrate to the deep layer in general the shallow fissures are in the karrens which are affected by weathering and nearby soil erosion over a long time resulting in a relatively high content of gravel in the shallow fissure soil in addition the soil structure of shallow fissures is worse than that of surface soils yan et al 2019a through the investigation of three fissures yang et al 2016 found that shallow fissure soil shows extremely high ks and the infiltration rate of rainfall is very fast which may be related to the significantly high total porosity of shallow fissure soil peng et al 2019 in this study the mean values of total porosity and ks of shallow soil in lx were significantly higher than those in up table 1 and their coefficient of variations also showed this rule indicating that the hydraulic connectivity of the shallow soil in lx was better than that in up which is related to the study by yang et al 2016 the reported results are similar it is believed that the variations in soil ks are mainly caused by changes in soil texture and structure schwen et al 2014 ks usually decreases with increasing clay content due to the decrease in soil porosity fu et al 2015a b yang et al 2019b analysed the distribution of soil particle sizes in shallow fissures during rainfall and the results showed that with increasing rainfall times the clay content decreased and the sand content increased indicating that the soil clay migrated downward therefore the content of sand in the surface soil is somewhat high because the sand is coarse and does not easily creep the particle composition of the lx shallow soil in this study also showed the same rule fig 4 nie et al 2014 believes that most of the plant roots in the karst area exist in the lateral development of the loose surface soil so the effect of plant roots on the soil structure is mainly limited to the shallow soil for up the root growth of vegetation in shallow soil not only increases the soil looseness but also causes the horizontal flow of soil water after infiltration of most precipitation fu et al 2015b in addition vegetation cover slowed the soil evaporation in the up shallow profile although the impact of plant water consumption needs to be considered this loss is far lower than the soil water loss caused by infiltration and evaporation in the lx shallow soil which is supported by the research conclusion of nie et al 2011 in guangxi southwestern china therefore the retention time of up shallow soil water is longer than that of lx and the coefficient of variation is lower table 2 thus the rainfall response of shallow soil moisture is fast with rapid loss and the alternation variation in the dry and wet soil is obvious in the lx shallow soil the difference in vegetation cover and soil physical properties is the main reason for the difference in the soil water dynamics between lx and up 4 2 the response of soil moisture in efs to rainfall events the rainfall response of soil moisture at various depths in lx were significantly different as shown in fig 6 although the response speed of shallow lx soil moisture to rainfall is fast after a rainfall event the falling speed is also relatively fast it is worth noting that the duration of drought events can enhance or weaken the response of soil moisture to rainfall events for example an event resulting 52 mm of precipitation occurred on june 16 2019 in the precipitation event two days later june 18 when the precipitation of lx20 lx80 lx140 lx200 and lx260 reached 6 6 15 8 15 8 15 8 and 15 8 mm respectively the soil moisture content of each layer increased significantly however after 18 days of continuous drought in the rainfall event on july 6 2019 the precipitation of lx20 lx80 lx140 lx200 and lx260 needed to reach 25 25 25 47 8 25 mm respectively for there to be a significant change in the soil moisture content of each layer fig 7 therefore the response of soil moisture to rainfall is more sensitive for short term continuous rainfall events and the long term drought interval will lead to a hysteresis in the rainfall response he et al 2012 suggested that large rainfall events with a short drought interval produce a superposition effect in which the cumulative amount of rain can increase soil moisture even in deeper soil layers which is similar to the results of this study fig 6 in most cases it takes more than 7 days for the soil moisture content of the bottom layer 200 260 cm to drop to 70 of the peak value after rainfall events while the soil moisture content of the shallow layer 20 80 cm decreases in less than 3 days fig 5 this indicates that the retention time of soil water in the bottom layer of lx is significantly longer than that in the shallow layer on the one hand the soil water of the bottom layer receives infiltration from the upper layer on the other hand the retention time of soil water may be increased due to the high clay content in the bottom layer moreover the results of wavelet coherence analysis show that there is a significant positive correlation on the scale of 8 d at various soil depths in lx during rainfall fig 9 which indicates that the response of soil moisture to rainfall at different depths has coherency which has been shown in most studies li et al 2017 lee and kim 2019 however the correlation is low under drought interval fig 9 which reflects that there are significant differences in the soil water retention time at different depths moreover the difference in evapotranspiration between the shallow layer and the bottom layer is another factor that cannot be ignored karst soil has a low water holding capacity and high permeability which promotes the rapid vertical downward transport of soil water canton et al 2016 yang et al 2019 and the displacement speed decreases with increasing depth in the soil layer chen et al 2017 yang et al 2016 believes that the hydrological function of efss is controlled by the properties and distributions of soils or fillings in the fissures and describes the following potential flow path in karst areas only a small part of the soil patches have fissures underneath resulting in most of the precipitation being blocked by bedrock in contact with the soil and interflow becomes the main type of hydrology mcdaniel et al 2008 which is the main form of retained water this flow path also causes soil water redistribution in addition the existence of the clay layer usually in the bottom of the efs restricts the rapid infiltration of soil water yang et al 2016 if there are no other pore channels interflow will be formed between the clay layer and the rapid seepage layer indicating that the direction of subsurface flow will also change according to the connectivity of the underlying soil structure dasgupta et al 2006 mcdaniel et al 2008 fu et al 2015c 2016 yang et al 2016 as mentioned before there are more sands and fewer clays in the lx shallow soil showing the opposite trend with increasing depth fig 4 the mean value of clays in the 40 280 cm soil layer is 81 3 higher than that in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the sand is 42 4 lower table 1 moreover the soil total porosity and ks of the lx shallow soil are significantly higher than those of the deep soil the bulk density is lower than that of deep soil and the coefficient of variation in all three profiles shows that shallow soil is greater than that of deep soil table 1 the results show that the hydraulic connectivity of the lx shallow soil are better than those of the middle and lower layers which affects the retention time of soil water at different depths 4 3 soil hydrology of epikarst fissures in the rocky desertification area in general in the soil profile the correlation between the soil moisture variables of the two adjacent soil layers is relatively high in the time series the deeper the soil layer is the stronger the soil water time stability of the adjacent soil layers is zhao et al 2020 and the higher the significance of the wavelet coherence is li et al 2017 lee and kim 2019 however in this study although we can directly observe the vertical development of the lx profile the results of the wavelet coherence analysis show that the soil hydrological process of lx is quite different from that of the usual soil profile for example in the wavelet coherent time series of soil moisture at different depths in lx fig 8 the coherence of most soil moisture time series at a scale of 32 d between different depths is low furthermore the response of soil moisture at lx140 and lx200 is faster than that at lx80 figs 6 and 7 as mentioned above the significant areas of lx20 and lx140 in the wavelet coherence analysis are significantly higher fig 8 in addition in terms of the rainfall response speed of soil moisture among the five soil moisture sensors of lx the response speed of lx140 is next to that of lx20 figs 6 and 7 according to the site conditions the soil rock mixed medium formed by gravel and weathered filling in efs may have an influence on hydrological process fig 3a the hydrologic process of the soil rock mixed medium is different from that of usual pure surface soil which is an obvious difference between the soil hydrologic process of rocky desertification areas and other areas bare rocks may have some influence on soil hydrological processes and supply zhao et al 2020 li et al 2014 observed the spatial and temporal distributions of soil water around an outcrop rock in a karst rocky desertification area of southwest china it was found that bare rocks caused the redistribution of precipitation which mainly infiltrated from the rock soil boundary to the deep layer and this irregular rock led to heterogeneity in the surrounding soil water wang et al 2016 further found that when the bare rock area reaches 70 of the surface the water amount obtained by the soil patches from the rock runoff will be equal to the water amount obtained from precipitation this double precipitation increased the water input of the nearby soil patches resulting in the nonuniformity of the surrounding soil moisture in eps hydrology porous karst topography gives underground pipeline networks higher infiltration and faster water movement speeds peng and wang 2012 green et al 2014 fu et al 2015c believe that the deep soil in the fissure easily collects the supply of different hydrological paths and the soil water supply is more complex with strong spatial heterogeneity the existence of water retention in the irregular development of rock pores will also affect the hydrological process moreover there is preferential flow at the soil rock interface fu et al 2015c 2016 conducted four rainfall simulation experiments on efss and found that 70 of the precipitation moved vertically through the shallow soil and was redistributed as preferential flow on the soil epikarst interface and similar results were reported by dasgupta et al 2006 and sohrt et al 2014 in summary in contrast to the surface soil profile the vertical hydraulic connectivity of soil in the lx profile is quite different so the hydrological process of efs in the rocky desertification area is more complex 5 conclusions the soil moisture of the epikarst fissure lx in the karst rocky desertification area was continuously monitored for 609 days and the surface soil up near lx was taken as the control point the soil physical and chemical properties and the dynamic variations in the soil moisture in the two sample sites were analysed the results show that the difference in vegetation cover and soil physical properties is the main reason for the difference in soil water dynamics between lx shallow soil and up soil the mean value of total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of lx shallow soil is significantly higher than that of up and the hydraulic connectivity is better than that of up the seasonal variations in soil moisture in the lx shallow layer are obvious the rainfall response of soil moisture and the alternation of dry wet conditions are fast the seasonal variations in soil moisture in up are relatively stable and the retention time of soil water is long in the lx profile there is more sand and less clay in the lx shallow soil which shows the opposite trend with increasing depth the mean value of the total porosity and ks of shallow soil is higher than that of deep soil and the bulk density is lower than that of deep soil the hydraulic connectivity of the lx shallow soil are better than those of the middle and lower layers which affects the response speed of soil moisture at different depths for short term continuous rainfall events the response of soil moisture to rainfall is more sensitive and long term drought interval lead to a hysteresis in the rainfall response furthermore the results of the wavelet coherence analysis showed that when rainfall events occurred most of the soil moisture between different depths of lx showed a significant positive correlation on the scale of 8 d but the correlation was poor in the dry period indicating that the soil water retention time at different depths exhibited significant differences ultimately the findings reveal a relatively complex hydrological path of the efs in the rocky desertification area the vertical hydraulic connectivity of the efs profile is quite different and is shown to be significantly different from the surface soil hydrology the results have significant importance for vegetation restoration strategies in rocky desertification regions credit authorship contribution statement yuan li writing original draft

5110,epikarst fissures filled with soil efs are important factors controlling karst hydrological processes and ecological hydrological functions the efs are common in karst rocky desertification areas and it is important to understand the hydraulic properties and hydrological characteristics of efs for vegetation restoration in this study we analysed the soil moisture content dynamics of surface soil and efs in a rocky desertification environment to explore the influencing factors of soil moisture variation a typical epikarst fissure was selected as the sample site in the rocky desertification area of the karst plateau gorge beipanjiang catchment guizhou province in southwest china and surface soil was used as the control site from may 12 2018 to january 10 2020 soil moisture content data for the efs profile 20 80 140 200 and 260 cm and the surface soil profile 20 and 40 cm were monitored synchronously at 30 min intervals simultaneously soil samples were collected to measure the physical properties the results show that the difference in vegetation cover and soil physical properties is the main reason for the difference in soil water dynamics between the shallow efs and surface soil the shallow efs hydraulic connectivity is better and the mean values of total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of shallow efs are 15 6 and 69 5 higher than those of the surface soil respectively the seasonal variations in soil moisture in the shallow efs are obvious the soil moisture rainfall response and dry wet alternation are fast the seasonal variations in soil moisture in the surface soil are relatively stable and the soil water retention time is long in the efs profile the hydraulic connectivity of the shallow soil 0 40 cm are obviously better than those in the middle and lower layers 40 280 cm which affected the response speed and retention time of soil water at different depths in conclusion the vertical hydraulic connectivity of the efs profile is quite different and is shown to be significantly different from the surface soil hydrology these results are helpful for understanding the ecohydrological process of epikarst keywords karst rocky desertification soil moisture epikarst fissure soil hydrology 1 introduction the global karst area is approximately 22 million km2 accounting for 15 of the total land area and providing water for 20 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2007 the karst area of china is the largest and most widely distributed accounting for approximately 1 3 of the total national land area 3 4 million km2 which is mainly distributed in southwest china wang et al 2004 karst landforms have the characteristics of slow soil formation rates uncoordinated soil and water resources high exposure rates of bedrock and high spatial heterogeneity long term strong karstification has formed a unique dual surface and underground hydrological structure due to sufficient rainfall lack of water and soil on the surface poor function of soil and water regulation and storage and unreasonable human activities xu et al 2013 zhao and hou 2019 soil erosion in this area is serious and even rocky desertification has formed since the 1970s mangin 1973 found that there is a perched aquifer on the top of the vadose zone so he first proposed the concept of epikarst from the perspective of hydrogeography and then williams 1983 defined it as a subcutaneous zone from the perspective of karst dynamics epikarst is the first karst development layer below the surface a transitional zone connecting the karst dual hydrological structure the main space for the storage and migration of surface soil and water and an important factor for controlling the development of karst geomorphology and ecohydrological function soil and epikarst evolve together to form a complex hydrological system klimchouk 2004 williams 2008 the epikarst fissures filled with soil efs are mainly determined by the surface soil forming bedrock and the rocks that form karst fissure pipelines and the soil plays a role in promoting the development of fissures in karst rocky desertification areas because the soil is shallow and the bedrock is exposed abundant precipitation and high temperature provide favourable conditions for rock weathering and dissolution thus forming the characteristics of rock fragmentation crack development and good connectivity resulting in a large amount of surface leakage soil filling in the fissures zhou et al 2012 rocky desertification will change the rainfall runoff process reduce the retention time of precipitation on the surface and the resistance of slope flow and increase the permeability of the underground system with soil leakage in the fissures jiang et al 2014 due to the bare rock of the slope a large amount of precipitation penetrates directly into epikarst fissures through the soil layer in the process of infiltration fissures and joints are preferred for seepage which is one of the main reasons for the extremely low runoff of slopes in the rocky desertification area peng and wang 2012 green et al 2014 it has been reported that soil water in shallow karst fissures is an important source of plant water querejeta et al 2007 nie et al 2012 found that in the karst environment of bare rocks the water absorption of vegetation mainly depends on the soil water in rock fissures and the water use efficiency of plants in fissured soil is higher than that in surface soil in addition liu et al 2019 reported that the degree of epikarst fissure development determines the coverage of woody and herbaceous plants and the well developed fissure structure is more suitable for the growth of trees with deep roots yan et al 2019 considered that the most suitable vegetation types for ecological restoration in karst rocky desertification areas are deep rooted plants especially those with strong root penetration these studies show that fissure soil plays a key role in vegetation growth and restoration in karst areas and epikarst fissures are the best place for vegetation restoration peng et al 2020 therefore understanding the hydraulic properties and hydrological processes of efs is of great significance to vegetation restoration in karst rocky desertification areas unlike most areas the soil moisture in karst areas is more easily affected by topography soil structure and spatial heterogeneity yang et al 2019 zhang and berndtsson 1988 therefore in the complex micro geomorphology and fissure development environment soil water recharge may be more complex chen et al 2017 fissures soil distribution and permeability are the main factors controlling the dynamics of the water cycle in epikarst and efs has a hysteretic regulating effect on rainfall infiltration williams 2008 there is no soil cover in the epikarst of a severe rocky desertification environment and the infiltration mainly depends on the development degree of fissures in the epikarst the infiltration of precipitation is mainly controlled by the vertical conductivity of the epikarst in contrast the infiltration is mainly controlled by the soil permeability soil structure determines the distribution pattern and hydrological path of soil water lin 2010 similarly the soil epikarst structure has an important influence on the hydrological process in efss which controls the storage retention and infiltration process of karst water and is accompanied by the multi influence of soil preferential flow and matrix flow dasgupta et al 2006 in recent years the hydraulic properties and hydrological processes of efs have gradually become a research hotspot and have attracted the attention of scholars yang et al 2016 evaluated the hydraulic properties of three fissured soils in the huanjiang area of guangxi china and considered that the soil properties and stratification characteristics in the fissures are important factors determining the ecohydrological function of the efss lange et al 2010 found that the epikarst storage capacity also has an impact on the hydrological process and the water storage capacity of soil and rock in the unsaturated zone is the main factor of underground water seepage and recharge according to the results of rainfall simulation experiments fu et al 2015c 2016 found that the existence of efss obviously improves the water storage capacity of epikarst and the initial moisture condition of soil is the factor controlling the surface hydrological process only by studying the soil epikarst system can we fully understand the soil hydrological process in epikarst however most previous studies have only focused on surface soil or shallow fissure soil which limits the in depth understanding of the underground hydrological process of karst however the flow path of soil epikarst usually shows high heterogeneity fu et al 2015c so it is very difficult to observe directly moreover due to the influence of exposed rocks and gravel in their soils the hydrological process of efss may be more complex in rocky desertification areas so little is known about the hydrology of efss in rocky desertification areas the main purposes of this study are as follows 1 determine the difference in soil moisture variations between surface soil and shallow efs and its influencing factors 2 provide an analysis of soil moisture dynamics in the efs profile and 3 reveal the influence of soil hydraulic properties on its hydrological process 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in the ecohydrological observation station of the state engineering technology institute for karst desertification control in the beipanjiang catchment zhenfeng county guizhou province southwest china fig 1 with an area of approximately 26 km2 it belongs to the sub watershed of the middle reaches of the beipan river basin the total length of the basin is 449 km and the drainage area is 26557 km2 the beipanjiang catchment is part of the guizhou plateau and is located on the southeast side of the qinghai tibet plateau which is a typical type of karst plateau gorge landform since the cenozoic the area has been subjected to a strong intermittent tilting tectonic uplift movement neotectonic movement strong crustal deformation rapid undercutting of rivers and strong regional tectonic activity xiong 1995 the uplifted base level of erosion continues to enable the vertical erosion of groundwater in addition there is obvious differential weathering of carbonate rocks in the process of weathering and dissolution resulting in the interweaving of folds and fractures the joints of bedrock and epikarst fissures continue to expand and deepen the groundwater in this part preferentially infiltrates and dissolves gradually forming a unique dual hydrological structure in this area fig 2 the basic hydrological structure of the area can be divided into six types fig 2 the slope units are mainly slope surface flow and interflow in the upper part of the vadose zone there are mainly subcutaneous flow and vadose flow in the weathered fissure of bedrock which constitute fissure flow and in the underground hydrological system the underground pipeline flow is composed of shaft flow and subterranean rivers the epikarst belongs to the unsaturated zone with subcutaneous flow and vadose flow as the main hydrological types in the joint or fracture with good permeability the water flows under the influence of gravity to form a vertical fissure fig 2 this area is dominated by a middle subtropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1052 mm mainly from may to october a mean annual temperature of 18 4 and an altitude of 450 1350 m the lithology is dolomitic limestone of the middle triassic system and the soil type is calcareous soil in the history of the area after serious human made destruction and farming activities zhao and hou 2019 soil erosion is serious forming serious rocky desertification and the rock exposure rate is as high as 70 the soil texture is sticky and heavy the soil layer is thin and discontinuous and most of them are concentrated in depressions karst karrens or fissures most of the primary epikarst fissures are developed below the ground in the karst area which cannot be directly observed in the study area most of the observable fissures were formed during the production and excavation of the local quarry which also made this study feasible according to the previous investigation of 64 excavated fissures in the study area the average depth of the fissures is 260 16 cm table s1 we selected a typical epikarst fissure lx in the lower part of the catchment to study fig 1 lx was excavated in october 2017 the length of lx is 330 cm the vertical depth is 280 cm the top width is 30 cm and the bottom width is 25 cm fig 3 a the top of lx is covered with loose soil soil loss by surface runoff and basically no vegetation development at the same time at a horizontal distance of 50 cm from the top of lx flat land was selected as the control site of surface soil up the thickness of the soil was approximately 50 cm the overlying shrub and grass were developed and the root system was more evenly distributed fig 3a 2 2 sampling and measurements soil samples were collected in december 2017 a thickness of 20 cm of soil on the exposed side in the fissure was removed before collecting the lx soil samples and the litter on the upper part of up was cleared after that we referred to the undisturbed fissure soil sampling method of yang et al 2016 and stainless steel cutting rings 5 cm height and 5 cm diameter were used to collect undisturbed 0 50 cm soil samples from up and lx at a height of 5 cm in each layer and a height of 10 cm in each layer at 50 260 cm from lx disturbed soil was collected at two sample sites at the same time after the samples were collected five soil moisture sensors ech2o 5te meter group inc pullman wa usa were installed at lx at 20 lx20 80 lx80 140 lx140 200 lx200 and 260 lx260 cm from top to bottom to monitor the dynamic changes in soil moisture in the efs profile fig 3b at the same time two soil moisture sensors were installed at 20 up20 and 40 up40 cm in the up profile fig 3c dasgupta et al 2006 considered that the optimal way to study hydrological process of efs is in situ monitoring which requires bedrock excavation however once the excavated profile is exposed to air properties of the fissure soil may change during the monitoring period as the surrounding environment changes yang et al 2016 to avoid the above effects during the monitoring period we used cement to strengthen and seal the exposed side of the lx after installing the sensor fig 3b after that we covered the fissure with sunshade cloth and impervious plastic film to prevent rainfall disturbing the internal soil directly from the side of the fissure fig 3d soil moisture was recorded on the data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa every 30 min from may 12 2018 to january 10 2020 609 days the weather station atmos meter group inc pullman wa usa is located 50 m away from the efs monitoring sites and the collected data include air temperature precipitation relative humidity and atmospheric pressure the frequency of recording data is synchronized with the soil moisture sensor the experiment of soil properties was analysed in the stateengineeringtechnologyinstitutefor karstdesertificationcontrol soil bulk density total porosity capillary porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were measured by undisturbed soil samples non undisturbed soil samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve to analyse the soil particle composition using a laser particle size analyser eyetech ankersmid group inc nijverdal dh ned 2 3 wavelet coherence analysis the wavelet coherence analysis localizes the correlation coefficients of two time series in the time and frequency domains wavelet coherence can identify the similarity of spatial patterns between two spatial series in this study we use the morlet wavelet transform ω 6 and wavelet coherence toolbox provided by grinsted et al 2004 and the code is available at http noc ac uk using science crosswavelet wavelet coherence the wavelet coherence of two time series is defined as follows grinsted et al 2004 1 coherence s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where x and y are two time series w n xy s is the interactive wavelet power of the time series x and y w n x s and w n y s are wavelet transforms of time series x and y respectively and s is a smoothing operator the wavelet coherence value is 0 1 which represents the local information of the linear relationship between the two processes 2 4 statistical

cm soil layer the mean values of total porosity and ks of lx are 15 6 and 69 5 higher respectively than those of up the mean values of bulk density total porosity and ks in the 0 40 cm soil layer of lx are significantly different from those in the 40 280 cm soil layer the mean values of total porosity and ks in the 0 40 cm soil layer are 33 7 and 488 6 higher respectively than those in the 40 280 cm soil layer and the mean value of bulk density is 15 5 lower than that in the 40 280 cm soil layer the coefficient of variation in bulk density is lx 0 40 cm cv 5 5 up 0 40 cm cv 4 5 lx 40 280 cm cv 3 1 the total porosity is lx 0 40 cm cv 3 9 up 0 40 cm cv 3 3 lx 40 280 cm cv 2 1 and the ks is lx 0 40 cm cv 41 6 up 0 40 cm cv 28 7 lx 40 280 cm cv 8 5 fig 4 shows the soil particle composition information of the up and lx profiles up showed that with increasing depth clay and silt gradually increased and sand gradually decreased lx showed that with increasing depth clay gradually increased and silt and sand gradually decreased the mean value of the soil particle composition in up 0 40 cm is silt sand clay lx 0 40 cm is silt sand clay and lx 40 280 cm is silt clay sand table 1 the 40 280 cm soil layer of lx is 81 3 more than that of the 0 40 cm clay layer 13 6 less for silt and 42 4 less for sand the mean value of clay in the 40 280 cm soil layer increased by 81 3 compared with the 0 40 cm layer at lx which decreased by 13 6 for silt and decreased by 42 4 for sand 3 2 dynamic characteristics of soil moisture during the monitoring period the mean daily rainfall is 3 2 mm the mean daily temperature is 22 4 c and the mean soil moisture exhibits the following order lx200 lx140 lx260 up40 up20 lx80 lx20 table 2 the coefficient of variation in soil moisture in the upper part of lx is higher than that in the upper part of up and the coefficient of variation in soil moisture in the lower part of lx is relatively lower fig 5 shows the dynamic changes in soil moisture in the soil profiles of up and lx which correspond to the changes in air temperature and rainfall the precipitation is mainly concentrated from may to october and accompanied by continuous high temperatures there was a significant difference in soil moisture content dynamics in the upper part between up and lx the soil moisture in the 20 80 cm soil layer of lx shows obvious alternations of dry and wet with seasonal variation indicating that it is strongly affected by temperature and rainfall and has a strong correlation with the seasonal cycle however the seasonal variation in soil moisture in the 20 40 cm soil layer of up is relatively stable indicating that the retention time of shallow soil water in up is longer than that of lx the soil moisture in the 120 260 cm soil layer of lx was significantly higher than that in the 20 80 cm soil layer table 2 and the retention time was relatively long fig 5 it should be noted that when the daily rainfall exceeds 50 mm the soil moisture of lx200 can reach 36 3 3 the response of soil moisture to rainfall events based on the monitoring data of the sensor we counted the changes in the sensor data in 14 typical rainfall events 20 mm in general with increasing soil depth the hysteresis in the soil moisture content peak is stronger fig 6 moreover according to the cumulative rainfall the response to the first increase in soil moisture was used to analyse the response hysteresis of rainfall at different depths for the up and lx profiles fig 7 the mean value of the cumulative rainfall of the first increase in soil moisture in 14 rainfall events has the following order lx260 24 6 mm lx80 24 2 mm lx200 22 8 mm up40 21 9 mm up20 20 5 mm lx140 18 5 mm lx20 13 6 mm the results show that the response speed of rainfall in the lx profile has the following order lx20 lx140 lx200 lx80 lx260 3 4 wavelet coherence analysis of soil moisture at various soil depths as shown in table 3 the spearman rank correlation coefficients rs of soil moisture between different soil depths in up and lx were statistically significant p 0 01 the dynamic variations in soil moisture at different depths were similar during the monitoring period indicating that there is temporal stability in the soil water during rainfall events the correlation coefficient between up20 and up40 was relatively high rs 0 950 in lx the highest correlation coefficients are lx80 and lx140 rs 0 952 and the lowest are lx200 and lx260 rs 0 798 to explore the similarity and difference in shallow soil water dynamics between up and lx we used the wavelet coherency analysis to study the correlation between up20 and lx20 at different time scales as shown in fig 8 under rainfall conditions there was a significant correlation between up20 and lx20 on the scale of 8 d but a lower correlation in the dry season on the time scale of 16 d except for a few cases there was a significant positive correlation in most cases fig 9 shows the time series correlations of soil moisture among different depths of lx and the correspondence to rainfall events on the scale of 8 d in the time series most of the significant positive correlations exist when there are rainfall events but the correlation is obviously poor during the dry period during the rainy season in 2019 may october there was a significant positive correlation between soil moisture at almost all depths on the scale of 8 d for adjacent depths lx20 and lx80 showed a significant positive correlation in the whole time series on the scale of 32 d however the significant areas of lx80 and lx140 lx140 and lx200 lx200 and lx260 decreased significantly on the scale of 32 d and the significant areas of lx140 and lx200 were the lowest it is worth noting that the significant areas of lx20 and lx140 in all wavelet correlation analyses of fig 9 are the highest indicating that the factors affecting soil moisture at the two depths are the most similar 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic difference in shallow soil moisture between lx and up the shallow soil water in karst areas is a complex process affected by rainfall drought interval vegetation type soil structure and exposed rocks and karst areas have stronger spatiotemporal heterogeneity than other areas chen et al 2017 li et al 2014 2017 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 this study showed that under rainfall conditions the soil moisture content dynamics of up20 and lx20 showed a significant positive correlation at almost all time scales while the drought period led to their low correlation on a short time scale fig 8 according to the dynamic characteristics of shallow soil water for up and lx fig 5 the rainfall response of the lx shallow soil moisture is fast and the dry wet alternation and seasonal variation are obvious but the soil moisture of up is relatively high the seasonal variation is relatively stable and the retention time of soil water is long fu et al 2015a b proposed that the high content of gravel in the soil in karst rocky desertification areas is an important characteristic different from non karst areas crushed stone increases the temperature of shallow soil and promotes evaporation cousin et al 2003 meanwhile a higher gravel content is accompanied by a high infiltration capacity in the soil which makes it easier for water to migrate to the deep layer in general the shallow fissures are in the karrens which are affected by weathering and nearby soil erosion over a long time resulting in a relatively high content of gravel in the shallow fissure soil in addition the soil structure of shallow fissures is worse than that of surface soils yan et al 2019a through the investigation of three fissures yang et al 2016 found that shallow fissure soil shows extremely high ks and the infiltration rate of rainfall is very fast which may be related to the significantly high total porosity of shallow fissure soil peng et al 2019 in this study the mean values of total porosity and ks of shallow soil in lx were significantly higher than those in up table 1 and their coefficient of variations also showed this rule indicating that the hydraulic connectivity of the shallow soil in lx was better than that in up which is related to the study by yang et al 2016 the reported results are similar it is believed that the variations in soil ks are mainly caused by changes in soil texture and structure schwen et al 2014 ks usually decreases with increasing clay content due to the decrease in soil porosity fu et al 2015a b yang et al 2019b analysed the distribution of soil particle sizes in shallow fissures during rainfall and the results showed that with increasing rainfall times the clay content decreased and the sand content increased indicating that the soil clay migrated downward therefore the content of sand in the surface soil is somewhat high because the sand is coarse and does not easily creep the particle composition of the lx shallow soil in this study also showed the same rule fig 4 nie et al 2014 believes that most of the plant roots in the karst area exist in the lateral development of the loose surface soil so the effect of plant roots on the soil structure is mainly limited to the shallow soil for up the root growth of vegetation in shallow soil not only increases the soil looseness but also causes the horizontal flow of soil water after infiltration of most precipitation fu et al 2015b in addition vegetation cover slowed the soil evaporation in the up shallow profile although the impact of plant water consumption needs to be considered this loss is far lower than the soil water loss caused by infiltration and evaporation in the lx shallow soil which is supported by the research conclusion of nie et al 2011 in guangxi southwestern china therefore the retention time of up shallow soil water is longer than that of lx and the coefficient of variation is lower table 2 thus the rainfall response of shallow soil moisture is fast with rapid loss and the alternation variation in the dry and wet soil is obvious in the lx shallow soil the difference in vegetation cover and soil physical properties is the main reason for the difference in the soil water dynamics between lx and up 4 2 the response of soil moisture in efs to rainfall events the rainfall response of soil moisture at various depths in lx were significantly different as shown in fig 6 although the response speed of shallow lx soil moisture to rainfall is fast after a rainfall event the falling speed is also relatively fast it is worth noting that the duration of drought events can enhance or weaken the response of soil moisture to rainfall events for example an event resulting 52 mm of precipitation occurred on june 16 2019 in the precipitation event two days later june 18 when the precipitation of lx20 lx80 lx140 lx200 and lx260 reached 6 6 15 8 15 8 15 8 and 15 8 mm respectively the soil moisture content of each layer increased significantly however after 18 days of continuous drought in the rainfall event on july 6 2019 the precipitation of lx20 lx80 lx140 lx200 and lx260 needed to reach 25 25 25 47 8 25 mm respectively for there to be a significant change in the soil moisture content of each layer fig 7 therefore the response of soil moisture to rainfall is more sensitive for short term continuous rainfall events and the long term drought interval will lead to a hysteresis in the rainfall response he et al 2012 suggested that large rainfall events with a short drought interval produce a superposition effect in which the cumulative amount of rain can increase soil moisture even in deeper soil layers which is similar to the results of this study fig 6 in most cases it takes more than 7 days for the soil moisture content of the bottom layer 200 260 cm to drop to 70 of the peak value after rainfall events while the soil moisture content of the shallow layer 20 80 cm decreases in less than 3 days fig 5 this indicates that the retention time of soil water in the bottom layer of lx is significantly longer than that in the shallow layer on the one hand the soil water of the bottom layer receives infiltration from the upper layer on the other hand the retention time of soil water may be increased due to the high clay content in the bottom layer moreover the results of wavelet coherence analysis show that there is a significant positive correlation on the scale of 8 d at various soil depths in lx during rainfall fig 9 which indicates that the response of soil moisture to rainfall at different depths has coherency which has been shown in most studies li et al 2017 lee and kim 2019 however the correlation is low under drought interval fig 9 which reflects that there are significant differences in the soil water retention time at different depths moreover the difference in evapotranspiration between the shallow layer and the bottom layer is another factor that cannot be ignored karst soil has a low water holding capacity and high permeability which promotes the rapid vertical downward transport of soil water canton et al 2016 yang et al 2019 and the displacement speed decreases with increasing depth in the soil layer chen et al 2017 yang et al 2016 believes that the hydrological function of efss is controlled by the properties and distributions of soils or fillings in the fissures and describes the following potential flow path in karst areas only a small part of the soil patches have fissures underneath resulting in most of the precipitation being blocked by bedrock in contact with the soil and interflow becomes the main type of hydrology mcdaniel et al 2008 which is the main form of retained water this flow path also causes soil water redistribution in addition the existence of the clay layer usually in the bottom of the efs restricts the rapid infiltration of soil water yang et al 2016 if there are no other pore channels interflow will be formed between the clay layer and the rapid seepage layer indicating that the direction of subsurface flow will also change according to the connectivity of the underlying soil structure dasgupta et al 2006 mcdaniel et al 2008 fu et al 2015c 2016 yang et al 2016 as mentioned before there are more sands and fewer clays in the lx shallow soil showing the opposite trend with increasing depth fig 4 the mean value of clays in the 40 280 cm soil layer is 81 3 higher than that in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the sand is 42 4 lower table 1 moreover the soil total porosity and ks of the lx shallow soil are significantly higher than those of the deep soil the bulk density is lower than that of deep soil and the coefficient of variation in all three profiles shows that shallow soil is greater than that of deep soil table 1 the results show that the hydraulic connectivity of the lx shallow soil are better than those of the middle and lower layers which affects the retention time of soil water at different depths 4 3 soil hydrology of epikarst fissures in the rocky desertification area in general in the soil profile the correlation between the soil moisture variables of the two adjacent soil layers is relatively high in the time series the deeper the soil layer is the stronger the soil water time stability of the adjacent soil layers is zhao et al 2020 and the higher the significance of the wavelet coherence is li et al 2017 lee and kim 2019 however in this study although we can directly observe the vertical development of the lx profile the results of the wavelet coherence analysis show that the soil hydrological process of lx is quite different from that of the usual soil profile for example in the wavelet coherent time series of soil moisture at different depths in lx fig 8 the coherence of most soil moisture time series at a scale of 32 d between different depths is low furthermore the response of soil moisture at lx140 and lx200 is faster than that at lx80 figs 6 and 7 as mentioned above the significant areas of lx20 and lx140 in the wavelet coherence analysis are significantly higher fig 8 in addition in terms of the rainfall response speed of soil moisture among the five soil moisture sensors of lx the response speed of lx140 is next to that of lx20 figs 6 and 7 according to the site conditions the soil rock mixed medium formed by gravel and weathered filling in efs may have an influence on hydrological process fig 3a the hydrologic process of the soil rock mixed medium is different from that of usual pure surface soil which is an obvious difference between the soil hydrologic process of rocky desertification areas and other areas bare rocks may have some influence on soil hydrological processes and supply zhao et al 2020 li et al 2014 observed the spatial and temporal distributions of soil water around an outcrop rock in a karst rocky desertification area of southwest china it was found that bare rocks caused the redistribution of precipitation which mainly infiltrated from the rock soil boundary to the deep layer and this irregular rock led to heterogeneity in the surrounding soil water wang et al 2016 further found that when the bare rock area reaches 70 of the surface the water amount obtained by the soil patches from the rock runoff will be equal to the water amount obtained from precipitation this double precipitation increased the water input of the nearby soil patches resulting in the nonuniformity of the surrounding soil moisture in eps hydrology porous karst topography gives underground pipeline networks higher infiltration and faster water movement speeds peng and wang 2012 green et al 2014 fu et al 2015c believe that the deep soil in the fissure easily collects the supply of different hydrological paths and the soil water supply is more complex with strong spatial heterogeneity the existence of water retention in the irregular development of rock pores will also affect the hydrological process moreover there is preferential flow at the soil rock interface fu et al 2015c 2016 conducted four rainfall simulation experiments on efss and found that 70 of the precipitation moved vertically through the shallow soil and was redistributed as preferential flow on the soil epikarst interface and similar results were reported by dasgupta et al 2006 and sohrt et al 2014 in summary in contrast to the surface soil profile the vertical hydraulic connectivity of soil in the lx profile is quite different so the hydrological process of efs in the rocky desertification area is more complex 5 conclusions the soil moisture of the epikarst fissure lx in the karst rocky desertification area was continuously monitored for 609 days and the surface soil up near lx was taken as the control point the soil physical and chemical properties and the dynamic variations in the soil moisture in the two sample sites were analysed the results show that the difference in vegetation cover and soil physical properties is the main reason for the difference in soil water dynamics between lx shallow soil and up soil the mean value of total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of lx shallow soil is significantly higher than that of up and the hydraulic connectivity is better than that of up the seasonal variations in soil moisture in the lx shallow layer are obvious the rainfall response of soil moisture and the alternation of dry wet conditions are fast the seasonal variations in soil moisture in up are relatively stable and the retention time of soil water is long in the lx profile there is more sand and less clay in the lx shallow soil which shows the opposite trend with increasing depth the mean value of the total porosity and ks of shallow soil is higher than that of deep soil and the bulk density is lower than that of deep soil the hydraulic connectivity of the lx shallow soil are better than those of the middle and lower layers which affects the response speed of soil moisture at different depths for short term continuous rainfall events the response of soil moisture to rainfall is more sensitive and long term drought interval lead to a hysteresis in the rainfall response furthermore the results of the wavelet coherence analysis showed that when rainfall events occurred most of the soil moisture between different depths of lx showed a significant positive correlation on the scale of 8 d but the correlation was poor in the dry period indicating that the soil water retention time at different depths exhibited significant differences ultimately the findings reveal a relatively complex hydrological path of the efs in the rocky desertification area the vertical hydraulic connectivity of the efs profile is quite different and is shown to be significantly different from the surface soil hydrology the results have significant importance for vegetation restoration strategies in rocky desertification regions credit authorship contribution statement yuan li writing original draft

5111,near surface soil hydro thermodynamics plays an important role in heat and water transfer between land and atmosphere however it is difficult to quantify these processes in field campaigns such as movement of liquid water and water vapor this has affected determination of ground heat flux a key component of surface energy budget this study aims to quantify soil heat and water processes utilizing in situ measurements and to improve ground heat flux estimation and surface energy imbalance a new model has been proposed based on three main physical processes including thermal conduction convection of heat by moving water and convection of latent heat the model was tested at a grassland site in colorado usa results show that the model can capture high values of soil water content during rain events low values under intense solar radiation and high frequency fluctuations under intermittent cloudy conditions also the model produces reasonable vertical velocity and mass flux of water vapor for the estimation of ground heat flux the method that considers vertical variation of soil thermal conductivity and the contribution of water vapor gives better energy balance ratio than methods that ignore these conditions in spite of this the energy balance ratio is still low footprint analysis further shows the seasonal variation of ground cover is a potential reason responsible for this keywords ground heat flux surface energy balance soil hydro thermodynamics soil thermal convection evaporation within soil soil vertical heterogeneity 1 introduction the surface energy balance remains unclosed at most flux observation sites cava et al 2008 foken 2008 liang et al 2017 oncley et al 2007 stoy et al 2013 tanaka et al 2003 wilson et al 2002 xin et al 2018 efforts have been made to investigate the reasons for the surface energy imbalance among them measurement errors flux corrections and flux footprints have attracted much attention cheng et al 2017 foken 2008 kljun et al 2015 leuning et al 2012 mauder and foken 2006 oncley et al 2007 twine et al 2000 taking all these into consideration the surface energy balance can be improved but still is not closed e g oncley et al 2007 tanaka et al 2003 xin et al 2018 meanwhile some studies focused on the importance of ground heat flux g 0 i e the heat transferred into or out of the soil surface they found that g 0 is also a potential important factor accounting for surface energy imbalance e g higgins 2012 liang et al 2017 however its role has not attracted as much attention as other factors e g measurement errors flux corrections in fact over bare soils or sparsely vegetated surfaces g 0 can reach half of the net radiation e g heusinkveld et al 2004 even under full vegetation cover instantaneous g 0 is also significant especially when turbulent processes are less active gentine et al 2012 except for a few cases where g 0 was attempted to be measured directly heusinkveld et al 2004 current methods for indirectly estimating g 0 can be summarized into five categories firstly g 0 can be estimated with empirical methods based on net radiation or sensible heat flux liebethal and foken 2007 purdy et al 2016 secondly g 0 can be derived by combining soil heat flux at a specific reference depth with soil heat storage above soil heat flux can be measured by heat flux plates e g oncley et al 2007 or derived from the gradient method e g liebethal et al 2005 thirdly given the uncertainties in determining soil heat storage some studies derive g 0 only based on soil heat flux leuning et al 2012 wang and bou zeid 2012 fourthly g 0 can also be estimated by integrating soil thermal profiles which needs temperature and moisture measurements in deep soil yang and wang 2008 lastly g 0 can be directly calculated by the gradient method the harmonic analysis method heusinkveld et al 2004 zuo et al 2011 or the half order time derivative method wang and bras 1999 can be applied to better represent surface temperature gradient given various methods for determining g 0 some comparative studies have been carried out gao et al 2017 liebethal and foken 2007 russell et al 2015 although these methods have their own advantages three common problems still remain firstly methods using heat flux plates for example the traditional plate calorimetric method suffer from errors caused by thermal contact resistance heat flow distortion etc e g ochsner et al 2006 sauer et al 2003 tong et al 2019 secondly near surface soil is generally assumed vertically homogeneous with depth independent soil moisture thermal properties etc perhaps due to lack of fine scale measurements for instance when calculating soil heat storage soil volumetric heat capacity is usually regarded invariant with depth estimated by single measurement of soil water content e g oncley et al 2007 also the soil thermal conductivity at the surface needed by the gradient method is assumed identical to that measured or estimated at a few centimeters below thirdly except for a few cases which incorporates thermal convection of flowing water gao 2005 most physical models for determining g 0 consider only thermal conduction e g wang and bras 1999 wang and bou zeid 2012 in addition the convection of latent heat by phase change within soil which is also an important physical process for near surface soil e g heitman et al 2008a 2008b is usually ignored the vertically homogeneous assumption and incomplete physical processes make near surface soil hydro thermodynamics not well represented which further affects the accuracy in determining g 0 to improve the estimation of g 0 this study develops a near surface soil hydro thermodynamics nssht model that considers all the three soil physical processes mentioned above without the vertically homogeneous assumption the nssht model utilizes in situ measurements as input and gives vertical distribution of near surface soil water content thermal properties movement of liquid water and water vapor etc as output based on these outputs g 0 is re evaluated and then surface energy balance section 2 elaborates on methods in this study section 3 describes the field campaign at a grassland site section 4 presents the results and section 5 gives the discussions conclusions are in section 6 2 methods 2 1 construction of the nssht model after incorporating convection of heat by flowing liquid water and convection of latent heat the heat conservation equation is given by 1 c s t t z λ t z ρ l c l w t z h v j v z c l j v t z where c s is soil volumetric heat capacity t is soil temperature λ is soil thermal conductivity ρ l is density of liquid water c l is specific heat of liquid water w is vertical velocity of liquid water h v is latent heat of vaporization and j v is mass flux of water vapor the abbreviations symbols and constants in this study are summarized in table 1 the whole system is defined upward positive the derivation of eq 1 can be found in appendix a on the right hand of eq 1 the 1st item is the contribution of thermal conduction the 2nd item is the contribution of flowing liquid water and the 3rd and 4th items are the contribution of water vapor according to darcy s law 2 w k k ψ z k d θ z where k is soil hydraulic conductivity ψ is soil water potential d is soil hydraulic diffusivity and θ is soil water content

saturated hydraulic diffusivity and b is the clapp and hornberger exponent based on previous studies of describing the transport of gases in soil jury and horton 2004 jury and letey 1979 the water vapor flux equation is given by 4 j v ξ g d wv a r h ρ v z ξ g d wv a ρ v r h z where ξ g is the gas tortuosity factor d wv a is the binary diffusion coefficient of water vapor in free air rh is relative humidity within soil ρ v is the saturated water vapor density for ξ g the penman model documented in jury and horton 2004 is used for considering the modification for the available pore space for diffusion 5 ξ g α p a where α is 2 3 p a a θ q a and a is volumetric air content and 6 q a 1 a a k a a k a a k where a k is the volumetric air content below which liquid continuity begins jury and letey 1979 philip and de vries 1957 according to philip and de vries 1957 7 rh e x p g ψ m v rt where g is gravitational acceleration m v is the molecular weight of water and r is universal gas constant if the soil is not very dry and rh can be approximated as the constant 1 then eq 4 can be written as 8 j v j v w β f t t z where β is the pore structure modification factor according to jury and letey 1979 9 β ξ g ζ ε ε a θ q a a θ q a λ v t λ l 2 where ζ is the enhancement factor ε is the correction term λ l is thermal conductivity of liquid water and λ v is the effective thermal conductivity of water vapor the expression of λ v is 10 λ v t d wv a p v h v 2 r v 2 t 3 where p v is saturated water vapor pressure r v is the water vapor gas constant and 11 f t d wv a p v h v r v t r v 2 t 3 d wv a p v h v r v 2 t 3 from eqs 4 and 8 when the soil is wet enough water vapor is only driven by temperature gradient but when the soil is very dry water vapor is driven by both temperature gradient and gradient of rh or soil water potential when rh can be approximated as the constant 1 inserting eq 8 into eq 1 using the chain rule of differentiation and then rearranging a first order linear ordinary differential equation in θ can be obtained if vertical profiles of t t z and 2 t z 2 can be known by fitting measured soil temperature 12 f 1 θ z θ z f 2 θ z where 13 f 1 θ

differentiation soil texture bulk density θ s ψ s k s d s and b are assumed to be vertically homogenous for the very thin near surface soil layer using eq 12 the vertical distribution of θ at each timestep can be solved numerically with one initial condition i e measured θ value at a certain depth below then near surface soil hydro thermodynamics can be known including soil thermal conductivity vertical movement of liquid water and water vapor etc when the effect of rh must be considered inserting eq 4 into eq 1 and then rearranging a second order non linear ordinary differential equation in θ can be obtained 15 g 1 θ z 2 θ z 2 g 2 θ z θ z g 3 θ z θ z 2 g 4 θ z where 16 g 1 θ z h v ρ v ξ g d wv a r h ψ ψ θ 17 g 2 θ z t z λ θ ρ l c l d h v r h β θ f t 2 h v β f t c l ξ g d wv a ρ v r h ψ ψ

1 z θ 2 z g 4 θ 1 z g 2 θ 1 z θ 2 g 3 θ 1 z θ 2 2 note that solving eq 20 requires two initial conditions i e θ and d θ d z at a certain depth below but d θ d z is difficult to obtain accurately via in situ measurements one way is to use the differentiation method with two layer measurements but its accuracy is hard to be guaranteed fortunately eq 20 is only needed when soil is very dry and usually rh can be regarded as the constant 1 so eq 12 can always be applied at the beginning of integration if the soil becomes very dry at a certain point then eq 20 can be solved with θ and d θ d z provided by eq 12 to continue the integration the package of odepack hindmarsh 1983 is used for numerically solving the ordinary differential equation s above 2 2 method for fitting soil temperature profiles from section 2 1 vertical profiles of t t z and 2 t z 2 must be known for solving the distribution of θ inspired by horton et al 1983 a method based on harmonic analysis is presented to fit the function of t with z using discrete temperature measurements according to horton et al 1983 if only soil thermal conduction is considered and if the boundary conditions of homogeneous soil satisfy 1 surface temperature can be described by a series of harmonics 2 soil temperature at the infinitely deep bottom is equal to mean soil temperature then the soil temperature has an analytical solution as 21 t z t t n 1 m c 0 n e x p z d n s i n n ω t φ 0 n z d n where t is the average soil temperature m is the number of harmonics c 0 n and φ 0 n are the amplitude and phase angle of the nth harmonic for the upper boundary i e the soil surface ω 2 π p f is the radial frequency p f is the period of a fundamental cycle d n 2 κ n ω is the damping depth of the nth harmonic and κ is soil thermal diffusivity eq 21 shows that the amplitude of the nth harmonic c 0 n e x p z d n decays exponentially with depth and its phase angle φ 0 n z d n changes linearly with depth although this kind of variation is obtained under ideal conditions as mentioned above it may still hold true in reality if d n in the amplitude and phase angle can be replaced with some appropriate values via the fitting method therefore soil temperature profiles are derived in two steps firstly at each measurement depth the time series of soil temperature in a full period is searched and then fitted to fourier series then the average temperature can be obtained along with the amplitudes and phase angles of each harmonic the full period is used to minimize the fitted errors at both ends of the time series note that the length of the period is varied under different radiation conditions for sunny days it is about one day but for consecutive rainy days the period can be about two days or longer besides the determination of m is as follows set the initial value of m as 2 and then increase it until amplitudes of the m 1 th and m 2 th harmonics are both less than 0 05 c and the rest signals are considered as noise secondly for the nth harmonic n 1 2 m at each measurement layer exponential fitting is done for amplitude c n and linear fitting for phase angle φ n given that average temperature t a may change with depth at the daily timescale exponential fitting is assumed 22 c n c 0 n e x p z d n 1 φ n φ 0 n z d n 2 t a t 0 a t 1 a e x p z d a where c 0 n φ 0 n d n 1 d n 2 t 0 a t 1 a and d a are fitting coefficients it s noted that eq 21 has only one d n but in eq 22 d n 1 and d n 2 are two independent parameters the effectiveness of the fitting method is shown in section 4 2 finally 23 t z t t a n 1 m c n s i n n ω t φ n then t z and 2 t z 2 can also be derived this temperature fitting method is named the hel harmonics exponential linear method 2 3 method for fitting λ θ relationship from section 2 1 the λ θ relationship is also needed by the nssht model campbell 1985 described such kind of relationship 24 λ a b θ a d e x p c θ e where a b c d and e are fitting coefficients for mineral soils campbell 1985 further related these coefficients to soil bulk density ρ b and clay mass fraction m c a 0 65 0 78 ρ b 0 6 ρ b 2 b 1 06 ρ b c 1 2 6 m c 0 5 d 0 03 0 1 ρ b 2 e 4 0 in eq 24 d represents thermal conductivity of dry soil and unknown coefficients ρ b and m c can be obtained by the nonlinear fitting method in summary the input of the nssht model includes the λ θ relationship the related hydraulic parameters vertical profiles of t t z and 2 t z 2 and soil water content measured at a shallow depth the output includes vertical distribution of soil water content velocity of liquid water mass flux of water vapor and soil thermal conductivity fig 1 summarizes how the nssht model works 2 4 methods for determining g 0 2 4 1 the plate calorimetric method the traditional way to determine g 0 is the plate calorimetric pc method it uses the heat flux plate hfp to measure soil heat flux at a certain depth below the soil surface which is called the reference depth z r because the plate thermal conductivity λ p is different from soil thermal conductivity λ heat flow distortion always occurs sauer et al 2003 reviewed the theory of correction to minimize heat flow distortion here a general correction equation is presented sauer et al 2003 2007 2008 25 g p g s 1 1 σ γ 1 λ λ p where g s is the actual soil heat flux at z r g p is the soil heat flux through the hfp σ 1 70 is a coefficient derived from the theory of correction in philip 1961 and γ x p s p is a dimensionless factor x p is plate thickness and s p is the measuring area of the hfp following oncley et al 2007 soil heat storage δ s is given by 26 δ s c s z r d t dt where t is average soil temperature between the soil surface and z r and c s is average soil volumetric heat capacity finally g 0 is the combination of g s and δ s i e g 0 g s δ s where g 0 and g s are defined downward positive by convention usually c s is obtained by single measurement of soil water content and thus implicitly assuming that soil is homogeneous with depth independent c s if the vertical variation of c s is considered for heterogeneous soil the expression of δ s ochsner et al 2007 should be 27 δ s 0 z r c s dt dt d z 2 4 2 the gradient related methods when the traditional gradient method based on fourier s law is applied it often assumes that thermal conductivity at the surface λ 0 is equal to that measured at some distance below λ m i e g 0 λ m t z it is named the gh method i e the gradient method with homogeneous assumption as the nssht model considers the heterogeneity of soil and gives an estimation of λ 0 the formula is changed to g 0 λ 0 t z since the effect of water vapor is ignored it is named the go gradient only method furthermore with the theory of water vapor transfer the contribution of water vapor can be added as below 28 g 0 λ 0 t z h v j v it is named the gradient vapor gv method it is noted that in eq 28 g 0 is upward positive and in practice it is always adjusted to downward positive in addition the gv and go methods can also be used for calculating soil heat flux at any depth in the similar way 3 data data were collected at an integrated surface flux system isfs site located at the former boulder atmospheric observatory bao in colorado 40 2 54 84 n 105 0 7 62 w at an altitude of 1587 m the field project is named characterizing the atmospheric boundary layer cabl which was carried out by the earth observing laboratory eol of the national center for atmospheric research ncar from february 18 2015 to june 25 2015 ucar ncar earth observing laboratory 2018 2016a 2016b the period from february 18 to march 8 is excluded in this study due to the impact of frozen soil the bao was situated in an area of open grassland shown in fig 2 a the isfs tower fig 2b was equipped with the integrated irgason eddy covariance systems a temperature relative humidity sensor a barometer an integrated net radiometer and a leaf wetness sensor lws the manufacturers models installation heights and sampling rates are summarized in table 2 the lws has a base level output of 0 25 0 26 v and water on the sensor causes an output above the base level thus the lws can also be used as an indirect way to detect rainfall please refer to https www eol ucar edu content sensor notes for more details about the lws near surface soil temperature close to the tower was measured by a 4 needle temperature probe at a high vertical resolution of 0 6 1 9 3 1 and 4 4 cm at the depth of 5 cm the soil moisture sensor was installed along with a heat flux plate to measure soil heat flux soil thermal conductivity and diffusivity were measured by the thermal properties sensor at the same depth besides half hour sensible and latent heat fluxes were calculated from the eddy covariance data please refer to oncley et al 2007 for the related data processing details four radiation components wetness by the lws soil heat flux soil temperature and moisture were stored as the 5 min average tp01 was started every 3 h to avoid overheating the soil for hft3 the parameters related to eq 25 are as follows s p π d p 2 2 where the plate diameter d p 38 2 mm x p 3 91 mm λ p 1 22 w m 1 k 1 the accuracy of hft3 is within 5 and its measurement range is 100 w m 2 for tp01 measurements of soil thermal conductivity may attain uncertainties in the order of 10 in the rated measurement range of 0 3 to 5 w m 1 k 1 and the measurement range of soil thermal diffusivity is 0 05 1 10 6 m2 s 1 with uncertainties 20 the accuracy of soil temperature measurement is 0 1 k the accuracy of volumetric water content by ec 5 is 0 03 m3 m 3 for typical mineral soils with generic calibration and 0 02 m3 m 3 in any porous medium with medium specific calibration 4 results 4 1 the λ θ relationship fig 3 a shows measured λ and θ as well as the fitting curves long term in situ monitoring reveals the bifurcation phenomenon shown by the red dots and blue dots implying that the λ θ relationship underwent significant change during the observation period the transition point occurred on april 16 17 when there was a heavy rainfall event before and after this rainfall event measured sensible heat flux sh and latent heat flux le also changed dramatically fig 3b before april 17 sh was much higher than le however after that heavy rainfall le was first comparable with sh and then quickly exceeded it and became dominant in less than a week this phenomenon is consistent with the observation on the tibetan plateau sh dominates during the pre monsoon season when the grass remains inactive and le becomes important after the onset of monsoon when the grass turns green and active e g tanaka et al 2001 therefore it is believed that at this bao site the rainfall event during april 16 17 made the grass grow rapidly and then enter the active period which altered the λ θ relationship however it remains unclear how the grass growth influences soil thermal conductivity which needs further study in the future the λ θ relationship in section 2 3 does not consider the effects of grass growth and thus should be used for the inactive period the nonlinear fitting gives ρ b 0 315 g cm 3 m c 0 948 then 29 λ 0 464 0 334 θ 0 424 e x p 3 672 θ 4 where coefficient d 0 040 w m 1 k 1 i e thermal conductivity of dry soil compared with typical mineral soils ρ b here is very low which should be the distinguishing feature of peat côté and konrad 2005 reported a low ρ b of 0 332 g cm 3 for fairbanks peat chen et al 2012 also found ρ b can reach about 0 4 g cm 3 for soils with extremely high soil organic matters the very low λ values measured by tp01 fig 3a also imply this is not typical mineral soils but peat soils however it s noted that the very high value of m c on the other hand means it is the clay soil but the thermal conductivity of clay soil should be much higher than the measured values shown in fig 3a given that the λ θ relationship by campbell 1985 is mainly for mineral soils the fitting parameter m c here should have different meaning or explanation other λ θ models were also tried but their fitting even gave negative thermal conductivity for dry soils and thus were not adopted please see section 5 2 for further discussions for the active period it is assumed that ρ b and λ of dry soil are invariant regardless of the conditions of grass thus the coefficients a b and d in eq 24 should remain the same as those in the inactive period the impact of grass growth is reflected by adjustment of coefficients c and e then with known a b and d the new equation for the active period is given by 30 λ 0 464 0 334 θ 0 424 e x p 3 435 θ 7 427 besides at the bao site measurements were not conducted for soil porosity and other hydraulic properties etc so these model parameters are estimated according to typical peat following lawrence and slater 2008 these parameters are set as θ s 0 9 k s 2 8 10 4 m s 1 ψ s 0 0103 m b 2 7 and c sdry 2 5 105 j m 3 k 1 then d s k s ψ s b θ s 8 652 10 6 m2 s 1 the sensitivity experiments of these parameters are further discussed in section 4 5 except for low thermal conductivity these parameters reflect other characteristics of organic or peat soils high porosity high saturated hydraulic conductivity and weak suction in addition the enhancement factor ζ usually ranges from 2 to 3 for general mineral soils jury and horton 2004 but considering the large porosity of peat soils ζ is estimated as 1 4 philip and de vries 1957 and in eq 6 a k equals θ s θ k where θ k 0 2 also following philip and de vries 1957 4 2 soil temperature fitting fig 4 shows the statistics of fitting including the coefficient of determination r 2 the root mean square error rmse and the relative rmse rrmse the exponential fitting for c n is very good the 10th percentage of r 2 exceeds 0 97 and the 90th percentile of rrmse is about 6 similarly the linear fitting also well describes φ n t a is also well represented by the exponential fitting therefore the change of c n and φ n with depth is consistent with the ideal solution in section 2 2 the differences lie in 1 d n 1 and d n 2 in eq 22 are not equal under real soil conditions results not shown and the vertical heterogeneity of real soils is probably one of the reasons for this 2 t a actually changes slightly with depth at the daily timescale results not shown but the ideal solution assumes the same t a for all depths lastly soil temperature t is also evaluated by comparing fitted values with observed ones at each timestep overall the fitting of t is good the 10th percentage of r 2 can still reach 0 94 and the 90th percentile of rmse is less than 0 25 c therefore the hel fitting method is proved to be an effective way to construct soil temperature profiles using discrete measurements fig 5 further shows three types of cases for soil temperature fitting a rainy case with almost no solar radiation fig 5a a sunny case with almost no clouds fig 5c and a sunny case with intermittent clouds fig 5e the full periods are shown in fig 5c and e and the partial period is shown in fig 5a since the full period lasts almost 3 days fig 5b d and f are selected vertical profiles to illustrate spatial fitting during nighttime around midday with no clouds and during intermittent cloudy conditions respectively results show that the hel fitting method performs well for the sunny case without clouds fig 5c d but it is a little difficult to capture the rapid change of soil temperature when there are intermittent clouds fig 5e f for the rainy case it sometimes produces some small disturbance fig 5a due to some high frequency harmonics in spite of this the hel fitting method can well represent the main features of soil temperature the constructed profiles of t along with its derivatives t z and 2 t z 2 are used as the input of the nssht model in the next section 4 3 evaluation of near surface soil hydro thermodynamics equipped with all the input above the model was run from march 12 to june 25 2015 at the bao site for the λ θ relationship the model uses eq 29 for the inactive period of grass and eq 30 for the active period critical model output variables related to soil hydro thermodynamics are analyzed for the three typical cases in section 4 2 including swc vertical velocity of liquid water mass flux of water vapor and soil thermal conductivity fig 6 a shows the observed wetness by lws swc at 5 cm and incoming shortwave radiation for the case of heavy rain on april 16 the lws shows the water began to accumulate on its surface from 6 00 lst local standard time implying the beginning of the rainfall but the swc at 5 cm increased with a time lag 7 h until about 13 00 lst a possible reason for this delay is that the precipitation amount might be quite small from 6 00 to 13 00 lst but unfortunately no direct rainfall measurement was conducted the distinct variation of swc indicates that it was raining from 13 00 lst and became very heavy from 17 00 lst besides the constructed soil temperature fig 6b generally decreased all day long due to very weak incoming solar radiation for the model output the swc between 0 and 5 cm fig 6c did not change significantly until about 15 00 lst and became very wet afterwards with the maximum swc more than 0 6 m3 m 3 it implies that the model can capture the high values of swc corresponding to the heavy precipitation for april 13 the sunny case with almost no clouds the incoming solar radiation was very intense with the maximum about 1000 w m 2 and the swc at 5 cm behaved like a sinusoidal wave with low values about 0 2 m3 m 3 fig 7 a there was almost no high frequency disturbance in soil temperature fig 7b and the output of swc fig 7c it is noted that only daytime output results are shown in fig 7c f because nighttime results are dubious also fig 8 c f the model sometimes cannot deal well with small temperature gradients at night and especially during sunrise and sunset due to singularity difficulty which will be further discussed in section 5 1 the soil from 0 to 1 cm fig 7c was very dry during the daytime with the minimum swc less than 0 04 m3 m 3 implying the model can produce low values of the swc under very intense solar radiation for the case of intermittent clouds on april 9 the incoming solar radiation underwent high frequency oscillations fig 8a and it was also reflected by the response of soil temperature fig 8b the output of swc is also highly variable fig 8c even though the model in general can produce reasonable swc sometimes its performance is not satisfactory for example at about 2 30 lst on april 16 there is a high value area of swc near the surface fig 6c which is probably not true since the rainfall has not begun the temperature fitting errors fig 5a and b should be responsible for this false high value area because when t z is very small it is rather sensitive to errors of fitted t besides the model can produce reasonable vertical velocity of liquid water w in fig 6d positive upward w was very low before the rain and became very high during the heavy rain up to 10 6 10 5 m s whose variation is consistent with swc fig 6c and during sunny days without rain w is only 10 9 m s figs 7d and 8d which is three to four orders of magnitude lower than that during the rain during sunny days soil became drier from bottom to top figs 7c and 8c and water remained going up to drier parts figs 7d and 8d which is consistent with darcy s law in addition figs 6e 7e and 8e show the mass flux of water vapor j v positive upward for the rainy case water vapor kept going upward but went downward during the two sunny cases it seems that the finding is contrary to the common sense that water vapor should go upward to enter the atmosphere under solar radiation actually according to the theory of gas transport in soil in section 2 1 the direction of water vapor transfer within soil is mainly determined by temperature gradient as shown in eq 8 the related physical process is described as below when the sun heats the soil surface surface temperature gets higher than air temperature and the same is true for its water vapor density so water vapor leaves the soil surface and enters the atmosphere meanwhile solar heating makes t z 0 within soil and thus water vapor also moves downward driven by temperature gradient then the soil water at the surface evaporates to compensate the decrease of water vapor due to transport in both directions and becomes drier at the same time water in the deeper soil then moves upward according to darcy s law the water vapor that enters the atmosphere mainly comes from the soil surface lastly soil thermal conductivity λ can undergo obvious changes even for the 0 5 cm soil layer figs 6f 7f and 8f during the precipitation λ at the soil surface can be higher than that at 5 cm by 20 30 and under strong solar radiation λ at the soil surface can be 3 4 times lower than that at 5 cm the vertical variation is also true for soil volumetric heat capacity therefore the soil thermal properties are essentially vertically heterogeneous for this thin near surface layer 4 4 ground heat flux and surface energy balance ground heat flux g 0 is calculated via the four methods mentioned in section 2 4 2 the results are shown in fig 9 a the gh method gives higher g 0 than the go method during the daytime because it uses the thermal conductivity at 5 cm to approximate that at the soil surface which ignores the vertical variation of thermal conductivity the gv method considers the contribution of water vapor and thus produces higher g 0 than the go method using the gv method as the reference the g 0 by the go method has the rmse of 22 53 w m 2 and the relative bias of 37 94 from 8 00 to 16 00 lst thus the role of water vapor cannot be ignored in the determination of g 0 the same conclusion can be drawn from the analysis of soil heat flux g s at 5 cm fig 9b in addition the pc method gives slightly higher g 0 values than the gv method one primary reason is that g s by the hfp after correction is higher than that by the gv method fig 9b which accounts for most of the differences the other secondary reason is that the pc method produces slightly higher soil heat storage δ s fig 9c with the assumption of homogeneous soil the reason for the differences in δ s is that shallower soil is always drier than deeper soil due to solar radiation and gravity except during the rain and thus the homogeneous assumption has higher volumetric heat capacity and higher δ s for g s at 5 cm the hfp is expected to produce lower g s since it blocks the movement of water vapor and only considers conductive heat flux but what it actually gives is higher g s compared with the gv method the thermal contact resistance is not the reason because it tends to make g s by the hfps lower sauer et al 2007 and the correction for heat flow distortion actually makes g s lower than original measurements because the soil thermal conductivity at this site is less than the plate thermal conductivity as shown in eq 25 therefore both heat flow distortion and thermal contact resistance cannot explain the higher g s by the hfp a possible explanation is soil horizontal heterogeneity since the temperature probe and hfp had to be buried apart and not in the same hole the impact of g 0 on the surface energy balance is further analyzed since the energy balance ratio ebr around midday is closer to 1 than other periods wilson et al 2002 xin et al 2018 this study only focuses on the ebr from 10 00 to 15 00 lst following xin et al 2018 the ebr was analyzed with the linear regression method by fitting the turbulent energy fluxes the sum of sh and le against the available energy the difference between net radiation r n and g 0 e g wilson et al 2002 ideal closure means the slope is 1 the intercept is 0 and r 2 is 1 the results are shown in fig 10 although the gh method has higher daytime g 0 than the gv method fig 9a which appears to make the ebr better actually it behaves worse than the gv method with higher intercept lower slope and r 2 besides the gv method also has higher slope than the go method despite its slightly higher intercept and lower r 2 generally the surface energy closure gets better when soil vertical heterogeneity and the contribution of water vapor are considered in addition compared with the pc method the gv method has slightly lower slope but higher r 2 and lower intercept but even for the pc method its slope is only about 0 7 thus the ebr is overall very low at this site for further exploring the reasons for the low ebr the flux footprint is analyzed using an online flux footprint prediction ffp model developed by kljun et al 2015 http footprint kljun net ffp2d html in order to know the temporal variation of footprints the model was run for each month from march to june the period from 10 00 to 15 00 lst is selected to be consistent with the ebr analysis besides the ffp model provides an unsupervised land cover classification for the flux footprint and estimates the contribution of different land covers to the measured turbulent fluxes specific type of land cover is determined by comparing with the actual satellite image of google earth for the flux footprint from march to june fig 11 all the contour lines of 80 lie within the area of grassland but the contour lines of 90 have larger scope including roads and trees thus to some extent the spatial representativeness of turbulent fluxes is influenced by roads and trees and it should be one of the reasons for the energy imbalance besides for the contribution of different land covers to the measured turbulent fluxes in march the contribution of grass and bare soils can reach 59 9 and 38 8 respectively in april the grass entered the active period and began growing also mentioned in section 4 1 and the area of bare soils decreased therefore the contribution of grass increased slightly in may and june as the grass continued to grow its area quickly expanded and its contribution to measured fluxes can reach 92 in june during this period the role of bare soils became less and less important it s worth noting that although the ground cover was almost homogenous in june it was significantly heterogeneous in march and april however the instruments for measuring g 0 were deployed only at one location therefore the seasonal variation of ground cover could influence the spatial representativeness of g 0 which is another potential reason for the surface energy imbalance in addition other factors like the underestimation of turbulent fluxes e g cheng et al 2017 twine et al 2000 may also contribute to the low ebr 4 5 parameter sensitivity given that soil physical parameters like θ s k s ψ s and b are estimated from typical peat when solving the nssht model the sensitivity of g 0 by the gv method as well as the corresponding ebr to these soil parameters is further analyzed in this section the control experiment uses the aforementioned typical values θ s 0 9 k s 2 8 10 4 m s 1 ψ s 0 0103 m b 2 7 lawrence and slater 2008 the way to conduct the sensitivity tests is to change one parameter while keeping others the same as the typical values the possible values of θ s are set to 0 85 0 8 0 75 0 7 0 65 and 0 6 considering the large porosity of peat θ s lower than 0 6 is not tried the values of the clapp and hornberger exponent b are typically higher than 2 91 for mineral soils lawrence and slater 2008 thus the possible values of b here are set to 3 0 2 9 2 8 2 6 2 5 and 2 4 for saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the following values are used for sensitivity tests 0 25 k s 0 5 k s 0 75 k s 1 33 k s 2 0 k s and 4 0 k s the values of saturated water potential are set in the similar way as k s the sensitivity of g 0 is evaluated by the rmse of g 0 between the control experiment and sensitivity tests and the sensitivity of ebr is evaluated by the variation in fitted slope intercept and r2 tables 3 and 4 show the sensitivity of g 0 and ebr to soil physical parameters respectively it is found that g 0 by the gv method is only slightly sensitive to θ s and it is very insensitive to the other three parameters the same is true for the corresponding ebr in terms of fitted slope intercept and r2 therefore the results of ebr by the gv method are relatively robust it also shows that the uncertainty of soil physical parameters cannot account for the low ebr 5 discussions 5 1 the application of the nssht model there are some noteworthy points about the application of the nssht model firstly some physical properties are assumed vertically homogeneous for the near surface soil in the derivation of eq 12 thus vertical heterogeneity is caused only by soil water content if detailed measurements can be made in the future eqs 12 and 15 can be modified to incorporate the vertical heterogeneity of these properties secondly as mentioned in section 4 3 the model cannot deal well with singularities or very small t z in practice when t z approximates 0 the mass matrix f 1 in eq 12 becomes singular although the backward differentiation formulas bdfs are designed to solve this kind of singularity e g shampine et al 1999 this algorithm always fails in application while debugging it is found that in eq 12 when f 1 gets close to 0 f 2 should have approached 0 but more often than not it does not thus making θ z and the failure of bdfs the problem lies in that even though f 1 and f 2 are related in physics they are calculated independently in mathematics t z 0 can only guarantee f 1 0 but not f 2 0 the inconsistent convergence is related to various errors in the real world and it is essentially not caused by the mathematical algorithm or physical processes of the model during sunrise sunset and some nighttime or intermittent cloudy periods with very small t z other methods for estimating g 0 can be used if the model fails to give a solution given that the soil below 5 cm has smaller t z the model cannot be extended to deeper soils and the shallow swc measurement is necessary thirdly although the theory for transport of water vapor is complete some details may need more investigations for example the determination of a k in eq 6 i e the volumetric air content below which liquid continuity begins is not very clear for soils with different texture porosity etc the same is true for the enhancement factor lastly the model only considers liquid water and water vapor the soil hydro thermodynamics for frozen soils need further investigation in the future 5 2 future soil observations firstly the impact of vegetation activities on soil thermal conductivity needs further investigation by using long term monitoring at a wider range of sites the thermal sensor tp01 is a good option but its measurement range is smaller than those with thermal needles like hukseflux ftn02 which may produce errors for organic or peat soils with low soil thermal conductivity secondly it s warranted and necessary to pay greater attention to the study of organic or peat soils in section 2 3 the relationship between fitting coefficients and soil properties is for mineral soils although in terms of mathematics good fitting is also obtained for organic soils in section 4 1 the meaning of the parameters may be different for example the clay fraction the alternative λ θ relationship in lu et al 2014 is also tested but the thermal conductivity of dry soil is unrealistically negative the reason is that their samples do not include soils with high organic matter content the same is true for tong et al 2016 besides most empirical equations for deriving soil hydraulic properties are created for mineral soils e g cosby et al 1984 some studies consider the impact of organic matters but only allow low content e g saxton and rawls 2006 thirdly more attention should be paid to seasonal variation of ground cover which has impact on spatial representativeness of g 0 and becomes a potential factor for surface energy imbalance lastly it s necessary to measure soil texture bulk density and soil hydraulic properties including soil porosity saturated water potential saturated hydraulic conductivity and the clapp and hornberger exponent in future field campaigns 5 3 future development for land surface models the relative importance of three main physical processes in eq 1 i e the heat conservation equation is compared to emphasize the role of vertical heterogeneity of λ thermal conduction is divided into two parts λ z t z conduct 1 and λ 2 t z 2 conduct 2 for each node at each timestep the percentage is calculated by dividing the absolute value of each item by the sum of absolute value of all the items since the movement of liquid water is only important when there is precipitation infiltration li et al 2009 the statistical results are roughly divided into two parts the red blue boxes in fig 12 correspond to cases when the contribution of the movement of liquid water is less more than 10 which is considered without with rain influence the sample number of the blue boxes only accounts for 2 5 so the movement of liquid water is often not important except for rain by contrast thermal conduction always contributes most in the heat conservation equation regardless of the rain the role of vertical heterogeneity of λ is also important besides the contribution of water vapor is also significant especially when there exists precipitation infiltration the comparison indicates that except for the major thermal conduction the movement of flowing liquid water and water vapor is also important in heat conservation equation at least for the near surface layer however some widely used land surface models e g the noah land surface model with multiparameterization options noah mp do not consider these processes niu et al 2011 therefore in the future these processes can be incorporated into the land surface models to further test their impact 6 conclusions based on heat conservation equation this study proposes a near surface soil hydro thermodynamics nssht model it is essentially a temperature driven soil moisture model three main soil physical processes are considered including thermal conduction heat convection of flowing liquid water and convection of latent heat the input includes soil temperature temperature gradient the 2nd order spatial derivative of temperature soil water content at a certain depth the function of soil thermal conductivity and other hydraulic parameters the output fields include soil water content vertical velocity of liquid water mass flux of water vapor and soil thermal conductivity then ground heat flux can be determined by the gradient vapor method which considers the vertical heterogeneity of thermal conductivity and contribution of water vapor in addition in order to obtain soil temperature profiles this study presents the harmonics exponential linear hel fitting method in two steps 1 fourier decomposition of time series at each depth 2 spatially exponential fitting for average soil temperature and amplitude and linear fitting for phase angle besides the equation documented in campbell 1985 is used for fitting the function of soil thermal conductivity with soil water content main findings and conclusions are summarized as follows firstly the long term in situ monitoring reveals that the vegetation activities can change the function of soil thermal conductivity with soil water content secondly analysis of in situ measurements shows that the amplitudes of soil temperature harmonics decrease exponentially with depth and the phase angles change linearly with depth overall the hel method performs good temperature fitting thirdly the nssht model can capture high values of soil water content during rainfall events low values under strong solar radiation and highly variable values in intermittent cloudy conditions the model can also produce reasonable vertical movement of liquid water and water vapor however the disadvantages lie in that the model can neither give a solution during sunrise and sunset due to singularity difficulty nor deal well with very small temperature gradients which sometimes occur during nighttime and intermittent cloudy periods fourthly after comparing the relative importance of three main physical processes in the heat conservation equation it is found that although thermal conduction is most important the contribution of liquid water and water vapor cannot be ignored either fifthly when soil vertical heterogeneity and the contribution of water vapor are considered in the estimation of ground heat flux the energy balance ratio ebr is improved although it is still low footprint analysis indicates the very low ebr at this site may be caused by the contribution of other flux footprint and seasonal variation of ground cover for future soil observations suggestions are summarized as below 1 long term monitoring at a wider range of sites is necessary to explore the mechanism of how grass growth affects soil thermal conductivity 2 more studies are needed for the organic or peat soils including the function of soil thermal conductivity with soil water content 3 seasonal variation of ground cover could cause horizontal heterogeneity which needs further investigation in the future besides for land surface models the contribution of liquid water and water vapor is recommended to be incorporated into the heat conservation equation for the near surface soil credit authorship contribution statement baoqiang wu conceptualization methodology formal analysis resources data curation

provided by ncar eol under the sponsorship of the national science foundation appendix a derivation of the heat conservation equation the heat conservation equation needs to be rewritten for incorporating convection of heat by flowing water and convection of latent heat similar to the derivation of mass conservation equation in jury and horton 2004 we focus on a cube of soil with the volume v δ x δ y δ z at the point x y z as shown in fig a 1 only the flow in the z direction is considered upward positive during an arbitrarily small time period δ t between t and t δ t the heat conservation equation can be stated as energy entering soil volume during δ t energy leaving soil volume during δ t increase of energy stored in soil volume during δ t the energy entering soil volume at the bottom side during δ t consists of four parts 1 j hc x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hc x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hc λ t z is the conductive heat flux 2 j hv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hv h v j v is the convective latent heat flux 3 j hw x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hw ρ l c l w t t ref is the convective heat flux carried by flowing liquid water 4 j hwv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hwv c l j v t t ref is the convective heat flux produced by gain or loss of liquid water through condensation or evaporation similarly energy leaving soil volume at the top side during δ t includes j hc x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hv x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hw x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hwv x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t and an additional term for water uptake by plant roots or other sinks of water ρ l c l t t ref r w x y z δ z 2 t δ x δ y δ z δ t where r w is the rate of loss of water per unit volume per unit time lastly increase of energy stored in soil volume during δ t is h x y z δ z 2 t δ t δ x δ y δ z h x y z δ z 2 t δ x δ y δ z where h c s t t ref is total soil heat content per unit volume therefore the heat conservation equation is given by a 1 j hc x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hw x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hwv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hc x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hv x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hw x y z δ

t and in the limit δ z δ t 0 eq a 1 becomes a 2 h t j hc z j hv z j hw z j hwv z r w ρ l c l t t ref 0 inserting expressions of each term into eq a 2 produces a 3 c s t t ρ l c l t t ref θ t w z 1 ρ l j v z r w z λ t z ρ l c l w t z h v j v z c l j v t z similar to the derivations in jury and horton 2004 the water conservation equation could be written as a 4 θ t w z 1 ρ l j v z r w 0 inserting eq a 4 into eq a 3 produces a 5 c s t t z λ t z ρ l c l w t z h v j v z c l j v t z the derivation shows that the items related to t ref can be eliminated through the water conservation equation which is similar to the findings in ochsner et al 2007 
5111,near surface soil hydro thermodynamics plays an important role in heat and water transfer between land and atmosphere however it is difficult to quantify these processes in field campaigns such as movement of liquid water and water vapor this has affected determination of ground heat flux a key component of surface energy budget this study aims to quantify soil heat and water processes utilizing in situ measurements and to improve ground heat flux estimation and surface energy imbalance a new model has been proposed based on three main physical processes including thermal conduction convection of heat by moving water and convection of latent heat the model was tested at a grassland site in colorado usa results show that the model can capture high values of soil water content during rain events low values under intense solar radiation and high frequency fluctuations under intermittent cloudy conditions also the model produces reasonable vertical velocity and mass flux of water vapor for the estimation of ground heat flux the method that considers vertical variation of soil thermal conductivity and the contribution of water vapor gives better energy balance ratio than methods that ignore these conditions in spite of this the energy balance ratio is still low footprint analysis further shows the seasonal variation of ground cover is a potential reason responsible for this keywords ground heat flux surface energy balance soil hydro thermodynamics soil thermal convection evaporation within soil soil vertical heterogeneity 1 introduction the surface energy balance remains unclosed at most flux observation sites cava et al 2008 foken 2008 liang et al 2017 oncley et al 2007 stoy et al 2013 tanaka et al 2003 wilson et al 2002 xin et al 2018 efforts have been made to investigate the reasons for the surface energy imbalance among them measurement errors flux corrections and flux footprints have attracted much attention cheng et al 2017 foken 2008 kljun et al 2015 leuning et al 2012 mauder and foken 2006 oncley et al 2007 twine et al 2000 taking all these into consideration the surface energy balance can be improved but still is not closed e g oncley et al 2007 tanaka et al 2003 xin et al 2018 meanwhile some studies focused on the importance of ground heat flux g 0 i e the heat transferred into or out of the soil surface they found that g 0 is also a potential important factor accounting for surface energy imbalance e g higgins 2012 liang et al 2017 however its role has not attracted as much attention as other factors e g measurement errors flux corrections in fact over bare soils or sparsely vegetated surfaces g 0 can reach half of the net radiation e g heusinkveld et al 2004 even under full vegetation cover instantaneous g 0 is also significant especially when turbulent processes are less active gentine et al 2012 except for a few cases where g 0 was attempted to be measured directly heusinkveld et al 2004 current methods for indirectly estimating g 0 can be summarized into five categories firstly g 0 can be estimated with empirical methods based on net radiation or sensible heat flux liebethal and foken 2007 purdy et al 2016 secondly g 0 can be derived by combining soil heat flux at a specific reference depth with soil heat storage above soil heat flux can be measured by heat flux plates e g oncley et al 2007 or derived from the gradient method e g liebethal et al 2005 thirdly given the uncertainties in determining soil heat storage some studies derive g 0 only based on soil heat flux leuning et al 2012 wang and bou zeid 2012 fourthly g 0 can also be estimated by integrating soil thermal profiles which needs temperature and moisture measurements in deep soil yang and wang 2008 lastly g 0 can be directly calculated by the gradient method the harmonic analysis method heusinkveld et al 2004 zuo et al 2011 or the half order time derivative method wang and bras 1999 can be applied to better represent surface temperature gradient given various methods for determining g 0 some comparative studies have been carried out gao et al 2017 liebethal and foken 2007 russell et al 2015 although these methods have their own advantages three common problems still remain firstly methods using heat flux plates for example the traditional plate calorimetric method suffer from errors caused by thermal contact resistance heat flow distortion etc e g ochsner et al 2006 sauer et al 2003 tong et al 2019 secondly near surface soil is generally assumed vertically homogeneous with depth independent soil moisture thermal properties etc perhaps due to lack of fine scale measurements for instance when calculating soil heat storage soil volumetric heat capacity is usually regarded invariant with depth estimated by single measurement of soil water content e g oncley et al 2007 also the soil thermal conductivity at the surface needed by the gradient method is assumed identical to that measured or estimated at a few centimeters below thirdly except for a few cases which incorporates thermal convection of flowing water gao 2005 most physical models for determining g 0 consider only thermal conduction e g wang and bras 1999 wang and bou zeid 2012 in addition the convection of latent heat by phase change within soil which is also an important physical process for near surface soil e g heitman et al 2008a 2008b is usually ignored the vertically homogeneous assumption and incomplete physical processes make near surface soil hydro thermodynamics not well represented which further affects the accuracy in determining g 0 to improve the estimation of g 0 this study develops a near surface soil hydro thermodynamics nssht model that considers all the three soil physical processes mentioned above without the vertically homogeneous assumption the nssht model utilizes in situ measurements as input and gives vertical distribution of near surface soil water content thermal properties movement of liquid water and water vapor etc as output based on these outputs g 0 is re evaluated and then surface energy balance section 2 elaborates on methods in this study section 3 describes the field campaign at a grassland site section 4 presents the results and section 5 gives the discussions conclusions are in section 6 2 methods 2 1 construction of the nssht model after incorporating convection of heat by flowing liquid water and convection of latent heat the heat conservation equation is given by 1 c s t t z λ t z ρ l c l w t z h v j v z c l j v t z where c s is soil volumetric heat capacity t is soil temperature λ is soil thermal conductivity ρ l is density of liquid water c l is specific heat of liquid water w is vertical velocity of liquid water h v is latent heat of vaporization and j v is mass flux of water vapor the abbreviations symbols and constants in this study are summarized in table 1 the whole system is defined upward positive the derivation of eq 1 can be found in appendix a on the right hand of eq 1 the 1st item is the contribution of thermal conduction the 2nd item is the contribution of flowing liquid water and the 3rd and 4th items are the contribution of water vapor according to darcy s law 2 w k k ψ z k d θ z where k is soil hydraulic conductivity ψ is soil water potential d is soil hydraulic diffusivity and θ is soil water content

saturated hydraulic diffusivity and b is the clapp and hornberger exponent based on previous studies of describing the transport of gases in soil jury and horton 2004 jury and letey 1979 the water vapor flux equation is given by 4 j v ξ g d wv a r h ρ v z ξ g d wv a ρ v r h z where ξ g is the gas tortuosity factor d wv a is the binary diffusion coefficient of water vapor in free air rh is relative humidity within soil ρ v is the saturated water vapor density for ξ g the penman model documented in jury and horton 2004 is used for considering the modification for the available pore space for diffusion 5 ξ g α p a where α is 2 3 p a a θ q a and a is volumetric air content and 6 q a 1 a a k a a k a a k where a k is the volumetric air content below which liquid continuity begins jury and letey 1979 philip and de vries 1957 according to philip and de vries 1957 7 rh e x p g ψ m v rt where g is gravitational acceleration m v is the molecular weight of water and r is universal gas constant if the soil is not very dry and rh can be approximated as the constant 1 then eq 4 can be written as 8 j v j v w β f t t z where β is the pore structure modification factor according to jury and letey 1979 9 β ξ g ζ ε ε a θ q a a θ q a λ v t λ l 2 where ζ is the enhancement factor ε is the correction term λ l is thermal conductivity of liquid water and λ v is the effective thermal conductivity of water vapor the expression of λ v is 10 λ v t d wv a p v h v 2 r v 2 t 3 where p v is saturated water vapor pressure r v is the water vapor gas constant and 11 f t d wv a p v h v r v t r v 2 t 3 d wv a p v h v r v 2 t 3 from eqs 4 and 8 when the soil is wet enough water vapor is only driven by temperature gradient but when the soil is very dry water vapor is driven by both temperature gradient and gradient of rh or soil water potential when rh can be approximated as the constant 1 inserting eq 8 into eq 1 using the chain rule of differentiation and then rearranging a first order linear ordinary differential equation in θ can be obtained if vertical profiles of t t z and 2 t z 2 can be known by fitting measured soil temperature 12 f 1 θ z θ z f 2 θ z where 13 f 1 θ

differentiation soil texture bulk density θ s ψ s k s d s and b are assumed to be vertically homogenous for the very thin near surface soil layer using eq 12 the vertical distribution of θ at each timestep can be solved numerically with one initial condition i e measured θ value at a certain depth below then near surface soil hydro thermodynamics can be known including soil thermal conductivity vertical movement of liquid water and water vapor etc when the effect of rh must be considered inserting eq 4 into eq 1 and then rearranging a second order non linear ordinary differential equation in

in situ measurements one way is to use the differentiation method with two layer measurements but its accuracy is hard to be guaranteed fortunately eq 20 is only needed when soil is very dry and usually rh can be regarded as the constant 1 so eq 12 can always be applied at the beginning of integration if the soil becomes very dry at a certain point then eq 20 can be solved with θ and d θ d z provided by eq 12 to continue the integration the package of odepack hindmarsh 1983 is used for numerically solving the ordinary differential equation s above 2 2 method for fitting soil temperature profiles from section 2 1 vertical profiles of t t z and 2 t z 2 must be known for solving the distribution of θ inspired by horton et al 1983 a method based on harmonic analysis is presented to fit the function of t with z using discrete temperature measurements according to horton et al 1983 if only soil thermal conduction is considered and if the boundary conditions of homogeneous soil satisfy 1 surface temperature can be described by a series of harmonics 2 soil temperature at the infinitely deep bottom is equal to mean soil temperature then the soil temperature has an analytical solution as 21 t z t t n 1 m c 0 n e x p z d n s i n n ω t φ 0 n z d n where t is the average soil temperature m is the number of harmonics c 0 n and φ 0 n are the amplitude and phase angle of the nth harmonic for the upper boundary i e the soil surface ω 2 π p f is the radial frequency p f is the period of a fundamental cycle d n 2 κ n ω is the damping depth of the nth harmonic and κ is soil thermal diffusivity eq 21 shows that the amplitude of the nth harmonic c 0 n e x p z d n decays exponentially with depth and its phase angle φ 0 n z d n changes linearly with depth although this kind of variation is obtained under ideal conditions as mentioned above it may still hold true in reality if d n in the amplitude and phase angle can be replaced with some appropriate values via the fitting method therefore soil temperature profiles are derived in two steps firstly at each measurement depth the time series of soil temperature in a full period is searched and then fitted to fourier series then the average temperature can be obtained along with the amplitudes and phase angles of each harmonic the full period is used to minimize the fitted errors at both ends of the time series note that the length of the period is varied under different radiation conditions for sunny days it is about one day but for consecutive rainy days the period can be about two days or longer besides the determination of m is as follows set the initial value of m as 2 and then increase it until amplitudes of the m 1 th and m 2 th harmonics are both less than 0 05 c and the rest signals are considered as noise secondly for the nth harmonic n 1 2 m at each measurement layer exponential fitting is done for amplitude c n and linear fitting for phase angle φ n given that average temperature t a may change with depth at the daily timescale exponential fitting is assumed 22 c n c 0 n e x p z d n 1 φ n φ 0 n z d n 2 t a t 0 a t 1 a e x p z d a where c 0 n φ 0 n d n 1 d n 2 t 0 a t 1 a and d a are fitting coefficients it s noted that eq 21 has only one d n but in eq 22 d n 1 and d n 2 are two independent parameters the effectiveness of the fitting method is shown in section 4 2 finally 23 t z t t a n 1 m c n s i n n ω t φ n then t z and 2 t z 2 can also be derived this temperature fitting method is named the hel harmonics exponential linear method 2 3 method for fitting λ θ relationship from section 2 1 the λ θ relationship is also needed by the nssht model campbell 1985 described such kind of relationship 24 λ a b θ a d e x p c θ e where a b c d and e are fitting coefficients for mineral soils campbell 1985 further related these coefficients to soil bulk density ρ b and clay mass fraction m c a 0 65 0 78 ρ b 0 6 ρ b 2 b 1 06 ρ b c 1 2 6 m c 0 5 d 0 03 0 1 ρ b 2 e 4 0 in eq 24 d represents thermal conductivity of dry soil and unknown coefficients ρ b and m c can be obtained by the nonlinear fitting method in summary the input of the nssht model includes the λ θ relationship the related hydraulic parameters vertical profiles of t t z and 2 t z 2 and soil water content measured at a shallow depth the output includes vertical distribution of soil water content velocity of liquid water mass flux of water vapor and soil thermal conductivity fig 1 summarizes how the nssht model works 2 4 methods for determining g 0 2 4 1 the plate calorimetric method the traditional way to determine g 0 is the plate calorimetric pc method it uses the heat flux plate hfp to measure soil heat flux at a certain depth below the soil surface which is called the reference depth z r because the plate thermal conductivity λ p is different from soil thermal conductivity λ heat flow distortion always occurs sauer et al 2003 reviewed the theory of correction to minimize heat flow distortion here a general correction equation is presented sauer et al 2003 2007 2008 25 g p g s 1 1 σ γ 1 λ λ p where g s is the actual soil heat flux at z r g p is the soil heat flux through the hfp σ 1 70 is a coefficient derived from the theory of correction in philip 1961 and γ x p s p is a dimensionless factor x p is plate thickness and s p is the measuring area of the hfp following oncley et al 2007 soil heat storage δ s is given by 26 δ s c s z r d t dt where t is average soil temperature between the soil surface and z r and c s is average soil volumetric heat capacity finally g 0 is the combination of g s and δ s i e g 0 g s δ s where g 0 and g s are defined downward positive by convention usually c s is obtained by single measurement of soil water content and thus implicitly assuming that soil is homogeneous with depth independent c s if the vertical variation of c s is considered for heterogeneous soil the expression of δ s ochsner et al 2007 should be 27 δ s 0 z r c s dt dt d z 2 4 2 the gradient related methods when the traditional gradient method based on fourier s law is applied it often assumes that thermal conductivity at the surface λ 0 is equal to that measured at some distance below λ m i e g 0 λ m t z it is named the gh method i e the gradient method with homogeneous assumption as the nssht model considers the heterogeneity of soil and gives an estimation of λ 0 the formula is changed to g 0 λ 0 t z since the effect of water vapor is ignored it is named the go gradient only method furthermore with the theory of water vapor transfer the contribution of water vapor can be added as below 28 g 0 λ 0 t z h v j v it is named the gradient vapor gv method it is noted that in eq 28 g 0 is upward positive and in practice it is always adjusted to downward positive in addition the gv and go methods can also be used for calculating soil heat flux at any depth in the similar way 3 data data were collected at an integrated surface flux system isfs site located at the former boulder atmospheric observatory bao in colorado 40 2 54 84 n 105 0 7 62 w at an altitude of 1587 m the field project is named characterizing the atmospheric boundary layer cabl which was carried out by the earth observing laboratory eol of the national center for atmospheric research ncar from february 18 2015 to june 25 2015 ucar ncar earth observing laboratory 2018 2016a 2016b the period from february 18 to march 8 is excluded in this study due to the impact of frozen soil the bao was situated in an area of open grassland shown in fig 2 a the isfs tower fig 2b was equipped with the integrated irgason eddy covariance systems a temperature relative humidity sensor a barometer an integrated net radiometer and a leaf wetness sensor lws the manufacturers models installation heights and sampling rates are summarized in table 2 the lws has a base level output of 0 25 0 26 v and water on the sensor causes an output above the base level thus the lws can also be used as an indirect way to detect rainfall please refer to https www eol ucar edu content sensor notes for more details about the lws near surface soil temperature close to the tower was measured by a 4 needle temperature probe at a high vertical resolution of 0 6 1 9 3 1 and 4 4 cm at the depth of 5 cm the soil moisture sensor was installed along with a heat flux plate to measure soil heat flux soil thermal conductivity and diffusivity were measured by the thermal properties sensor at the same depth besides half hour sensible and latent heat fluxes were calculated from the eddy covariance data please refer to oncley et al 2007 for the related data processing details four radiation components wetness by the lws soil heat flux soil temperature and moisture were stored as the 5 min average tp01 was started every 3 h to avoid overheating the soil for hft3 the parameters related to eq 25 are as follows s p π d p 2 2 where the plate diameter d p 38 2 mm x p 3 91 mm λ p 1 22 w m 1 k 1 the accuracy of hft3 is within 5 and its measurement range is 100 w m 2 for tp01 measurements of soil thermal conductivity may attain uncertainties in the order of 10 in the rated measurement range of 0 3 to 5 w m 1 k 1 and the measurement range of soil thermal diffusivity is 0 05 1 10 6 m2 s 1 with uncertainties 20 the accuracy of soil temperature measurement is 0 1 k the accuracy of volumetric water content by ec 5 is 0 03 m3 m 3 for typical mineral soils with generic calibration and 0 02 m3 m 3 in any porous medium with medium specific calibration 4 results 4 1 the λ θ relationship fig 3 a shows measured λ and θ as well as the fitting curves long term in situ monitoring reveals the bifurcation phenomenon shown by the red dots and blue dots implying that the λ θ relationship underwent significant change during the observation period the transition point occurred on april 16 17 when there was a heavy rainfall event before and after this rainfall event measured sensible heat flux sh and latent heat flux le also changed dramatically fig 3b before april 17 sh was much higher than le however after that heavy rainfall le was first comparable with sh and then quickly exceeded it and became dominant in less than a week this phenomenon is consistent with the observation on the tibetan plateau sh dominates during the pre monsoon season when the grass remains inactive and le becomes important after the onset of monsoon when the grass turns green and active e g tanaka et al 2001 therefore it is believed that at this bao site the rainfall event during april 16 17 made the grass grow rapidly and then enter the active period which altered the λ θ relationship however it remains unclear how the grass growth influences soil thermal conductivity which needs further study in the future the λ θ relationship in section 2 3 does not consider the effects of grass growth and thus should be used for the inactive period the nonlinear fitting gives ρ b 0 315 g cm 3 m c 0 948 then 29 λ 0 464 0 334 θ 0 424 e x p 3 672 θ 4 where coefficient d 0 040 w m 1 k 1 i e thermal conductivity of dry soil compared with typical mineral soils ρ b here is very low which should be the distinguishing feature of peat côté and konrad 2005 reported a low ρ b of 0 332 g cm 3 for fairbanks peat chen et al 2012 also found ρ b can reach about 0 4 g cm 3 for soils with extremely high soil organic matters the very low λ values measured by tp01 fig 3a also imply this is not typical mineral soils but peat soils however it s noted that the very high value of m c on the other hand means it is the clay soil but the thermal conductivity of clay soil should be much higher than the measured values shown in fig 3a given that the λ θ relationship by campbell 1985 is mainly for mineral soils the fitting parameter m c here should have different meaning or explanation other λ θ models were also tried but their fitting even gave negative thermal conductivity for dry soils and thus were not adopted please see section 5 2 for further discussions for the active period it is assumed that ρ b and λ of dry soil are invariant regardless of the conditions of grass thus the coefficients a b and d in eq 24 should remain the same as those in the inactive period the impact of grass growth is reflected by adjustment of coefficients c and e then with known a b and d the new equation for the active period is given by 30 λ 0 464 0 334 θ 0 424 e x p 3 435 θ 7 427 besides at the bao site measurements were not conducted for soil porosity and other hydraulic properties etc so these model parameters are estimated according to typical peat following lawrence and slater 2008 these parameters are set as θ s 0 9 k s 2 8 10 4 m s 1 ψ s 0 0103 m b 2 7 and c sdry 2 5 105 j m 3 k 1 then d s k s ψ s b θ s 8 652 10 6 m2 s 1 the sensitivity experiments of these parameters are further discussed in section 4 5 except for low thermal conductivity these parameters reflect other characteristics of organic or peat soils high porosity high saturated hydraulic conductivity and weak suction in addition the enhancement factor ζ usually ranges from 2 to 3 for general mineral soils jury and horton 2004 but considering the large porosity of peat soils ζ is estimated as 1 4 philip and de vries 1957 and in eq 6 a k equals θ s θ k where θ k 0 2 also following philip and de vries 1957 4 2 soil temperature fitting fig 4 shows the statistics of fitting including the coefficient of determination r 2 the root mean square error rmse and the relative rmse rrmse the exponential fitting for c n is very good the 10th percentage of r 2 exceeds 0 97 and the 90th percentile of rrmse is about 6 similarly the linear fitting also well describes φ n t a is also well represented by the exponential fitting therefore the change of c n and φ n with depth is consistent with the ideal solution in section 2 2 the differences lie in 1 d n 1 and d n 2 in eq 22 are not equal under real soil conditions results not shown and the vertical heterogeneity of real soils is probably one of the reasons for this 2 t a actually changes slightly with depth at the daily timescale results not shown but the ideal solution assumes the same t a for all depths lastly soil temperature t is also evaluated by comparing fitted values with observed ones at each timestep overall the fitting of t is good the 10th percentage of r 2 can still reach 0 94 and the 90th percentile of rmse is less than 0 25 c therefore the hel fitting method is proved to be an effective way to construct soil temperature profiles using discrete measurements fig 5 further shows three types of cases for soil temperature fitting a rainy case with almost no solar radiation fig 5a a sunny case with almost no clouds fig 5c and a sunny case with intermittent clouds fig 5e the full periods are shown in fig 5c and e and the partial period is shown in fig 5a since the full period lasts almost 3 days fig 5b d and f are selected vertical profiles to illustrate spatial fitting during nighttime around midday with no clouds and during intermittent cloudy conditions respectively results show that the hel fitting method performs well for the sunny case without clouds fig 5c d but it is a little difficult to capture the rapid change of soil temperature when there are intermittent clouds fig 5e f for the rainy case it sometimes produces some small disturbance fig 5a due to some high frequency harmonics in spite of this the hel fitting method can well represent the main features of soil temperature the constructed profiles of t along with its derivatives t z and 2 t z 2 are used as the input of the nssht model in the next section 4 3 evaluation of near surface soil hydro thermodynamics equipped with all the input above the model was run from march 12 to june 25 2015 at the bao site for the λ θ relationship the model uses eq 29 for the inactive period of grass and eq 30 for the active period critical model output variables related to soil hydro thermodynamics are analyzed for the three typical cases in section 4 2 including swc vertical velocity of liquid water mass flux of water vapor and soil thermal conductivity fig 6 a shows the observed wetness by lws swc at 5 cm and incoming shortwave radiation for the case of heavy rain on april 16 the lws shows the water began to accumulate on its surface from 6 00 lst local standard time implying the beginning of the rainfall but the swc at 5 cm increased with a time lag 7 h until about 13 00 lst a possible reason for this delay is that the precipitation amount might be quite small from 6 00 to 13 00 lst but unfortunately no direct rainfall measurement was conducted the distinct variation of swc indicates that it was raining from 13 00 lst and became very heavy from 17 00 lst besides the constructed soil temperature fig 6b generally decreased all day long due to very weak incoming solar radiation for the model output the swc between 0 and 5 cm fig 6c did not change significantly until about 15 00 lst and became very wet afterwards with the maximum swc more than 0 6 m3 m 3 it implies that the model can capture the high values of swc corresponding to the heavy precipitation for april 13 the sunny case with almost no clouds the incoming solar radiation was very intense with the maximum about 1000 w m 2 and the swc at 5 cm behaved like a sinusoidal wave with low values about 0 2 m3 m 3 fig 7 a there was almost no high frequency disturbance in soil temperature fig 7b and the output of swc fig 7c it is noted that only daytime output results are shown in fig 7c f because nighttime results are dubious also fig 8 c f the model sometimes cannot deal well with small temperature gradients at night and especially during sunrise and sunset due to singularity difficulty which will be further discussed in section 5 1 the soil from 0 to 1 cm fig 7c was very dry during the daytime with the minimum swc less than 0 04 m3 m 3 implying the model can produce low values of the swc under very intense solar radiation for the case of intermittent clouds on april 9 the incoming solar radiation underwent high frequency oscillations fig 8a and it was also reflected by the response of soil temperature fig 8b the output of swc is also highly variable fig 8c even though the model in general can produce reasonable swc sometimes its performance is not satisfactory for example at about 2 30 lst on april 16 there is a high value area of swc near the surface fig 6c which is probably not true since the rainfall has not begun the temperature fitting errors fig 5a and b should be responsible for this false high value area because when t z is very small it is rather sensitive to errors of fitted t besides the model can produce reasonable vertical velocity of liquid water w in fig 6d positive upward w was very low before the rain and became very high during the heavy rain up to 10 6 10 5 m s whose variation is consistent with swc fig 6c and during sunny days without rain w is only 10 9 m s figs 7d and 8d which is three to four orders of magnitude lower than that during the rain during sunny days soil became drier from bottom to top figs 7c and 8c and water remained going up to drier parts figs 7d and 8d which is consistent with darcy s law in addition figs 6e 7e and 8e show the mass flux of water vapor j v positive upward for the rainy case water vapor kept going upward but went downward during the two sunny cases it seems that the finding is contrary to the common sense that water vapor should go upward to enter the atmosphere under solar radiation actually according to the theory of gas transport in soil in section 2 1 the direction of water vapor transfer within soil is mainly determined by temperature gradient as shown in eq 8 the related physical process is described as below when the sun heats the soil surface surface temperature gets higher than air temperature and the same is true for its water vapor density so water vapor leaves the soil surface and enters the atmosphere meanwhile solar heating makes t z 0 within soil and thus water vapor also moves downward driven by temperature gradient then the soil water at the surface evaporates to compensate the decrease of water vapor due to transport in both directions and becomes drier at the same time water in the deeper soil then moves upward according to darcy s law the water vapor that enters the atmosphere mainly comes from the soil surface lastly soil thermal conductivity λ can undergo obvious changes even for the 0 5 cm soil layer figs 6f 7f and 8f during the precipitation λ at the soil surface can be higher than that at 5 cm by 20 30 and under strong solar radiation λ at the soil surface can be 3 4 times lower than that at 5 cm the vertical variation is also true for soil volumetric heat capacity therefore the soil thermal properties are essentially vertically heterogeneous for this thin near surface layer 4 4 ground heat flux and surface energy balance ground heat flux g 0 is calculated via the four methods mentioned in section 2 4 2 the results are shown in fig 9 a the gh method gives higher g 0 than the go method during the daytime because it uses the thermal conductivity at 5 cm to approximate that at the soil surface which ignores the vertical variation of thermal conductivity the gv method considers the contribution of water vapor and thus produces higher g 0 than the go method using the gv method as the reference the g 0 by the go method has the rmse of 22 53 w m 2 and the relative bias of 37 94 from 8 00 to 16 00 lst thus the role of water vapor cannot be ignored in the determination of g 0 the same conclusion can be drawn from the analysis of soil heat flux g s at 5 cm fig 9b in addition the pc method gives slightly higher g 0 values than the gv method one primary reason is that g s by the hfp after correction is higher than that by the gv method fig 9b which accounts for most of the differences the other secondary reason is that the pc method produces slightly higher soil heat storage δ s fig 9c with the assumption of homogeneous soil the reason for the differences in δ s is that shallower soil is always drier than deeper soil due to solar radiation and gravity except during the rain and thus the homogeneous assumption has higher volumetric heat capacity and higher δ s for g s at 5 cm the hfp is expected to produce lower g s since it blocks the movement of water vapor and only considers conductive heat flux but what it actually gives is higher g s compared with the gv method the thermal contact resistance is not the reason because it tends to make g s by the hfps lower sauer et al 2007 and the correction for heat flow distortion actually makes g s lower than original measurements because the soil thermal conductivity at this site is less than the plate thermal conductivity as shown in eq 25 therefore both heat flow distortion and thermal contact resistance cannot explain the higher g s by the hfp a possible explanation is soil horizontal heterogeneity since the temperature probe and hfp had to be buried apart and not in the same hole the impact of g 0 on the surface energy balance is further analyzed since the energy balance ratio ebr around midday is closer to 1 than other periods wilson et al 2002 xin et al 2018 this study only focuses on the ebr from 10 00 to 15 00 lst following xin et al 2018 the ebr was analyzed with the linear regression method by fitting the turbulent energy fluxes the sum of sh and le against the available energy the difference between net radiation r n and g 0 e g wilson et al 2002 ideal closure means the slope is 1 the intercept is 0 and r 2 is 1 the results are shown in fig 10 although the gh method has higher daytime g 0 than the gv method fig 9a which appears to make the ebr better actually it behaves worse than the gv method with higher intercept lower slope and r 2 besides the gv method also has higher slope than the go method despite its slightly higher intercept and lower r 2 generally the surface energy closure gets better when soil vertical heterogeneity and the contribution of water vapor are considered in addition compared with the pc method the gv method has slightly lower slope but higher r 2 and lower intercept but even for the pc method its slope is only about 0 7 thus the ebr is overall very low at this site for further exploring the reasons for the low ebr the flux footprint is analyzed using an online flux footprint prediction ffp model developed by kljun et al 2015 http footprint kljun net ffp2d html in order to know the temporal variation of footprints the model was run for each month from march to june the period from 10 00 to 15 00 lst is selected to be consistent with the ebr analysis besides the ffp model provides an unsupervised land cover classification for the flux footprint and estimates the contribution of different land covers to the measured turbulent fluxes specific type of land cover is determined by comparing with the actual satellite image of google earth for the flux footprint from march to june fig 11 all the contour lines of 80 lie within the area of grassland but the contour lines of 90 have larger scope including roads and trees thus to some extent the spatial representativeness of turbulent fluxes is influenced by roads and trees and it should be one of the reasons for the energy imbalance besides for the contribution of different land covers to the measured turbulent fluxes in march the contribution of grass and bare soils can reach 59 9 and 38 8 respectively in april the grass entered the active period and began growing also mentioned in section 4 1 and the area of bare soils decreased therefore the contribution of grass increased slightly in may and june as the grass continued to grow its area quickly expanded and its contribution to measured fluxes can reach 92 in june during this period the role of bare soils became less and less important it s worth noting that although the ground cover was almost homogenous in june it was significantly heterogeneous in march and april however the instruments for measuring g 0 were deployed only at one location therefore the seasonal variation of ground cover could influence the spatial representativeness of g 0 which is another potential reason for the surface energy imbalance in addition other factors like the underestimation of turbulent fluxes e g cheng et al 2017 twine et al 2000 may also contribute to the low ebr 4 5 parameter sensitivity given that soil physical parameters like θ s k s ψ s and b are estimated from typical peat when solving the nssht model the sensitivity of g 0 by the gv method as well as the corresponding ebr to these soil parameters is further analyzed in this section the control experiment uses the aforementioned typical values θ s 0 9 k s 2 8 10 4 m s 1 ψ s 0 0103 m b 2 7 lawrence and slater 2008 the way to conduct the sensitivity tests is to change one parameter while keeping others the same as the typical values the possible values of θ s are set to 0 85 0 8 0 75 0 7 0 65 and 0 6 considering the large porosity of peat θ s lower than 0 6 is not tried the values of the clapp and hornberger exponent b are typically higher than 2 91 for mineral soils lawrence and slater 2008 thus the possible values of b here are set to 3 0 2 9 2 8 2 6 2 5 and 2 4 for saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the following values are used for sensitivity tests 0 25 k s 0 5 k s 0 75 k s 1 33 k s 2 0 k s and 4 0 k s the values of saturated water potential are set in the similar way as k s the sensitivity of g 0 is evaluated by the rmse of g 0 between the control experiment and sensitivity tests and the sensitivity of ebr is evaluated by the variation in fitted slope intercept and r2 tables 3 and 4 show the sensitivity of g 0 and ebr to soil physical parameters respectively it is found that g 0 by the gv method is only slightly sensitive to θ s and it is very insensitive to the other three parameters the same is true for the corresponding ebr in terms of fitted slope intercept and r2 therefore the results of ebr by the gv method are relatively robust it also shows that the uncertainty of soil physical parameters cannot account for the low ebr 5 discussions 5 1 the application of the nssht model there are some noteworthy points about the application of the nssht model firstly some physical properties are assumed vertically homogeneous for the near surface soil in the derivation of eq 12 thus vertical heterogeneity is caused only by soil water content if detailed measurements can be made in the future eqs 12 and 15 can be modified to incorporate the vertical heterogeneity of these properties secondly as mentioned in section 4 3 the model cannot deal well with singularities or very small t z in practice when t z approximates 0 the mass matrix f 1 in eq 12 becomes singular although the backward differentiation formulas bdfs are designed to solve this kind of singularity e g shampine et al 1999 this algorithm always fails in application while debugging it is found that in eq 12 when f 1 gets close to 0 f 2 should have approached 0 but more often than not it does not thus making θ z and the failure of bdfs the problem lies in that even though f 1 and f 2 are related in physics they are calculated independently in mathematics t z 0 can only guarantee f 1 0 but not f 2 0 the inconsistent convergence is related to various errors in the real world and it is essentially not caused by the mathematical algorithm or physical processes of the model during sunrise sunset and some nighttime or intermittent cloudy periods with very small t z other methods for estimating g 0 can be used if the model fails to give a solution given that the soil below 5 cm has smaller t z the model cannot be extended to deeper soils and the shallow swc measurement is necessary thirdly although the theory for transport of water vapor is complete some details may need more investigations for example the determination of a k in eq 6 i e the volumetric air content below which liquid continuity begins is not very clear for soils with different texture porosity etc the same is true for the enhancement factor lastly the model only considers liquid water and water vapor the soil hydro thermodynamics for frozen soils need further investigation in the future 5 2 future soil observations firstly the impact of vegetation activities on soil thermal conductivity needs further investigation by using long term monitoring at a wider range of sites the thermal sensor tp01 is a good option but its measurement range is smaller than those with thermal needles like hukseflux ftn02 which may produce errors for organic or peat soils with low soil thermal conductivity secondly it s warranted and necessary to pay greater attention to the study of organic or peat soils in section 2 3 the relationship between fitting coefficients and soil properties is for mineral soils although in terms of mathematics good fitting is also obtained for organic soils in section 4 1 the meaning of the parameters may be different for example the clay fraction the alternative λ θ relationship in lu et al 2014 is also tested but the thermal conductivity of dry soil is unrealistically negative the reason is that their samples do not include soils with high organic matter content the same is true for tong et al 2016 besides most empirical equations for deriving soil hydraulic properties are created for mineral soils e g cosby et al 1984 some studies consider the impact of organic matters but only allow low content e g saxton and rawls 2006 thirdly more attention should be paid to seasonal variation of ground cover which has impact on spatial representativeness of g 0 and becomes a potential factor for surface energy imbalance lastly it s necessary to measure soil texture bulk density and soil hydraulic properties including soil porosity saturated water potential saturated hydraulic conductivity and the clapp and hornberger exponent in future field campaigns 5 3 future development for land surface models the relative importance of three main physical processes in eq 1 i e the heat conservation equation is compared to emphasize the role of vertical heterogeneity of λ thermal conduction is divided into two parts λ z t z conduct 1 and λ 2 t z 2 conduct 2 for each node at each timestep the percentage is calculated by dividing the absolute value of each item by the sum of absolute value of all the items since the movement of liquid water is only important when there is precipitation infiltration li et al 2009 the statistical results are roughly divided into two parts the red blue boxes in fig 12 correspond to cases when the contribution of the movement of liquid water is less more than 10 which is considered without with rain influence the sample number of the blue boxes only accounts for 2 5 so the movement of liquid water is often not important except for rain by contrast thermal conduction always contributes most in the heat conservation equation regardless of the rain the role of vertical heterogeneity of λ is also important besides the contribution of water vapor is also significant especially when there exists precipitation infiltration the comparison indicates that except for the major thermal conduction the movement of flowing liquid water and water vapor is also important in heat conservation equation at least for the near surface layer however some widely used land surface models e g the noah land surface model with multiparameterization options noah mp do not consider these processes niu et al 2011 therefore in the future these processes can be incorporated into the land surface models to further test their impact 6 conclusions based on heat conservation equation this study proposes a near surface soil hydro thermodynamics nssht model it is essentially a temperature driven soil moisture model three main soil physical processes are considered including thermal conduction heat convection of flowing liquid water and convection of latent heat the input includes soil temperature temperature gradient the 2nd order spatial derivative of temperature soil water content at a certain depth the function of soil thermal conductivity and other hydraulic parameters the output fields include soil water content vertical velocity of liquid water mass flux of water vapor and soil thermal conductivity then ground heat flux can be determined by the gradient vapor method which considers the vertical heterogeneity of thermal conductivity and contribution of water vapor in addition in order to obtain soil temperature profiles this study presents the harmonics exponential linear hel fitting method in two steps 1 fourier decomposition of time series at each depth 2 spatially exponential fitting for average soil temperature and amplitude and linear fitting for phase angle besides the equation documented in campbell 1985 is used for fitting the function of soil thermal conductivity with soil water content main findings and conclusions are summarized as follows firstly the long term in situ monitoring reveals that the vegetation activities can change the function of soil thermal conductivity with soil water content secondly analysis of in situ measurements shows that the amplitudes of soil temperature harmonics decrease exponentially with depth and the phase angles change linearly with depth overall the hel method performs good temperature fitting thirdly the nssht model can capture high values of soil water content during rainfall events low values under strong solar radiation and highly variable values in intermittent cloudy conditions the model can also produce reasonable vertical movement of liquid water and water vapor however the disadvantages lie in that the model can neither give a solution during sunrise and sunset due to singularity difficulty nor deal well with very small temperature gradients which sometimes occur during nighttime and intermittent cloudy periods fourthly after comparing the relative importance of three main physical processes in the heat conservation equation it is found that although thermal conduction is most important the contribution of liquid water and water vapor cannot be ignored either fifthly when soil vertical heterogeneity and the contribution of water vapor are considered in the estimation of ground heat flux the energy balance ratio ebr is improved although it is still low footprint analysis indicates the very low ebr at this site may be caused by the contribution of other flux footprint and seasonal variation of ground cover for future soil observations suggestions are summarized as below 1 long term monitoring at a wider range of sites is necessary to explore the mechanism of how grass growth affects soil thermal conductivity 2 more studies are needed for the organic or peat soils including the function of soil thermal conductivity with soil water content 3 seasonal variation of ground cover could cause horizontal heterogeneity which needs further investigation in the future besides for land surface models the contribution of liquid water and water vapor is recommended to be incorporated into the heat conservation equation for the near surface soil credit authorship contribution statement baoqiang wu conceptualization methodology formal analysis resources data curation

provided by ncar eol under the sponsorship of the national science foundation appendix a derivation of the heat conservation equation the heat conservation equation needs to be rewritten for incorporating convection of heat by flowing water and convection of latent heat similar to the derivation of mass conservation equation in jury and horton 2004 we focus on a cube of soil with the volume v δ x δ y δ z at the point x y z as shown in fig a 1 only the flow in the z direction is considered upward positive during an arbitrarily small time period δ t between t and t δ t the heat conservation equation can be stated as energy entering soil volume during δ t energy leaving soil volume during δ t increase of energy stored in soil volume during δ t the energy entering soil volume at the bottom side during δ t consists of four parts 1 j hc x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hc x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hc λ t z is the conductive heat flux 2 j hv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hv h v j v is the convective latent heat flux 3 j hw x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hw ρ l c l w t t ref is the convective heat flux carried by flowing liquid water 4 j hwv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t where j hwv c l j v t t ref is the convective heat flux produced by gain or loss of liquid water through condensation or evaporation similarly energy leaving soil volume at the top side during δ t includes j hc x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hv x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hw x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hwv x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t and an additional term for water uptake by plant roots or other sinks of water ρ l c l t t ref r w x y z δ z 2 t δ x δ y δ z δ t where r w is the rate of loss of water per unit volume per unit time lastly increase of energy stored in soil volume during δ t is h x y z δ z 2 t δ t δ x δ y δ z h x y z δ z 2 t δ x δ y δ z where h c s t t ref is total soil heat content per unit volume therefore the heat conservation equation is given by a 1 j hc x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hw x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hwv x y z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hc x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hv x y z δ z t δ t 2 δ x δ y δ t j hw x y z δ

t and in the limit δ z δ t 0 eq a 1 becomes a 2 h t j hc z j hv z j hw z j hwv z r w ρ l c l t t ref 0 inserting expressions of each term into eq a 2 produces a 3 c s t t ρ l c l t t ref θ t w z 1 ρ l j v z r w z λ t z ρ l c l w t z h v j v z c l j v t z similar to the derivations in jury and horton 2004 the water conservation equation could be written as a 4 θ t w z 1 ρ l j v z r w 0 inserting eq a 4 into eq a 3 produces a 5 c s t t z λ t z ρ l c l w t z h v j v z c l j v t z the derivation shows that the items related to t ref can be eliminated through the water conservation equation which is similar to the findings in ochsner et al 2007 
5112,soil water and groundwater are important water resources for vegetation survival and growth in arid and semiarid regions and their contributions to water use over a whole growth period are difficult to quantify with limited observations additionally the root water uptake rwu processes of groundwater dependent xeric vegetation are specific and aggravate the complexity of these issues in this paper salix is selected to study the interaction among atmosphere soil water groundwater and rwu from the sprout to withered stage based on an observation within the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of the atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum two lysimeters with a diameter of 2 m and depths of 1 2 m and 4 2 m were implemented with salix the initial water table depth was 0 7 m in case 1 and 2 2 m in case 2 the results show that water use of salix is the main contribution to actual evapotranspiration eta no less than 80 eta was 462 75 mm in case 1 with a shallower soil layer and limited groundwater during the entire growth period 2016 contrastively it was 619 70 mm in case 2 with relatively abundant soil water and groundwater the soil water and groundwater contribution were 89 6 and 10 4 74 3 and 25 7 for both cases the selective water use by salix in different soil layers was subject to temporal moisture availability salix extended to utilize groundwater in drought period and shifted back to wetter upper layers in case of rainfall the access to groundwater significantly alleviates water stress although rainfall replenishment can also play a part salix can not only intercept rainfall infiltration in the root zone but also cause the decrease of water level implying that the replanting of salix should be carried out in a reasonable mode to ensure rainfall infiltration and reduce the ineffective loss of groundwater our results provide a practical reference for groundwater management and ecology restoration in semiarid desert regions keywords water use salix root water uptake water table depth in situ observation semiarid regions 1 introduction soil water and groundwater are paramount water sources for the growth and transpiration of many plants in arid and semiarid regions naumburg et al 2005 gribovszki et al 2010 in dry season groundwater likely account for more than 50 of water resources miller et al 2010 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 the vegetation soil water groundwater interaction is related to the influence of groundwater recharge discharge and ecoenvironment chen et al 2014 wang et al 2011 2013 yang et al 2016 yin et al 2015 chen et al 2018 however there is still insufficient research on the water use processes of plants especially the interaction among the atmosphere vegetation soil and groundwater therefore understanding the relationship among the above factors is of great significance for improving the water and vegetation management in arid and semiarid regions beff et al 2013 seyfried et al 2005 most fundamentally soil water and groundwater have obvious effects on xeric vegetation which appears to specialize in taking up water from specific soil layers at certain times of the year cody 1986 cohen 1970 flanagan et al 1992 lin et al 1996 wu et al 2014 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 rather than taking up water wherever and whenever it becomes available numerous studies have shown that plants preferentially utilize rainfall derived soil water over groundwater because rainfall derived soil water is more readily available however most arid vegetation especially shrubs use groundwater soil water or a mixture of both chimner and cooper 2004 mclendon et al 2008 mclendon et al 2008 indicated that plants preferentially extract groundwater when the water table depth is less than 3 m xeric shrubs form deep root systems to improve water uptake in arid and semiarid environments nepstad et al 1994 it has been found that desert plants can absorb water from a depth at least 3 m and the depth may be much deeper in some cases canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 2002 dai et al 2015 deep roots may serve as a mechanism to avoid severe drought stress lubczynski 2009 miller et al 2010 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 the dynamic process of root water uptake rwu has a significant impact on hydro ecological processes there is an analogy that plants acts like a pump that can intercept or extract a large portion of rainfall derived soil water and groundwater banks et al 2011 it is critically important to understand the fraction of groundwater and soil water used by plants quantifying the proportion of groundwater and soil water contributed to plants has received wide attention zhao et al 2016 yu et al 2016 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 many studies have shown that groundwater uptake is high during the summer months when rainfall is low while is low during wet seasons zhu et al 2015 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 predictably the water use strategies of shrubs vary with water table depth which is the key in quantifying the contributions of groundwater and soil water to plants therefore exploration of seasonal water use strategies by vegetation is necessary to improve understanding of water use and water balance in xeric ecosystem however the models describing the water flow at the soil plant atmosphere interface neglect plants adaptive response to water stress it does not consider the mechanisms by which they take place schneider et al 2010 in order to simulate the soil water transport in the root zone a description of rwu in a complete growth period is prerequisite experimental investigations and techniques such as in situ lysimeter observations soil water sensors and water table transducers are essential for a better understanding of the water fluxes within the groundwater soil vegetation continuum system ludwig et al 2005 wenninger et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 2019 ma et al 2019 the lysimeter method is accurate and can be used to simultaneously measure the water balance components luo and sophocleous 2010 wang et al 2017 yu et al 2016 however several problems exist in previous lysimeter studies for example the use of lysimeters with small radius or size which will expand the boundary effect and the inclusion of crops as the primary research objects beff et al 2013 yu et al 2016 few studies have investigated natural vegetation in arid areas furthermore most studies focused on vegetation water uptake under a single meteorological condition such as continuous drought but lacked of research on vegetation under natural climatic conditions in order to explore the interaction between soil water groundwater and vegetation more comprehensively more realistic field studies are needed at the plant individual scale therefore a typical and groundwater dependent xeric vegetation that could reflect a continuum of water use strategies from germination to wilting should be chosen to address the issue in arid and semiarid regions using a multidisciplinary approach such as ecology vadose zone hydrology and hydrogeology in addition variations in atmosphere elements should also be considered when determining the unique water use and the rwu processes of trees in a semiarid environment meanwhile the balance of water resources and ecological water consumption in semiarid areas needs to be quantified in this paper the long term in situ monitoring lysimeter system of the atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum was implemented to study the relationship among soil water groundwater and the most representative natural plant salix in the wind blown sand area of the ordos basin northwest china based on the field investigation of the salix habitat two water level scenarios were set up the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 the rwu processes and water use strategies of salix in unsaturated saturated systems were explored for the two cases 2 the soil water and groundwater contribution under different growth stages were quantitatively analyzed 3 on this basis the balance between water use of salix and soil water resource protection was analyzed our study provides a reference for ecosystem replanting and groundwater management in semi arid areas 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area is in the mu us desert which is one of the largest deserts in china fig 1 a the water table depth is generally from 1 to 30 m in this region cheng et al 2012 it is a typical semiarid region where the annual average temperature is 7 7 c the average annual rainfall is 315 2 mm the average annual potential evapotranspiration is 2100 5 mm and the aridity index is 2 9 8 0 huo et al 2013 rainfall events mainly occur from july to september which account for more than 70 of the annual total rainfall before the 1990 s the landscape was mainly mobile and semifixed dunes and vegetation was scarce after the 1990 s the government called for returning farmland to forest and prohibiting grassland and grazing to improve the ecological environment the ecological environment has been greatly improved vegetation was more luxuriant than it was before the 1990 s and the dunes were also fixed since most of the vegetation depends on groundwater a large amount of vegetation restoration leads to a continuous decline in the water table moreover high ecological risk still exists the dominant species in the study area are salix artemisia aragana and caragana koragana salix is a perennial shrub species and grows in the interhill area between dunes or on dunes the wind blown sand thickness of the salix habitat is sometimes very thin with an unweathered quartz based about 1 m underground and sometimes the thickness is several meters fig 1b the appropriate water table depth of salix growth is approximately 0 5 5 m wang et al 2013 and its vegetation coverage accounts for more than 70 of the surface ecosystem within this depth range yang 2004 based on years of field investigation the gradient of the water level is relatively flat in the study area and groundwater recharge from lateral flow is low furthermore the growth characteristics of salix were determined in the sprout stage from may to mid june the growing stage from mid june to late july the harvest stage in august and the withered stage from september to october moreover the dormant period of salix and the frozen period is from november to april of the following year during this period rainfall and water use are almost zero wang et al 2004 2 2 in situ experiment setup the in situ experiment was conducted at the national weather station of henan county inner mongolia china fig 1c and two lysimeters were implemented at the observation site fig 1d the meteorological station records the net radiation air temperature pressure rainfall relative humidity wind speed and direction based on field survey of the site conditions of salix two bottom and wall sealed lysimeters were set to study the vertical exchange of rainfall soil water groundwater and rwu without considering the influence of lateral flow one lysimeter 200 cm in diameter and 120 cm in depth with an initial water table depth of approximately 70 cm was case1 another lysimeter 200 cm in diameter and 420 cm in depth with an initial water table depth of approximately 220 cm was case2 the lysimeters were filled with local natural homogeneous wind blown sand the material parameters were obtained in the laboratory and are shown in table 1 two similar sized salix seedlings were planted in both lysimeters in 2015 with different initial water table depths approximately 70 cm for case 1 and 220 cm for case 2 the soil moisture content was measured by ech2o 5 tm decagon inc 1 2 sensors at depths of 3 10 20 30 50 and 80 cm for case 1 and 3 10 20 30 50 80 100 150 250 350 and 400 cm for case 2 fig 2 the water table was monitored by di 501 diver inc 0 05 and corrected by a di 500 baro diver 0 1 fig 2 all data were automatically recorded via a data logger decagon devices inc usa 2 3 relative evapotranspiration eta etp the simplified water balance approach hupet et al 2002 was applied to quantitatively calculate actual evapotranspiration eta the following equation provides a framework in which the fundamental relationships among rainfall inputs change in soil water storage and eta in the lysimeter are determined 1 et a p i where p lt 1 is rainfall eta lt 1 is actual evapotranspiration including transpiration from the plant and evaporation from the soil surface and i is the soil water storage variation in the lysimeter including soil water in the unsaturated zone and groundwater in the saturated zone which can be calculated by eq 2 2 i 0 z sw ti sw ti 1 where 0 is the surface of the soil z is the thickness of soil layer in the lysimeter swti and swti 1 are the soil water contents at ti and ti 1 times respectively the vertical soil water content at any given depth within a 20 mm interval is determined through interpolation between neighboring observed data using the kriging method yu et al 2018 etp reflects the potential capabilities of plant transpiration and soil evaporation and it is obtained by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 by an appropriate crop coefficient tang 2007 mirck and volk 2010 the penman monteith equation p m is used to calculate et0 the fao p m equation is defined as follows allen et al 1998 3 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 m height above the ground c u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 m height m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δis the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 eta reflects the actual water transport ability depending on the climate soil water in unsaturated zone and water table depth and it is usually less than etp in semiarid regions the relative evapotranspiration is the ratio between eta and etp it expresses the degree to which a certain plant can suit the soil water stress and four levels of water scarcity are determined 1 0 0 8 means that the water supply to the plants is continuous and not limited 0 8 0 5 signifies that the water demand is still continuous but it is getting increasingly restricted 0 5 0 3 means that water scarcity is high and the water supply to the plants is restricting and water stress is developing 0 3 signifies that strong water stress occurs causing considerable the death of the plant when this stage lasts long petrassovits 1990 2 4 evaporation estimation soil evaporation is appropriate to estimate water flux by darcy s law downward positive 4 q d θ θ z k θ where θ is soil water content z denotes the vertical depth k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and d θ is the moisture diffusivity evaporation from the profile occurs only above the zero flux plane which is no more than 30 cm depth ma et al 2019 chen et al 2018 therefore the measured soil moisture content above 30 cm in the shallow layer is used to calculate the evaporation from beneath a canopy detailed parameter values and calculation procedures can be found in the researches published by zhang et al 2018 and chen et al 2018 3 calculation of the soil water and groundwater contributions the groundwater contribution is the water amount decrease in the saturated area which can be calculated by eq 5 δ g wtd z θ s sw ti 1 5 where δ g is the groundwater volume variation lt 1 wtd is the water table depth l z is the thickness the lysimeter and θ s is the saturated soil water content the soil water contribution is the total soil water storage variation minus the groundwater contribution 3 1 estimation of the rooting front the rooting front represents the maximum root depth which can be estimated by identifying the position where the observed soil profile moisture content had an abrupt decrease mcgowan 1974 in this study the rooting front was identified as the deepest spot where soil moisture content decreased abruptly based on the results of interpolation for measured soil profile water content 3 2 data sources the weather datum used cover all of 2016 the soil water moisture and water table fluctuations in the lysimeters were recorded from late april to early november whereas the frozen period from november to april was not analyzed in this paper the meteorological data were on an hourly scale and the soil water moisture and water table fluctuation data were on a 5 minutes scale the data can meet the needs of analysis for the interactions among the atmosphere vegetation soil water and groundwater during different growth stages 4 results 4 1 characteristics of the main meteorology variables during the observed period the variability in the observed rainfall daily air temperature and etp for the trial site in 2016 is shown in fig 3 rainfall varied dramatically throughout the year with an annual rainfall of 343 5 mm the rainfall amount from may to october accounted for 94 of the annual total rainfall amount individual rainfall events ranged from 0 1 to 58 mm among which light rain 0 1 9 9 mm d accounted for 81 7 of all rainy days moderate rain 10 24 9 mm d accounted for 15 0 heavy rain 25 49 9 mm d accounted for 1 7 and rainstorms 50 mm d accounted for 1 6 the annual average temperature was 2 5 c the daily average temperature ranged from a minimum of 20 1 c in january to a maximum of 28 3 c in july the average daily temperature in june july and august was above 20 c and it was less than 0 c most of the time from november to april during which the soil moisture was frozen the annual fluctuation in etp was roughly the same as that of the daily temperature and presented obvious seasonal differences etp was less than 2 mm in winter and gradually increased in spring then etp was maintained at a high level approximately 15 mm d in summer after autumn etp gradually decreased to less than 2 mm in particular etp fluctuated significantly from may to july due to heavy rainfall events the cumulative etp was approximately 2109 mm which was more than six times the cumulative rainfall see the embedded figure in fig 3 4 2 variability in water table depth fig 4 shows the water table fluctuations in both cases throughout the entire salix growth period which can be divided into four stages the first stage was from late april to mid june the second stage was from mid june to early august the third stage was from early august to early october and the fourth stage was after early october nonetheless the water table depth variation trend of the two cases were significantly different in the four stages in case 1 the water table depth varied from 72 6 cm depth to 120 cm depth in the first stage in which the depth rose twice due to rainfall after the second stage the groundwater in the lysimeter was exhausted in case 2 the water table depth varied from 226 2 cm initially to 352 0 cm finally during the whole growth stage the water table rose slightly in the first stage dropped at a rate of about 1 05 mm day in the second stage continued to decline at a rate of about 0 83 mm day in the third stage and had a very slight drop to 352 0 cm in the fourth stage 4 3 temporal and spatial variations in soil moisture the spatial variation in the measured soil water content in the soil profile for the two cases is shown in fig 5 the distribution of the soil water content shows obvious zonality and it can be divided into three zones from the ground surface to the bottom of the lysimeter according to its magnitude which are the soil water defect zone the soil water gradation zone and the saturated zone respectively the soil water defect zone is located at the surface and certain depth below and its soil water content is less than 0 1 cm3 cm3 which is mainly affected by the atmospheric conditions and shallow hairy roots the soil water gradation zone is located from the water defect zone to the water table the soil water content in this zone gradually changes from 0 1 cm3 cm3 to a saturated moisture content and is jointly controlled by the atmospheric conditions rate of rwu and water table fluctuation the saturated zone is below the water table and its variation is dominated by water table fluctuations the spatial features of zonality in both cases are conspicuously different mainly manifesting as follows the thickness of the soil water defect zone is less than 60 cm in depth in case 1 which is smaller than that in case 2 with a maximum depth of 270 cm due to the difference in the initial water table the soil water gradation zone in case 1 is thinner than that in case 2 the saturated zone in case 2 is deeper and its thickness is larger than that in case 1 the temporal characteristics of zonality in both cases are also significant although the thickness of the soil water defect zone continuously stretches to deeper soil layers under continuous drought the thickness becomes thin again resulting from the soil water being replenished by rainfall except for the soil water defect zone found in the shallow soil layers it is worth noting that the soil water defect zone appeared at 120 cm in late september and extended downward over time finally reaching a maximum depth of 270 cm in case 2 for the soil water gradation zone the two cases present a similar step down trend the saturated zone gradually decreases until it disappears in mid june incase 1 while it exists all the time and maintains a variation trend that is consistent with the water table fluctuation in case 2 4 4 eta and the rooting front fig 6 shows the calculated average 15 day eta intensity and rooting front of salix in both cases the eta intensity in case 1 was less than 2 mm d in early may and reached a maximum of 5 14 mm d in late august the eta intensity was suddenly reduced to less than 2 mm d from september to october in case 2 the variation trend of eta intensity was similar to that in case 1 but there were still obvious differences as reflected in the following three aspects 1 the eta intensity was less than that of case 1 before mid july 2 the eta intensity increased rapidly and became larger than that of case 1 after mid july reaching the maximum intensity of 6 8 mm d in late august and 3 the eta intensity gradually decreased from september to october and was almost twice the level of case 1 in case 1 the rooting front was 75 cm in the sprout stage and stretched to 120 cm in the early june after then the root growth is restricted by the depth of the lysimeter in case 2 the rooting front was at just 1 2 m in the sprout stage and developed downwards rapidly to over 220 cm in the early june the rooting front further stretched to 275 cm in late july reached a maximum depth of 3 48 m after october obviously salix is the typical deep root system plant an increasing depth of the rooting front improved the availability of water for salix thereby causing the increase in eta 4 5 the relative evapotranspiration for salix the relative evapotranspiration for both cases and rainfall on the half month scale are plotted in fig 7 the relative evapotranspiration was always less than 1 and differed in each period indicating that eta was constrained by water stress throughout the entire growth stage specifically in both cases salix was under severe water stress from may to mid july then the relative evapotranspiration increased after mid july and peaked in august because the rainfall effectively replenished the soil water and largely alleviated the water stress therefore salix was under moderate stress in case 1 and mild stress in case 2 salix was under severe water stress again in case 1 while moderate water stress in case 2 from september to october in addition there were still obvious differences in both cases as follows 1 the relative evapotranspiration in case 1 was roughly higher than that of case 2 before mid july and 2 the peak values of the relative evapotranspiration in case 1 and case 2 were 0 68 and 0 92 respectively due to contribution by groundwater 4 6 contributions of groundwater and soil water the soil water storage total eta soil water and the groundwater contribution at different salix growth stages are summarized in table 2 the decrease of soil water storage in case 1 was 104 45 mm during the whole growing period conversely for a total decrease in mean storage of 263 4 mm for case 2 the total eta was 462 75 mm in case 1 and 619 70 mm in case 2 which was 1 36 times and 1 82 times than the rainfall respectively in case 1 eta was the lowest 38 83 mm in the withered stage but the hightest 183 42 mm in the harvest stage in case 2 eta was the lowest 75 15 mm in the sprout stage but the hightest 334 31 mm in the harvest stage sw eta was 89 6 and 74 3 and g eta was 10 4 and 25 7 for both cases respectively in case 1 sw eta was 97 65 and g eta was only 2 35 in the sprout stage indicating that salix mainly utilizes soil water g eta increased to 22 6 in the growing stage salix could only depend on soil water to sustain growth from the harvest stage to the withered stage because the groundwater was exhausted in case 2 sw eta was 100 in the sprout stage indicating that salix depended on only soil water subsequently the g eta reached 11 65 in the growing stage and peaked at 38 31 in the harvest stage in the withered stage g eta decreased to 29 79 indicating that the soil water contribution increased again in this stage 5 discussion 5 1 soil evaporation beneath a canopy the loss of water is caused by both transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from underlying soil of which soil evaporation is in constant interaction with the atmosphere and the interior of the soil and is primarily controlled by the demand and supply of water soil evaporation beneath salix canopy are shown in table 2 the amount of evaporation beneath the canopy does not exceed 10 of eta case 1 during the whole growth stage and the proportion is even smaller when the water table depth is deeper case 2 soil evaporation varied among seasons evaporation during germination and wilting was greater than that during growing and harvest stage because the canopy and leaf area is relatively small in these two stages even so the evaporation in these two stages accounts for less than 20 of the eta which means that soil water loss is mainly caused by rwu the evaporation of bare soil under similar conditions would not exceed 45 of the evapotranspiration zhang et al 2018 and it can be inferred that soil evaporation from beneath a canopy should be lower than that over bare soil this interpretation is supported by observations and only 5 7 of annual evapotranspiration comes from soil evaporation black et al 1996 miralles et al 2011 furthermore soil evaporation is mainly the water flux above the zero flux plane around 30 cm ma et al 2019 chen et al 2018 nevertheless the soil water is consumed intensively by rwu in whole growth stage leading to high water stress to some extent it cuts off the supply of water that travels up to evaporate therefore we attribute the observed changes in soil profile moisture content to the rwu strategy 5 2 rwu processes of salix in the whole growth stage the observed data indicate that the water use varies significantly between individuals in different habitats and specific growth stages in case 1 salix not only utilized soil water in the vadose zone in the sprout stage but also directly absorbed groundwater resulting in the decrease of water level see fig 4 and expansion of the soil water defect zone stretching to 40 cm underground fig 5 in the growing stage salix could only rely on the soil water in the vadose zone due to the disappearance of groundwater resulting in the soil water defect zone continuing to expand stretching to 60 cm underground in the harvest stage with the frequency and intensity of rainfall increasing the water deficit zone was replenished by rainfall and the rainfall derived soil water was absorbed by roots system in the withered stage salix was maintained by soil moisture in the vadose zone in case 2 the water table depth was deeper than the root depth in the sprout stage and salix only depended on the soil moisture in the vadose zone in the growing stage salix began to utilize groundwater driven by potential atmospheric demand causing a sudden drop in the water level see fig 4 in the harvest stage due to the input of rainfall water use of salix had been transformed from mainly using groundwater to simultaneously utilizing groundwater and rainfall derived soil water resulting in that the rate of water level decline at this stage was slowed down as shown in fig 4 it is consistent with the conceptual model developed by ehleringer and dawson 1992 following large rain events water utilization shifts from shallow soil layers to deep soil layers again yang et al 2015 in the withered stage with the water use of salix significantly reducing an interesting phenomenon occurred in which the water defect zone occurred in the middle position 120 cm 270 cm underground of soil layer see fig 5 case 2 indicating that salix absorbed deep soil water rather than groundwater plants mainly absorb shallow soil water when the upper soil water is abundant but deep soil water and groundwater when the upper soil water was depleted the selective use of soil water and groundwater is adjusted in a timely manner and is a species specific phenomenon as revealed by dardanelli et al 2004 and shah et al 2008 uptake is not uniform at all of the depths the rwu strategies of salix can be summarized as follows based on observations 1 salix adapts to shallow soil water stress through root growth to utilize deep soil water and groundwater and this transformation occurs on a seasonal scale or at different growth stages and 2 salix adjusts its uptake zone to adapt to the changing environment rainfall infiltration water deficit in local soil layers on smaller time scales within a day or few days which is a probable trade off between the activity of shallow and deep roots without altering the root system plant water use strategies are considered to be a function of the complex interactions between the species and the prevailing environmental conditions and it implied three biophysical mechanism compensation rwu minimum energy expenditure principle and hydraulic redistribution compensation rwu is important for water use and it represents a process in which transpiration can be compensated for by deeper root sparse and wetter root zones under educed surface available water arya et al 1975 nnyamah and black 1977 jarvis 1989 goldstein et al 2008 shouse et al 2011 albasha et al 2015 andre peters 2016 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 this mechanism is considered as a water redistribution phenomenon caused by the uneven distribution of the soil water potential couvreur et al 2012 javaux et al 2013 especially for natural shrubs this compensation dose could allow for adaptations in the absorbing pattern to water stress as shown in our study for salix the minimum energy expenditure principle is that plants seek to minimize the total energy expenditure during water uptake adiku et al 2000 in a homogenous wet soil profile rwu mainly occurs in the biggest root density zone in which this principle is not really suitable however once the soil profile dries out this principle plays a critical role in rwu as shown in fig 5 there is a soil water defect zone from 120 cm to 270 cm indicating that salix requires less energy to absorb soil water in the middle soil layers but more energy to absorb deep groundwater hydraulic redistribution is a passive movement of water via plant roots from relatively moist soil layers to drier soil layers amenu and kumar 2008 richards and caldwell 1987 nadezhdina et al 2010 it is one of the adaptive strategies of vegetation particularly in water limited ecosystems to optimally use resources available throughout the soil column amenu and kumar 2008 there is mounting evidence that hydraulic redistribution frequently occurs in shrubs mooney et al 1980 yoder and nowak 1999 the quantity of hydraulic redistributed water depends directly on the depth to which roots penetrate the soil thereby enhancing tremendously the contribution of deep roots to the water uptake by plants the uneven distribution of water potential in the thicker unsaturated zone in case 2 might arouse hydraulic redistribution although the lack of sufficient deep soil water cannot drive this process in case 1 the plant s root system is fundamental in determining the water use strategy of desert shrubs and the physiological responses of the shifting main water uptake layer at different stages xu and li 2006 zhao et al 2018 therefore the dynamics of rooting front is critical dardanelli et al 2004 for perennial plants the root system undergoes a continuous growth process and its depth and morphology vary greatly in not only among species but also among individuals of the same species schneider et al 2010 which is affected by the soil texture moisture in the vadose zone groundwater level etc vividly case 1 represents one field scenario in which there is a thin layer of wind blown sand with a shallower weak permeable unweathered quartz based as shown in fig 6 the rooting front is restricted because of a water proof layer and thus cannot search for deep soil water resulting in limited eta intensity case 2 represents another field scenario in which the vadose zone is thicker and the rooting front increases constantly with the deepest position close to 3 5 m the tracking water characteristic of the rooting front facilitates the eta intensity in case 2 being higher than that in case 1 especially when salix experience soil water deficits it appears to be a water conservation mechanism for the plants when deep roots are present similar results were proposed by li et al 2011 and liu et al 2011 which considered that the main water uptake layer gradually increased with the roots system extension during the whole growth stage on the contrary some studies confirmed that the depth of roots system may not be a reliable indicator of actual rwu processes but roots activity in soil areas where moisture is available ehleringer and dawson 1992 dawson and pate 1996 moreira et al 2000 predictably rwu of salix is under multiple influences including the soil moisture in the vadose zone water table depth rainfall and potential atmospheric demand it should be understood before establishing a rwu model especially for xerophytic vegetation dependent on groundwater in arid and semi arid areas rwu is just not directly proportional to amount of the roots but also depends on the ambient water content this sound analysis provides great insights on the behavior of rwu and clearly reveals that although it may be easy for a model to match the measured data for single soil water source of plant building a numerical model that comprehensively considers different water sources is still an important issue additionally the static treatment of the root system and a lack of consideration of biophysical factors in the model are unrealistic 5 3 water stress and soil water consumption there is a great deal of variation within shrubs with regards to seasonal water stress as illustrated in fig 7 water stress in case 1 is less than that in case 2 in the sprout stage indicating that access to groundwater can prevent the water stress the opposite is true in the growing stage due to the shortage of soil water and lack of groundwater availability in case 1 while groundwater is absorbed by the extended roots system in case 2 at the harvest stage water stress is relieved in both cases by significant increases in rainfall indicating that the replenishment soil water by rainfall is particularly important during persistent drought notably water stress in case 1 is still more serious than that in case 2 at the harvest stage indicating that the high percentage utilization of shallow soil water derived from rainfall could not be maintained by salix and groundwater is also needed as a supplement to alleviate water stress this finding is consistent with the results reported by naumburg et al 2005 zhu et al 2009 yin et al 2015 the contribution of each soil layer water for shrubs use changed over the growth stages and it is associated with the variations in water requirements at stages our observed results indicate that both soil water and groundwater serve as important water resources for salix but this does not mean that salix utilizes soil water and groundwater equally especially in different growth stages salix tended to uptake soil water in unsaturated zone water during the sprout and withered period in which the water demand is small as salix entered the growing and harvest stage the main water source switches to be dependable deeper soil water and groundwater in some situations the groundwater contribution amounts to more than 50 loheide et al 2005 lamontagne et al 2005 miller et al 2010 yin et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 and will increase with aridity evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 rainfall as the main input source changes the composition of the water source thus small rainfall events recharge shallow soil water and heavy rainfall events recharge deep soil water while rainstorms or successive heavy rain events happen in the rainy season might recharge groundwater song et al 2011 wu et al 2014 however in our cases rainfall infiltration is intercepted in the soil water deficit zone and salix responded rapidly by taking up more rainfall driven soil water resulting in the absence of groundwater recharge 5 4 exploring the ecological effects of salix in semiarid regions a balance between soil water supply and water use by plants is crucial for maintaining the sustainability of ecosystem in semiarid region cao et al 2018 the introduction of unsuitable plant species and improper management strategies i e high density planting that had intensified deep soil water depletion in the region causing imbalanced water budget jia et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2010 2012 the average water yields have dropped by 50 in the semiarid loess plateau due to water consumption by plants sun et al 2006 proper tree species selection may lower the water use rates to acceptable levels kunert et al 2010 thus future afforestation should consider optimal shrub species that use less water based on soil water resource conditions for guidance in vegetation recovery operations jia et al 2015 2017 the key goal for studying the water use of salix is to provide reasonable water management strategies our observed results imply that salix plays a role as a water pump and consumes more deep soil moisture inducing soil desiccation and dry soil layer formation the decline in soil water induced soil desiccation that in turn limits tree growth or even induced degeneration of vegetation therefore it is worth considering the vegetation selection under different stratigraphic conditions and water table depths considered both reducing the consumption of groundwater and stabilization of sands it appears efficient and practical to plant xerophytic salix on sand dunes using natural rainfall meanwhile our observation results combined with field investigation imply that salix shrubs should be kept spaced at a distance of approximately more than 3 times the canopy to make as much rain as available to the deep soil these guidelines will be verified in our next work moreover the inter species of salix can be planted appropriately with xeric artemisia which is an opportunistic apecies that utilizes the short term availability of water in the upper soil layers 6 conclusion in this work a contrastive experiment with salix being planted at two water table depths were implemented in the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum in the mu us sandy land of china analyses were performed using observed data to provide insights into the water use of salix over a complete growth stage our findings gave rise to the following conclusions in arid and semi arid desert areas water use of salix is the main contribution to eta no less than 80 in the whole growth period of 2016 the rainfall was 356 3 mm for salix with a thin habitat and a shallow water table depth eta was 462 75 mm soil water and groundwater contribution were 89 6 and 10 4 respectively rainfall driven soil water in the unsaturated zone was the main source for salix due to the limited root systems for salix with a thick habitat and a deeper water table depth eta was 619 70 mm soil water and groundwater contribution were 74 3 and 25 7 respectively the rooting front could be 3 5 m to utilize groundwater and groundwater contribution could be near 40 in the growing stage two water use strategies for salix preferentially taking up shallow soil water in the unsaturated zone and taking up deeper soil water and even groundwater to adjust to near surface drought through continuous downward extension of the root system and the transformation of rwu from groundwater dependence to using soil water and groundwater simultaneously driven by rainfall consequently groundwater is the main water source to maintain survival in drought period and salix responds clearly to rain pulse events and uses precipitation derived upper soil water to alleviate water stress in rainy season the findings about how and how much water is used by salix indicate water use is related to atmosphere demand soil water state water table depth and growth stage in addition rainfall infiltration was intercepted at the root zone resulting in the absence of groundwater recharge this provides the basis for groundwater management and vegetation restoration in similar areas and the planting of salix should be maintained at a certain interspecies spacing so that the rainfall can infiltrate into the deep soil or recharge the groundwater rather than being completely intercepted by the roots system this research still has shortcomings in method and scale expansion thus additional studies are required especially on two or three dimensions in watersheds of different scales to further supplement and increase the confidence in the findings future water use processes studies should be at individual plant scale and field scale and numerical simulations connected with the field experiment method are necessary to improve a better understanding of the hydrological processes under different scenarios

5112,soil water and groundwater are important water resources for vegetation survival and growth in arid and semiarid regions and their contributions to water use over a whole growth period are difficult to quantify with limited observations additionally the root water uptake rwu processes of groundwater dependent xeric vegetation are specific and aggravate the complexity of these issues in this paper salix is selected to study the interaction among atmosphere soil water groundwater and rwu from the sprout to withered stage based on an observation within the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of the atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum two lysimeters with a diameter of 2 m and depths of 1 2 m and 4 2 m were implemented with salix the initial water table depth was 0 7 m in case 1 and 2 2 m in case 2 the results show that water use of salix is the main contribution to actual evapotranspiration eta no less than 80 eta was 462 75 mm in case 1 with a shallower soil layer and limited groundwater during the entire growth period 2016 contrastively it was 619 70 mm in case 2 with relatively abundant soil water and groundwater the soil water and groundwater contribution were 89 6 and 10 4 74 3 and 25 7 for both cases the selective water use by salix in different soil layers was subject to temporal moisture availability salix extended to utilize groundwater in drought period and shifted back to wetter upper layers in case of rainfall the access to groundwater significantly alleviates water stress although rainfall replenishment can also play a part salix can not only intercept rainfall infiltration in the root zone but also cause the decrease of water level implying that the replanting of salix should be carried out in a reasonable mode to ensure rainfall infiltration and reduce the ineffective loss of groundwater our results provide a practical reference for groundwater management and ecology restoration in semiarid desert regions keywords water use salix root water uptake water table depth in situ observation semiarid regions 1 introduction soil water and groundwater are paramount water sources for the growth and transpiration of many plants in arid and semiarid regions naumburg et al 2005 gribovszki et al 2010 in dry season groundwater likely account for more than 50 of water resources miller et al 2010 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 the vegetation soil water groundwater interaction is related to the influence of groundwater recharge discharge and ecoenvironment chen et al 2014 wang et al 2011 2013 yang et al 2016 yin et al 2015 chen et al 2018 however there is still insufficient research on the water use processes of plants especially the interaction among the atmosphere vegetation soil and groundwater therefore understanding the relationship among the above factors is of great significance for improving the water and vegetation management in arid and semiarid regions beff et al 2013 seyfried et al 2005 most fundamentally soil water and groundwater have obvious effects on xeric vegetation which appears to specialize in taking up water from specific soil layers at certain times of the year cody 1986 cohen 1970 flanagan et al 1992 lin et al 1996 wu et al 2014 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 rather than taking up water wherever and whenever it becomes available numerous studies have shown that plants preferentially utilize rainfall derived soil water over groundwater because rainfall derived soil water is more readily available however most arid vegetation especially shrubs use groundwater soil water or a mixture of both chimner and cooper 2004 mclendon et al 2008 mclendon et al 2008 indicated that plants preferentially extract groundwater when the water table depth is less than 3 m xeric shrubs form deep root systems to improve water uptake in arid and semiarid environments nepstad et al 1994 it has been found that desert plants can absorb water from a depth at least 3 m and the depth may be much deeper in some cases canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 2002 dai et al 2015 deep roots may serve as a mechanism to avoid severe drought stress lubczynski 2009 miller et al 2010 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 the dynamic process of root water uptake rwu has a significant impact on hydro ecological processes there is an analogy that plants acts like a pump that can intercept or extract a large portion of rainfall derived soil water and groundwater banks et al 2011 it is critically important to understand the fraction of groundwater and soil water used by plants quantifying the proportion of groundwater and soil water contributed to plants has received wide attention zhao et al 2016 yu et al 2016 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 many studies have shown that groundwater uptake is high during the summer months when rainfall is low while is low during wet seasons zhu et al 2015 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 predictably the water use strategies of shrubs vary with water table depth which is the key in quantifying the contributions of groundwater and soil water to plants therefore exploration of seasonal water use strategies by vegetation is necessary to improve understanding of water use and water balance in xeric ecosystem however the models describing the water flow at the soil plant atmosphere interface neglect plants adaptive response to water stress it does not consider the mechanisms by which they take place schneider et al 2010 in order to simulate the soil water transport in the root zone a description of rwu in a complete growth period is prerequisite experimental investigations and techniques such as in situ lysimeter observations soil water sensors and water table transducers are essential for a better understanding of the water fluxes within the groundwater soil vegetation continuum system ludwig et al 2005 wenninger et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 2019 ma et al 2019 the lysimeter method is accurate and can be used to simultaneously measure the water balance components luo and sophocleous 2010 wang et al 2017 yu et al 2016 however several problems exist in previous lysimeter studies for example the use of lysimeters with small radius or size which will expand the boundary effect and the inclusion of crops as the primary research objects beff et al 2013 yu et al 2016 few studies have investigated natural vegetation in arid areas furthermore most studies focused on vegetation water uptake under a single meteorological condition such as continuous drought but lacked of research on vegetation under natural climatic conditions in order to explore the interaction between soil water groundwater and vegetation more comprehensively more realistic field studies are needed at the plant individual scale therefore a typical and groundwater dependent xeric vegetation that could reflect a continuum of water use strategies from germination to wilting should be chosen to address the issue in arid and semiarid regions using a multidisciplinary approach such as ecology vadose zone hydrology and hydrogeology in addition variations in atmosphere elements should also be considered when determining the unique water use and the rwu processes of trees in a semiarid environment meanwhile the balance of water resources and ecological water consumption in semiarid areas needs to be quantified in this paper the long term in situ monitoring lysimeter system of the atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum was implemented to study the relationship among soil water groundwater and the most representative natural plant salix in the wind blown sand area of the ordos basin northwest china based on the field investigation of the salix habitat two water level scenarios were set up the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 the rwu processes and water use strategies of salix in unsaturated saturated systems were explored for the two cases 2 the soil water and groundwater contribution under different growth stages were quantitatively analyzed 3 on this basis the balance between water use of salix and soil water resource protection was analyzed our study provides a reference for ecosystem replanting and groundwater management in semi arid areas 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area is in the mu us desert which is one of the largest deserts in china fig 1 a the water table depth is generally from 1 to 30 m in this region cheng et al 2012 it is a typical semiarid region where the annual average temperature is 7 7 c the average annual rainfall is 315 2 mm the average annual potential evapotranspiration is 2100 5 mm and the aridity index is 2 9 8 0 huo et al 2013 rainfall events mainly occur from july to september which account for more than 70 of the annual total rainfall before the 1990 s the landscape was mainly mobile and semifixed dunes and vegetation was scarce after the 1990 s the government called for returning farmland to forest and prohibiting grassland and grazing to improve the ecological environment the ecological environment has been greatly improved vegetation was more luxuriant than it was before the 1990 s and the dunes were also fixed since most of the vegetation depends on groundwater a large amount of vegetation restoration leads to a continuous decline in the water table moreover high ecological risk still exists the dominant species in the study area are salix artemisia aragana and caragana koragana salix is a perennial shrub species and grows in the interhill area between dunes or on dunes the wind blown sand thickness of the salix habitat is sometimes very thin with an unweathered quartz based about 1 m underground and sometimes the thickness is several meters fig 1b the appropriate water table depth of salix growth is approximately 0 5 5 m wang et al 2013 and its vegetation coverage accounts for more than 70 of the surface ecosystem within this depth range yang 2004 based on years of field investigation the gradient of the water level is relatively flat in the study area and groundwater recharge from lateral flow is low furthermore the growth characteristics of salix were determined in the sprout stage from may to mid june the growing stage from mid june to late july the harvest stage in august and the withered stage from september to october moreover the dormant period of salix and the frozen period is from november to april of the following year during this period rainfall and water use are almost zero wang et al 2004 2 2 in situ experiment setup the in situ experiment was conducted at the national weather station of henan county inner mongolia china fig 1c and two lysimeters were implemented at the observation site fig 1d the meteorological station records the net radiation air temperature pressure rainfall relative humidity wind speed and direction based on field survey of the site conditions of salix two bottom and wall sealed lysimeters were set to study the vertical exchange of rainfall soil water groundwater and rwu without considering the influence of lateral flow one lysimeter 200 cm in diameter and 120 cm in depth with an initial water table depth of approximately 70 cm was case1 another lysimeter 200 cm in diameter and 420 cm in depth with an initial water table depth of approximately 220 cm was case2 the lysimeters were filled with local natural homogeneous wind blown sand the material parameters were obtained in the laboratory and are shown in table 1 two similar sized salix seedlings were planted in both lysimeters in 2015 with different initial water table depths approximately 70 cm for case 1 and 220 cm for case 2 the soil moisture content was measured by ech2o 5 tm decagon inc 1 2 sensors at depths of 3 10 20 30 50 and 80 cm for case 1 and 3 10 20 30 50 80 100 150 250 350 and 400 cm for case 2 fig 2 the water table was monitored by di 501 diver inc 0 05 and corrected by a di 500 baro diver 0 1 fig 2 all data were automatically recorded via a data logger decagon devices inc usa 2 3 relative evapotranspiration eta etp the simplified water balance approach hupet et al 2002 was applied to quantitatively calculate actual evapotranspiration eta the following equation provides a framework in which the fundamental relationships among rainfall inputs change in soil water storage and eta in the lysimeter are determined 1 et a p i where p lt 1 is rainfall eta lt 1 is actual evapotranspiration including transpiration from the plant and evaporation from the soil surface and i is the soil water storage variation in the lysimeter including soil water in the unsaturated zone and groundwater in the saturated zone which can be calculated by eq 2 2 i 0 z sw ti sw ti 1 where 0 is the surface of the soil z is the thickness of soil layer in the lysimeter swti and swti 1 are the soil water contents at ti and ti 1 times respectively the vertical soil water content at any given depth within a 20 mm interval is determined through interpolation between neighboring observed data using the kriging method yu et al 2018 etp reflects the potential capabilities of plant transpiration and soil evaporation and it is obtained by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 by an appropriate crop coefficient tang 2007 mirck and volk 2010 the penman monteith equation p m is used to calculate et0 the fao p m equation is defined as follows allen et al 1998 3 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 m height above the ground c u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 m height m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δis the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 eta reflects the actual water transport ability depending on the climate soil water in unsaturated zone and water table depth and it is usually less than etp in semiarid regions the relative evapotranspiration is the ratio between eta and etp it expresses the degree to which a certain plant can suit the soil water stress and four levels of water scarcity are determined 1 0 0 8 means that the water supply to the plants is continuous and not limited 0 8 0 5 signifies that the water demand is still continuous but it is getting increasingly restricted 0 5 0 3 means that water scarcity is high and the water supply to the plants is restricting and water stress is developing 0 3 signifies that strong water stress occurs causing considerable the death of the plant when this stage lasts long petrassovits 1990 2 4 evaporation estimation soil evaporation is appropriate to estimate water flux by darcy s law downward positive 4 q d θ θ z k θ where θ is soil water content z denotes the vertical depth k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and d θ is the moisture diffusivity evaporation from the profile occurs only above the zero flux plane which is no more than 30 cm depth ma et al 2019 chen et al 2018 therefore the measured soil moisture content above 30 cm in the shallow layer is used to calculate the evaporation from beneath a canopy detailed parameter values and calculation procedures can be found in the researches published by zhang et al 2018 and chen et al 2018 3 calculation of the soil water and groundwater contributions the groundwater contribution is the water amount decrease in the saturated area which can be calculated by eq 5 δ g wtd z θ s sw ti 1 5 where δ g is the groundwater volume variation lt 1 wtd is the water table depth l z is the thickness the lysimeter and θ s is the saturated soil water content the soil water contribution is the total soil water storage variation minus the groundwater contribution 3 1 estimation of the rooting front the rooting front represents the maximum root depth which can be estimated by identifying the position where the observed soil profile moisture content had an abrupt decrease mcgowan 1974 in this study the rooting front was identified as the deepest spot where soil moisture content decreased abruptly based on the results of interpolation for measured soil profile water content 3 2 data sources the weather datum used cover all of 2016 the soil water moisture and water table fluctuations in the lysimeters were recorded from late april to early november whereas the frozen period from november to april was not analyzed in this paper the meteorological data were on an hourly scale and the soil water moisture and water table fluctuation data were on a 5 minutes scale the data can meet the needs of analysis for the interactions among the atmosphere vegetation soil water and groundwater during different growth stages 4 results 4 1 characteristics of the main meteorology variables during the observed period the variability in the observed rainfall daily air temperature and etp for the trial site in 2016 is shown in fig 3 rainfall varied dramatically throughout the year with an annual rainfall of 343 5 mm the rainfall amount from may to october accounted for 94 of the annual total rainfall amount individual rainfall events ranged from 0 1 to 58 mm among which light rain 0 1 9 9 mm d accounted for 81 7 of all rainy days moderate rain 10 24 9 mm d accounted for 15 0 heavy rain 25 49 9 mm d accounted for 1 7 and rainstorms 50 mm d accounted for 1 6 the annual average temperature was 2 5 c the daily average temperature ranged from a minimum of 20 1 c in january to a maximum of 28 3 c in july the average daily temperature in june july and august was above 20 c and it was less than 0 c most of the time from november to april during which the soil moisture was frozen the annual fluctuation in etp was roughly the same as that of the daily temperature and presented obvious seasonal differences etp was less than 2 mm in winter and gradually increased in spring then etp was maintained at a high level approximately 15 mm d in summer after autumn etp gradually decreased to less than 2 mm in particular etp fluctuated significantly from may to july due to heavy rainfall events the cumulative etp was approximately 2109 mm which was more than six times the cumulative rainfall see the embedded figure in fig 3 4 2 variability in water table depth fig 4 shows the water table fluctuations in both cases throughout the entire salix growth period which can be divided into four stages the first stage was from late april to mid june the second stage was from mid june to early august the third stage was from early august to early october and the fourth stage was after early october nonetheless the water table depth variation trend of the two cases were significantly different in the four stages in case 1 the water table depth varied from 72 6 cm depth to 120 cm depth in the first stage in which the depth rose twice due to rainfall after the second stage the groundwater in the lysimeter was exhausted in case 2 the water table depth varied from 226 2 cm initially to 352 0 cm finally during the whole growth stage the water table rose slightly in the first stage dropped at a rate of about 1 05 mm day in the second stage continued to decline at a rate of about 0 83 mm day in the third stage and had a very slight drop to 352 0 cm in the fourth stage 4 3 temporal and spatial variations in soil moisture the spatial variation in the measured soil water content in the soil profile for the two cases is shown in fig 5 the distribution of the soil water content shows obvious zonality and it can be divided into three zones from the ground surface to the bottom of the lysimeter according to its magnitude which are the soil water defect zone the soil water gradation zone and the saturated zone respectively the soil water defect zone is located at the surface and certain depth below and its soil water content is less than 0 1 cm3 cm3 which is mainly affected by the atmospheric conditions and shallow hairy roots the soil water gradation zone is located from the water defect zone to the water table the soil water content in this zone gradually changes from 0 1 cm3 cm3 to a saturated moisture content and is jointly controlled by the atmospheric conditions rate of rwu and water table fluctuation the saturated zone is below the water table and its variation is dominated by water table fluctuations the spatial features of zonality in both cases are conspicuously different mainly manifesting as follows the thickness of the soil water defect zone is less than 60 cm in depth in case 1 which is smaller than that in case 2 with a maximum depth of 270 cm due to the difference in the initial water table the soil water gradation zone in case 1 is thinner than that in case 2 the saturated zone in case 2 is deeper and its thickness is larger than that in case 1 the temporal characteristics of zonality in both cases are also significant although the thickness of the soil water defect zone continuously stretches to deeper soil layers under continuous drought the thickness becomes thin again resulting from the soil water being replenished by rainfall except for the soil water defect zone found in the shallow soil layers it is worth noting that the soil water defect zone appeared at 120 cm in late september and extended downward over time finally reaching a maximum depth of 270 cm in case 2 for the soil water gradation zone the two cases present a similar step down trend the saturated zone gradually decreases until it disappears in mid june incase 1 while it exists all the time and maintains a variation trend that is consistent with the water table fluctuation in case 2 4 4 eta and the rooting front fig 6 shows the calculated average 15 day eta intensity and rooting front of salix in both cases the eta intensity in case 1 was less than 2 mm d in early may and reached a maximum of 5 14 mm d in late august the eta intensity was suddenly reduced to less than 2 mm d from september to october in case 2 the variation trend of eta intensity was similar to that in case 1 but there were still obvious differences as reflected in the following three aspects 1 the eta intensity was less than that of case 1 before mid july 2 the eta intensity increased rapidly and became larger than that of case 1 after mid july reaching the maximum intensity of 6 8 mm d in late august and 3 the eta intensity gradually decreased from september to october and was almost twice the level of case 1 in case 1 the rooting front was 75 cm in the sprout stage and stretched to 120 cm in the early june after then the root growth is restricted by the depth of the lysimeter in case 2 the rooting front was at just 1 2 m in the sprout stage and developed downwards rapidly to over 220 cm in the early june the rooting front further stretched to 275 cm in late july reached a maximum depth of 3 48 m after october obviously salix is the typical deep root system plant an increasing depth of the rooting front improved the availability of water for salix thereby causing the increase in eta 4 5 the relative evapotranspiration for salix the relative evapotranspiration for both cases and rainfall on the half month scale are plotted in fig 7 the relative evapotranspiration was always less than 1 and differed in each period indicating that eta was constrained by water stress throughout the entire growth stage specifically in both cases salix was under severe water stress from may to mid july then the relative evapotranspiration increased after mid july and peaked in august because the rainfall effectively replenished the soil water and largely alleviated the water stress therefore salix was under moderate stress in case 1 and mild stress in case 2 salix was under severe water stress again in case 1 while moderate water stress in case 2 from september to october in addition there were still obvious differences in both cases as follows 1 the relative evapotranspiration in case 1 was roughly higher than that of case 2 before mid july and 2 the peak values of the relative evapotranspiration in case 1 and case 2 were 0 68 and 0 92 respectively due to contribution by groundwater 4 6 contributions of groundwater and soil water the soil water storage total eta soil water and the groundwater contribution at different salix growth stages are summarized in table 2 the decrease of soil water storage in case 1 was 104 45 mm during the whole growing period conversely for a total decrease in mean storage of 263 4 mm for case 2 the total eta was 462 75 mm in case 1 and 619 70 mm in case 2 which was 1 36 times and 1 82 times than the rainfall respectively in case 1 eta was the lowest 38 83 mm in the withered stage but the hightest 183 42 mm in the harvest stage in case 2 eta was the lowest 75 15 mm in the sprout stage but the hightest 334 31 mm in the harvest stage sw eta was 89 6 and 74 3 and g eta was 10 4 and 25 7 for both cases respectively in case 1 sw eta was 97 65 and g eta was only 2 35 in the sprout stage indicating that salix mainly utilizes soil water g eta increased to 22 6 in the growing stage salix could only depend on soil water to sustain growth from the harvest stage to the withered stage because the groundwater was exhausted in case 2 sw eta was 100 in the sprout stage indicating that salix depended on only soil water subsequently the g eta reached 11 65 in the growing stage and peaked at 38 31 in the harvest stage in the withered stage g eta decreased to 29 79 indicating that the soil water contribution increased again in this stage 5 discussion 5 1 soil evaporation beneath a canopy the loss of water is caused by both transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from underlying soil of which soil evaporation is in constant interaction with the atmosphere and the interior of the soil and is primarily controlled by the demand and supply of water soil evaporation beneath salix canopy are shown in table 2 the amount of evaporation beneath the canopy does not exceed 10 of eta case 1 during the whole growth stage and the proportion is even smaller when the water table depth is deeper case 2 soil evaporation varied among seasons evaporation during germination and wilting was greater than that during growing and harvest stage because the canopy and leaf area is relatively small in these two stages even so the evaporation in these two stages accounts for less than 20 of the eta which means that soil water loss is mainly caused by rwu the evaporation of bare soil under similar conditions would not exceed 45 of the evapotranspiration zhang et al 2018 and it can be inferred that soil evaporation from beneath a canopy should be lower than that over bare soil this interpretation is supported by observations and only 5 7 of annual evapotranspiration comes from soil evaporation black et al 1996 miralles et al 2011 furthermore soil evaporation is mainly the water flux above the zero flux plane around 30 cm ma et al 2019 chen et al 2018 nevertheless the soil water is consumed intensively by rwu in whole growth stage leading to high water stress to some extent it cuts off the supply of water that travels up to evaporate therefore we attribute the observed changes in soil profile moisture content to the rwu strategy 5 2 rwu processes of salix in the whole growth stage the observed data indicate that the water use varies significantly between individuals in different habitats and specific growth stages in case 1 salix not only utilized soil water in the vadose zone in the sprout stage but also directly absorbed groundwater resulting in the decrease of water level see fig 4 and expansion of the soil water defect zone stretching to 40 cm underground fig 5 in the growing stage salix could only rely on the soil water in the vadose zone due to the disappearance of groundwater resulting in the soil water defect zone continuing to expand stretching to 60 cm underground in the harvest stage with the frequency and intensity of rainfall increasing the water deficit zone was replenished by rainfall and the rainfall derived soil water was absorbed by roots system in the withered stage salix was maintained by soil moisture in the vadose zone in case 2 the water table depth was deeper than the root depth in the sprout stage and salix only depended on the soil moisture in the vadose zone in the growing stage salix began to utilize groundwater driven by potential atmospheric demand causing a sudden drop in the water level see fig 4 in the harvest stage due to the input of rainfall water use of salix had been transformed from mainly using groundwater to simultaneously utilizing groundwater and rainfall derived soil water resulting in that the rate of water level decline at this stage was slowed down as shown in fig 4 it is consistent with the conceptual model developed by ehleringer and dawson 1992 following large rain events water utilization shifts from shallow soil layers to deep soil layers again yang et al 2015 in the withered stage with the water use of salix significantly reducing an interesting phenomenon occurred in which the water defect zone occurred in the middle position 120 cm 270 cm underground of soil layer see fig 5 case 2 indicating that salix absorbed deep soil water rather than groundwater plants mainly absorb shallow soil water when the upper soil water is abundant but deep soil water and groundwater when the upper soil water was depleted the selective use of soil water and groundwater is adjusted in a timely manner and is a species specific phenomenon as revealed by dardanelli et al 2004 and shah et al 2008 uptake is not uniform at all of the depths the rwu strategies of salix can be summarized as follows based on observations 1 salix adapts to shallow soil water stress through root growth to utilize deep soil water and groundwater and this transformation occurs on a seasonal scale or at different growth stages and 2 salix adjusts its uptake zone to adapt to the changing environment rainfall infiltration water deficit in local soil layers on smaller time scales within a day or few days which is a probable trade off between the activity of shallow and deep roots without altering the root system plant water use strategies are considered to be a function of the complex interactions between the species and the prevailing environmental conditions and it implied three biophysical mechanism compensation rwu minimum energy expenditure principle and hydraulic redistribution compensation rwu is important for water use and it represents a process in which transpiration can be compensated for by deeper root sparse and wetter root zones under educed surface available water arya et al 1975 nnyamah and black 1977 jarvis 1989 goldstein et al 2008 shouse et al 2011 albasha et al 2015 andre peters 2016 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 this mechanism is considered as a water redistribution phenomenon caused by the uneven distribution of the soil water potential couvreur et al 2012 javaux et al 2013 especially for natural shrubs this compensation dose could allow for adaptations in the absorbing pattern to water stress as shown in our study for salix the minimum energy expenditure principle is that plants seek to minimize the total energy expenditure during water uptake adiku et al 2000 in a homogenous wet soil profile rwu mainly occurs in the biggest root density zone in which this principle is not really suitable however once the soil profile dries out this principle plays a critical role in rwu as shown in fig 5 there is a soil water defect zone from 120 cm to 270 cm indicating that salix requires less energy to absorb soil water in the middle soil layers but more energy to absorb deep groundwater hydraulic redistribution is a passive movement of water via plant roots from relatively moist soil layers to drier soil layers amenu and kumar 2008 richards and caldwell 1987 nadezhdina et al 2010 it is one of the adaptive strategies of vegetation particularly in water limited ecosystems to optimally use resources available throughout the soil column amenu and kumar 2008 there is mounting evidence that hydraulic redistribution frequently occurs in shrubs mooney et al 1980 yoder and nowak 1999 the quantity of hydraulic redistributed water depends directly on the depth to which roots penetrate the soil thereby enhancing tremendously the contribution of deep roots to the water uptake by plants the uneven distribution of water potential in the thicker unsaturated zone in case 2 might arouse hydraulic redistribution although the lack of sufficient deep soil water cannot drive this process in case 1 the plant s root system is fundamental in determining the water use strategy of desert shrubs and the physiological responses of the shifting main water uptake layer at different stages xu and li 2006 zhao et al 2018 therefore the dynamics of rooting front is critical dardanelli et al 2004 for perennial plants the root system undergoes a continuous growth process and its depth and morphology vary greatly in not only among species but also among individuals of the same species schneider et al 2010 which is affected by the soil texture moisture in the vadose zone groundwater level etc vividly case 1 represents one field scenario in which there is a thin layer of wind blown sand with a shallower weak permeable unweathered quartz based as shown in fig 6 the rooting front is restricted because of a water proof layer and thus cannot search for deep soil water resulting in limited eta intensity case 2 represents another field scenario in which the vadose zone is thicker and the rooting front increases constantly with the deepest position close to 3 5 m the tracking water characteristic of the rooting front facilitates the eta intensity in case 2 being higher than that in case 1 especially when salix experience soil water deficits it appears to be a water conservation mechanism for the plants when deep roots are present similar results were proposed by li et al 2011 and liu et al 2011 which considered that the main water uptake layer gradually increased with the roots system extension during the whole growth stage on the contrary some studies confirmed that the depth of roots system may not be a reliable indicator of actual rwu processes but roots activity in soil areas where moisture is available ehleringer and dawson 1992 dawson and pate 1996 moreira et al 2000 predictably rwu of salix is under multiple influences including the soil moisture in the vadose zone water table depth rainfall and potential atmospheric demand it should be understood before establishing a rwu model especially for xerophytic vegetation dependent on groundwater in arid and semi arid areas rwu is just not directly proportional to amount of the roots but also depends on the ambient water content this sound analysis provides great insights on the behavior of rwu and clearly reveals that although it may be easy for a model to match the measured data for single soil water source of plant building a numerical model that comprehensively considers different water sources is still an important issue additionally the static treatment of the root system and a lack of consideration of biophysical factors in the model are unrealistic 5 3 water stress and soil water consumption there is a great deal of variation within shrubs with regards to seasonal water stress as illustrated in fig 7 water stress in case 1 is less than that in case 2 in the sprout stage indicating that access to groundwater can prevent the water stress the opposite is true in the growing stage due to the shortage of soil water and lack of groundwater availability in case 1 while groundwater is absorbed by the extended roots system in case 2 at the harvest stage water stress is relieved in both cases by significant increases in rainfall indicating that the replenishment soil water by rainfall is particularly important during persistent drought notably water stress in case 1 is still more serious than that in case 2 at the harvest stage indicating that the high percentage utilization of shallow soil water derived from rainfall could not be maintained by salix and groundwater is also needed as a supplement to alleviate water stress this finding is consistent with the results reported by naumburg et al 2005 zhu et al 2009 yin et al 2015 the contribution of each soil layer water for shrubs use changed over the growth stages and it is associated with the variations in water requirements at stages our observed results indicate that both soil water and groundwater serve as important water resources for salix but this does not mean that salix utilizes soil water and groundwater equally especially in different growth stages salix tended to uptake soil water in unsaturated zone water during the sprout and withered period in which the water demand is small as salix entered the growing and harvest stage the main water source switches to be dependable deeper soil water and groundwater in some situations the groundwater contribution amounts to more than 50 loheide et al 2005 lamontagne et al 2005 miller et al 2010 yin et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 and will increase with aridity evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 rainfall as the main input source changes the composition of the water source thus small rainfall events recharge shallow soil water and heavy rainfall events recharge deep soil water while rainstorms or successive heavy rain events happen in the rainy season might recharge groundwater song et al 2011 wu et al 2014 however in our cases rainfall infiltration is intercepted in the soil water deficit zone and salix responded rapidly by taking up more rainfall driven soil water resulting in the absence of groundwater recharge 5 4 exploring the ecological effects of salix in semiarid regions a balance between soil water supply and water use by plants is crucial for maintaining the sustainability of ecosystem in semiarid region cao et al 2018 the introduction of unsuitable plant species and improper management strategies i e high density planting that had intensified deep soil water depletion in the region causing imbalanced water budget jia et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2010 2012 the average water yields have dropped by 50 in the semiarid loess plateau due to water consumption by plants sun et al 2006 proper tree species selection may lower the water use rates to acceptable levels kunert et al 2010 thus future afforestation should consider optimal shrub species that use less water based on soil water resource conditions for guidance in vegetation recovery operations jia et al 2015 2017 the key goal for studying the water use of salix is to provide reasonable water management strategies our observed results imply that salix plays a role as a water pump and consumes more deep soil moisture inducing soil desiccation and dry soil layer formation the decline in soil water induced soil desiccation that in turn limits tree growth or even induced degeneration of vegetation therefore it is worth considering the vegetation selection under different stratigraphic conditions and water table depths considered both reducing the consumption of groundwater and stabilization of sands it appears efficient and practical to plant xerophytic salix on sand dunes using natural rainfall meanwhile our observation results combined with field investigation imply that salix shrubs should be kept spaced at a distance of approximately more than 3 times the canopy to make as much rain as available to the deep soil these guidelines will be verified in our next work moreover the inter species of salix can be planted appropriately with xeric artemisia which is an opportunistic apecies that utilizes the short term availability of water in the upper soil layers 6 conclusion in this work a contrastive experiment with salix being planted at two water table depths were implemented in the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum in the mu us sandy land of china analyses were performed using observed data to provide insights into the water use of salix over a complete growth stage our findings gave rise to the following conclusions in arid and semi arid desert areas water use of salix is the main contribution to eta no less than 80 in the whole growth period of 2016 the rainfall was 356 3 mm for salix with a thin habitat and a shallow water table depth eta was 462 75 mm soil water and groundwater contribution were 89 6 and 10 4 respectively rainfall driven soil water in the unsaturated zone was the main source for salix due to the limited root systems for salix with a thick habitat and a deeper water table depth eta was 619 70 mm soil water and groundwater contribution were 74 3 and 25 7 respectively the rooting front could be 3 5 m to utilize groundwater and groundwater contribution could be near 40 in the growing stage two water use strategies for salix preferentially taking up shallow soil water in the unsaturated zone and taking up deeper soil water and even groundwater to adjust to near surface drought through continuous downward extension of the root system and the transformation of rwu from groundwater dependence to using soil water and groundwater simultaneously driven by rainfall consequently groundwater is the main water source to maintain survival in drought period and salix responds clearly to rain pulse events and uses precipitation derived upper soil water to alleviate water stress in rainy season the findings about how and how much water is used by salix indicate water use is related to atmosphere demand soil water state water table depth and growth stage in addition rainfall infiltration was intercepted at the root zone resulting in the absence of groundwater recharge this provides the basis for groundwater management and vegetation restoration in similar areas and the planting of salix should be maintained at a certain interspecies spacing so that the rainfall can infiltrate into the deep soil or recharge the groundwater rather than being completely intercepted by the roots system this research still has shortcomings in method and scale expansion thus additional studies are required especially on two or three dimensions in watersheds of different scales to further supplement and increase the confidence in the findings future water use processes studies should be at individual plant scale and field scale and numerical simulations connected with the field experiment method are necessary to improve a better understanding of the hydrological processes under different scenarios

assistance of wei hu associate editor sediment transport capacity tc is the equilibrium sediment transport value under steady state flow and channel conditions given the difficulties in controlling hydrologic parameters close to steady state in the field most previous studies measured transport capacity in the laboratory on either non erodible beds or erodible beds without drainage however infiltration under drainage conditions and exfiltration under seepage conditions cannot be ignored in the real world and their impacts on soil strength and water discharge may affect transport capacity the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on rill sediment transport capacity and the observations are discussed under both detachment limited and transport limited conditions series of experiments were carried out with a relatively uniform sand using three water discharges on a 4 56 slope flume with four rills from 0 5 to 3 0 m long under four subsurface hydrologic conditions varying from free drainage to 10 cm seepage head the determination of equilibrium sediment transport capacity was based on the spatial change of sediment transport as slope lengths increased and the elevation change of the erodible surface in rills results from 107 runs indicated that there was only one equilibrium sediment transport value for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition given similar observations were obtained under detachment limited and transport limited conditions for the studied sand observed critical shear stress decreased around 20 from the drainage to the saturation condition and decreased slightly from the saturation to the seepage condition measured transport capacity increased 13 to 15 from drainage to seepage conditions for the studied water discharges which was the result of decreased soil strength and increased water discharge the differences in transport capacities between drainage and saturation increased as water discharge increased but the differences between saturation and seepage were relatively stable for all studied water discharges keywords subsurface hydrology sediment transport capacity rill flow equilibrium condition 1 introduction 1 1 the importance of estimating sediment transport capacity tc as a serious world wide environmental problem soil erosion and sediment leaving a hillslope affect the management of conservation practices estimation of water pollution and the rates of fertilizer application when modeling soil erosion for a given hillslope the erosion process contains three main subprocesses including sediment detachment sediment transport and sediment deposition and these three are highly correlated with each other the sediment detachment transport coupling concept is widely used to combine the three subprocesses in various soil erosion models flanagan et al 2001 morgan et al 1998 de roo et al 1996 smith et al 1995 using this concept the detachment estimation and the net deposition determination are based on the comparison between sediment load and sediment transport capacity as the key factor in the sediment detachment transport concept the definition of sediment transport capacity in this study is the equilibrium sediment concentration approached at an infinite downslope distance given that hydraulic conditions water discharge channel shape roughness water depth slope etc do not change polyakov and nearing 2003 however the implicit assumption of a unique sediment transport capacity in the detachment transport coupling concept has been under discussion huang et al 1996 the examination of transport capacity is also the validation of the sediment detachment transport coupling concept and then the soil erosion models based on this concept 1 2 challenges of the sediment detachment transport coupling concept given the definition of sediment transport capacity which is the equilibrium sediment transport for a given hydrologic condition the difficulties are substantial to control all related hydrologic parameters and to measure transport capacity in the field hence estimates of sediment transport capacity were made in the laboratory for almost all previous studies two traditional methods have been broadly used to measure transport capacity under either sediment detachment limited conditions or transport limited conditions for observations under detachment limited conditions a long enough erodible bed was used with clear water introduced from the top of the flume govers 1990 measured sediment transport capacities for five well sorted quartz materials under 1 to 12 degrees slope gradients on a 6 m long flume and the experiments showed that a 3 m effective length yielded comparable results therefore the flume was required to be at least 3 m long and the main process on the soil surface was sediment detachment the main hypothesis was that sediment transport would reach equilibrium capacity after flowing 3 m down the flume when measuring transport capacity under transport limited conditions both erodible and non erodible beds can be used non erodible beds need to have experimental sediment particles glued to the bed surface in order to simulate similar roughness as a natural erodible surface very muddy flows were introduced at the top of the flume with sediment loads greater than transport capacity and obvious net deposition was visible in the top area of the flume the observed sediment transport at the end of the flume was assumed to reach transport capacity when no noticeable deposition was visible at the bottom area of the flume given very limited sediment detachment on non erodible beds which was due mainly to the re detachment of deposited particles the observations on non erodible beds were of concern as we know both sediment detachment and deposition processes can include particle size selectivity malam issa et al 2006 for experiments on non erodible beds the dominant process of larger particles depositing without re entrainment of finer particles may cause sediment transport less than the capacity at the end of the flume therefore some non erodible bed studies included a small erodible soil box embedded in the flume near the outlet with the same width as the bed which introduced some detachment in order to make sure that the sediment transport reached capacity at the end of the flume zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 the comparison of observed sediment transport capacities under detachment limited and transport limited conditions facilitates examination of the uniqueness of transport capacity which is the assumption in the sediment detachment transport coupling concept polyakov and nearing 2003 compared equilibrium sediment concentrations of a carmi loam using the two traditional methods on an 8 m long flume and found the measurements under transport limited conditions were about two times more than the values under detachment limited conditions different measured values were also observed in the study of huang et al 1996 and they agreed that sediment detachment and sediment transport are separate processes and the sediment delivery is limited to the lesser of the detachment limitation and the transport limitation however the use of natural soils in these previous studies complicated the erosion processes on the flumes with the impacts of sediment size selectivity and the influence of aggregate breakdown cannot be ignored which was caused by the rapid wetting of soils when adding sediment at the top of the flumes therefore testing of unique sediment transport capacity needs further examination 1 3 effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport given the difficulties to control uniform subsurface hydrologic conditions in the experiments most previous studies obtained transport capacities under the no drainage condition yalin 1963 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 which means there were no holes drilled for infiltration at the bottom of the flume and the soil or sand body was saturated before each experiment however the subsurface hydrologic condition does influence the sediment transport especially for saturation and seepage conditions where the buoyancy on soil particles against gravity decreases the energy cost for the incipient motion saturation condition in this study means the water table level is exactly the same as the erodible surface seepage is the condition of saturation with positive pore water pressure and an exfiltration gradient huang and laflen 1996 the impacts of a seepage condition include exfiltration causing increased water discharge and buoyancy causing reduction of the required tractive force and energy for soil detachment the effects of the three kinds of subsurface hydrologic conditions are different drainage saturation and seepage the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions have been studied on different soils but the results do not all agree with each other stolte et al 1990 investigated the impacts of seepage on soil erosion on a loam and a sand and their results showed that the return flow rates which were caused by the exfiltration produced insignificant effects for the loam soil erosion but very dramatic increases for the sand erosion when changing the subsurface hydrologic condition to seepage the cohesive loam retained some shear strength due to the in situ soil cohesion but the cohesionless sand lost much of its shear strength different results were obtained in the huang and laflen 1996 study which used both simulated rainfall and concentrated flows on a cohesive clay loam soil they found that the effects of seepage conditions gave an average 22 increase in soil detachment under simulated rainfall and a greater increase of headcut developments with concentrated flows on this cohesive soil liu et al 2019 investigated soil erosion amount under free drainage and groundwater seepage conditions and found groundwater seepage increased sediment concentration 27 411 compared to the free drainage condition when increased runoff rate was 27 54 huang et al 2018 found flow velocities on saturated slopes were 17 to 88 greater than the values on non saturated soil for loess slopes which also indicates that subsurface hydrologic conditions can influence the surface soil erosion process subsurface condition can also influence the developments of rills and then the sediment detachment and transport gabbard et al 1998 showed that seepage conditions increase the generation of rills and erosion rates increased by as much as 60 times in their experiments compared with those under drainage conditions nouwakpo and huang 2012 estimated soil losses by measuring elevation changes in a large soil box and their observations showed that the channel development rates were doubled under seepage compared to free drainage conditions and caused 1 5 times greater total soil losses in the study of bryan and poesen 1989 the dominant effect of subsurface soil moisture on rill development was the reduction of soil strength and the increase of runoff entrainment under saturation conditions therefore the developments of rills detachment rates and sediment transport increased when the subsurface hydrologic conditions changed from drainage to seepage in most soil erosion models critical values critical shear stress critical unit stream power or critical stream power and erodibility are used to represent the soil characteristics and considered as the determination of incipient motion both critical shear stress and erodibility are affected by the subsurface conditions nouwakpo and huang 2010 showed the dependency of both soil erodibility and critical shear stress on the pore water pressure which varied with subsurface conditions from drainage to seepage similar results were observed in nouwakpo et al 2010 that rill erodibility of a crosby miami soil under seepage conditions was 5 64 times greater than that of the same soil under drainage conditions and the critical shear stress increased quasi linearly with decreasing vertical hydraulic gradient from seepage to drainage given the observed dramatic impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on rill development critical shear stress and erodibility in previous studies the estimation of transport capacity requires the consideration of differences under free drainage saturation and seepage conditions this study reports on a series of experiments in a hydraulic flume with a water table controller designed to quantify the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport capacity in rills the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on critical shear stress and rill erodibility 2 to test the uniqueness of transport capacity by comparing the measurements under detachment limited conditions and transport limited conditions and 3 to observe the quantitative effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on measured sediment transport capacities 2 materials and methods in order to diminish the impacts of sediment size selectivity in the process of detachment and deposition relatively uniform sands were used in this study to observe the fundamental relationships between subsurface hydrologic conditions and transport capacity relatively uniform sands were used with median particle size 0 46 mm and around 65 of the particle sizes were in the range of 0 4 0 6 mm the particle size distribution is shown in fig 1 which was measured using a malvern mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer given that the simulation of steady state conditions was challenged by the rill development process on an erodible bed in the experiment all sediment samples in this study were collected at the very beginning of each run to avoid the decrease in bed slope gradient caused by detachment both soil strength parameters critical shear stress and rill erodibility and sediment transport capacities were measured under free drainage saturation and seepage conditions for prewetting the sand body the water table controller was raised to the sand surface level to obtain saturated conditions before each run the prewetting process took about 4 h for dry sands and a clearly shallow water layer was found as the symbol of saturation when changing the subsurface conditions from saturation to seepage the experiments started 1 h after raising the water

the rill erodibility and critical shear stress can be obtained as the slope and the intercept with the x axis using a regression method the regression method used in this study is a common way to determine critical shear stress and rill erodibility gilley et al 1993 wu et al 2017 a half meter long flume was designed for measuring rill erodibility under different subsurface conditions fig 2 the flume was 0 1 m wide 0 3 m deep and filled with 0 23 m deep experimental sands there was a 1 cm diameter hole at the bottom of the flume which could be connected to a water table controller pipe so that the water table level in the flume could be controlled by changing the vertical position of the pipe and water infiltrated out of the bottom of the flume through the hole for free drainage conditions the experimental slope was 4 56 four subsurface conditions were studied including free drainage saturation 5 cm seepage head and 10 cm seepage head the runoff sediment samples were collected at the end of the flume using autoclavable bottles and then oven dried the clean water discharge rates and sediment transport values were calculated based on the water and sediment weights in the samples the flow velocity was measured by timing the movement of the leading edge of a fluorescent dye the infiltration rate was estimated as the flow rate exiting the drainage ports in the base of the flume 2 2 experimental design for the measurements of sediment transport capacity given that the determination of sediment transport capacity requires the confirmation of an equilibrium condition where sediment transport will not change with increasing slope length a flume with four different length rills was designed for this study fig 3 in order to obtain spatial change of sediment transport along the slope lengths the entire flume was 3 m long 0 4 m wide and 0 3 m deep which was filled with 0 23 m deep experimental sands the flume was divided into four 0 1 m wide rills and the erodible lengths of the four rills varied by covering the top 2 5 m 2 m 1 m and 0 m of the rills the rills were numbered from the shortest to the longest rill 1 was 0 5 m long rill 2 was 1 m long rill 3 was 2 m long and rill 4 was 3 m long a sediment feeder was positioned at the top of the flume and sediment was introduced evenly into clear inflow at the beginning of rills holes were drilled in the bottom of the flume box and located at the center of each section for water entrance or drainage nozzles were placed in these holes with porous sponge materials placed in them to prevent sand from flowing out polyurethane clear tubes were used to connect with these nozzles that converged to a single outlet by connecting the bottom of the flume to the water table pipe the water table level in the flume could be controlled in order to get a relatively uniform subsurface hydrologic condition when the flume had some slope a 20 cm high baffle plate was added every half meter to divide the rill into several sections and the corresponding sections in the water controller pipe were divided by 5 cm high metal plates the experiments were conducted at a 4 56 slope steepness under four subsurface hydraulic gradients free drainage saturation 5 cm seepage head 10 cm seepage head with three water discharge rates 0 0012 0 0014 and 0 0017 m2 s 1 the sediment feeding speeds for each water discharge and subsurface hydrologic condition are shown in table 1 for each combination of inflow and subsurface condition the experiments were completed with one or two sediment feeding speeds greater than the sediment transport capacity and one feeding speed lower than the transport capacity therefore the equilibrium sediment transport capacities were investigated under both detachment limited and transport limited conditions there were two to four replications for each sediment feeding speed and we conducted 107 runs for each rill totally from pre experiments we found that the spatial changes of sediment transport for different slope lengths alone were not enough for the determination of transport capacities even though similar sediment transport rates were obtained for the two longest rills the clear net detachment or net deposition at the bottom area of the flume challenged the reach of equilibrium conditions for better determination of equilibrium conditions the surface changes in rills were also measured using an electronic digital caliper a rated accuracy of 0 02 mm in this study the measurement points were marked on the left side and right side of each rill in order to get the surface change every 0 1 m along the downslope direction for instance the 3 m long rill was marked with numbers 0 0 1 2 9 3 0 from the top to bottom of the rill the surface changes along the slope length were obtained as the differences between surface level before and after each run for each measurement point and the net detachment areas and net deposition areas could be clearly depicted on the basis of surface changes for the runs without noticeable net detachment or net deposition at the bottom area of the longest rill the observed sediment transport at the outlet was assumed to be the equilibrium value of the sediment transport capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on critical shear stress and rill erodibility the relationships between flow shear stress and detachment rate for different subsurface conditions from the half meter long flume are shown in fig 4 there were 54 pairs of observed flow shear stress and detachment rate for the linear regression shown in table 2 when changing the subsurface condition from free drainage to saturation the critical shear stress decreased from 0 788 pa to 0 574 pa and the rill erodibilities were similar when changing the subsurface condition from saturation to 10 cm seepage the critical shear stress decreased from 0 574 pa to 0 555 pa as expected there was a large decrease of critical shear stress from free drainage to saturation which was caused by at least two factors the removal of the infiltration process reduced the downward forces on the particles and the addition of exfiltration gave particles an upward buoyancy force against gravity the downward infiltration acted on particles to remain in their original locations and increased the energy requirement for particle movement the exfiltration caused an upward force that reduced the energy cost for particle movement for conditions with water table level higher than the surface the critical shear stress decreased slightly as water table level increased when subsurface hydrologic conditions changed from drainage to saturation the drainage force was replaced with a seepage force which caused a large difference in the total lifting force for a given particle however when the subsurface hydrologic condition changed from saturation to seepage the increase of the lifting force was not very great the anova results in table 3 show the paired comparisons of linear regressions between detachment rate and shear stress under different subsurface hydrologic conditions when using the regression method gilley et al 1993 wu et al 2017 for estimation rill erodibility and critical shear stress were obtained as the regressed slope and x intercept for each subsurface hydrologic condition the p values for regressed slopes comparisons were greater than 0 05 for all pairs and over 0 8 when comparing saturation and seepage conditions therefore for the particles used in this study no significant differences of rill erodibilities were obtained between any subsurface hydrologic conditions especially between saturation and seepage conditions for the comparison of regressed x intercepts the p value was 0 064 for free drainage and 5 cm seepage comparison and 0 076 for free drainage and 10 cm seepage comparison these two p values were significant at the 10 level which indicates the need to consider the changes in critical shear stress between free drainage and seepage conditions the regressed critical shear stress values of saturation and seepage conditions were close to each other and no significant differences were obtained with p values over 0 90 table 3 agreed with fig 4 that no significant differences in either rill erodibility or critical shear stress of the study sands were observed for wt 0 5 10 conditions and the rill erodibility was around 0 2 s m 1 and the critical shear stress was around 0 56 pa for these conditions both the critical shear stress and the rill erodibilities were calculated using the regression method and high r squared values 0 8 were obtained for all regressions which showed a high correlation between shear stress and sediment detachment rate under any considered subsurface hydrologic condition when predicting sediment transport capacity the selection of an independent variable included consideration of shear stress unit stream power and stream power the sediment load in the water flow can reach the transport capacity when sediment detachment and deposition are under equilibrium conditions fig 4 indicates that it was reasonable to use flow shear stress for sediment transport capacity predictions 3 2 comparison of transport capacities obtained under detachment limited conditions and transport limited conditions 3 2 1 the determination of transport capacity given that the definition of sediment transport capacity is the equilibrium value for a specific hydrologic condition the determination of the equilibrium condition was dependent on the measured sediment transport of different slope lengths and the surface elevation changes of the rills in this study fig 5 shows the observed sediment transport for different slope lengths when water discharge was 0 0012 m2 s 1 under the free drainage condition there were four replicates for each sediment feeding rate 1 2 g s 1 2 5 g s 1 and 3 8 g s 1 which were named as run1 run2 run3 and run4 the sediment transport capacities were reached when relatively similar sediment transport values were obtained for the two longest rills rill 3 and rill 4 sediment transport capacities were measured with fed sediment 1 2 g s 1 2 5 g s 1 and 3 8 g s 1 less than approximately equal to or greater than the equilibrium value the outlier of run 1 with the feeding rate of 1 2 g s 1 was caused by a serious head cut scour at the top of the 0 5 m long rill 1 for runs with the same sediment feeding rate greater variations of sediment transport values were observed for shorter rills which indicated that the impacts of micro surface elevation changes decreased as rill slope length increased for the longest rills rill 3 and rill 4 even when the same water discharge and subsurface conditions were introduced for the replicates the surface elevation changes for a given rill were different which is a characteristic feature of a natural system therefore it was necessary to estimate the surface elevation changes in the rills to diminish the impacts of local micro surface changes on sediment transport in order to obtain a better determination of transport capacity given that the surface elevations after each run were measured every 10 cm of each rill and compared to the original surface the determination of transport capacity was based on the bottom area surface changes of the longest rill rill 4 the boxplots of surface elevation changes for each run are shown in fig 6 for the bottom 1 0 m long area of rill 4 surface changes are the elevation differences between the designed original surface and the surface after each run positive surface changes indicate the area with local deposition and negative changes indicate the area with local detachment run1 run2 run3 and run4 are the replicates for all four subsurface conditions studied the changes of surface elevation were within 6 mm and the changes were mainly between 3 mm for the saturation and seepage conditions given limited surface changes appear under close to equilibrium conditions in theory small surface changes less than 3 mm were evidence that close to equilibrium conditions were reached in this study the results from saturation and 5 cm seepage head conditions gave minimum surface changes given more values around 0 and more concentrated distributions compared to the other two subsurface hydrologic conditions it was obvious that there were fewer impacts of infiltration and exfiltration on sediment transport under saturation and the 5 cm seepage head conditions which was the reason for more easily reaching equilibrium conditions for these two treatments for the free drainage treatment mainly positive surface changes were obtained given the infiltration increased the critical shear stress and decreased water discharge and then increased net deposition for the saturation and 5 cm seepage head conditions the surface changes were mostly symmetrically distributed around 0 and the negative outliers were caused by the slight scouring at the outlets for the 10 cm seepage head condition the medians of the surface elevation changes were close to 0 for most runs but more negative observations were obtained which was the result of exfiltration causing critical shear stress decreases and water discharge increases the bed elevation changes due to subsurface hydrology variations shown in fig 6 indicate most runs closely approached equilibrium conditions and this was useful for selecting the representative run for a specific surface and subsurface hydrologic condition the results of the wilcoxon test for surface changes of each replication for each treatment are shown in fig 7 and the null hypothesis was that no significant surface changes were observed after each run compared to the original surface the p values were classified based on the confidence levels 95 99 and 99 9 for saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most runs with 95 confidence which indicates that close to equilibrium conditions were obtained for most runs under these three subsurface hydrologic conditions for the free drainage condition infiltration caused net deposition which enlarged the surface changes after each run and made it harder to reach the equilibrium condition the seven runs with no significant differences at the 95 confidence level were then considered when selecting representative runs for the respective surface hydrologic conditions the results of the kruskal wallis chi test are shown in fig 8 as the comparison between replicates if the null hypothesis of no significant differences was obtained between replicates it means the runs were truly replicates of each other and the alternative hypothesis is that the surface changes of at least two runs were different from each other for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition the dashed line indicates p values equal to 0 05 for a confidence level 95 for most designed surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions calculated p values were greater than 0 05 which means no significant differences were obtained between replicates with 95 confidence the results showed most replicates were effective there were some conditions showing significant differences within at least two replicates which were caused by the accumulated surface changes for instance the p value was less than 0 05 for runs under the free drainage condition with water discharge 0 12 10 2 m2 s 1 and fed sediment rate of 1 2 g s 1 the respective surface measurements in fig 6 show continuing net deposition for the downslope bottom 1 0 m area from run1 to run3 the upslope net detachment and downslope net deposition caused slight decreases of slope steepness and then increased net deposition in the upslope area of run4 and more detachment in the downslope area hence the accumulated surface changes increased the differences between the original surface and the surface before run4 which resulted in the significant differences between run3 and run4 in this study both the spatial change of sediment transport as slope length increased and the surface elevation changes showed most runs closely approximated equilibrium conditions 3 2 2 measured sediment transport capacity under detachment limited condition and transport limited condition the sediment transport values in rill 3 and rill 4 2 m long and 3 m long under all subsurface conditions for designed water discharge 0 0012 m2 s 1 are shown in fig 9 for free drainage saturation and the 5 cm seepage head conditions sediment transport capacities were observed by introducing sediment with two rates greater than the equilibrium value and one rate lower than the value for the 10 cm seepage head condition sediment transport capacity was measured by feeding sediment at one rate greater than and at one rate lower than the equilibrium value therefore the sediment transport capacity values were measured under both detachment limited and transport limited conditions according to fig 9 the sediment transport capacities were obtained for all considered subsurface hydrologic conditions given that relatively similar measurements were observed between the 2 m long rill and the 3 m long rill for almost all replicates for a given subsurface hydrologic condition similar observed transport capacity values were obtained under detachment limited and transport limited conditions which indicated there was only one equilibrium value of sediment transport for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition on uniform sediment particles for most replicates observed sediment transport values were very close between the 2 m long and 3 m long flumes but there were some runs that had observations with some differences for instance measured sediment transport values of run 1 under the free drainage conditions were greater for the 2 m long rill than for the 3 m long rill the differences may be the result of different bed surfaces of these two rills even though the same surface and subsurface conditions were designed and used in the experiments given that micro surface topography changes cannot be avoided the differences indicated the need for more replicates in order to increase the accuracy of the sediment transport capacity determinations for the comparison of observations under detachment limited and transport limited conditions the impacts of the upslope sediment feeding speed on measured sediment transport capacity was estimated using the jrfit joint ranking estimates for cluster correlated data method kloke et al 2009 in this study measured sediment transport capacity data were classified into three clusters based on the approximations of measured water discharge for each subsurface hydrologic condition for instance data under the free drainage condition were clustered based on water discharge around 0 0010 0 0012 and 0 0014 m2 s 1 table 4 shows the comparison of sediment transport obtained with different sediment feeding speed for each cluster p values were 0 92 0 96 0 81 and 0 50 for free drainage saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage conditions which were greater than 0 1 and showed no significant differences obtained at the 0 1 level therefore no significant differences of sediment transport were observed for the different sediment feeding speeds which confirmed that there were no significant differences of measured sediment transport capacities by using the detachment limited method or the transport limited method when comparing the results with the study of polyakov and nearing 2003 which found different equilibrium values under detachment limited and transport limited conditions the differences may be explained by the following reasons first the application of cohesionless sands removed the impacts of clay dispersion and aggregate breakdown for studies with soil particles polyakov and nearing 2003 the particle size distribution is complicated especially when introducing dry soil into inflow the rapid wetting process may cause flaking and aggregate breakdown and generate finer particles both the particle size distribution and the density can be influenced by the wetting process which can cause differences in equilibrium sediment transport values obtained at the end of a flume in this study the introduction of primary sand particles into inflow did not allow for any aggregate breakdown which made it easier to compare the observations under detachment limited and transport limited conditions second the use of relatively uniform sands can diminish the impacts of sediment size selectivity in the study of rose et al 1983 most of their flume surface was covered by deposited particles when the sediment transport reached transport capacity as we know the selective deposition of coarser sediment particles increased the component of coarse particles on the surface during the experiments when using uniform sands in this study the sediment size selectivity can be ignored and the particle size distribution of the sand surface was spatially and dynamically identical in the experiments given that the same sands were introduced at the top of the flume there were no size differences between introduced sediment and detached sediment from all studies transport capacity was surely affected by the studied particles and the variables for particle size and particle density were included in almost all previous transport capacity equations wang et al 2019 therefore uniform cohesionless sands were used in this study to establish a relatively stable experimental environment which gave simpler and more trustworthy comparison results between detachment limited and transport limited conditions the results on uniform sands were the basis for soil studies with different size particles the observations from different uniform particles were widely used for the generation of sediment transport capacity equations govers 1990 for better prediction of soil which is a combination of different size particles 3 3 impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on measured transport capacity measured sediment transport values of rill 4 are shown in table 5 which were closest to capacities compared to other rills rill 1 rill 2 or rill 3 the water discharge in table 5 for each subsurface hydrologic condition was the clear water discharge at the end of the flume which was calculated based on the water mass water density sample time and rill width obtained in each sediment and water sample given that high hydraulic conductivity sands were used in this study the effects of infiltration on water discharge were significant from table 4 the decrease of water discharge by infiltration was 0 0002 to 0 0004 m2 s 1 for the free drainage condition compared to the impacts of infiltration the increase of water discharge caused by exfiltration was limited for the saturation condition the water discharge at the end of the flume was almost the same as that of the inflow the increases were no more than 0 0001 m2 s 1 for all saturation and seepage conditions the subsurface hydrologic impacts on sediment transport capacity were studied using the jrfit method with experimental data clustered based on approximations of measured water discharge table 6 shows the comparison between different subsurface hydrologic conditions measurements under free drainage and saturation condition were chosen as references and the observed p values represent the changes in the other conditions from the references when the reference was data under the free drainage condition changes were obtained for water discharge around 0 0012 or 0 0014 m2 s 1 the p values were 0 0060 0 000017 and 0 00020 which were all less than 0 05 the results showed significant differences of measured transport capacities under saturation and seepage conditions compared to the free drainage condition which indicates it is necessary to consider the increase of transport capacity when changing subsurface hydrologic conditions from free drainage to saturation or seepage when the reference was data under saturation conditions changes were obtained for water discharge around 0 0012 0 0014 and 0 0017 m2 s 1 the p values were then greater than 0 05 and indicated no significant differences obtained between saturation and seepage conditions with 95 confidence however the p value was 0 076 when comparing the changes of observations from saturation to the 10 cm seepage head condition which is close to 0 05 and was significant at the 0 1 level therefore even though the transport capacity increase was not significant from saturation to the 10 cm seepage head for the experimental conditions in this study it is too early to say that there are no significant changes in sediment transport capacity between saturation and seepage conditions for other hydrologic conditions from previous studies the impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport included the decrease of soil strength and the increase of water discharge caused by exfiltration both changes of soil strength and water discharge were considered in this study and the effects of these two factors resulted in a large increase of transport capacity from drainage to saturation fig 10 according to the results of measured critical shear stress and rill erodibility under different subsurface hydrologic conditions the soil strength critical shear stress decreased from drainage to seepage transport capacity increased as water discharge increased the relationship between water discharge and measured transport capacity is shown in fig 10 for all subsurface hydrologic conditions considered when the subsurface hydrologic condition changed from free drainage to saturation measured transport capacities increased about 14 when the condition changed from saturation to 10 cm seepage head measured transport capacities increased but only slightly as water discharge increased the differences between measurements of free drainage and saturation increased the results of the dramatic increase of transport capacity from free drainage to saturation conditions agreed with the observations of huang and laflen 1996 their study emphasized the importance of subsurface hydrologic conditions and serious soil erosion problems can happen on saturated or seeping soils even though the surface discharge may not be great according to zhang et al 2009 transport capacity increased as the power of water discharge based on their experiments on non erodible beds the power regression lines between water discharge and transport capacity are shown in fig 10 and the coefficient values are shown in table 7 our results agreed with zhang et al 2009 that transport capacity increased as a power function of water discharge but the coefficients were different for different subsurface hydrologic conditions given more scattered observations under the free drainage condition compared to that under the other conditions a lower r2 value was obtained as shown in table 7 the r2 values were 0 909 0 875 and 0 904 for saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions respectively which indicated that the relationship between water discharge and transport capacity agreed well with a power relationship the exponents of water discharge were 1 476 1 258 and 1 318 for saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions respectively which were close to the value of 1 237 obtained in zhang et al 2009 and the average value of 1 4 reported by prosser and rustomji 2000 the experiments of zhang et al 2009 were conducted on non erodible beds which may be close to saturation or seepage conditions the differences in the exponents of water discharge observed in this study and those in previous literature might have resulted from subsurface hydrologic impacts and sediment size distribution differences for the free drainage condition even though the r2 value was 0 451 it was not great enough to determine whether the relationship between the water discharge and the sediment transport capacity followed a power relationship from the previous analysis the impacts of infiltration on water discharge were more outstanding than exfiltration given water discharge decreased 0 0002 to 0 0004 m2 s 1 under free drainage condition and increased less than 0 0001 m2 s 1 under seepage condition the biases caused by infiltration increased the differences of surface changes between replicates flows with lower water discharge were more sensitive to the micro surface changes which gave more scattered observations under the free drainage condition therefore more work will be required to clarify the relationship between water discharge and transport capacity under free drainage based on fig 10 and table 7 the increase of soil lost can be significant when the subsurface hydrologic condition changed from drainage to saturation or seepage soil erosion models should consider the subsurface hydrologic impacts for better predictions based on the measurements of surface changes for rill 4 the values closest to equilibrium were selected as the sediment transport capacities given minimum surface changes for the bottom 1 5 m of the rill which is shown in table 8 in this study 107 runs were conducted to meet the requirement of large numbers of replicates to determine equilibrium value and compare observations under detachment limited and transport limited conditions and only one measured equilibrium sediment transport was selected to represent the final transport capacity value for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition according to the measurements reported in table 8 when the subsurface condition changed from free drainage to saturation transport capacities increased 13 for 0 0012 m2 s 1 and 15 for 0 0014 m2 s 1 for seepage conditions the differences between measured transport capacities were limited further experiments are required in order to determine the quantitative impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport capacities 4 conclusions in this study 107 laboratory experimental runs were conducted for the estimation of subsurface hydrologic impacts on sediment transport capacities in rills the results indicated that the subsurface hydrology affected the transport capacities through impacts on critical shear stress and water discharge first the critical shear stress decreased about 20 from the free drainage to the saturation condition for the studied sands and decreased slightly from saturation to the 10 cm seepage head condition there were no obvious differences obtained for rill erodibilities from free drainage to seepage conditions second the measured sediment transport capacities were close between detachment limited and transport limited conditions which means there was only one equilibrium sediment transport for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition third the observed transport capacities when subsurface hydrologic condition changed from free drainage to saturation condition and the differences between these conditions increased as water discharge increased limited increase of transport capacities was obtained between 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions for a given water discharge and the differences between saturation and seepage conditions were relatively stable as water discharge increased this study emphasized the impacts of subsurface hydrology on sediment transport the soil lost increased dramatically from drainage to saturation or seepage conditions even though there was no significant increase of surface runoff according to the results of this study the determination of transport capacity in the laboratory requires the measurements of spatial sediment transport changes along increasing slope lengths and surface elevation changes in the rills more experiments are necessary with greater water discharges and steeper slopes for further quantitative estimation of

assistance of wei hu associate editor sediment transport capacity tc is the equilibrium sediment transport value under steady state flow and channel conditions given the difficulties in controlling hydrologic parameters close to steady state in the field most previous studies measured transport capacity in the laboratory on either non erodible beds or erodible beds without drainage however infiltration under drainage conditions and exfiltration under seepage conditions cannot be ignored in the real world and their impacts on soil strength and water discharge may affect transport capacity the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on rill sediment transport capacity and the observations are discussed under both detachment limited and transport limited conditions series of experiments were carried out with a relatively uniform sand using three water discharges on a 4 56 slope flume with four rills from 0 5 to 3 0 m long under four subsurface hydrologic conditions varying from free drainage to 10 cm seepage head the determination of equilibrium sediment transport capacity was based on the spatial change of sediment transport as slope lengths increased and the elevation change of the erodible surface in rills results from 107 runs indicated that there was only one equilibrium sediment transport value for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition given similar observations were obtained under detachment limited and transport limited conditions for the studied sand observed critical shear stress decreased around 20 from the drainage to the saturation condition and decreased slightly from the saturation to the seepage condition measured transport capacity increased 13 to 15 from drainage to seepage conditions for the studied water discharges which was the result of decreased soil strength and increased water discharge the differences in transport capacities between drainage and saturation increased as water discharge increased but the differences between saturation and seepage were relatively stable for all studied water discharges keywords subsurface hydrology sediment transport capacity rill flow equilibrium condition 1 introduction 1 1 the importance of estimating sediment transport capacity tc as a serious world wide environmental problem soil erosion and sediment leaving a hillslope affect the management of conservation practices estimation of water pollution and the rates of fertilizer application when modeling soil erosion for a given hillslope the erosion process contains three main subprocesses including sediment detachment sediment transport and sediment deposition and these three are highly correlated with each other the sediment detachment transport coupling concept is widely used to combine the three subprocesses in various soil erosion models flanagan et al 2001 morgan et al 1998 de roo et al 1996 smith et al 1995 using this concept the detachment estimation and the net deposition determination are based on the comparison between sediment load and sediment transport capacity as the key factor in the sediment detachment transport concept the definition of sediment transport capacity in this study is the equilibrium sediment concentration approached at an infinite downslope distance given that hydraulic conditions water discharge channel shape roughness water depth slope etc do not change polyakov and nearing 2003 however the implicit assumption of a unique sediment transport capacity in the detachment transport coupling concept has been under discussion huang et al 1996 the examination of transport capacity is also the validation of the sediment detachment transport coupling concept and then the soil erosion models based on this concept 1 2 challenges of the sediment detachment transport coupling concept given the definition of sediment transport capacity which is the equilibrium sediment transport for a given hydrologic condition the difficulties are substantial to control all related hydrologic parameters and to measure transport capacity in the field hence estimates of sediment transport capacity were made in the laboratory for almost all previous studies two traditional methods have been broadly used to measure transport capacity under either sediment detachment limited conditions or transport limited conditions for observations under detachment limited conditions a long enough erodible bed was used with clear water introduced from the top of the flume govers 1990 measured sediment transport capacities for five well sorted quartz materials under 1 to 12 degrees slope gradients on a 6 m long flume and the experiments showed that a 3 m effective length yielded comparable results therefore the flume was required to be at least 3 m long and the main process on the soil surface was sediment detachment the main hypothesis was that sediment transport would reach equilibrium capacity after flowing 3 m down the flume when measuring transport capacity under transport limited conditions both erodible and non erodible beds can be used non erodible beds need to have experimental sediment particles glued to the bed surface in order to simulate similar roughness as a natural erodible surface very muddy flows were introduced at the top of the flume with sediment loads greater than transport capacity and obvious net deposition was visible in the top area of the flume the observed sediment transport at the end of the flume was assumed to reach transport capacity when no noticeable deposition was visible at the bottom area of the flume given very limited sediment detachment on non erodible beds which was due mainly to the re detachment of deposited particles the observations on non erodible beds were of concern as we know both sediment detachment and deposition processes can include particle size selectivity malam issa et al 2006 for experiments on non erodible beds the dominant process of larger particles depositing without re entrainment of finer particles may cause sediment transport less than the capacity at the end of the flume therefore some non erodible bed studies included a small erodible soil box embedded in the flume near the outlet with the same width as the bed which introduced some detachment in order to make sure that the sediment transport reached capacity at the end of the flume zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 the comparison of observed sediment transport capacities under detachment limited and transport limited conditions facilitates examination of the uniqueness of transport capacity which is the assumption in the sediment detachment transport coupling concept polyakov and nearing 2003 compared equilibrium sediment concentrations of a carmi loam using the two traditional methods on an 8 m long flume and found the measurements under transport limited conditions were about two times more than the values under detachment limited conditions different measured values were also observed in the study of huang et al 1996 and they agreed that sediment detachment and sediment transport are separate processes and the sediment delivery is limited to the lesser of the detachment limitation and the transport limitation however the use of natural soils in these previous studies complicated the erosion processes on the flumes with the impacts of sediment size selectivity and the influence of aggregate breakdown cannot be ignored which was caused by the rapid wetting of soils when adding sediment at the top of the flumes therefore testing of unique sediment transport capacity needs further examination 1 3 effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport given the difficulties to control uniform subsurface hydrologic conditions in the experiments most previous studies obtained transport capacities under the no drainage condition yalin 1963 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 which means there were no holes drilled for infiltration at the bottom of the flume and the soil or sand body was saturated before each experiment however the subsurface hydrologic condition does influence the sediment transport especially for saturation and seepage conditions where the buoyancy on soil particles against gravity decreases the energy cost for the incipient motion saturation condition in this study means the water table level is exactly the same as the erodible surface seepage is the condition of saturation with positive pore water pressure and an exfiltration gradient huang and laflen 1996 the impacts of a seepage condition include exfiltration causing increased water discharge and buoyancy causing reduction of the required tractive force and energy for soil detachment the effects of the three kinds of subsurface hydrologic conditions are different drainage saturation and seepage the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions have been studied on different soils but the results do not all agree with each other stolte et al 1990 investigated the impacts of seepage on soil erosion on a loam and a sand and their results showed that the return flow rates which were caused by the exfiltration produced insignificant effects for the loam soil erosion but very dramatic increases for the sand erosion when changing the subsurface hydrologic condition to seepage the cohesive loam retained some shear strength due to the in situ soil cohesion but the cohesionless sand lost much of its shear strength different results were obtained in the huang and laflen 1996 study which used both simulated rainfall and concentrated flows on a cohesive clay loam soil they found that the effects of seepage conditions gave an average 22 increase in soil detachment under simulated rainfall and a greater increase of headcut developments with concentrated flows on this cohesive soil liu et al 2019 investigated soil erosion amount under free drainage and groundwater seepage conditions and found groundwater seepage increased sediment concentration 27 411 compared to the free drainage condition when increased runoff rate was 27 54 huang et al 2018 found flow velocities on saturated slopes were 17 to 88 greater than the values on non saturated soil for loess slopes which also indicates that subsurface hydrologic conditions can influence the surface soil erosion process subsurface condition can also influence the developments of rills and then the sediment detachment and transport gabbard et al 1998 showed that seepage conditions increase the generation of rills and erosion rates increased by as much as 60 times in their experiments compared with those under drainage conditions nouwakpo and huang 2012 estimated soil losses by measuring elevation changes in a large soil box and their observations showed that the channel development rates were doubled under seepage compared to free drainage conditions and caused 1 5 times greater total soil losses in the study of bryan and poesen 1989 the dominant effect of subsurface soil moisture on rill development was the reduction of soil strength and the increase of runoff entrainment under saturation conditions therefore the developments of rills detachment rates and sediment transport increased when the subsurface hydrologic conditions changed from drainage to seepage in most soil erosion models critical values critical shear stress critical unit stream power or critical stream power and erodibility are used to represent the soil characteristics and considered as the determination of incipient motion both critical shear stress and erodibility are affected by the subsurface conditions nouwakpo and huang 2010 showed the dependency of both soil erodibility and critical shear stress on the pore water pressure which varied with subsurface conditions from drainage to seepage similar results were observed in nouwakpo et al 2010 that rill erodibility of a crosby miami soil under seepage conditions was 5 64 times greater than that of the same soil under drainage conditions and the critical shear stress increased quasi linearly with decreasing vertical hydraulic gradient from seepage to drainage given the observed dramatic impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on rill development critical shear stress and erodibility in previous studies the estimation of transport capacity requires the consideration of differences under free drainage saturation and seepage conditions this study reports on a series of experiments in a hydraulic flume with a water table controller designed to quantify the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport capacity in rills the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on critical shear stress and rill erodibility 2 to test the uniqueness of transport capacity by comparing the measurements under detachment limited conditions and transport limited conditions and 3 to observe the quantitative effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on measured sediment transport capacities 2 materials and methods in order to diminish the impacts of sediment size selectivity in the process of detachment and deposition relatively uniform sands were used in this study to observe the fundamental relationships between subsurface hydrologic conditions and transport capacity relatively uniform sands were used with median particle size 0 46 mm and around 65 of the particle sizes were in the range of 0 4 0 6 mm the particle size distribution is shown in fig 1 which was measured using a malvern mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer given that the simulation of steady state conditions was challenged by the rill development process on an erodible bed in the experiment all sediment samples in this study were collected at the very beginning of each run to avoid the decrease in bed slope gradient caused by detachment both soil strength parameters critical shear stress and rill erodibility and sediment transport capacities were measured under free drainage saturation and seepage conditions for prewetting the sand body the water table controller was raised to the sand surface level to obtain saturated conditions before each run the prewetting process took about 4 h for dry sands and a clearly shallow water layer was found as the symbol of saturation when changing the subsurface conditions from saturation to seepage the experiments started 1 h after raising the water

the rill erodibility and critical shear stress can be obtained as the slope and the intercept with the x axis using a regression method the regression method used in this study is a common way to determine critical shear stress and rill erodibility gilley et al 1993 wu et al 2017 a half meter long flume was designed for measuring rill erodibility under different subsurface conditions fig 2 the flume was 0 1 m wide 0 3 m deep and filled with 0 23 m deep experimental sands there was a 1 cm diameter hole at the bottom of the flume which could be connected to a water table controller pipe so that the water table level in the flume could be controlled by changing the vertical position of the pipe and water infiltrated out of the bottom of the flume through the hole for free drainage conditions the experimental slope was 4 56 four subsurface conditions were studied including free drainage saturation 5 cm seepage head and 10 cm seepage head the runoff sediment samples were collected at the end of the flume using autoclavable bottles and then oven dried the clean water discharge rates and sediment transport values were calculated based on the water and sediment weights in the samples the flow velocity was measured by timing the movement of the leading edge of a fluorescent dye the infiltration rate was estimated as the flow rate exiting the drainage ports in the base of the flume 2 2 experimental design for the measurements of sediment transport capacity given that the determination of sediment transport capacity requires the confirmation of an equilibrium condition where sediment transport will not change with increasing slope length a flume with four different length rills was designed for this study fig 3 in order to obtain spatial change of sediment transport along the slope lengths the entire flume was 3 m long 0 4 m wide and 0 3 m deep which was filled with 0 23 m deep experimental sands the flume was divided into four 0 1 m wide rills and the erodible lengths of the four rills varied by covering the top 2 5 m 2 m 1 m and 0 m of the rills the rills were numbered from the shortest to the longest rill 1 was 0 5 m long rill 2 was 1 m long rill 3 was 2 m long and rill 4 was 3 m long a sediment feeder was positioned at the top of the flume and sediment was introduced evenly into clear inflow at the beginning of rills holes were drilled in the bottom of the flume box and located at the center of each section for water entrance or drainage nozzles were placed in these holes with porous sponge materials placed in them to prevent sand from flowing out polyurethane clear tubes were used to connect with these nozzles that converged to a single outlet by connecting the bottom of the flume to the water table pipe the water table level in the flume could be controlled in order to get a relatively uniform subsurface hydrologic condition when the flume had some slope a 20 cm high baffle plate was added every half meter to divide the rill into several sections and the corresponding sections in the water controller pipe were divided by 5 cm high metal plates the experiments were conducted at a 4 56 slope steepness under four subsurface hydraulic gradients free drainage saturation 5 cm seepage head 10 cm seepage head with three water discharge rates 0 0012 0 0014 and 0 0017 m2 s 1 the sediment feeding speeds for each water discharge and subsurface hydrologic condition are shown in table 1 for each combination of inflow and subsurface condition the experiments were completed with one or two sediment feeding speeds greater than the sediment transport capacity and one feeding speed lower than the transport capacity therefore the equilibrium sediment transport capacities were investigated under both detachment limited and transport limited conditions there were two to four replications for each sediment feeding speed and we conducted 107 runs for each rill totally from pre experiments we found that the spatial changes of sediment transport for different slope lengths alone were not enough for the determination of transport capacities even though similar sediment transport rates were obtained for the two longest rills the clear net detachment or net deposition at the bottom area of the flume challenged the reach of equilibrium conditions for better determination of equilibrium conditions the surface changes in rills were also measured using an electronic digital caliper a rated accuracy of 0 02 mm in this study the measurement points were marked on the left side and right side of each rill in order to get the surface change every 0 1 m along the downslope direction for instance the 3 m long rill was marked with numbers 0 0 1 2 9 3 0 from the top to bottom of the rill the surface changes along the slope length were obtained as the differences between surface level before and after each run for each measurement point and the net detachment areas and net deposition areas could be clearly depicted on the basis of surface changes for the runs without noticeable net detachment or net deposition at the bottom area of the longest rill the observed sediment transport at the outlet was assumed to be the equilibrium value of the sediment transport capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of subsurface hydrologic conditions on critical shear stress and rill erodibility the relationships between flow shear stress and detachment rate for different subsurface conditions from the half meter long flume are shown in fig 4 there were 54 pairs of observed flow shear stress and detachment rate for the linear regression shown in table 2 when changing the subsurface condition from free drainage to saturation the critical shear stress decreased from 0 788 pa to 0 574 pa and the rill erodibilities were similar when changing the subsurface condition from saturation to 10 cm seepage the critical shear stress decreased from 0 574 pa to 0 555 pa as expected there was a large decrease of critical shear stress from free drainage to saturation which was caused by at least two factors the removal of the infiltration process reduced the downward forces on the particles and the addition of exfiltration gave particles an upward buoyancy force against gravity the downward infiltration acted on particles to remain in their original locations and increased the energy requirement for particle movement the exfiltration caused an upward force that reduced the energy cost for particle movement for conditions with water table level higher than the surface the critical shear stress decreased slightly as water table level increased when subsurface hydrologic conditions changed from drainage to saturation the drainage force was replaced with a seepage force which caused a large difference in the total lifting force for a given particle however when the subsurface hydrologic condition changed from saturation to seepage the increase of the lifting force was not very great the anova results in table 3 show the paired comparisons of linear regressions between detachment rate and shear stress under different subsurface hydrologic conditions when using the regression method gilley et al 1993 wu et al 2017 for estimation rill erodibility and critical shear stress were obtained as the regressed slope and x intercept for each subsurface hydrologic condition the p values for regressed slopes comparisons were greater than 0 05 for all pairs and over 0 8 when comparing saturation and seepage conditions therefore for the particles used in this study no significant differences of rill erodibilities were obtained between any subsurface hydrologic conditions especially between saturation and seepage conditions for the comparison of regressed x intercepts the p value was 0 064 for free drainage and 5 cm seepage comparison and 0 076 for free drainage and 10 cm seepage comparison these two p values were significant at the 10 level which indicates the need to consider the changes in critical shear stress between free drainage and seepage conditions the regressed critical shear stress values of saturation and seepage conditions were close to each other and no significant differences were obtained with p values over 0 90 table 3 agreed with fig 4 that no significant differences in either rill erodibility or critical shear stress of the study sands were observed for wt 0 5 10 conditions and the rill erodibility was around 0 2 s m 1 and the critical shear stress was around 0 56 pa for these conditions both the critical shear stress and the rill erodibilities were calculated using the regression method and high r squared values 0 8 were obtained for all regressions which showed a high correlation between shear stress and sediment detachment rate under any considered subsurface hydrologic condition when predicting sediment transport capacity the selection of an independent variable included consideration of shear stress unit stream power and stream power the sediment load in the water flow can reach the transport capacity when sediment detachment and deposition are under equilibrium conditions fig 4 indicates that it was reasonable to use flow shear stress for sediment transport capacity predictions 3 2 comparison of transport capacities obtained under detachment limited conditions and transport limited conditions 3 2 1 the determination of transport capacity given that the definition of sediment transport capacity is the equilibrium value for a specific hydrologic condition the determination of the equilibrium condition was dependent on the measured sediment transport of different slope lengths and the surface elevation changes of the rills in this study fig 5 shows the observed sediment transport for different slope lengths when water discharge was 0 0012 m2 s 1 under the free drainage condition there were four replicates for each sediment feeding rate 1 2 g s 1 2 5 g s 1 and 3 8 g s 1 which were named as run1 run2 run3 and run4 the sediment transport capacities were reached when relatively similar sediment transport values were obtained for the two longest rills rill 3 and rill 4 sediment transport capacities were measured with fed sediment 1 2 g s 1 2 5 g s 1 and 3 8 g s 1 less than approximately equal to or greater than the equilibrium value the outlier of run 1 with the feeding rate of 1 2 g s 1 was caused by a serious head cut scour at the top of the 0 5 m long rill 1 for runs with the same sediment feeding rate greater variations of sediment transport values were observed for shorter rills which indicated that the impacts of micro surface elevation changes decreased as rill slope length increased for the longest rills rill 3 and rill 4 even when the same water discharge and subsurface conditions were introduced for the replicates the surface elevation changes for a given rill were different which is a characteristic feature of a natural system therefore it was necessary to estimate the surface elevation changes in the rills to diminish the impacts of local micro surface changes on sediment transport in order to obtain a better determination of transport capacity given that the surface elevations after each run were measured every 10 cm of each rill and compared to the original surface the determination of transport capacity was based on the bottom area surface changes of the longest rill rill 4 the boxplots of surface elevation changes for each run are shown in fig 6 for the bottom 1 0 m long area of rill 4 surface changes are the elevation differences between the designed original surface and the surface after each run positive surface changes indicate the area with local deposition and negative changes indicate the area with local detachment run1 run2 run3 and run4 are the replicates for all four subsurface conditions studied the changes of surface elevation were within 6 mm and the changes were mainly between 3 mm for the saturation and seepage conditions given limited surface changes appear under close to equilibrium conditions in theory small surface changes less than 3 mm were evidence that close to equilibrium conditions were reached in this study the results from saturation and 5 cm seepage head conditions gave minimum surface changes given more values around 0 and more concentrated distributions compared to the other two subsurface hydrologic conditions it was obvious that there were fewer impacts of infiltration and exfiltration on sediment transport under saturation and the 5 cm seepage head conditions which was the reason for more easily reaching equilibrium conditions for these two treatments for the free drainage treatment mainly positive surface changes were obtained given the infiltration increased the critical shear stress and decreased water discharge and then increased net deposition for the saturation and 5 cm seepage head conditions the surface changes were mostly symmetrically distributed around 0 and the negative outliers were caused by the slight scouring at the outlets for the 10 cm seepage head condition the medians of the surface elevation changes were close to 0 for most runs but more negative observations were obtained which was the result of exfiltration causing critical shear stress decreases and water discharge increases the bed elevation changes due to subsurface hydrology variations shown in fig 6 indicate most runs closely approached equilibrium conditions and this was useful for selecting the representative run for a specific surface and subsurface hydrologic condition the results of the wilcoxon test for surface changes of each replication for each treatment are shown in fig 7 and the null hypothesis was that no significant surface changes were observed after each run compared to the original surface the p values were classified based on the confidence levels 95 99 and 99 9 for saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most runs with 95 confidence which indicates that close to equilibrium conditions were obtained for most runs under these three subsurface hydrologic conditions for the free drainage condition infiltration caused net deposition which enlarged the surface changes after each run and made it harder to reach the equilibrium condition the seven runs with no significant differences at the 95 confidence level were then considered when selecting representative runs for the respective surface hydrologic conditions the results of the kruskal wallis chi test are shown in fig 8 as the comparison between replicates if the null hypothesis of no significant differences was obtained between replicates it means the runs were truly replicates of each other and the alternative hypothesis is that the surface changes of at least two runs were different from each other for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition the dashed line indicates p values equal to 0 05 for a confidence level 95 for most designed surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions calculated p values were greater than 0 05 which means no significant differences were obtained between replicates with 95 confidence the results showed most replicates were effective there were some conditions showing significant differences within at least two replicates which were caused by the accumulated surface changes for instance the p value was less than 0 05 for runs under the free drainage condition with water discharge 0 12 10 2 m2 s 1 and fed sediment rate of 1 2 g s 1 the respective surface measurements in fig 6 show continuing net deposition for the downslope bottom 1 0 m area from run1 to run3 the upslope net detachment and downslope net deposition caused slight decreases of slope steepness and then increased net deposition in the upslope area of run4 and more detachment in the downslope area hence the accumulated surface changes increased the differences between the original surface and the surface before run4 which resulted in the significant differences between run3 and run4 in this study both the spatial change of sediment transport as slope length increased and the surface elevation changes showed most runs closely approximated equilibrium conditions 3 2 2 measured sediment transport capacity under detachment limited condition and transport limited condition the sediment transport values in rill 3 and rill 4 2 m long and 3 m long under all subsurface conditions for designed water discharge 0 0012 m2 s 1 are shown in fig 9 for free drainage saturation and the 5 cm seepage head conditions sediment transport capacities were observed by introducing sediment with two rates greater than the equilibrium value and one rate lower than the value for the 10 cm seepage head condition sediment transport capacity was measured by feeding sediment at one rate greater than and at one rate lower than the equilibrium value therefore the sediment transport capacity values were measured under both detachment limited and transport limited conditions according to fig 9 the sediment transport capacities were obtained for all considered subsurface hydrologic conditions given that relatively similar measurements were observed between the 2 m long rill and the 3 m long rill for almost all replicates for a given subsurface hydrologic condition similar observed transport capacity values were obtained under detachment limited and transport limited conditions which indicated there was only one equilibrium value of sediment transport for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition on uniform sediment particles for most replicates observed sediment transport values were very close between the 2 m long and 3 m long flumes but there were some runs that had observations with some differences for instance measured sediment transport values of run 1 under the free drainage conditions were greater for the 2 m long rill than for the 3 m long rill the differences may be the result of different bed surfaces of these two rills even though the same surface and subsurface conditions were designed and used in the experiments given that micro surface topography changes cannot be avoided the differences indicated the need for more replicates in order to increase the accuracy of the sediment transport capacity determinations for the comparison of observations under detachment limited and transport limited conditions the impacts of the upslope sediment feeding speed on measured sediment transport capacity was estimated using the jrfit joint ranking estimates for cluster correlated data method kloke et al 2009 in this study measured sediment transport capacity data were classified into three clusters based on the approximations of measured water discharge for each subsurface hydrologic condition for instance data under the free drainage condition were clustered based on water discharge around 0 0010 0 0012 and 0 0014 m2 s 1 table 4 shows the comparison of sediment transport obtained with different sediment feeding speed for each cluster p values were 0 92 0 96 0 81 and 0 50 for free drainage saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage conditions which were greater than 0 1 and showed no significant differences obtained at the 0 1 level therefore no significant differences of sediment transport were observed for the different sediment feeding speeds which confirmed that there were no significant differences of measured sediment transport capacities by using the detachment limited method or the transport limited method when comparing the results with the study of polyakov and nearing 2003 which found different equilibrium values under detachment limited and transport limited conditions the differences may be explained by the following reasons first the application of cohesionless sands removed the impacts of clay dispersion and aggregate breakdown for studies with soil particles polyakov and nearing 2003 the particle size distribution is complicated especially when introducing dry soil into inflow the rapid wetting process may cause flaking and aggregate breakdown and generate finer particles both the particle size distribution and the density can be influenced by the wetting process which can cause differences in equilibrium sediment transport values obtained at the end of a flume in this study the introduction of primary sand particles into inflow did not allow for any aggregate breakdown which made it easier to compare the observations under detachment limited and transport limited conditions second the use of relatively uniform sands can diminish the impacts of sediment size selectivity in the study of rose et al 1983 most of their flume surface was covered by deposited particles when the sediment transport reached transport capacity as we know the selective deposition of coarser sediment particles increased the component of coarse particles on the surface during the experiments when using uniform sands in this study the sediment size selectivity can be ignored and the particle size distribution of the sand surface was spatially and dynamically identical in the experiments given that the same sands were introduced at the top of the flume there were no size differences between introduced sediment and detached sediment from all studies transport capacity was surely affected by the studied particles and the variables for particle size and particle density were included in almost all previous transport capacity equations wang et al 2019 therefore uniform cohesionless sands were used in this study to establish a relatively stable experimental environment which gave simpler and more trustworthy comparison results between detachment limited and transport limited conditions the results on uniform sands were the basis for soil studies with different size particles the observations from different uniform particles were widely used for the generation of sediment transport capacity equations govers 1990 for better prediction of soil which is a combination of different size particles 3 3 impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on measured transport capacity measured sediment transport values of rill 4 are shown in table 5 which were closest to capacities compared to other rills rill 1 rill 2 or rill 3 the water discharge in table 5 for each subsurface hydrologic condition was the clear water discharge at the end of the flume which was calculated based on the water mass water density sample time and rill width obtained in each sediment and water sample given that high hydraulic conductivity sands were used in this study the effects of infiltration on water discharge were significant from table 4 the decrease of water discharge by infiltration was 0 0002 to 0 0004 m2 s 1 for the free drainage condition compared to the impacts of infiltration the increase of water discharge caused by exfiltration was limited for the saturation condition the water discharge at the end of the flume was almost the same as that of the inflow the increases were no more than 0 0001 m2 s 1 for all saturation and seepage conditions the subsurface hydrologic impacts on sediment transport capacity were studied using the jrfit method with experimental data clustered based on approximations of measured water discharge table 6 shows the comparison between different subsurface hydrologic conditions measurements under free drainage and saturation condition were chosen as references and the observed p values represent the changes in the other conditions from the references when the reference was data under the free drainage condition changes were obtained for water discharge around 0 0012 or 0 0014 m2 s 1 the p values were 0 0060 0 000017 and 0 00020 which were all less than 0 05 the results showed significant differences of measured transport capacities under saturation and seepage conditions compared to the free drainage condition which indicates it is necessary to consider the increase of transport capacity when changing subsurface hydrologic conditions from free drainage to saturation or seepage when the reference was data under saturation conditions changes were obtained for water discharge around 0 0012 0 0014 and 0 0017 m2 s 1 the p values were then greater than 0 05 and indicated no significant differences obtained between saturation and seepage conditions with 95 confidence however the p value was 0 076 when comparing the changes of observations from saturation to the 10 cm seepage head condition which is close to 0 05 and was significant at the 0 1 level therefore even though the transport capacity increase was not significant from saturation to the 10 cm seepage head for the experimental conditions in this study it is too early to say that there are no significant changes in sediment transport capacity between saturation and seepage conditions for other hydrologic conditions from previous studies the impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport included the decrease of soil strength and the increase of water discharge caused by exfiltration both changes of soil strength and water discharge were considered in this study and the effects of these two factors resulted in a large increase of transport capacity from drainage to saturation fig 10 according to the results of measured critical shear stress and rill erodibility under different subsurface hydrologic conditions the soil strength critical shear stress decreased from drainage to seepage transport capacity increased as water discharge increased the relationship between water discharge and measured transport capacity is shown in fig 10 for all subsurface hydrologic conditions considered when the subsurface hydrologic condition changed from free drainage to saturation measured transport capacities increased about 14 when the condition changed from saturation to 10 cm seepage head measured transport capacities increased but only slightly as water discharge increased the differences between measurements of free drainage and saturation increased the results of the dramatic increase of transport capacity from free drainage to saturation conditions agreed with the observations of huang and laflen 1996 their study emphasized the importance of subsurface hydrologic conditions and serious soil erosion problems can happen on saturated or seeping soils even though the surface discharge may not be great according to zhang et al 2009 transport capacity increased as the power of water discharge based on their experiments on non erodible beds the power regression lines between water discharge and transport capacity are shown in fig 10 and the coefficient values are shown in table 7 our results agreed with zhang et al 2009 that transport capacity increased as a power function of water discharge but the coefficients were different for different subsurface hydrologic conditions given more scattered observations under the free drainage condition compared to that under the other conditions a lower r2 value was obtained as shown in table 7 the r2 values were 0 909 0 875 and 0 904 for saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions respectively which indicated that the relationship between water discharge and transport capacity agreed well with a power relationship the exponents of water discharge were 1 476 1 258 and 1 318 for saturation 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions respectively which were close to the value of 1 237 obtained in zhang et al 2009 and the average value of 1 4 reported by prosser and rustomji 2000 the experiments of zhang et al 2009 were conducted on non erodible beds which may be close to saturation or seepage conditions the differences in the exponents of water discharge observed in this study and those in previous literature might have resulted from subsurface hydrologic impacts and sediment size distribution differences for the free drainage condition even though the r2 value was 0 451 it was not great enough to determine whether the relationship between the water discharge and the sediment transport capacity followed a power relationship from the previous analysis the impacts of infiltration on water discharge were more outstanding than exfiltration given water discharge decreased 0 0002 to 0 0004 m2 s 1 under free drainage condition and increased less than 0 0001 m2 s 1 under seepage condition the biases caused by infiltration increased the differences of surface changes between replicates flows with lower water discharge were more sensitive to the micro surface changes which gave more scattered observations under the free drainage condition therefore more work will be required to clarify the relationship between water discharge and transport capacity under free drainage based on fig 10 and table 7 the increase of soil lost can be significant when the subsurface hydrologic condition changed from drainage to saturation or seepage soil erosion models should consider the subsurface hydrologic impacts for better predictions based on the measurements of surface changes for rill 4 the values closest to equilibrium were selected as the sediment transport capacities given minimum surface changes for the bottom 1 5 m of the rill which is shown in table 8 in this study 107 runs were conducted to meet the requirement of large numbers of replicates to determine equilibrium value and compare observations under detachment limited and transport limited conditions and only one measured equilibrium sediment transport was selected to represent the final transport capacity value for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition according to the measurements reported in table 8 when the subsurface condition changed from free drainage to saturation transport capacities increased 13 for 0 0012 m2 s 1 and 15 for 0 0014 m2 s 1 for seepage conditions the differences between measured transport capacities were limited further experiments are required in order to determine the quantitative impacts of subsurface hydrologic conditions on sediment transport capacities 4 conclusions in this study 107 laboratory experimental runs were conducted for the estimation of subsurface hydrologic impacts on sediment transport capacities in rills the results indicated that the subsurface hydrology affected the transport capacities through impacts on critical shear stress and water discharge first the critical shear stress decreased about 20 from the free drainage to the saturation condition for the studied sands and decreased slightly from saturation to the 10 cm seepage head condition there were no obvious differences obtained for rill erodibilities from free drainage to seepage conditions second the measured sediment transport capacities were close between detachment limited and transport limited conditions which means there was only one equilibrium sediment transport for a given surface and subsurface hydrologic condition third the observed transport capacities when subsurface hydrologic condition changed from free drainage to saturation condition and the differences between these conditions increased as water discharge increased limited increase of transport capacities was obtained between 5 cm and 10 cm seepage head conditions for a given water discharge and the differences between saturation and seepage conditions were relatively stable as water discharge increased this study emphasized the impacts of subsurface hydrology on sediment transport the soil lost increased dramatically from drainage to saturation or seepage conditions even though there was no significant increase of surface runoff according to the results of this study the determination of transport capacity in the laboratory requires the measurements of spatial sediment transport changes along increasing slope lengths and surface elevation changes in the rills more experiments are necessary with greater water discharges and steeper slopes for further quantitative estimation of

5114,cascade damming has seriously affected the hydrologic regimes and solutes transport of the river systems however the effect of damming on carbon cycle and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear in this study to reveal the effects of damming on riverine dissolved inorganic carbon dic transport the water chemistry and stable isotopic signature of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic were analyzed in the tributaries and four subtropical karst reservoirs on the pearl river in southern china from reservoir epilimnion to hypolimnion dic concentrations increased from 183 2 to 229 4 mg l 1 167 6 to 192 0 mg l 1 179 1 to 181 5 mg l 1 and 182 4 to 183 8 mg l 1 while δ13cdic decreased from 6 6 to 9 7 7 8 to 10 4 9 7 to 10 0 and 9 9 to 10 0 in the chaishitan cst longtan lt yantan yt and dahua dh reservoirs respectively our analyses suggest that primary production and organic matter degradation were two dominant processes in carbon evolution in the epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively however there was no obvious spatial heterogeneity of solutes concentration in the dh reservoir our results also suggested that cascade reservoirs had a regional damming effect and could be significantly weakened without damming or in daily regulated reservoirs furthermore δ13cdic had a significant positive relationship with the reservoir effect index ri which was affected by hydraulic retention time and water temperature in the water column of reservoirs and is useful to evaluate the thermal stratification strength this study highlights that dam constructions affected carbon transport and transformation significantly and the degree of the damming effect on the carbon cycle can be expressed by ri keywords dissolved inorganic carbon carbon isotope reservoir effect index cascade reservoirs karst 1 introduction reservoirs are used for flood control irrigation navigation and electricity generation and are considered as green sources of energy yoshikawa et al 2014 tockner and stanford 2002 hydropower contributes about 16 6 of the world s electricity generation from renewable sources ren21 2016 over the past several decades the number of dams constructed has increased dramatically at regional and global levels thereby rivers are under sustained pressure such as the losses of river connectivity a rapid decline of biodiversity increases in sediment extraction and emitting a significant amount of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere cardinale et al 2012 grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 st louis et al 2000 therefore the damming effect has attracted substantial attention from researchers worldwide to think about a sustainable environment in the future dams 2000 rivers are the main channel for material especially carbon transportation from the land to the ocean cole et al 2007 about 900 tg yr 1 1 tg 1 1012 g of terrestrial carbon is transported to the ocean through rivers of which inorganic carbon makes up about 450 tg cole et al 2007 john 1992 meybeck 1982 however due to artificial regulation free flowing large rivers in the world are not more than one third currently which would contribute large shares to the regional or global carbon budgets grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2017 mendonça et al 2017 st louis et al 2000 reported that the average fluxes of co2 and ch4 in tropical reservoirs are more than 4 times and 10 times higher than the global lake system respectively the reservoir surface water samples loss 20 of dic in the reservoir surface water compared with the released water in the wet season of some karst stratified reservoirs in the wujiang river wang et al 2020 it is suggested that the damming effect seriously changed the geochemical behavior of carbon which formed a unique river reservoir system and has gained great attention from researchers worldwide barros et al 2011 maavara et al 2020 in recent years many studies have been carried out on hydrology organic matter burial sediment interception and ghgs in the river reservoir systems barros et al 2011 best 2018 kondolf et al 2014 wang et al 2018 2019a the literature has revealed that hydraulic retention time hrt water depth and nutrient retention of rivers would be changed by damming which may contribute to the increase of bicarbonate fluxes from river to ocean olden and naiman 2010 wang et al 2020 although a few studies have been reported to evaluate the impact of reservoirs with specific indicators barros et al 2011 st louis et al 2000 liang et al 2019 the influence of cascade reservoirs on the carbon cycle is still unclear it is an important way to integrate more studies into comparative analysis to explore the damming effect on the carbon cycle however a lack of good indicators would lead to the research on reservoirs being too scattered to be effectively integrated while compared with a single reservoir cascade reservoirs may have a regional damming effect which is mainly reflected in the great difference of water chemistry in the different areas of the reservoir fan et al 2015 wang et al 2020 therefore it is urgent to understand the potential effect of river damming on carbon transportation and conduct systematic studies on carbon biogeochemical processes in the river reservoir system to understand the inherent processes and key factors affecting carbon distribution icold 2018 reported that about 23 842 reservoirs with a dam height of 15 m existed in china of which more than 68 of dams have been established in south china moreover the largest karst area in the world is in southwestern china which accounts for 15 6 of the world s total karst area ford and williams 2007 jiang et al 2014 karst areas are more sensitive to climate change than non karst areas which are regarded as an important carbon sink area through the weathering of carbonate rocks beaulieu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 carbonate weathering can consume carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere and release dissolved inorganic carbon dic into the water bodies e g rivers reservoirs lakes which is an important part of the global carbon cycle gaillardet et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 however following the damming of the karst rivers dic was severely affected by primary production carbonate precipitation co2 outgassing and other biogeochemical processes liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019b in this study four typical karst reservoirs have been studied which were on the pearl river the second largest river in china this is the first comprehensive study on the cascade reservoirs in the upstream of the pearl river where the air temperature is high all year round by the influence of the subtropical monsoon climate further systematic analyses of water chemistry and the δ13cdic were conducted to study the carbon biogeochemical process in the river reservoir system this study is useful to explore the carbon biogeochemical processes in karst river reservoir systems and key factors affecting them which will further support the building of global carbon cycle models under anthropogenic disturbance 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the pearl river is the 2nd largest river in china and 13th largest river in the world in terms of discharge located at southern china at a latitude of 21 31 26 49 n and longitude of 102 14 115 53 e with a drainage area of about 453 690 km2 the annual flow can reach 330 km3 year 1 which is about seven times higher than that of the yellow river the annual sunshine hours were 1282 2243 h and the average temperature and sunshine hours increased from upstream to downstream of the pearl river moreover the pearl river basin is affected by the subtropical monsoon climate with average annual temperature and precipitation of 14 22 c and 1200 2200 mm

fluvial sediments permian and triassic carbonate rock e g limestone and dolomite is widely distributed in the river basin and support the karst topography pu et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 in this regard we selected four reservoirs viz chaishitan cst longtan lt yantan yt and dahua dh with different regulation modes for the corresponding analysis out of four reservoirs under study table 1 cst is the first reservoir in the upper reaches of the pearl river basin and lt is the second largest reservoir in china the short distance between lt yt and dh reservoirs can help to explore the cascading influence between the reservoirs the reservoirs under study are mainly used for power generation and water transportation also the yunnan and guangxi province in the upstream area of the pearl river belong to karst landforms fig 1 the adequate precipitation and widely distributed canyon landforms in the karst river basins provide a firm structure for building dams by the year 2018 large scale reservoirs number 93 with a capacity over 108 m3 and medium sized reservoirs number 682 with a capacity from 107 to 108 m3 have been built in the pearl river basin with total water storage of 6 2 billion cubic meters prcmw 2020 2 2 sampling and analysis the water samples were collected at 15 locations including two from tributaries during april july and october of 2019 and january of 2020 to represent the spring summer autumn and winter respectively the collected samples in each season from the mainstream p1 p13 and its tributaries t1 t2 of which p1 p4 p8 and p11 are the inlets p2 p5 p6 p9 and p12 are the reservoir sites p3 p7 p10 and p13 are the outlets of the reservoir fig 1 the inflow and released water were collected at 0 5 m below the surface layer of the river and water profile

through a 0 45 μm membrane whatman inc whereas water samples for doc analysis were filtered through 0 7 μm filter membrane waterman gf f which was pre heated at 450 c the filtered samples were packed in hdpe bottles and stored at 20 c before analysis the total carbonate alkalinity was titrated with 0 02 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid within 12 h using a titrimeter brand 4760161 telmer and veizer 1999 wang et al 2020 the cation samples for ca2 analysis were acidified with purified hno3 to keep ph 2 and then the samples were tested by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp

standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb the overall experimental accuracy for δ13c measurements was 0 3 all samples were analyzed in the school of earth system science tianjin university flows and meteorological data were obtained online from the ministry of water resources www mwr gov cn and the china meteorological administration www cma gov cn 2 3 calculations methods according to henry s law pco2 was expressed in μatm and calculated according to the following equation raymond et al 1997 telmer and veizer 1999 1 p co 2 h 2 co 3 k co 2 where h2co3 means total concentrations of hydrated co2 and k co2 is the henry constant of co2 at a given temperature to reveal the main influencing factors and processes related to dic migration and transformation in cascade reservoirs the changing degree of dic and ca2 was calculated according to the following equations wang et al 2019b 2 δ dic 100 dic sample dic 15 m dic 15 m 3 δ ca 2 100 ca 2 sample ca 2 15 m ca 2 15 m where δ dic δ ca2 represent the changes of dic and ca2 in depth profiles compared with values at 15 m in the same water column the reservoir effect refers to the interaction between the reservoir and its hydrological factors whose changes may relate to water depth t hrt age and other factors of the reservoirs li et al 2018 liang et al 2019 st louis et al 2000 among the above parameters water t and depth are used widely to indicate the reservoir effect and have attracted much attention from researchers boehrer and schultze 2008 dubnyak and timchenko 2000 previous studies determined the three different layers epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion based on the variation of water t and have shown that the ratio of euphotic depth to mixing depth zeu zmix can better indicate the strength of the thermal stratification liu et al 2012 kirk and press 1994 besides water depth is an important index affecting heat transfer and nutrient circulation dubnyak and timchenko 2000 therefore according to previous studies boehrer and schultze 2008 wang et al 2020 liang et al 2019 liu et al 2012 the reservoir effect index ri m 1 was calculated based on the following equation in this study 4 r i δ t 100 d t s t b 100 t s d where ts is the surface temperature c tb represents bottom temperatures c and d is the depth m of the reservoir 3 results 3 1 hydrological and physical characteristics in the study year the average inflow of cst 31 5 m3 s 1 lt 1777 8 m3 s 1 yt 1464 6 m3 s 1 and dh 1796 8 m3 s 1 reservoir were calculated and shown in table 1 the hrt of cst lt yt and dh were 103 days 193 days 21 days and 5 days respectively the annual average air temperature ranged from 11 c to 29 5 c mean 22 4 c sd 5 1 c during the sampling period as a response the surface water temperature ranged from 15 1 c to 27 8 c mean 21 8 c sd 3 0 c fig 2 in the studied reservoirs of cst lt and yt the average water temperature increased significantly from the fluvial area to the reservoir area while the average water temperature remained stable in the dh reservoir mean 21 7 c sd 2 9 c the outflow water temperature decreased significantly in the reservoirs of lt and yt but increased in the cst reservoir 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of water chemical parameters the hydrochemical parameters of the cascade reservoirs from the cst upstream to the dh downstream reservoir showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneities fig 2 the do concentrations ranged from 4 4 to 13 0 mg l 1 mean 7 6 mg l 1 sd 1 6 mg l 1 except for the dh reservoir other reservoirs had a significant increase in the reservoir area and a decrease in the released water however the do concentrations remained stable in the water column and ranged from 6 1 to 7 2 mg l 1 mean 6 8 mg l 1 sd 0 4 mg l 1 in the dh reservoir figs 2 and 3 the trend of reservoir surface water chemical parameters such as chl mean 9 2 μg l 1 sd 15 3 μg l 1 do mean 86 9 sd 18 5 ph mean 7 9 sd 0 3 and doc mean 1 4 mg l 1 sd 0 9 mg l 1 were similar to that of do however the variations of ca2 mean 64 7 mg l 1 sd 8 4 mg l 1 and pco2 mean 2937 1 μatm sd 1913 8 μatm showed a reverse trend whereas released water of the reservoirs with non daily regulation increased significantly in the studied reservoirs water chemical parameters varied in the lentic profiles fig 3 in the wet season the cst lt and yt reservoirs showed significant thermal stratification in the lentic area and water t mean 19 3 c sd 3 9 c do mean 6 0 mg l 1 sd 3 2 mg l 1 ph mean 7 8 sd 0 3 chl mean 10 0 μg l 1 sd 16 9 μg l 1 and doc mean 1 6 mg l 1 sd 0 9 mg l 1 decreased significantly in the thermocline and remained stable in the hypolimnion however the concentrations of ca2 and pco2 were lower in the epilimnion and increased in the hypolimnion the lowest value of pco2 446 μatm was found at the air water interface of the cst which was equivalent to the atmospheric value i e 400 μatm and the highest value in the hypolimnion was 7324 μatm in the dry season the thermal stratification effect of the reservoirs was weaker than it during the wet season further variation in the other water quality parameters such as water t mean 20 6 c sd 3 8 c do mean 4 9 mg l 1 sd 2 1 mg l 1 ph mean 7 8 sd 0 2 chl mean 3 6 μg l 1 sd 5 6 μg l 1 and doc mean 1 5 mg l 1 sd 0 8 mg l 1 fell with in a narrow range the thermal stratification of water was still evident in the cst and lt reservoirs and the highest value of pco2 9804 μatm appeared at the bottom 130 m of the lt reservoir as a whole the hydrochemistry of the dh reservoir was similar to the river system and there was no obvious variation in the inflowing stratified water and the released water in the studied year 3 3 dic and δ13cdic the dic concentration mean 185 1 mg l 1 sd 21 5 in the lentic water surface area decreased significantly along the flow direction of cascade reservoirs cst lt and yt while it increased significantly in the released water the highest value 129 8 mg l 1 and the lowest value 254 2 mg l 1 of dic appeared in the cst and lt reservoirs respectively dic concentrations tended to be stable in the yt mean 182 5 mg l 1 sd 16 0 mg l 1 and the dh reservoir mean 183 8 mg l 1 sd 14 4 mg l 1 the dic concentration increased significantly along with the profiles of the cst lt and yt reservoirs and remained stable in the hypolimnion in the wet season the dic concentration increased by 41 2 129 8 183 2 mg l 1 from epilimnion to hypolimnion in the lt reservoir and increased by 0 7 194 0 195 4 mg l 1 in the dh reservoir with shallow depth however dic concentration in the hypolimnion of cst 254 2 mg l 1 was much higher than that in the lt reservoir 183 2 mg l 1 δ13cdic mean 9 1 sd 1 7 values decreased along the direction of water flow which was contrary to that of dic variation the values of δ13cdic were significantly higher in the lentic surface area mean 7 2 sd 1 9 than the fluvial area mean 8 5 sd 1 6 of the cst and the lt reservoirs and it decreased significantly in the released water mean 9 sd 1 5 further the highest value of δ13cdic was 4 8 in the epilimnion of cst whereas the lowest value was 13 4 in the released water of the yt reservoir the average δ13cdic in the dh reservoir mean 10 0 sd 1 0 was significantly lower than that in the other reservoirs mean 9 1 sd 1 5 and with little variation 3 4 reservoir effect index the correlation analysis was performed in related environmental parameters with dic concentrations and δ13cdic in the studied cascade reservoirs and the results showed that water depth and temperature were significantly correlated with dic and δ13cdic in the reservoirs of long hrt cst and lt reservoirs table 2 moreover there was no significant correlation in the reservoirs of short hrt yt and dh reservoir the reservoir effect index ri of the four reservoirs was estimated as 0 66 cst 0 21 lt 0 10 yt and 0 dh besides ri values depended on seasonal variability and were found to be larger in the wet season than in the dry season the largest value ri 1 02 was observed in april at the cst reservoir and the lowest ri 0 was in the dh reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 cascade damming effect on dic concentrations and δ13cdic dic and δ13cdic values showed obvious spatial heterogeneities along with the cascade reservoirs figs 2 and 3 the ranges of dic concentrations and δ13cdic in the lentic area of reservoirs were much wider than those in the fluvial area fig 2 these variations suggest that damming on karst river systems plays a significant role in carbon biogeochemical processes the relative mechanisms and underlying processes are discussed below in natural karst rivers dic is mainly derived from weathering of carbonate rocks which leads to the higher dic concentration than non karst rivers gaillardet et al 2019 liu and han 2020 the sampling point p1 is not affected by damming and the average dic concentrations was higher than the reservoir surface samples in the study year which is similar to the inflow water of the hongjiadu reservoir in the wujiang river wang et al 2020 however the construction of dams hindered the water velocity resulting in increased water surface temperature with a long hrt wang et al 2019b the variations in concentrations of dic and ca2 help in characterizing the migration and transformation of carbon in rivers binet et al 2020 wang et al 2019b zhong et al 2020 in this study dic and ca2 showed similar trends at different water depths having a significant positive correlation r2 0 64 fig 4 a the dic and ca2 concentrations in the epilimnion of lt and cst reservoirs were lower than those in the hypolimnion it suggested that the calcium carbonate caco3 precipitation and dissolution are two important processes in the epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively however dic and ca2 concentrations were more concentrated with seasonal differences in the yt and dh reservoirs which suggest that reservoirs with short hrts may have limited influence on water chemical parameters fig 4 a a pattern diagram has been presented to understand the biogeochemical processes that affect the behavior of carbon fig 4 it was found that dic ca2 and δ13cdic could be used to explain the exact processes involved in the river reservoir system wang et al 2019b 2020 in this study the significant positive relationship of δ dic and δ ca2 could help to understand the processes that affected the dic transport and transformation in different reservoirs fig 4 b due to human regulation and air temperature increases the water temperature increased significantly in the epilimnion after forming a stable thermal stratification in the reservoirs of cst lt and yt in the wet season the results showed that δ13cdic values became heavy in the epilimnion of the above three reservoirs and the dic and ca2 decreased simultaneously moreover the surface high chl contents and do 100 in the wet season of the three reservoirs indicating that the process of phytoplankton photosynthesizes in the epilimnion the photosynthesis of phytoplankton can consume dic e g hco3 and co2 aq and prefer to use the lighter 12c resulting in heavy δ13cdic and high ph maberly et al 2012 pu et al 2020 the significant positive relationship between chl and δ13cdic further indicates that the carbon was influenced by the primary productivity in the dh lt and yt reservoirs table 2 moreover intense phytoplankton photosynthesis would increase the absorption of shortwave light which could slow down the heat transfer in the profile dubnyak and timchenko 2000 boehrer and schultze 2008 therefore the epilimnion is much shallower than other layers fig 3 and the hydrochemical parameters e g water t ph and do varied notably wang et al 2020 cui et al 2017 the saturated status of caco3 was formed under high ph and water temperature conditions which leads to a decrease of ca2 and dic in the epilimnion liu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 further the rapid decrease of dic content and the increase of ph could cause low pco2 due to the phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion of cst lt and yt reservoirs jiang et al 2020 pu et al 2020 however all measured data was distributed around the origin of the dh reservoir with a short hrt indicating a weak damming effect on water chemistry fig 4 b the above results suggested that the epilimnion of the lt cst and yt reservoirs with obvious thermal stratification was mainly affected by phytoplankton photosynthesis caco3 precipitation and co2 outgassing which were mainly distributed in the first quadrant fig 4 b in the second quadrant fig 4 b δ dic increased while δ ca2 and δ13cdic decreased indicating that dic may be affected by both groundwater input and om degradation vachon et al 2020 in the third quadrant fig 4 b ph t chl and do decreased significantly while dic and pco2 increased significantly indicating that dic in the water may be mainly from the degradation of om and dissolution of caco3 of samples from the thermocline and hypolimnion binet et al 2020 besides δ13cdic was found to be negative in the thermocline and hypolimnion which further proved that om degradation was one of the key processes affecting dic concentration therefore high pco2 in thermocline and hypolimnion would lead to co2 outgassing and provid co2 for phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion as a response primary production also produced do and om which helped in the process of om oxidizing and decomposing in the thermocline and hypolimnion in the fourth quadrant fig 4 b decreased δ dic and increased δ ca2 may be caused by rainfall and mixing of water in the process of water flowing from river to reservoir area which was mainly reflected in the lentic surface of the cst reservoir wang et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 in the mainstream along the water flow direction of the cascade reservoirs ph dic and doc decreased while pco2 increased indicating that the regional damming effect with a long hrt and high air temperature may enhance the carbon emission in the downstream wang et al 2020 moreover ph and do decreased significantly whereas pco2 increased rapidly in the released water of the cst lt and yt reservoirs indicating that the rapid influx of atmospheric o2 with a high air temperature will accelerate the degradation of om and cause a increase in pco2 pu et al 2020 due to the high air temperature in july thermal stratification was most obvious in reservoirs with a long hrt and showed similar characteristics of cascade reservoirs built on the wujiang river and jialing river cui et al 2017 wang et al 2020 taking the site p1 δ13cdic 10 6 with no damming effect as a reference δ13cdic decreased to 13 4 in the yt reservoir in july however δ13cdic increased to 11 3 in the dh reservoir where the annual average was 9 9 0 9 our results showed a similar trend with other karst cascade reservoirs in the wujiang river 8 8 to 10 1 and the jialing river 12 3 to 12 7 cui et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the above results showed that dam construction may cause a regional damming effect the increase of pco2 and decrease both ph and δ13cdic and further help to understand its effect on the carbon cycle however when thermal stratification became weak in the downstream the water chemical characteristics would be similar to the natural river system in this case the impact of the reservoirs on carbon biogeochemical processes may depend on the reservoir itself and the regional damming effect was localized in the river reservoir system 4 2 the enlightenment of reservoir effect index on carbon biogeochemical processes previous studies revealed that the effect of river damming on nutrients was influenced by hrt reservoir age latitude climate and water depth grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 st louis et al 2000 kumar et al 2019 but no clear standard for the impact assessment of river damming has been reported yet δ13cdic is widely used in studying carbon evolution in inland waters as an indicator to understand the geochemical behavior of carbon maberly et al 2012 pu et al 2020 telmer and veizer 1999 zhang and liu 2014 in this study hydrochemistry and isotope indicate that dic was mainly affected by the weathering of carbonate rocks in the fluvial area due to high dic content and light δ13cdic values li et al 2008 liu and han 2020 zhong et al 2018 in the reservoirs with obvious thermal stratification dic was mainly influenced by primary productivity and om degradation in the epilimnion and hypolimnion maberly et al 2012 wang et al 2020 moreover most of the water is discharged from the bottom of dams which is mainly from the hypolimnion therefore dic is mainly affected by co2 outgassing om degradation and carbonate dissolution kumar et al 2019 mendonça et al 2017 wang et al 2019b in this study we found that both water depth and water temperature had positive relationships with dic and δ13cdic in the cst and the lt reservoir displaying a thermal stratification effect table 2 water temperature is one of the most important drivers for the formation of thermal stratification in river reservoir systems elçi 2008 liang et al 2019 in this study the water depth of the lt reservoir was up to 135 m which is much deeper than that of fluvial area 10 m resulting in variability of water temperature at different depths besides the elevation difference between the cst and dh reservoirs is 1485 m causing the annual average air temperature difference of 6 4 c and then leading to difference in water column temperature table 1 it further suggested that the reservoir effect cannot be characterized directly by the different reservoirs water temperatures from the above discussion the damming effect on water thermal stratification may be better characterized by the ri ratio of δt to depth as shown in eq 4 and it is found that ri has a strong linear relationship with δ13cdic which are found to be high in the reservoirs with a long hrt fig 5 a however ri and δ13cdic values are not found to be high in the lt reservoir with the longest hrt which suggests that although hrt is an important driver it may not be the determining factor since the 1990s co2 emissions from reservoirs have attracted much attention and oc degradation was regarded as an important source of co2 duchemin et al 1995 kumar et al 2019 li et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 st louis et al 2000 moreover the doc concentration is much higher than that of the chishui river which is not influenced by the damming effect in the karst area xu et al 2020 in this study ri and doc had a good linear relationship and with the increase of ri doc concentration increased and pco2 decreased indicating that ri can be an important index to investigate the strength of primary productivity which would further help to understand the processes behind the carbon cycle fig 5 b to test the indicative role of ri in other karst reservoirs we compiled data of cascade reservoirs in the mainstream of the wujiang river jialing river and the hf reservoir of the maotiao river and plotted them together with the data in this study cui et al 2017 wang et al 2016 2020 the results show that ri and δ13cdic have a positive relationship r2 0 65 p 0 001 fig 6 which reveal that δ13cdic in the surface water is distinctly different in the reservoirs with different hrts further it indicates that δ13cdic of reservoirs with similar hrt also have significant differences which suggest that reservoir effect also depends on the reservoir characteristics generally large ri represents a strong reservoir effect which is mainly reflected in the significant thermal stratification of the reservoir the ri can also help to explain why the highest value of pco2 occurred in the reservoir hypolimnion of lt reservoir in october in october the stratification of the water may be more pronounced due to the longer hrt higher temperature and less disturbance by precipitation in the lt reservoir the ri value in january 0 14 april 0 20 july 0 40 and october 0 33 further indicate that the lt reservoir still had a strong reservoir effect in october fig 4 moreover intensified phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion and accelerated degradation of om in the hypolimnion resulted in higher pco2 in the released water which suggest that ri can better explore the reservoir effect by combining the hydrochemical characteristics and geographical characteristics therefore compared with hrt the application of both ri and isotopic signatures will help to investigate the strength of the damming effect on the carbon cycle and further provide theoretical support for the evaluation of the reservoir effect in karst areas 5 conclusion in this study four cascade reservoirs in the subtropical region were selected to study the effect of damming on riverine carbon transport and the underlying processes using water chemistry and stable isotopic signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic results revealed that after cascade damming in karst rivers the main influence processes of dic in karst rivers were transformed from carbonate weathering to the jointly regulation by carbonate weathering carbonate precipitation primary production and om degradation after a comprehensive analysis of hydrochemistry and δ13cdic we proposed the concept of reservoir effect index ri which is a more sensitive indicator than hrt and could provide a more accurate indication of damming effect on the carbon cycle and inherent processes involved by compiling δ13cdic of other karst reservoirs it is proved that ri can be used to represent the stratification strength of reservoirs and further help to understand the degree of damming effect on the carbon cycle our study can act as a reference for other karst damming rivers to assess the impact of damming on the carbon cycle so that mitigation measures could be implemented in advance to reduce its emission in the future however numerous factors affect the carbon characteristics after building dams on rivers therefore additional work needs to be done in the future such as multi isotope analyses higher frequency monitoring and application of hydrodynamics which will help to further understand the migration and transformation of carbon in river reservoir systems credit authorship contribution statement wanfa wang formal

5114,cascade damming has seriously affected the hydrologic regimes and solutes transport of the river systems however the effect of damming on carbon cycle and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear in this study to reveal the effects of damming on riverine dissolved inorganic carbon dic transport the water chemistry and stable isotopic signature of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic were analyzed in the tributaries and four subtropical karst reservoirs on the pearl river in southern china from reservoir epilimnion to hypolimnion dic concentrations increased from 183 2 to 229 4 mg l 1 167 6 to 192 0 mg l 1 179 1 to 181 5 mg l 1 and 182 4 to 183 8 mg l 1 while δ13cdic decreased from 6 6 to 9 7 7 8 to 10 4 9 7 to 10 0 and 9 9 to 10 0 in the chaishitan cst longtan lt yantan yt and dahua dh reservoirs respectively our analyses suggest that primary production and organic matter degradation were two dominant processes in carbon evolution in the epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively however there was no obvious spatial heterogeneity of solutes concentration in the dh reservoir our results also suggested that cascade reservoirs had a regional damming effect and could be significantly weakened without damming or in daily regulated reservoirs furthermore δ13cdic had a significant positive relationship with the reservoir effect index ri which was affected by hydraulic retention time and water temperature in the water column of reservoirs and is useful to evaluate the thermal stratification strength this study highlights that dam constructions affected carbon transport and transformation significantly and the degree of the damming effect on the carbon cycle can be expressed by ri keywords dissolved inorganic carbon carbon isotope reservoir effect index cascade reservoirs karst 1 introduction reservoirs are used for flood control irrigation navigation and electricity generation and are considered as green sources of energy yoshikawa et al 2014 tockner and stanford 2002 hydropower contributes about 16 6 of the world s electricity generation from renewable sources ren21 2016 over the past several decades the number of dams constructed has increased dramatically at regional and global levels thereby rivers are under sustained pressure such as the losses of river connectivity a rapid decline of biodiversity increases in sediment extraction and emitting a significant amount of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere cardinale et al 2012 grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 st louis et al 2000 therefore the damming effect has attracted substantial attention from researchers worldwide to think about a sustainable environment in the future dams 2000 rivers are the main channel for material especially carbon transportation from the land to the ocean cole et al 2007 about 900 tg yr 1 1 tg 1 1012 g of terrestrial carbon is transported to the ocean through rivers of which inorganic carbon makes up about 450 tg cole et al 2007 john 1992 meybeck 1982 however due to artificial regulation free flowing large rivers in the world are not more than one third currently which would contribute large shares to the regional or global carbon budgets grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2017 mendonça et al 2017 st louis et al 2000 reported that the average fluxes of co2 and ch4 in tropical reservoirs are more than 4 times and 10 times higher than the global lake system respectively the reservoir surface water samples loss 20 of dic in the reservoir surface water compared with the released water in the wet season of some karst stratified reservoirs in the wujiang river wang et al 2020 it is suggested that the damming effect seriously changed the geochemical behavior of carbon which formed a unique river reservoir system and has gained great attention from researchers worldwide barros et al 2011 maavara et al 2020 in recent years many studies have been carried out on hydrology organic matter burial sediment interception and ghgs in the river reservoir systems barros et al 2011 best 2018 kondolf et al 2014 wang et al 2018 2019a the literature has revealed that hydraulic retention time hrt water depth and nutrient retention of rivers would be changed by damming which may contribute to the increase of bicarbonate fluxes from river to ocean olden and naiman 2010 wang et al 2020 although a few studies have been reported to evaluate the impact of reservoirs with specific indicators barros et al 2011 st louis et al 2000 liang et al 2019 the influence of cascade reservoirs on the carbon cycle is still unclear it is an important way to integrate more studies into comparative analysis to explore the damming effect on the carbon cycle however a lack of good indicators would lead to the research on reservoirs being too scattered to be effectively integrated while compared with a single reservoir cascade reservoirs may have a regional damming effect which is mainly reflected in the great difference of water chemistry in the different areas of the reservoir fan et al 2015 wang et al 2020 therefore it is urgent to understand the potential effect of river damming on carbon transportation and conduct systematic studies on carbon biogeochemical processes in the river reservoir system to understand the inherent processes and key factors affecting carbon distribution icold 2018 reported that about 23 842 reservoirs with a dam height of 15 m existed in china of which more than 68 of dams have been established in south china moreover the largest karst area in the world is in southwestern china which accounts for 15 6 of the world s total karst area ford and williams 2007 jiang et al 2014 karst areas are more sensitive to climate change than non karst areas which are regarded as an important carbon sink area through the weathering of carbonate rocks beaulieu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 carbonate weathering can consume carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere and release dissolved inorganic carbon dic into the water bodies e g rivers reservoirs lakes which is an important part of the global carbon cycle gaillardet et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 however following the damming of the karst rivers dic was severely affected by primary production carbonate precipitation co2 outgassing and other biogeochemical processes liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019b in this study four typical karst reservoirs have been studied which were on the pearl river the second largest river in china this is the first comprehensive study on the cascade reservoirs in the upstream of the pearl river where the air temperature is high all year round by the influence of the subtropical monsoon climate further systematic analyses of water chemistry and the δ13cdic were conducted to study the carbon biogeochemical process in the river reservoir system this study is useful to explore the carbon biogeochemical processes in karst river reservoir systems and key factors affecting them which will further support the building of global carbon cycle models under anthropogenic disturbance 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the pearl river is the 2nd largest river in china and 13th largest river in the world in terms of discharge located at southern china at a latitude of 21 31 26 49 n and longitude of 102 14 115 53 e with a drainage area of about 453 690 km2 the annual flow can reach 330 km3 year 1 which is about seven times higher than that of the yellow river the annual sunshine hours were 1282 2243 h and the average temperature and sunshine hours increased from upstream to downstream of the pearl river moreover the pearl river basin is affected by the subtropical monsoon climate with average annual temperature and precipitation of 14 22 c and 1200 2200 mm respectively and more than 80 of the annual runoff occurs in the wet season april to september and 20 occurs in the dry season october to march as altitude decreased the average annual discharge of cst 48 4 m3 s 1 lt 1639 4 m3 s 1 yt 1760 m3 s 1 and dh 1990 m3 s 1 show a significant increase table 1 in the pearl river basin minerals outcrop from precambrian metamorphic rocks to quaternary fluvial sediments permian and triassic carbonate rock e g limestone and dolomite is widely distributed in the river basin and support the karst topography pu et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 in this regard we selected four reservoirs viz chaishitan cst longtan lt yantan yt and dahua dh with different regulation modes for the corresponding analysis out of four reservoirs under study table 1 cst is the first reservoir in the upper reaches of the pearl river basin and lt is the second largest reservoir in china the short distance between lt yt and dh reservoirs can help to explore the cascading influence between the reservoirs the reservoirs under study are mainly used for power generation and water transportation also the yunnan and guangxi province in the upstream area of the pearl river belong to karst landforms fig 1 the adequate precipitation and widely distributed canyon landforms in the karst river basins provide a firm structure for building dams by the year 2018 large scale reservoirs number 93 with a capacity over 108 m3 and medium sized reservoirs number 682 with a capacity from 107 to 108 m3 have been built in the pearl river basin with total water storage of 6 2 billion cubic meters prcmw 2020 2 2 sampling and analysis the water samples were collected at 15 locations including two from tributaries during april july and october of 2019 and january of 2020 to represent the spring summer autumn and winter respectively the collected samples in each season from the mainstream p1 p13 and its tributaries t1 t2 of which p1 p4 p8 and p11 are the inlets p2 p5 p6 p9 and p12 are the reservoir sites p3 p7 p10 and p13 are the outlets of the reservoir fig 1 the inflow and released water were collected at 0 5 m below the surface layer of the river and water profile

temperature t dissolved oxygen do and chlorophyll chl were determined in situ by an automated multiparameter profiler model ysi exo1 water samples except dissolved organic carbon doc were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane whatman inc whereas water samples for doc analysis were filtered through 0 7 μm filter membrane waterman gf f which was pre heated at 450 c the filtered samples were packed in hdpe bottles and stored at 20 c before analysis the total carbonate alkalinity was titrated with 0 02 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid within 12 h using a titrimeter brand 4760161 telmer and veizer 1999 wang et al 2020 the cation samples for ca2 analysis were acidified with purified hno3 to keep ph 2 and then the samples were tested by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes with 5 uncertainty the concentrations of doc was analyzed using the aurora 1030 toc analyzer oi analytical 5 uncertainty with tworeplicates the δ13cdic sample was filtered in the field through 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filters and then injected 2 ml into a 12 ml vacuumed labco bottle containing 1 ml of 85 phosphoric acid with three replicates to reduce the uncertainty further δ13cdic was tested by gasbench ii device interfaced with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer irms finnigan delta v in the laboratory the results were calibrated by the standards nbs 18 and expressed as a deviation from the standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb the overall experimental accuracy for δ13c measurements was 0 3 all samples were analyzed in the school of earth system science tianjin university flows and meteorological data were obtained online from the ministry of water resources www mwr gov cn and the china meteorological administration www cma gov cn 2 3 calculations methods according to henry s law pco2 was expressed in μatm and calculated according to the following equation raymond et al 1997 telmer and veizer 1999 1 p co 2 h 2 co 3 k co 2 where h2co3 means total concentrations of hydrated co2 and k co2 is the henry constant of co2 at a given temperature to reveal the main influencing factors and processes related to dic migration and transformation in cascade reservoirs the changing degree of dic and ca2 was calculated according to the following equations wang et al 2019b 2 δ dic 100 dic sample dic 15 m dic 15 m 3 δ ca 2 100 ca 2 sample ca 2 15 m ca 2 15 m where δ dic δ ca2 represent the changes of dic and ca2 in depth profiles compared with values at 15 m in the same water column the reservoir effect refers to the interaction between the reservoir and its hydrological factors whose changes may relate to water depth t hrt age and other factors of the reservoirs li et al 2018 liang et al 2019 st louis et al 2000 among the above parameters water t and depth are used widely to indicate the reservoir effect and have attracted much attention from researchers boehrer and schultze 2008 dubnyak and timchenko 2000 previous studies determined the three different layers epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion based on the variation of water t and have shown that the ratio of euphotic depth to mixing depth zeu zmix can better indicate the strength of the thermal stratification liu et al 2012 kirk and press 1994 besides water depth is an important index affecting heat transfer and nutrient circulation dubnyak and timchenko 2000 therefore according to previous studies boehrer and schultze 2008 wang et al 2020 liang et al 2019 liu et al 2012 the reservoir effect index ri m 1 was calculated based on the following equation in this study 4 r i δ t 100 d t s t b 100 t s d where ts is the surface temperature c tb represents bottom temperatures c and d is the depth m of the reservoir 3 results 3 1 hydrological and physical characteristics in the study year the average inflow of cst 31 5 m3 s 1 lt 1777 8 m3 s 1 yt 1464 6 m3 s 1 and dh 1796 8 m3 s 1 reservoir were calculated and shown in table 1 the hrt of cst lt yt and dh were 103 days 193 days 21 days and 5 days respectively the annual average air temperature ranged from 11 c to 29 5 c mean 22 4 c sd 5 1 c during the sampling period as a response the surface water temperature ranged from 15 1 c to 27 8 c mean 21 8 c sd 3 0 c fig 2 in the studied reservoirs of cst lt and yt the average water temperature increased significantly from the fluvial area to the reservoir area while the average water temperature remained stable in the dh reservoir mean 21 7 c sd 2 9 c the outflow water temperature decreased significantly in the reservoirs of lt and yt but increased in the cst reservoir 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of water chemical parameters the hydrochemical parameters of the cascade reservoirs from the cst upstream to the dh downstream reservoir showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneities fig 2 the do concentrations ranged from 4 4 to 13 0 mg l 1 mean 7 6 mg l 1 sd 1 6 mg l 1 except for the dh reservoir other reservoirs had a significant increase in the reservoir area and a decrease in the released water however the do concentrations remained stable in the water column and ranged from 6 1 to 7 2 mg l 1 mean 6 8 mg l 1 sd 0 4 mg l 1 in the dh reservoir figs 2 and 3 the trend of reservoir surface water chemical parameters such as chl mean 9 2 μg l 1 sd 15 3 μg l 1 do mean 86 9 sd 18 5 ph mean 7 9 sd 0 3 and doc mean 1 4 mg l 1 sd 0 9 mg l 1 were similar to that of do however the variations of ca2 mean 64 7 mg l 1 sd 8 4 mg l 1 and pco2 mean 2937 1 μatm sd 1913 8 μatm showed a reverse trend whereas released water of the reservoirs with non daily regulation increased significantly in the studied reservoirs water chemical parameters varied in the lentic profiles fig 3 in the wet season the cst lt and yt reservoirs showed significant thermal stratification in the lentic area and water t mean 19 3 c sd 3 9 c do mean 6 0 mg l 1 sd 3 2 mg l 1 ph mean 7 8 sd 0 3 chl mean 10 0 μg l 1 sd 16 9 μg l 1 and doc mean 1 6 mg l 1 sd 0 9 mg l 1 decreased significantly in the thermocline and remained stable in the hypolimnion however the concentrations of ca2 and pco2 were lower in the epilimnion and increased in the hypolimnion the lowest value of pco2 446 μatm was found at the air water interface of the cst which was equivalent to the atmospheric value i e 400 μatm and the highest value in the hypolimnion was 7324 μatm in the dry season the thermal stratification effect of the reservoirs was weaker than it during the wet season further variation in the other water quality parameters such as water t mean 20 6 c sd 3 8 c do mean 4 9 mg l 1 sd 2 1 mg l 1 ph mean 7 8 sd 0 2 chl mean 3 6 μg l 1 sd 5 6 μg l 1 and doc mean 1 5 mg l 1 sd 0 8 mg l 1 fell with in a narrow range the thermal stratification of water was still evident in the cst and lt reservoirs and the highest value of pco2 9804 μatm appeared at the bottom 130 m of the lt reservoir as a whole the hydrochemistry of the dh reservoir was similar to the river system and there was no obvious variation in the inflowing stratified water and the released water in the studied year 3 3 dic and δ13cdic the dic concentration mean 185 1 mg l 1 sd 21 5 in the lentic water surface area decreased significantly along the flow direction of cascade reservoirs cst lt and yt while it increased significantly in the released water the highest value 129 8 mg l 1 and the lowest value 254 2 mg l 1 of dic appeared in the cst and lt reservoirs respectively dic concentrations tended to be stable in the yt mean 182 5 mg l 1 sd 16 0 mg l 1 and the dh reservoir mean 183 8 mg l 1 sd 14 4 mg l 1 the dic concentration increased significantly along with the profiles of the cst lt and yt reservoirs and remained stable in the hypolimnion in the wet season the dic concentration increased by 41 2 129 8 183 2 mg l 1 from epilimnion to hypolimnion in the lt reservoir and increased by 0 7 194 0 195 4 mg l 1 in the dh reservoir with shallow depth however dic concentration in the hypolimnion of cst 254 2 mg l 1 was much higher than that in the lt reservoir 183 2 mg l 1 δ13cdic mean 9 1 sd 1 7 values decreased along the direction of water flow which was contrary to that of dic variation the values of δ13cdic were significantly higher in the lentic surface area mean 7 2 sd 1 9 than the fluvial area mean 8 5 sd 1 6 of the cst and the lt reservoirs and it decreased significantly in the released water mean 9 sd 1 5 further the highest value of δ13cdic was 4 8 in the epilimnion of cst whereas the lowest value was 13 4 in the released water of the yt reservoir the average δ13cdic in the dh reservoir mean 10 0 sd 1 0 was significantly lower than that in the other reservoirs mean 9 1 sd 1 5 and with little variation 3 4 reservoir effect index the correlation analysis was performed in related environmental parameters with dic concentrations and δ13cdic in the studied cascade reservoirs and the results showed that water depth and temperature were significantly correlated with dic and δ13cdic in the reservoirs of long hrt cst and lt reservoirs table 2 moreover there was no significant correlation in the reservoirs of short hrt yt and dh reservoir the reservoir effect index ri of the four reservoirs was estimated as 0 66 cst 0 21 lt 0 10 yt and 0 dh besides ri values depended on seasonal variability and were found to be larger in the wet season than in the dry season the largest value ri 1 02 was observed in april at the cst reservoir and the lowest ri 0 was in the dh reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 cascade damming effect on dic concentrations and δ13cdic dic and δ13cdic values showed obvious spatial heterogeneities along with the cascade reservoirs figs 2 and 3 the ranges of dic concentrations and δ13cdic in the lentic area of reservoirs were much wider than those in the fluvial area fig 2 these variations suggest that damming on karst river systems plays a significant role in carbon biogeochemical processes the relative mechanisms and underlying processes are discussed below in natural karst rivers dic is mainly derived from weathering of carbonate rocks which leads to the higher dic concentration than non karst rivers gaillardet et al 2019 liu and han 2020 the sampling point p1 is not affected by damming and the average dic concentrations was higher than the reservoir surface samples in the study year which is similar to the inflow water of the hongjiadu reservoir in the wujiang river wang et al 2020 however the construction of dams hindered the water velocity resulting in increased water surface temperature with a long hrt wang et al 2019b the variations in concentrations of dic and ca2 help in characterizing the migration and transformation of carbon in rivers binet et al 2020 wang et al 2019b zhong et al 2020 in this study dic and ca2 showed similar trends at different water depths having a significant positive correlation r2 0 64 fig 4 a the dic and ca2 concentrations in the epilimnion of lt and cst reservoirs were lower than those in the hypolimnion it suggested that the calcium carbonate caco3 precipitation and dissolution are two important processes in the epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively however dic and ca2 concentrations were more concentrated with seasonal differences in the yt and dh reservoirs which suggest that reservoirs with short hrts may have limited influence on water chemical parameters fig 4 a a pattern diagram has been presented to understand the biogeochemical processes that affect the behavior of carbon fig 4 it was found that dic ca2 and δ13cdic could be used to explain the exact processes involved in the river reservoir system wang et al 2019b 2020 in this study the significant positive relationship of δ dic and δ ca2 could help to understand the processes that affected the dic transport and transformation in different reservoirs fig 4 b due to human regulation and air temperature increases the water temperature increased significantly in the epilimnion after forming a stable thermal stratification in the reservoirs of cst lt and yt in the wet season the results showed that δ13cdic values became heavy in the epilimnion of the above three reservoirs and the dic and ca2 decreased simultaneously moreover the surface high chl contents and do 100 in the wet season of the three reservoirs indicating that the process of phytoplankton photosynthesizes in the epilimnion the photosynthesis of phytoplankton can consume dic e g hco3 and co2 aq and prefer to use the lighter 12c resulting in heavy δ13cdic and high ph maberly et al 2012 pu et al 2020 the significant positive relationship between chl and δ13cdic further indicates that the carbon was influenced by the primary productivity in the dh lt and yt reservoirs table 2 moreover intense phytoplankton photosynthesis would increase the absorption of shortwave light which could slow down the heat transfer in the profile dubnyak and timchenko 2000 boehrer and schultze 2008 therefore the epilimnion is much shallower than other layers fig 3 and the hydrochemical parameters e g water t ph and do varied notably wang et al 2020 cui et al 2017 the saturated status of caco3 was formed under high ph and water temperature conditions which leads to a decrease of ca2 and dic in the epilimnion liu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 further the rapid decrease of dic content and the increase of ph could cause low pco2 due to the phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion of cst lt and yt reservoirs jiang et al 2020 pu et al 2020 however all measured data was distributed around the origin of the dh reservoir with a short hrt indicating a weak damming effect on water chemistry fig 4 b the above results suggested that the epilimnion of the lt cst and yt reservoirs with obvious thermal stratification was mainly affected by phytoplankton photosynthesis caco3 precipitation and co2 outgassing which were mainly distributed in the first quadrant fig 4 b in the second quadrant fig 4 b δ dic increased while δ ca2 and δ13cdic decreased indicating that dic may be affected by both groundwater input and om degradation vachon et al 2020 in the third quadrant fig 4 b ph t chl and do decreased significantly while dic and pco2 increased significantly indicating that dic in the water may be mainly from the degradation of om and dissolution of caco3 of samples from the thermocline and hypolimnion binet et al 2020 besides δ13cdic was found to be negative in the thermocline and hypolimnion which further proved that om degradation was one of the key processes affecting dic concentration therefore high pco2 in thermocline and hypolimnion would lead to co2 outgassing and provid co2 for phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion as a response primary production also produced do and om which helped in the process of om oxidizing and decomposing in the thermocline and hypolimnion in the fourth quadrant fig 4 b decreased δ dic and increased δ ca2 may be caused by rainfall and mixing of water in the process of water flowing from river to reservoir area which was mainly reflected in the lentic surface of the cst reservoir wang et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 in the mainstream along the water flow direction of the cascade reservoirs ph dic and doc decreased while pco2 increased indicating that the regional damming effect with a long hrt and high air temperature may enhance the carbon emission in the downstream wang et al 2020 moreover ph and do decreased significantly whereas pco2 increased rapidly in the released water of the cst lt and yt reservoirs indicating that the rapid influx of atmospheric o2 with a high air temperature will accelerate the degradation of om and cause a increase in pco2 pu et al 2020 due to the high air temperature in july thermal stratification was most obvious in reservoirs with a long hrt and showed similar characteristics of cascade reservoirs built on the wujiang river and jialing river cui et al 2017 wang et al 2020 taking the site p1 δ13cdic 10 6 with no damming effect as a reference δ13cdic decreased to 13 4 in the yt reservoir in july however δ13cdic increased to 11 3 in the dh reservoir where the annual average was 9 9 0 9 our results showed a similar trend with other karst cascade reservoirs in the wujiang river 8 8 to 10 1 and the jialing river 12 3 to 12 7 cui et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the above results showed that dam construction may cause a regional damming effect the increase of pco2 and decrease both ph and δ13cdic and further help to understand its effect on the carbon cycle however when thermal stratification became weak in the downstream the water chemical characteristics would be similar to the natural river system in this case the impact of the reservoirs on carbon biogeochemical processes may depend on the reservoir itself and the regional damming effect was localized in the river reservoir system 4 2 the enlightenment of reservoir effect index on carbon biogeochemical processes previous studies revealed that the effect of river damming on nutrients was influenced by hrt reservoir age latitude climate and water depth grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 st louis et al 2000 kumar et al 2019 but no clear standard for the impact assessment of river damming has been reported yet δ13cdic is widely used in studying carbon evolution in inland waters as an indicator to understand the geochemical behavior of carbon maberly et al 2012 pu et al 2020 telmer and veizer 1999 zhang and liu 2014 in this study hydrochemistry and isotope indicate that dic was mainly affected by the weathering of carbonate rocks in the fluvial area due to high dic content and light δ13cdic values li et al 2008 liu and han 2020 zhong et al 2018 in the reservoirs with obvious thermal stratification dic was mainly influenced by primary productivity and om degradation in the epilimnion and hypolimnion maberly et al 2012 wang et al 2020 moreover most of the water is discharged from the bottom of dams which is mainly from the hypolimnion therefore dic is mainly affected by co2 outgassing om degradation and carbonate dissolution kumar et al 2019 mendonça et al 2017 wang et al 2019b in this study we found that both water depth and water temperature had positive relationships with dic and δ13cdic in the cst and the lt reservoir displaying a thermal stratification effect table 2 water temperature is one of the most important drivers for the formation of thermal stratification in river reservoir systems elçi 2008 liang et al 2019 in this study the water depth of the lt reservoir was up to 135 m which is much deeper than that of fluvial area 10 m resulting in variability of water temperature at different depths besides the elevation difference between the cst and dh reservoirs is 1485 m causing the annual average air temperature difference of 6 4 c and then leading to difference in water column temperature table 1 it further suggested that the reservoir effect cannot be characterized directly by the different reservoirs water temperatures from the above discussion the damming effect on water thermal stratification may be better characterized by the ri ratio of δt to depth as shown in eq 4 and it is found that ri has a strong linear relationship with δ13cdic which are found to be high in the reservoirs with a long hrt fig 5 a however ri and δ13cdic values are not found to be high in the lt reservoir with the longest hrt which suggests that although hrt is an important driver it may not be the determining factor since the 1990s co2 emissions from reservoirs have attracted much attention and oc degradation was regarded as an important source of co2 duchemin et al 1995 kumar et al 2019 li et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 st louis et al 2000 moreover the doc concentration is much higher than that of the chishui river which is not influenced by the damming effect in the karst area xu et al 2020 in this study ri and doc had a good linear relationship and with the increase of ri doc concentration increased and pco2 decreased indicating that ri can be an important index to investigate the strength of primary productivity which would further help to understand the processes behind the carbon cycle fig 5 b to test the indicative role of ri in other karst reservoirs we compiled data of cascade reservoirs in the mainstream of the wujiang river jialing river and the hf reservoir of the maotiao river and plotted them together with the data in this study cui et al 2017 wang et al 2016 2020 the results show that ri and δ13cdic have a positive relationship r2 0 65 p 0 001 fig 6 which reveal that δ13cdic in the surface water is distinctly different in the reservoirs with different hrts further it indicates that δ13cdic of reservoirs with similar hrt also have significant differences which suggest that reservoir effect also depends on the reservoir characteristics generally large ri represents a strong reservoir effect which is mainly reflected in the significant thermal stratification of the reservoir the ri can also help to explain why the highest value of pco2 occurred in the reservoir hypolimnion of lt reservoir in october in october the stratification of the water may be more pronounced due to the longer hrt higher temperature and less disturbance by precipitation in the lt reservoir the ri value in january 0 14 april 0 20 july 0 40 and october 0 33 further indicate that the lt reservoir still had a strong reservoir effect in october fig 4 moreover intensified phytoplankton photosynthesis in the epilimnion and accelerated degradation of om in the hypolimnion resulted in higher pco2 in the released water which suggest that ri can better explore the reservoir effect by combining the hydrochemical characteristics and geographical characteristics therefore compared with hrt the application of both ri and isotopic signatures will help to investigate the strength of the damming effect on the carbon cycle and further provide theoretical support for the evaluation of the reservoir effect in karst areas 5 conclusion in this study four cascade reservoirs in the subtropical region were selected to study the effect of damming on riverine carbon transport and the underlying processes using water chemistry and stable isotopic signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic results revealed that after cascade damming in karst rivers the main influence processes of dic in karst rivers were transformed from carbonate weathering to the jointly regulation by carbonate weathering carbonate precipitation primary production and om degradation after a comprehensive analysis of hydrochemistry and δ13cdic we proposed the concept of reservoir effect index ri which is a more sensitive indicator than hrt and could provide a more accurate indication of damming effect on the carbon cycle and inherent processes involved by compiling δ13cdic of other karst reservoirs it is proved that ri can be used to represent the stratification strength of reservoirs and further help to understand the degree of damming effect on the carbon cycle our study can act as a reference for other karst damming rivers to assess the impact of damming on the carbon cycle so that mitigation measures could be implemented in advance to reduce its emission in the future however numerous factors affect the carbon characteristics after building dams on rivers therefore additional work needs to be done in the future such as multi isotope analyses higher frequency monitoring and application of hydrodynamics which will help to further understand the migration and transformation of carbon in river reservoir systems credit authorship contribution statement wanfa wang formal
