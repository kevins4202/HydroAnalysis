9840,in this study we review the state of the art of different physiologically based water saving irrigation strategies and methods used to improve productive water use efficiency wueyield and berry and wine quality in vineyards we also show how these irrigation practices combined with more sustainable soil management and other agroecological practices can help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on wine grapes cultivation and make irrigated mediterranean vineyards more resilient and sustainable we analyse the deficit irrigation di strategies used most often for different varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions we review the latest advances in the application of regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying irrigation pri strategies in grapevines red and white grapes as well as other irrigation methods used less frequently in vineyards to improve wueyield berry quality and irrigation efficiency such as subsurface drip irrigation we also analyze recent findings concerning the physiological response of the vine to water stress with more holistic approaches such as hydraulic safety marging and stress distance and discuss how to translate these physiological approaches into the practical application of rdi management in field conditions according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination we review optimum vine water status ranges and the thresholds proposed for better deficit irrigation scheduling in vineyards in addition we consider sustainable soil management practices such as cover crops mulching composting reduced tillage mutualistic plant microorganisms interactions and agroforestry and their potential as beneficial agroecological practices to improve wue soil

introduction in the mediterranean basin viticulture plays a vital role in the socio economic life of the region which often lacks other viable economic alternatives in the southeast of spain woody crops are of great importance regarding their agroforestry contribution and any reduction in their cultivation may lead to abandonment of the land and the consequential problems of erosion and desertification romero and garcía garcía 2020 the situation of vineyards is particularly serious in regions with very limiting climatic conditions such as a shortage of rainfall the establishment of sustainable production patterns based on socio economic and environmental criteria is a key strategy in the progression toward viable and competitive wine production it is necessary to establish systems that make cultivation sustainable by promoting the quality of the wine grape and by implementing working methods with favorable social economic and environmental consequences for rural populations and the environment a productive specialization according to the localization of the grape cultivation quality wines produced in specified regions qwpsr and a consequent differentiation of the product depending on its quality and the surrounding environmental and landscape features could make wine production a viable activity linked to the rural environment fortunately the interest in more sustainable and holistic approaches in viticulture including organic biodynamic and agroforestry farming systems is growing baiano 2021 alternative farming systems place special emphasis on the health of the whole agroecosystem with a strong focus on the preservation of biodiversity soil fertility and soil biological activity by supporting the soil microorganisms and using good agroecological farming practices unfortunately in many mediterranean areas vineyards are frequently located on poor soils which have little organic matter and low fertility and are often bare without a natural or sown vegetation cover under rainfed conditions therefore the processes of degradation erosion and loss of soil are very intense in these semiarid areas and little is known about how to properly manage the soil to avoid these disturbances besides vineyard soils are often subjected to intensive cultivation with frequent tillage and may receive intensive application of herbicides fertilizers and other phytosanitary products this may lead to the accumulation of copper or other fungicides in soils with a negative impact on soil microbiota and soil biological activity hence conventional viticulture does not give too much importance to the soil quality and fertility and is often considered to reduce soil biodiversity and functionality and to drive soil biota extinction by the use of soil destructive farming practices thus in vineyards a number of practices such as intensive tillage high chemical fertilization rates and the frequent and intensive use of herbicides and other pesticides have been seen to impact negatively on soil biological activity and the presence of beneficial soil microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf trouvelot et al 2015 krauss et al 2020 recent studies predict greater warming and more severe water shortage in the south of europe especially in the iberian peninsula and more particularly the south and southeast of the iberian peninsula as a result of climate change cc fraga et al 2016 santos et al 2020 these regions will face great challenges and will need major efforts to adapt to increasing costs and to maintain the quality and productivity of vineyards fraga et al 2012 guiot and cramer 2016 resco et al 2016 santillan et al 2020 for example a study conducted to explore the possible measures of adaptation to cc in several spanish wine producing regions pointed out that the protected designations of origin of jumilla and la mancha are two of the most vulnerable areas which may suffer a high impact due to a great increase in the projected temperature and a decrease in precipitation resco et al 2016 the expected increase in global air temperature and in the intensity of climatic anomalies such as droughts and heatwaves as predicted by cc models for most of the semi arid regions where grapevine vitis vinifera l production occurs fraga et al 2016 will generate a high vapor pressure deficit vpd at the atmospheric level which will produce an increase in the annual rate of potential evapotranspiration eto of around 75 125 mm by the 2050 s for most of europe dezsi et al 2018 in this scenario there will be an increase in the water needs of vines and irrigation will be necessary to maintain the long term sustainability of vineyards and to prevent severe stress in many wine producing regions in the south of the iberian peninsula iglesias and garrote 2015 in this regard a recent study predicted an increase in vine irrigation requirements in arid and semi arid regions of south australia between 3 5 and 7 5 under future climate projections depending on the soil type and indicate that the greatest increase in irrigation requirements will occur during the early part of the season and not in the months of maximum demand phogat et al 2020 moreover in highly vulnerable semi arid regions to maintain the long term sustainability of the vineyards until the year 2050 and beyond it will be necessary to implement changes in vineyard management applying additional adaptation measures besides efficient irrigation especially related with a sustainable soil management applying soil conservation practices and the use of drought high temperature tolerant genotypes with high wue fraga et al 2018 santos et al 2020 tortosa et al 2020 in recent years a considerable effort has been made in mediterranean vineyards to develop and optimize efficient irrigation techniques and deficit irrigation di strategies e g regulated deficit irrigated rdi that require moderate low water volumes in order to improve berry quality and water use efficiency wue quality in vineyards in semiarid areas with successful results table 1 besides the current concerns of consumers about alcohol consumption and health and the associations between wine cancer and health have increased the interest in the elaboration of healthier wines with lower alcohol content and higher concentrations of anthocyanins tannins and other potentially beneficial polyphenols champ and kundu champ 2019 pérez álvarez et al 2021b thus specific low input rdi strategies intended to maximize the polyphenol content and nutraceutical potential can be a good option for healthier and more distinctive red wines recent studies have reported that rdi can alter the must amino acid profile grape aroma potential and wine volatile organic compounds terpenes unsaturated fatty acids alcohols volatile esters in different varieties viognier tempranillo verdejo gewürztraminer among others providing a basis for the management of grape aroma in rdi vineyards lun ju et al 2018 ju et al 2018 vilanova et al 2019 wang et al 2019 valdés et al 2019 kovalenko et al 2021 lizama et al 2021 in rainfed systems soil management is crucial to reduce water losses however we have less experience of efficient soil management in deficit irrigated vineyards and we know little about the best sustainable soil management practices for improving long term soil fertility and quality under deficit irrigated semiarid conditions more sustainable management of the soil within an organic vineyard context in addition to the ecosystem services generated can have a direct effect on the soil water balance evaporation infiltration rate water holding capacity etc and can increase the efficiency of the use of water and nutrients this would allow us to save water manage irrigation more efficiently and possibly achieve better adaptation of di vineyards to cc the aim of this update review is a show the state of the art and the latest progress in the management of di in vineyards b identify and establish common criteria when developing and optimizing di strategies c translate novel physiological approaches and advances into the practical application of di management according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination d highlight the importance of how sustainable soil management and other agroecological practices can optimize the management and sustainability of di in vineyards by describing and quantifying the effects of the sustainable viticultural management systems and soil and irrigation management practices this review update provides decision support for producers consumers and researchers in addition new findings concerning the response of the vine to water stress are described and we discuss how to translate these physiological approaches into the practical application of rdi management in field conditions according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination we consider the combination of sustainable soil management practices and their potential as beneficial agroecological practices to improve wue soil vine performance and other ecological services in rdi vineyards within a more sustainable farming system therefore this study also provides helpful guidance for defining future areas of research the idea is to contribute to a better design of sustainable cc resilient mediterranean di vineyards systems in the most vulnerable areas of the mediterranean basin based on agroecological principles with a special focus on the combination of long term sustainable water use and soil management practices literature searches of peer reviewed published literature were conducted to find studies investigating recent advances in deficit irrigation drought tolerance physiological response of the vine to water stress climate change adaptation

irrigation strategies and volume of applied water yield and berry quality and used replicates of management treatments with representative plots or studies that used a representative number of samples were included data from non peer reviewed sources such as conference proceedings master s theses or doctoral dissertations were also ocassionally included in this study if they met the criteria mentioned above for the drought tolerance mechanisms and physiological response of the vine table 3 recent studies from 2015 to 2021 were included for the impact of organic viticulture table 4 recent studies mainly reviews and meta analyses from 2015 to 2021 were included 2 water requirements and deficit irrigation strategies in wine grapes the use of deficit irrigation di although there is a wide variety of methods and techniques lysimeters heat pulse heat balance bowen energy balance surface renewal energy balance eddy covariance and soil water balance to estimate the components of the water balance and the water requirements of crops crop evapotranspiration etc including vineyards the models that are more commonly used for estimating the seasonal irrigation needs of crops use local crop weather and soil based measurements fandiño et al 2012 the model proposed by allen et al 1998 is one of the most used at a practical level due to its simplicity and robustness this model adopt a crop coefficient kc as the ratio between etc and the reference crop evapotranspiration eto which depends on climatic factors such as net radiation soil heat flux density air temperature wind speed and saturation vapor pressure deficit according to the fao penman monteith equation then etc is operationally estimated as etc kc eto allen et al 1998 factors determining the kc of vineyards include the crop growth stage canopy height and architecture that relate to the trellis system the fraction of soil covered by the crop presence of mulches or active ground cover as well as the soil fraction wetted and exposed to radiation that relates to the irrigation method and soil management crop management and local climate williams and ayars 2005 fandiño et al 2012 there are two options for using kc the single crop coefficient approach where kc represents time averaged combined effects of crop transpiration and soil evaporation most studies on vineyards irrigation use single crop coefficients to calculating etc and to determine the amount of irrigation water required at different crop growth stages and the kc related to the phenological stages of the vineyard williams and ayars 2005 in other way the dual kc approach where the kc value is divided into a basal crop coefficient kcb representing plant transpiration and an evaporation coefficient ke representing evaporation from the soil surface resulting kc kcb ke under water stress conditions the actual crop evapotranspiration eta can be considered being lower than etc and defined as eta ks kcb ke eto where eta is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 kcb is the basal crop coefficient ks is the water stress coefficient ke is the soil evaporation coefficient and eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 allen et al 1998 ks is a dimensionless transpiration reduction factor dependent on available soil water the estimation of ks requires a water balance computation for the root zone hence the importace of having the necessary information regarding the water content in the soil average soil water content for the effective root zone θi 1 m3 m 3 the water content at field capacity θfc m3 m 3 and the water content at wilting point θpc m3 m 3 allen et al 1998 the correct estimation of etc in grapevines acquires a special relevance not only in current studies to establish real needs but also to estimate future irrigation requirements in response to climate change thus projected weather is going to be increasingly important in scheduling etc based irrigation in a short and medium term phogat et al 2020 the application of water below the etc requirements is termed deficit irrigation di irrigation supply under di is reduced relative to that needed to meet maximum etc fereres and soriano 2007 two common di approaches that has been applied in wine grapes consists of the replacement of only fractions of the water lost by crop evapotranspiration etc during the growing season applying the same fraction of etc throughout the year sustained deficit irrigation sdi or different fractions of etc during specific pre and or post veraison periods rdi table 1 with sdi the water deficit increases progressively as the season advances due to a combination of the uniform application of a reduced amount and the depletion of the soil water reserve this pattern allows for water stress to develop slowly and for the plants to adapt to the water deficits in soils with significant water storage capacity fereres and soriano 2007 and in some cases has produced satisfactory results in vines table 1 for instance lizama et al 2021 in cv bobal concluded that watering at 35 of the etc during growing season sdi is a recommended irrigation strategy for optimizing grape skin seed and volatile composition in comparison with full irrigation thereby allowing for an increase in yield as compared to rainfed vines other of the most effective di irrigation techniques utilized in vineyards in arid and semi arid areas is regulated deficit irrigation rdi as it offers greater potential to save water optimize irrigation application reduce excessive vine vigor increase productive water use efficiency wueyield and improve berry and wine quality costa et al 2007 iglesias and garrote 2015 recent studies carried out under different edaphoclimatic and experimental conditions with several wine grape varieties and rootstocks and with different rdi strategies and water volumes applied have given quite similar results with significant improvements in many cases in wueyield and berry quality although also with yield losses averaging between 10 and 24 compared to conventional or standard irrigation sustained di and full irrigation practices table 1 although in many countries vineyards are rainfed the results indicate that low moderate water volume rdi can be an useful tool in many different situations and viticultural areas for irrigated vineyard sustainability in addition any reduction in irrigation water application due to the introduction of rdi practices will lead to energy savings because the application of irrigation in the vineyard is usually performed by technologies such as pressurized irrigation systems and drip irrigation and therefore is dependent on significant energy inputs for the pumping of water frequently from deeper wells that require more energy decreases in the soil moisture content caused by rdi implementation may also have positive effects on the soil c cycle and promote soil c sequestration due to reduced n2o greenhouse gas emissions with no negative effect on soil organic c soc and aggregates stability in the short term compared to full irrigation zornoza et al 2018 emissions of ch4 and the net global warming potential gwp can also be decreased by reducing the application of irrigation water and optimizing irrigation saptoka et al 2020 however when reduced irrigation was applied greater rate of co2 emissions were reported compared to flood irrigation this was attributed to increased aeration of soils that favored soil organic matter decomposition enhancing soil co2 production saptoka et al 2020 besides an increased soil temperature as consequence global warming accompanied by a decline in soil water content and water stress could also increase soil microbial respiration and soil co2 emmisions to the atmosphere saptoka et al 2020 badraghi et al 2021 other benefits of the water stress and low water availability caused by rdi include a reduction of the intensity of pests and diseases one example of this is a fall in leafhopper density in some regions e g california where leafhoppers are pests and this benefit might allow the frequency of insecticide application to be lowered costello and patterson 2012 also lower bunch rot incidence and reduced transmission efficiency for pierce s disease related to plant insect interactions have been found with rdi mirás avalos and araujo 2021 recently heyman et al 2021 concluded that deficit irrigation maintained at 40 of the full irrigation based on the volumetric water content of the soil may help to avoid downy mildew epidemics in vines thus deficit irrigation induced resistance to plasmopara vitícola the causal agent of downy mildew in chardonnay and xynisteri and aba seems to be involved in the observed drought induced resistance to p viticola however one negative consequence of reducing irrigation water use by rdi is the greater risk of increased soil salinity due to reduced leaching fereres and soriano 2007 the effect of rdi depends on the phenological stage and the severity of the stress imposed in each stage fig 1 with efficient scheduling of rdi the soil and plant water statuses are maintained within a narrow tolerance range thus it is necessary to deﬁne several optimum threshold values and ranges for soil plant stress indicators to avoid severe damage to root and leaf function and drastic yield and berry quality losses romero et al 2010 any over irrigation undermines the advantages of rdi and can cost more in terms of the water used and significant losses of water by leaching while under application can lead to severe yield penalties and loss of quality nonetheless these indicators depend on the iso anisohydric behavior of the variety rootstock combination resulting from its interaction with the environment the use of rdi imposes a water shortage during specific phenological periods and is based on the principle that plant sensitivity to water stress in terms of yield and berry quality is different depending on the vine phenological stage and the severity of the stress imposed mccarthy et al 2002 although the sensitivity to water stress differs among wine grape varieties levin alexander et al 2019 cochetel et al 2020 as a general guideline grapevines without water stress have midday stem water potential ψs values above 1 mpa at mild water stress ψs is between 1 0 and 1 2 mpa and at moderate water stress ψs is between 1 2 and 1 4 mpa values equal to or below 1 4 mpa correspond to severe water stress table 2 which can be dangerous for vine performance and vineyard lifespan if maintained for a long time romero et al 2010 using as references other plant water status indicators different water stress ranges and thresholds in different phenological periods have also been established to enable more precise irrigation scheduling and rdi management in vineyards table 2 as these physiological thresholds change during growing season optimum ranges of ψs in different phenological periods were established for monastrell vines in order to improve berry quality romero et al 2013 from budburst to fruit set 0 6 ψs 0 9 mpa from fruit set to veraison 1 2 ψs 1 3 mpa and from veraison to harvest 1 3 ψs 1 4 mpa the sensitivity of the vine to water stress in different phenological stages has been established previously fig 1 basile et al 2011 reported that berry composition in terms of the concentration of anthocyanins and polyphenols was improved when no water stress occurred from anthesis to fruit set with mild water stress between fruit set and veraison and moderate to severe water stress in post veraison the early season budburst flowering fruit set is considered a more critical and water stress sensitive period from a productive point of view than other phenological periods mccarthy 1997 severe water stress during flowering and fruit set can cause cluster desiccation and flower and fruit abscission which reduce fruit load bud fertility and the development of inflorescences and affect bud fruitfulness the following year wample and smithyman 2002 besides from budburst to fruit set it is difficult to control the soil water content by rdi compared to other phenological periods due to the frequent occurrence of rainfall events during spring and the low evaporative demand romero et al 2013 thus water deficits do not usually occur very early in the season in most viticultural mediterranean regions because 1 the soil water availability in the root zone is high 2 the vine is not at full canopy expansion and 3 the atmospherically driven demand and vine water needs are low nevertheless the tendency for lower soil content in spring is becoming more usual due to drier winters as consequence of global warming nevertheless a very light vine water stress 0 6 ψs 0 8 mpa table 2 maintained from budburst to fruit set under rdi was found to be sufficient to reduce shoot growth in monastrell grapevines without affecting significantly the photosynthetic activity romero et al 2013 this can be positive making relatively more carbon c available for non vegetative sinks such as flowers and berries especially with vigorous rootstock scion combinations following this approach for many rdi strategies in vineyards early season irrigation does not start until a certain threshold value of ψs or a certain mild water stress level in the vine is reached and it may even be the case that no irrigation is applied in this period budburst fruit set table 1 on the other hand adequate post harvest irrigation usually between 20 and 40 etc is also important to stimulate root growth in this period and to ensure that the necessary carbohydrates reserves are accumulated for the beginning of the following year in wine grapes cultivation rdi is commonly applied during the two phenological periods that coincide with the highest evaporative demand and vine water needs in order to save water and to increase wueyield and berry and wine quality fig 1 table 1 firstly a water deficit is applied from fruit set to veraison pre veraison water deficit to control berry size and reduce vine vigor mccarthy et al 2002 in this period there is a certain overlap between the vegetative and reproductive growth phases phase i of berry development fig 1 subsequently a water deficit is applied after veraison during berry ripening phase iii post veraison water deficit in order to increase the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds castellarin et al 2007a 2007b in general the pre veraison water deficit is more effective than the post veraison water deficit in reducing vegetative development and berry growth santesteban et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2012 buesa et al 2017 levin et al 2020 and can also accelerate the change in berry color herrera and castellarin 2016 besides qrt pcr data show an alteration in gene expression caused by early water deficit pre veraison and underline the role of gene regulation transcription factors and mirnas involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway within secondary metabolism as a vine response to mitigate water stress zombardo et al 2020 however the severity of water deficit during pre veraison can adversely affect subsequent ripening for instance romero et al 2013 found that complete irrigation cut off during the pre veraison period from fruit set to veraison substantially decreased berry growth at veraison as well as photosynthetic activity the pre veraison water status and the recovery of photosynthesis during early ripening which inhibited the flavonoids and sugar metabolism and translocation to fruit during the veraison early ripening period in rdi monastrell grapevines berry quality color development and synthesis of sugars and anthocyanins seems to be more sensitive to vine water status in the early rather than the late stages of the ripening process mathews anderson 1989 rdi applied after veraison increases the concentration at harvest of key free terpenes such as geraniol and citronellol for gewürztraminer grapes and can potentially improve wine aroma kovalenko et al 2021 a post veraison improvement in the cluster microclimate under rdi greater sun exposure of clusters and higher incident par in the clusters can also increase anthocyanin flavonol accumulation and bring about compositional changes compared to more irrigated vines deluc et al 2009 grimplet et al 2009 romero et al 2016c as the total levels of malvidin glucosides and flavonols are generally enhanced under increased light intensity downey et al 2006 anthocyanins and flavonols are important components in the determination of wine style and quality as flavonols can conjugate with anthocyanins a process called copigmentation that reinforces the long term stability of wine color and the nutraceutical properties of rdi wines castellarin et al 2015 nevertheless both pre and post veraison moderate water deficits have the potential to benefit berry and wine quality in different ways including 1 a reduced berry weight and size and a higher skin pulp ratio chacón vozmediano et al 2020 2 an improvement in the cluster microclimate due to a reduced canopy leaf area and more open canopies 3 changes in the root to shoot ratio 4 an altered endogenous hormonal response e g increased abscisic acid aba in roots leaves and or berries and or 5 greater expression of key genes regulating flavonoid biosynthesis e g the anthocyanins synthesis pathway sugar unloading and accumulation of proline and other amino acids alatzas et al 2021 in addition pre and post veraison water stress affect the anthocyanin composition differently suggesting a differential regulation of the genes involved in the last steps of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway ollé et al 2011 these authors found in shiraz vines that pre veraison water stress had no effect on total proanthocyanidin accumulation but increased the accumulation of all anthocyanins except malvidin and p coumaroylated derivatives whereas post veraison water stress enhanced the overall anthocyanin biosynthesis particularly of malvidin and p coumaroylated derivatives these results suggest the possibility of developing rdi strategies that produce both pre and post veraison stresses to maximize anthocyanin accumulation since the two stresses differently impact the hydroxylation and methylation of anthocyanins ollé et al 2011 although this response can depend on the genotype of the cultivar rdi di strategies have also been shown in different varieties tempranillo cabenet sauvignon monastrell bobal among others to 1 up regulate the expression of several genes responsible for proanthocyanidins synthesis increasing flavanols and tannins contents in seeds and skins and the berry antioxidant capacity genebra et al 2014 caceres mella et al 2017 2 increase volatile phenols content which plays a significant role in wine aroma lizama et al 2021 3 enhance the expression of flavonoid 3 5 hydroxylase f3 5 h involved in b ring trihydroxylation relative to that of flavonoid 3 hydroxylase f3 h involved in b ring dihydroxylation consequently increasing the proportion of b ring tri hydroxylated anthocyanins castellarin et al 2007a 2007b santesteban et al 2011 pinasseau et al 2017 romero et al 2019 and 3 stimulate the activity of the 3 o and 5 o methyltransferase enzymes resulting in an increase in methylated anthocyanins mainly malvidin derivatives romero et al 2016c yang et al 2020b 2020a and acylated anthocyanins especially malvidin 3 acetyl glucoside lun ju et al 2019 in berries and wines improving also the nutraceutical properties and health benefits of red rdi wines quintieri et al 2013 tri hydroxylated anthocyanins are more stable against oxidation or degradation than di hydroxylated forms mori et al 2007 which could be another reason besides f 3 5 h upregulation for their higher proportion under greater water stress and high temperature yu and kurtural 2020 in contrast in water stressed table grapes cvs autumn royal and italia the amount of di hydroxylated anthocyanins increased relatively more than that of the tri hydroxylated anthocyanins under rdi catacchio et al 2019 the total water consumption of vineyards 100 crop evapotranspiration etc under full water supply well watered plants ranges from 300 to 700 mm per season depending on meteorological conditions affecting eto and kc and the grapevine variety environment interaction medrano et al 2015 lópez urrea et al 2012 torres et al 2021a the common rdi approach that has been applied in wine grapes consists of the replacement of fractions of the water lost by crop evapotranspiration etc during the growing season table 1 however some studies have shown that irrigation comprising a constant fraction of that received by well watered plants might result in either excessive or insufficient irrigation hochberg et al 2017 this emphasizes the advantage of utilizing plant water status indicators based on vine water demand rather than only weather soil moisture etc based methods to manage specialized irrigation techniques such as rdi fereres and soriano 2007 acevedo opazo et al 2010 thus physiologically based rdi approaches that have been successfully applied in vineyards consist of the application of irrigation based on the optimum water status measured more frequently as the ψs pre dawn leaf water potential ψpd midday leaf water potential ψl leaf stomatal conductance gs or intrinsic leaf water use efficiency wueintrinsic a gs or less frequently as the c isotope discrimination δ13c and canopy temperature tc crop water stress index cwsi to maintain the vine water status within the optimum range proposed table 2 romero et al 2013 chacón vozmediano et al 2020 alternatively irrigation water may be applied only when the physiological indicator parameter drops below a certain threshold value of water stress cifre et al 2005 cancela et al 2016 matese et al 2018 munitz et al 2020 barbagallo et al 2021 sometimes all these approaches have been combined in specific rdi strategies with satisfactory results table 1 our current knowledge of the effects of water stress on grapevine photosynthesis yield and quality indicates that gs can be an earlier indicator of water stress than ψs chaves et al 2003 therefore the maintenance of grapevines in a gs range between 0 05 and 0 15 mol m 2 s 1 may in principle allow 1 maximum wueintrinsic 2 rapid reversibility of photosynthesis upon irrigation 3 relatively moderate yield losses compared to intensive irrigation and 4 optimization of grape quality characters cifre et al 2005 although this can also depend on the stomatal response of the variety to water stress similarly romero et al 2010 reported an optimum gs range between 0 11 and 0 15 mol m 2 s 1 for rdi monastrell grapevines for improvement of wueyield and berry quality in semi arid areas table 2 in field conditions probably linking plant and soil indices for water stress management is the best option from a practical point of view gs porometer ψs pressure chamber or tc infrared thermometer or ground based thermography costa et al 2019 combined with discrete continuos soil moisture measurement may be a better way to quantify the water stress in grapevines because although it requires some technical training and are time consuming measurements its acquisition management and interpretation is not excessively complex or expensive an rdi strategy must be developed and optimized for each particular condition taking into account not only the edaphoclimatic conditions and the particular variety rootstock combination but also the irrigation water availability production ceilings established style of grape and wine that is desired wine consumer preferences etc for example for cabernet sauvignon munitz et al 2020 concluded that when maximal yield is desirable early irrigation initiation during spring at budburst should be taken into consideration the postponement of irrigation initiation until advanced stages of the growing season was associated with improved berry composition and this method could be applied in premium vineyards with special precautions bearing in mind the cumulative effects of drought stress similarly limiting the water supply to 25 of etc during early berry development and then increasing it to 100 of etc at veraison proved to be an interesting irrigation management option for cabernet sauvignon in semiarid conditions of southeastern washington soil is deep silt loam rainfall 120 mm year 1 keller et al 2016 this rdi regime limited vigor and berry size and conserved irrigation water while avoiding detrimental long term effects on vine growth and yield however this rdi strategy has room for improvement to save water and improve berry quality probably the application of 100 etc post veraison provided too much water as indicated by high ψs values between 0 79 and 0 97 mpa and 70 etc post veraison where ψs had more adequate values from 0 87 to 1 28 mpa may be a better option since it gave similar or even higher rates of photosynthesis keller et al 2016 other authors have proposed that late irrigation at veraison could also be a useful strategy to delay shoot growth thus reducing the photosynthates available to the clusters and delaying grape ripening and promote adaptation to cc in warm areas gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 theocharis et al 2021 however excessive late irrigation is not recommended due to possible dilution effect and fungi disease incidence the maintenance of vine water status within an optimum range moderate water stress during the veraison harvest period table 2 avoiding dangerous levels of ψs and severe water stress could be a useful strategy to manage adequately late irrigation in vineyards romero et al 2013 negative carry over effects of some rdi strategies can also be important if maximization of grapevine yields or sustained long term high productivity is the main goal buesa et al 2017 shellie 2019 munitz et al 2020 a recent study in 15 field grown grapevine cultivars reported that pre veraison water deficits not only reduce yield in the current season by reducing berry size but can also reduce yield the following season by reducing bud fruitfulness through a reduction in the number of clusters vine thus to maximize grapevine yields water should be applied early to avoid pre veraison water deficits that can inhibit berry growth in the current season and bud fruitfulness in the following season levin et al 2020 probably pre veraison water deficits giving an average ψl 1 5 mpa as reported in levin s study 1 5 to 1 6 mpa an indicator of severe water stress table 2 were enough to disrupt the development of cluster primordia in the buds the authors concluded that an average pre veraison vine water status of ψl 1 3 mpa may be considered a preliminary critical value below which bud fruitfulness is negatively affected levin et al 2020 post veraison water deficit also has the potential to impact on both yield and fruit composition during both the current season and the subsequent one petrie et al 2004 as a general guide most of the rdi strategies that have shown benefits involved the application of moderate or low seasonal irrigation water volumes between 50 and 150 mm year 1 in different edaphoclimatic conditions table 1 studies of physiologically based irrigation scheduling for different wine grape varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions found significant correlations between midday ψs and berry quality components and showed ψs to be a suitable physiological indicator that enabled accurate water supply and irrigation scheduling in rdi wine grapes for both red and white varieties cancela et a 2016 romero et al 2010 2016b in this way a recent meta analysis concluded that both ψs and ψpd have more discrimination ability than ψl with regard to accurate measurement of vine water status and therefore in rdi vineyards ψl should be replaced as a general rule by either midday stem or pre dawn water potential readings santesteban et al 2019 however other studies reported that ψpd is poorly related to soil water content compared to ψs and ψl and would not be useful for the accurate determination of vine water status under high frequency di while ψl could be a reliable indicator of grapevine water status if one uses the appropriate technique to measure it williams and trout 2005 williams 2017 many studies have revealed that the maintenance of moderate levels of water stress measured as midday stem water potential with an optimum ψs range between 1 2 and 1 4 mpa ψs never being allowed to fall below 1 4 mpa table 2 during the pre and post veraison periods mainly from fruit set to harvest could improve wue berry quality and irrigation management in rdi grapevines table 1 castellarin et al 2007a 2007b romero et al 2010 2013 acevedo opazo et al 2010 levin et al 2020 rdi vineyards typically function well within this safe range of water potentials which do not lead to cavitation xylem embolism or turgor loss charrier et al 2016 2018 gambetta et al 2020 in this range grapevines can experience decreased transpiration e stomatal conductance hydraulic conductance photosynthesis and fruit yield in contrast more severe water deficit e g ψs 1 6 or 1 7 mpa might induce turgor loss and xylem cavitation e g if the minimum ψ that leads to a 50 loss of stem hydraulic conductivity ψ50 is reached that could lead to intense leaf shedding and even vine mortality charrier et al 2016 gambetta et al 2020 in support of this recent results confirm that the ψstem value at which 50 of the xylem embolisms is observed leaf p50 mpa ranges from 1 4 to 2 0 mpa in many varieties such as semillon syrah grenache or chardonnay dayer et al 2020 therefore these critical threshold values can be used in many environmental conditions and varieties for optimum rdi management however not very restrictive long term rdi strategies should be applied especially in warm arid semi arid areas to prevent ψs from reaching or exceeding these critical levels for long periods for example romero et al 2010 reported for a drought tolerant combination monastrell 1103 p that a severe rdi strategy produced an average ψs of 1 4 mpa during summer associated with high air temperatures tªmax 35 ºc although the critical threshold ψ50 of vulnerability to embolism and cavitation was probably not exceeded there was an intense leaf fall in summer as also observed in other varieties charrier et al 2018 a drastic reduction in photosynthesis and a reduction in the quality of the grapes and wines in addition to long term harmful effects due to severe water stress romero et al 2013 2016b 2016c less information is available on the effect of water deficit rdi on phenolic composition and berry and wine quality in white grapes the quality of white wines and their aromatic profile are strongly influenced by the vine water status during the growing season but the optimum ranges of vine water status have not been clearly established in white varieties due to high variability therefore zufferey et al 2020 reported that no water stress or a very mild water stress from bloom to fruit ripening ψpd 0 25 mpa is positive for wine quality and benefits the development of aromatic components in white varieties such as arvine compared to mild moderate water stress 0 3 ψpd 0 5 mpa these authors also reported that the wines from plants subjected to water stress and with a deficiency of yeast available nitrogen content yan in the must non irrigated vines during hot and dry seasons presented a less distinctive typicity and developed a lower aromatic expression with a more bitter taste than wines from non stressed plants that were better appreciated similarly ψpd above 0 2 0 22 mpa increased grape aroma potential in muscat blanc and sauvignon blanc cataldo et al 2021 in contrast mild di strategies 0 2 mpa ψpd 0 4 mpa have been shown to maintain or improve fruit quality in moscatel while improving wue chaves et al 2007 in the same way in cv muscat of alexandria irrigation at 50 etc 136 mm year 1 until harvest under sustained deficit irrigation sdi was sufficient to maintain an optimum vine water status mild water stress for the entire season avoiding severe vine water stress thresholds ψs 1 1 mpa and sᴪ 35 mpa day 1 there was no significant reduction in yield while accumulation of grape sugar was higher and wue was much higher than in the control 259 mm year 1 and in treatments involving pre post veraison water stress buesa et al 2017 in the same way for cv riesling reynolds et al 2010 reported that the concentrations of free and bound terpenes were correlated with the midday ψl suggesting that mild water stress 1 1 ψl 1 3 mpa may be beneficial for wine flavor in contrast a severe or sometimes even a moderate water stress can have a negative impact on white wine quality van leeuwen et al 2019 particularly affecting the finesse and the typicality of aromas the organoleptic characteristics and the perception of bitterness zufferey et al 2020 furthermore high water stress is often accompanied by a reduction in the yan of the must which can be detrimental for white grapes being associated with a decrease in the aromatic precursors concentration in must and in aromas in wines zufferey et al 2020 nevertheless other studies of di with prolonged and severe water stress during the growing season ψs 1 5 mpa reported that di can potentially impact the quality of white wines cv old tocai friulano by increasing the accumulation of potential antioxidant and flavour compounds e g derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids zeaxanthin and volatile organic compounds voc such as monoterpenes in the grapes savoi et al 2016 confirming inter cultivar differences in the molecular response to drought pinasseau et al 2017 this indicates that the vineyard characteristics and grape variety also influence the response to di chaves et al 2007 future studies that evaluate the impact of specific mild moderate rdi strategies on berry and wine quality in different white varieties will be necessary 3 di strategies according to the genotypic characteristics different cultivars have been shown to have different responses to di and there are several physiological traits that can determine this sensitivity and the vine s response to water availability such as a xylem architecture and plant hydraulics b stomatal regulation c aba dynamics d osmotic adjustment e root characteristics and f aquaporin regulation simonneau et al 2017 gambetta et al 2020 the response to water stress involves multiple strategies and can be modulated by the rootstock variety combination mainly through regulation of the primary and secondary metabolism romero et al 2018 degu et al 2019 zombardo et al 2020 even drought tolerant variety rootstock combinations seem to have several distinct characteristic traits strategies table 3 more holistic approaches that integrate these multiple traits and take into account this variation are necessary to predict the response of different genotypes to water stress gambetta et al 2020 and to develop optimize rdi strategies according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination table 3 therefore parameters such as ψ50 and the hydraulic safety margin hsm defined as the difference between the water potential at 90 stomatal closure pg s 90 and ψ50 dayer et al 2020 may be physiologically relevant and useful to compare vulnerability to drought among varieties in different environmental conditions the idea of a vine s stress distance the amount of time that a particular vine could go without water under a given set of environmental conditions before reaching the critical water potential threshold or ψcrit gambetta et al 2020 can also be useful to establish or refine optimum physiological thresholds in different genotypes and environmental conditions for better rdi management for example a strategy to increase the stress distance could be either to decrease canopy transpiration and maximum water use e g favoring smaller canopies using low vigor rootstocks for example 110 r or 161 49 c and or genotypes with tighter stomatal regulation 140ru 161 49 c or to increase water availability to the vine e g increasing the rooting volume with low planting densities deeper irrigation events with more water reaching deep into the soil profile and deeper roots and or using genotypes with greater root system development for example 140ru or 1103 p table 3 gambetta et al 2020 recent advances in vine physiology also show that 1 in general severe drought induced embolism appears to be uncommon for field grown grapevines in the current conditions and probably in the medium term charrier et al 2018 2 vines maintain a significant hsm during the growing season even during the critical period of midsummer with the smallest hsm charrier et al 2018 3 a drought stress memory in grapevines involves growth and physiological changes during recurrent drought events probably through epigenomic changes which can explain certain plasticity in the response to long term di in wine grapes depending on the variety and environmental conditions tombesi et al 2018 zamorano et al 2021 and 4 temperature and evaporative demand drive variation in stomatal and hydraulic traits across grape cultivars bartlett and sinclair 2021 for instance cultivars grown in warmer dryer regions exhibited drought tolerance traits that would reduce transpiration e g cultivars with a lower maximum gs and conserve soil water longer into the growing season in contrast cultivars grown in cooler regions show greater stem embolism resistance and more anisohydric stomatal behavior i e more negative water potential threshold for 50 stomatal closure bartlett and sinclair 2021 recent physiological approaches using classification and regression trees reported that both ψl and concentration of aba are important for characterizing the physiology of the growing season and its effects on phenol grape quality this approach permitted the most decisive variables for predicting the most vulnerable vineyards and wine quality parameters associated with water stress sánchez ortiz et al 2021 simmoneau et al 2017 also indicated that anisohydric cultivars such as chardonnay and syrah may be recommended in the case of short periods of water stress e g moderate short rdi table 3 while isohydric ones appear more suitable in the face of long periods of severe drought e g moderate severe and more prolonged rdi however this classification has been questioned hochberg et al 2018 and recent results indicate that cultivars respond similarly to one another at high and low water status but their stomatal behavior differs at moderate water deficits which are used frequently in rdi thus v vinifera cultivars possess both iso and anisohydric stomatal behaviors that depend on the intensity of the water deficit levin alexander et al 2019 besides recent advances indicate a high genetic variability in nighttime transpiration in vines enight associated with residual diffusion through the stomata coupel ledru et al 2016 that can contribute considerably to nighttime water loss and reduced wue and transpiration efficiency e g it was found to average 12 of the total daily transpiration in tempranillo montoro et al 2020 studies made in syrah and grenache reported that genotypes with reduced enight limit water use without altered growth and with higher transpiration efficiency and suggest that reduced nighttime transpiration is a relevant breeding target for high water use efficiency in grapevine coupel ledru et al 2016 in contrast other studies indicate that nighttime transpiration represents a negligible part of the water loss and does not increase the risk of water stress and hydraulic failure in several grapevine varieties grenache syrah and semillon dayer et al 2021 nevertheless the studies show 1 the minimum conductance gmin the minimum water loss after stomatal closure may became more important during drought progression dayer et al 2021 and 2 the highest enight corresponded to days in which the daytime transpiration and soil moisture content were very low more water stress montoro et al 2020 clearly more studies are necessary to explore the contribution of nocturnal water loss to drought tolerance and wue in grapevines and more effort has to be made by agronomists and field technicians in translating these new physiological approaches and advances into more practical applications of rdi scheduling and management in field conditions besides the decoupling of the accumulation of sugars and that of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds observed in field grown vines submitted to heat stress can have consequences for the anthocyanins sugar ratio and the color alcohol balance sadras and moran 2012 this suggests that rdi strategies as applied nowadays will have to be adapted e g higher volumes and or modified frequency or di strategy to new climatic conditions e g high summer temperatures and greater soil water deficits as a consequence of global warming to minimize undesirable effects on berry and wine quality for instance sadras and moran 2012 reported that water deficit increased the anthocyanin total soluble solids tss ratio in cabernet franc and they proposed that a water deficit established shortly before veraison could partially restore this ratio however this will depend on the variety rootstock and the local climatic conditions nevertheless critical periods such as midsummer coinciding with veraison and ripening with more intense frequent and prolonged heat wave episodes as predicted by cc models will have to be managed carefully under rdi to maintain a secure hsm and avoid dangerous levels of ψs and harmful effects on berry quality 4 partial root zone drying irrigation pri and irrigation management in wine grapes di strategies have been developed and applied more frequently using conventional surface drip irrigation but other physiologically based irrigation methods have also been used in di wine grape crops such as partial root zone drying irrigation pri the pri technique involves drying part of the root system while simultaneously maintaining the remaining roots in a well watered state this seeks to promote the production of chemical signals in the dry roots e g abscisic acid aba at the same time the irrigated roots supply sufficient water to the shoots to prevent plant water deficit because the effect is transient in practice it is necessary to keep part of the root system dry to maximize the production of root signals and to apply water to the other side of the vine for a particular period alternating at intervals of 7 14 d kriedemann and goodwin 2003 in pri vineyards there is also a tendency towards deeper water percolation and water extraction from deeper soil layers collins et al 2010 romero et al 2012 2018 as a consequence of a deeper root system development dos santos et al 2007 compared to rdi vines although this response can also depend on the irrigation volume applied and on the total content of available soil water some studies have indicated that the benefits of pri relative to rdi depend also on 1 genotypic variation in root distribution and the proportion of root biomass exposed to drying soil martín vertedor and dodd 2011 and 2 the volumetric soil water content maintained in the wet root zone θv wet hutton and loveys 2011 this is determined by irrigation management irrigation frequencies and volumes the maintenance of a high θv wet during drying re watering cycles seems to be important to improve the vine performance of wine grapes under long term pri in semi arid conditions romero et al 2012 in this respect the stomatal behavior and hormonal response have been found to be related more closely to θv wet as also predicted by a model of sap flow during pri dodd et al 2008a b and the relative contribution of both sides θv wet vs θv dry during a pri cycle than to θvdry alone thus in monastrell 1103 p ample irrigation and the maintenance of a high water content in the wet root zone at 10 60 cm produced higher whole vine hydraulic conductance and led to a significant effect on water uptake in the irrigated root zone that compensated for diminished water uptake from the drier soil romero et al 2012 as observed in other species under pri kang et al 2002 hu et al 2011 probably the deeper water percolation through the soil observed for pri with a high irrigation volume was also more beneficial for 1103 p because this rootstock shows deeper root growth during the warm and dry summer period alsina et al 2011 and could benefit from deeper irrigation table 3 however this compensatory effect was not observed when a low water content was maintained in the wet root zone and the total soil water availability was low probably due to limited sap flow from roots in drying soil when θv dry was too low romero et al 2014 similarly pri vines irrigated at 100 etc maintained higher night time sap flow water uptake during growing season compared to control vines 100 etc but this did not happen when it was watered at 50 etc fuentes et al 2014 probably an increased root volume and depth in pri 100 etc increased the buffer capacity of soils soil moisture to maintain physiological functioning at day and night time fuentes et al 2014 wang et al 2012b recommended that θv wet should be maintained relatively high whereas in the drying zone it should not be very low both conditions being crucial to maintain high soil and plant water statuses while sustaining aba signaling the early onset of cavitation and embolism of drying root xylem with soil moisture levels close to wilting point may restrict water flow and delay root water uptake after rewatering as observed in pri field grown syrah vines fuentes et al 2014 these authors suggested that shifting sides every 10 days for pri treatments for their specific soil conditions soil had a strong compactation layer at 40 cm was too long and they recommended shorter cycles of pri additional work is required to define the thresholds and optima of θv in wet and dry root zones in wine grapes to translate improved knowledge of root to shoot signaling into viable irrigation management strategies that ensure reproducible benefits of pri nevertheless more recent studies indicate that depending on the specific rootstock scion interaction pri can also be beneficial for vine performance even with low irrigation water volumes decreased θv in the wet root zone and lower root water uptake compared to rdi romero et al 2018 2019 thus compared to rdi the application of pri with low water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 improved substantially the monastrell yield berry quality and nutraceutical potential especially for low vigor rootstocks 161 49 c 110 r romero et al 2018 in contrast for high vigor rootstocks 1103 p 140ru rdi was better for wine composition and global quality probably two factors are implicated in this response 1 a higher cumulative water stress in pri compared to rdi due to the low irrigation volumes applied in the wet root zone and increased secondary metabolism and 2 the smaller and more restricted root system of low vigor rootstocks compared to that of high vigor rootstocks which can be more beneficial for the application of pri since a higher proportion of root biomass is exposed to drying soil martín vertedor and dodd 2011 although further research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis besides a study that investigated the synergic effect of pri and saline irrigation water on shiraz and grenache grapevines showed that under pri vines were generally enriched in na k cl and ca2 ions compared to well watered plants under the same saline conditions however in pri vines the cl concentration was low in leaves and higher in roots compared to control plants exposed to the same water volume and saline conditions degaris et al 2016 in irrigated semi arid viticultural areas where evaporation from the soil is high the application of pri can also be relevant because the reduction in evaporation under pri relative to an rdi regime due to the lower number of emission points that wet the soil at one time alters the partitioning between evaporation and transpiration fereres and soriano 2007 although this aspect also needs more investigation intrinsic changes in vine physiology and berry secondary metabolism caused specifically by pri in comparison to rdi have been reported in different field grown grape varieties santos et al 2007 bindon et al 2008 conesa et al 2016 romero et al 2016b 2016c and hormonal changes induced by pri seem to be involved field grown pri monastrell vines showed an increased xylem sap aba concentration following re irrigation romero et al 2014 and an altered endogenous hormonal status of the berries at harvest compared to rdi vines romero et al 2015 long term pri applied for 7 years improved the phenolic profile and enhanced the nutraceutical properties of monastrell berries and wines higher concentrations of flavonols malvidins acylated anthocyanins and amino acids compared to rdi with the same volume of water romero et al 2016b as aba is implicated in berry ripening and the grapevine response to stress ferrandino and lovisolo 2014 the increase in the xylem berry aba concentration may explain the increases in the concentrations of ﬂavonoids and stilbenes observed with pri alonso et al 2021 however it is not only aba that seems to be involved in the response to pri since pri also altered significantly the concentrations of salicylic acid sa which increased and jasmonic acid ja which decreased in the berries compared to rdi romero et al 2015 the increased levels of endogenous sa in pri vines might have contributed also to enhanced accumulation of phenolic compounds at harvest niculcea et al 2013 2014 ruiz garcía et al 2012 pri can also alter the sensory perception of wines romero et al 2019 found that pri wines were more aromatic than rdi wines with an increased presence of some volatile unpleasant alcohols in the wines in cabernet sauvignon pri increased the presence of volatile c13 norisoprenoids some with positive sensory characteristics in wines β damascenone β ionone and others with negative characteristics such as a kerosene like odor 1 1 6 trimethyl 1 2 dihydronaphtalene tdn bindon et al 2007 a better vine water status and greater growth restriction have often been reported in field grown pri vines compared to rdi with the same water volume applied for both white and red wine varieties and mainly in more drought sensitive varieties de souza et al 2005 grant et al 2007 the restriction of vegetative growth in pri grapevines is explained better by chemical signals rather than hydraulic signals and probably involves a reduction in cytokinins or an increase in ethylene stoll et al 2000 rodrigues et al 2008 in recent pot experiments carried out by ian dodd s lab re watering the dry side of the pot increased the xylem and leaf concentrations of a precursor of ethylene acc and the leaf ethylene evolution in pri plants thus both local foliar and long distance root to shoot variation in the acc 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid status seem important in the regulation of the temporal dynamics of foliar ethylene evolution in plants exposed to pri pérez pérez et al 2020 some results also indicate a positive effect on yield and wue in vines when pri is applied during the whole of the growing season from budburst to harvest suggesting that early onset of pri is more desirable to intensify the pri response than late onset de la hera et al 2007 the growth restriction due to pri can be beneficial because it allows an increase in the cluster exposure to solar radiation and an improved cluster microclimate with some potential to improve fruit quality chaves et al 2007 however other studies did not find substantial changes in vegetative development or yield intrigliolo and castel 2009 or even reported increases in pruning weight dry et al 2001 shoot plant dry biomass wang et al 2008 and leaf area under pri compared to rdi with the same irrigation water volume antolín et al 2006 de la hera et al 2007 romero and cutillas 2012 although there is still discussion on the relative benefits of pri this irrigation method shows great potential to improve berry and wine quality when applied in combination with optimized rdi strategies in semi arid areas however the success of pri is dependent on several factors such as the variety rootstock interaction soil climate characteristics environmental conditions during the growing season cultivation practices and irrigation management for example fine textured soils promote the release of non hydraulic signals root to shoot hormonal signaling putatively aba tramontini et al 2013 which probably makes the application of pri more beneficial and an improvement in the final berry quality in other soil types e g sandy soils which do not promote root to shoot stress signaling tramontini et al 2013 the pri effects on vine performance and berry quality may not be beneficial although in sandy soils some positive effects of pri relative to rdi have been reported chaves et al 2007 dos santos et al 2007 nevertheless the influence of the soil type on chemical signaling in pri vines needs further research besides in wine grapes it has been observed that pri effects may be more marked with more drought responsive varieties castelao and in years with lower precipitation de souza et al 2005 other studies show that pri vines seem to be more affected negatively by high temperatures high tªmax and tªmin during the growing season than rdi and sdi vines indicating that cooler and wetter years may enhance the pri response romero et al 2016a also decreased total vine water use and sap flow rates under conditions of high evaporative demand have been observed for pri rodrigues et al 2008 collins et al 2010 thus pri reduced vine water use by up to 50 at moderate vpd 3 kpa compared with control vines irrigated at the same level collins et al 2010 interestingly in recent years a wide range of other pri specific positive responses has been observed in different species for example pri improved photosynthetic capacity parameters carboxylation efficiency co2 saturated photosynthetic rate intrinsic wuei wang et al 2012 and changed the stomatal morphology smaller guard cells lower stomatal density allowing a more conservative control of plant water use than with rdi yang et al 2012 besides pri has also received attention because re wetting dry soil provokes both physical and biological changes which affect microbial processes and soil nutrient availability and can improve crop nutrition dodd et al 2015 jovanovic and stikic 2018 hence some studies showed that pri increases the activity of soil microorganisms root nutrient uptake capacity and soil n availability improves n nutrition and optimizes n distribution in the canopy li et al 2010 sun et al 2013b wang et al 2009 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2013 the explanation is that re wetting of previously dry soil induces an increase in n mineralization due to changes in physical soil aggregate disruption and biological stimulation of the soil microbial biomass and its activities in the mineralization of soil organic compounds dodd et al 2015 although dry wet cycles of soil may stimulate the mineralization of soil organic c and nitrogen n leading to increased n bioavailability to plants they can potentially also increase c and n losses thus some authors have suggested that pri might not be a sustainable irrigation practice in terms of c and n sequestration in soil plant systems sun et al 2013 these changes in soil microbial processes induced by the moderate water deficits imposed by pri can be relevant in vines because changes in the soil microbiome composition and microbial community structure are related with the expression of local terroir distinctive grape metabolite composition sensory properties and characteristics of wines gupta et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 however all these results have been reported for species such as maize tomato or potato so further research is necessary to corroborate these findings in field grown pri wine grapes nevertheless in wine grapes pri is more expensive and complex to install and to manage than conventional rdi garcía garcía et al 2012 romero and garcía 2020 depending on the rootstock scion combination yield losses can also be important in pri 18 in 161 49 c monastrell romero et al 2018 overall with low irrigation water volumes applied in the wet root zone so it is important to study under what circumstances pri could be economically justified 5 strategies to optimize irrigation efficiency and water savings in deficit irrigation improved efficiency in the use of applied irrigation water in vineyards using optimized di irrigation methods and strategies can be reached by 1 minimizing non productive water wasted water lost by evaporation from the soil and deep water percolation below the root system 2 maximizing root water uptake by the plant water uptaked by the plant useful water and 3 maintaining a reduced optimum leaf plant transpiration by stomatal regulation and or control of vigor and leaf area development subsurface drip irrigation has also been used although less frequently in vineyards under water deficit irrigation management irrigation of grapevines cabernet sauvignon 140ru via a subsurface drip system resulted in greater water savings around 20 due to reduced evaporation yield and wueyield without affecting the must composition compared to surface drip irrigation pisciotta et al 2018 direct root zone irrigation drz is a novel and efficient subsurface drip irrigation technique for water conservation developed to deliver water directly to the root zone at specific irrigation rates and delivery depths approx 60 cm depth and has been applied recently in wine grapes ma et al 2020b compared to surface drip irrigation drz improved the grape yield by 9 12 and wueyield by 9 11 with minor effects on berry composition while maintaining a better vine water status ma et al 2020b the authors concluded that deeper subsurface water delivery in drz may encourage deep rooting to alleviate the water stress in grapevine under seasonal drought ma et al 2020b more recent advances indicate that for grapevine drz improves vine water status increases significantly photosynthesis stomatal conductance and transpiration but decreases a gs and alters rooting patterns by significantly restricting shallow root growth and encouraging root development in the deeper soil profile compared to surface irrigation ma et al 2020a deep rooting patterns can help grapevines to take up water from deeper layers thus optimizing growth and alleviating water stress during periods of heat and drought ma et al 2020a in future studies the amounts and depth of water delivery should be adjusted for this irrigation system and the economic cost benefit analysis installation costs and environmental returns of drz compared with those of other di methods and strategies under different environmental conditions to optimize the drz di method future studies also need to investigate this irrigation system in different soil types and with different grapevine varieties in vineyards the application of pri strategies with subsurface drip irrigation pri sub has not been explored to date but the results in another woody crop lemon indicate that pri sub has great potential to save irrigation water in semi arid areas pérez pérez et al 2017 however higher total investment costs 1338 ha 10 higher compared to surface drip irrigation and greater management complexity problems of maintenance leaks may limit its use in low return semiarid mediterranean vineyards if we take into account the economic effect on the annual cost of production ha the increase is only 4 garcía garcía et al 2021 new technologies are being applied in precision viticulture especially smart irrigation systems based on a network of soil profile moisture sensors that monitor the real time soil water status content continuously shafi et al 2019 these can help achieve better and more precise rdi pri subsurface surface drip irrigation management in different ways through 1 maintenance of more adequate soil water levels in the root zone 2 control of deep water percolation below the root zone adjusting the irrigation accordingly 3 estimation observation of root water uptake rates at different depths and the soil water seasonal dynamic and 4 the correct implementation of wet dry pri cycles e g heterogeneous distribution of soil moisture fig 1 supporting information however there are certain limitations in the use of soil water sensors such as high soil heterogeneity the pattern of the wetted zone in drip irrigated vines vines with deeper roots high sensitivity to salinity the temperature air gaps and the percentage of stones williams 2017 buesa et al 2021 also there is a lack of soil moisture thresholds that can be used to determine whether a rdi vineyard is suffering from water stress and to what extent due to the weak correlations found between the soil water content and vine water status miras avalos and araujo 2021 other factors that may be important in improving irrigation efficiency and vineyard performance under rdi pri strategies and that have been scarcely studied are the frequency of irrigation the emitter spacing and water distribution patterns and the water volume applied in each irrigation event discharge flow rate the effect of the irrigation frequency seems to be more relevant than that of the emitter spacing and water distribution pattern sebastian et al 2016 the results obtained in syrah vineyards indicate that applying a small irrigation dose with a high frequency every 2 days to a heavy clay soil may lead to an efficiency loss compared to every 4 days as the wetted soil volume created is small and close to the soil surface favoring evaporation for a low total application of water 137 mm year 1 sebastian et al 2015 as applied usually in rdi strategies besides under low water availability plants irrigated every 4 days had higher average net assimilation than plants irrigated every 2 days sebastian et al 2016 in contrast for table grapes grown in sandy soils more frequent irrigation resulted more beneficial than low frequency irrigation myburgh 2012 high frequency irrigation of field grown pri vines in semi arid areas 3 5 times per week seems to be beneficial to maintain adequate soil moisture in the wet root zone romero et al 2012 2014 but little is known about the influence of lower irrigation frequencies 1 2 times per week on pri vines performance besides recent results indicate that less frequent irrigation events in addition to reducing evaporation from the soil lead to lower n2o emissions though the amount is dependent upon the local climate saptoka et al 2020 less frequent water application allows more time for oxygen to penetrate into the soil matrix between irrigation events which would favor microbial nitrification when soil water content is low enough these factors lead to a suppression of all microbial activity in the soil and hence an overall decrease in n2o emission saptoka et al 2020 interestingly in merlot and syrah vineyards am fungal colonization was higher when irrigation was performed every three days compared with daily irrigation indicating an irrigation frequency effect on the physiology of the fungal communities holland et al 2014 therefore more importance should be given to this factor when implementing rdi pri strategies and more research is necessary besides di applied as an early or late rdi strategy also promotes arbuscular colonization of fine roots by mycorrhizal fungi in grapevines in semi arid arid climates making the root system of the vine more efficient in water and nutrient uptake schreiner et al 2007 this suggests that the application of water saving irrigation strategies e g low input optimized rdi pri strategies combined with more sustainable agroecological practices such as the use of cover crops mulching composting and reduced tillage can enhance soil beneficial microorganisms mycorrhiza and growth promoting bacteria in addition to saving water and increasing the wue this would favor a more sustainable soil use and vine performance and promote other important ecosystem services in di vineyards 6 soil health sustainable soil management and vineyard water use efficiency soil health or quality can be broadly defined as the capacity of a living soil to function within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries to sustain plant and animal productivity maintain or enhance water and air quality and promote plant and animal health and other ecosystems services doran 2002 bünemann et al 2018 nowadays the sustainable management of soil in agriculture is strongly promoted by european policies and initiatives for example the european green deal and the from farm to fork program of the european commission aimed at preserving and or improving soil quality and fertility as soil will maintain its functionalities and productive efficiency only through the conservation of a diverse and active soil microbiome giacinto et al 2020 currently one of the missions of the european commission aims to ensure soil health for healthy food people nature and climate and it is intended that by 2030 at least 75 of all soils in each eu country will be healthy and able to provide essential services that we depend on http ec europa eu mission soil the soil microbiome impacts on the organic matter decomposition nutrient cycling and buffering soil structure redox balance and degradation of pollutants furthermore it influences plant health and growth both positively processes such as mycorrhization symbiotic interactions and resistance induction and negatively pathogenic infection thus the microbiota can be considered as a key player in soil functionality ensuring soil productivity and product quality in agricultural production systems despite the fact that little is known about the importance of single organisms for ecosystem functionality or about redundancy among organisms it is commonly agreed that high biodiversity can ensure vital and productive soils and buffers negative impacts hendgen et al 2018 giacinto et al 2020 vineyard soils are of major interest as they are an important determinant of grape and wine quality a common basis for the classification of vineyard sites and part of the so called terroir of wines terroir includes specific soil included microbial terroir topography climate landscape characteristics and biodiversity features two basic points for sustainable soil management are 1 minimization of soil organic c soc losses with conservation agriculture techniques altieri et al 2015 and 2 enhancement of the soil organic matter som content by the addition of quantities of organic materials animal manure prunings compost mulch tree leaves cover crops crops that leave large amounts of residues etc on a regular basis as a key strategy to enhance the soil quality and the resilience of vineyards som improves the soil s water retention capacity and infiltration thus diminishing runoff and the transport of soil particles with water during intense rainfall events altieri et al 2015 lazcano et al 2020 soil organic carbon soc improves surface soil aggregation by promoting the formation of clay organic matter complexes and thereby aggregate stability in the soil hendgen et al 2020 the management effects on the soc balance of soils in field can be expected after five years at the earliest which underlines the importance of long term sustainable management and of long term research studies hendgen et al 2020 therefore the development of long term strategies to ensure that the som pool increases preferably maintaining it above the threshold or critical level of 15 g kg 1 5 by weight is essential to reduce soil degradation risks and reverse degradation trends lal 2015 these soil management practices that increase som and the soil water holding capacity are widely used in alternative viticulture such as organic and biodynamic viticulture and they increase the usage of green water water that is sourced directly by the vineyard from natural sources such as rainfall and snow good management of this water stored in the soil is crucial to reduce the vine irrigation requirements and increase the rainfall wue medrano et al 2015 besides in a drip irrigated vineyard soil evaporation e can represent up to 30 40 of the seasonal grapevine crop evapotranspiration etc lópez urrea et al 2020 and model predictions indicate higher evaporation losses from the soil 40 43 of etc adj under future climate scenarios phogat et al 2020 thus appropriate vineyard soil management and irrigation scheduling can reduce soil e thereby improving crop wue and water conservation lópez urrea et al 2020 in accordance with the potential global contributions to cc mitigation and adaptation of the options to combat agricultural land degradation proposed by ipcc 2019 the strategy for soil quality soil fertility restoration should a minimize soil erosion and compaction b create a positive soc budget increase soc and improve the availability of macro and micronutrients c enhance rhizospheric processes and activity and the species diversity of soil biota micro meso and macro d agro forestry and e improve soil structural stability and pore geometry lal et al 2015 there are several practices that contribute to this fig 2 6 1 application of soil amendments compost biochar in vineyards the addition of high quality compost commonly added to soil as an organic fertilizer and soil amendment fig 2a increases som retains moisture increases the gravimetric soil water content and soil structural stability decreases soil bulk density and soil erosion provides beneficial micronutrients that may not normally be added to the soil increases soil microbial biomass microbial diversity and microbiological activity increases the abundance and diversity of earthworms improves soil porosity and soil quality and may have beneficial effects against plant pathogens pérès et al 1998 brown and cotton 2011 mugnai et al 2012 mehta et al 2014 bai et al 2018 de corato 2020 krauss et al 2020 lazcano et al 2020 for example in monastrell the use of organic amendments distillery organic waste compost 5 ton ha improved soil fertility and grape yield especially in the drip irrigated trellising vineyards compared to vineyards without organic amendments in addition reduced co2 emissions compared to manure application marín martínez et al 2021 in pinot noir vineyards the application of organic fertilizers increased the abundance of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes as compared to the synthetic fertilizer reducing the relative abundance of plant parasitic or herbivore nematodes and suggesting a strong role of organic fertilizer inputs in maintaining a balanced and complex food web lazcano et al 2021 similarly the use of organic soil amendments generally decreased the total plant parasitic nematode tppn populations while increasing the total non plant parasitic free living nematodes tfln thus increasing the tfln tppn ratios in a vineyards rahman et al 2014 also in mediterranean type soils compost additions increase the aggregate stability infiltration rate and soil water holding capacity and may provide some resilience to drought conditions and improve wue lazcano et al 2020 in merlot vineyards compost application 5 tonnes ha depending on the soil characteristics increased the som microbial biomass soil mg content and leaf chlorophyll content and affected vine productivity increasing yield and berry weight ponchia et al 2012 in a drip irrigated vineyard in a mediterranean type climate the combined effects of moderate irrigation and on farm compost application 7 5 tonnes ha induced an improvement in the quality polyphenols accumulation of grapes of variety montepulciano compared to moderate irrigation without compost cirigliano et al 2017 besides compost can bolster food safety by increasing soil microbial diversity and activity and even promote bacterial communities that suppress pathogens which can act as competitors or antagonists and reduce pathogen survival devarajan et al 2021 however when applying compost the type of compost or soil amendment the application rate and the nutrient input into the vineyard have to be considered and managed carefully depending on the type of soil and thus avoid inappropriate use for instance the inorganic and organic n inputs increase with the compost application rate lazcano et al 2020 high n inputs might cause nitrate leaching into groundwater and lead to excessive plant vigor dense foliage in the cluster zone and compact clusters which are directly linked to a higher predisposition towards bunch rot santos et al 2020 soil phosphorus p is also typically increased by compost application and the combined effect of a relatively low p demand by the wine grapes and increased p availability due to p sorption inhibition can lead to excess p in the soil following compost application in addition compost application usually increases soil extractable potassium k with very high levels of soil k corresponding to higher application rates the strongest effect of compost applications to vineyard soils on wine quality may be due to the k supply with increased k and ph observed in grapes and musts as a result of compost addition chan et al 2010 lazcano et al 2020 besides depending on the quality of processed input material compost may contain considerable heavy metal contents which can have potential negative effects thus the use of high quality compost preferably from organic farming with a low medium nutrient content n 2 3 2 6 p2o5 1 4 1 6 k2o 1 1 1 5 and low moderate rates of application 5 7 5 tonnes ha year can be a good alternative for sustainable vineyards nevertheless improvements in vine wue yield and berry and wine quality especially the polyphenol composition following application of compost require further investigation another important issue is the availability of high quality organic compost and associated costs that can be a limiting factor overall when we take into account its use in large viticultural areas biochar is a high c material resulting from biomass pyrolysis that possesses a stable fixed c structure with high porosity a high specific surface area and high alkalinity when applied as a soil amendment it can increase soil c and soil water retention sorb soil pollutants reduce the soil nutrient leaching potential reduce the yield scaled greenhouse gas intensity ghgi by 17 41 and mitigate cc liu et al 2019 hou et al 2020 in mediterranean vineyard soils biochar addition 5 t ha 1 was found to increase the c sequestration potential by decreasing the soil microbial biomass and som mineralization andrés et al 2019 also montagnoli et al 2021 showed that biochar addition stimulated earlier root lengthening increased the root number at the onset of the season raised the soil ph nutrient concentrations and soil water content during the driest and warmest period and reduced the bulk density in a montepulciano vineyard biochar application 10 t ha 1 significantly increased the soc 20 7 available ammonium 84 4 and available water 11 8 contents of the soil while it also promoted the formation of the large fraction of macro aggregates ø 2 mm besides an increase in fine root biomass associated with radial growth occurred immediately after biochar application and during the water shortage period amendola et al 2017 biochar made from crop residues or sustainable renewable sources produced at low temperatures 400 c and with a high ph 9 0 might contribute to a lower production cost of biochar liu et al 2019 nevertheless the balance between the cost of biochar production and the benefits agronomic and environmental provided by biochar use should also be focused on further long term studies in vineyards 6 2 elimination of soil mechanical disturbances zero tillage management of agricultural soils has the potential to enhance soil c storage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions also less intensive conventional tillage or zero tillage could be another strategy to increase som in vineyards as tillage is one of the major driving forces of soc mineralization and continuous tillage is one of the main causes of som depletion and the current low som content in mediterranean vineyards garcía díaz et al 2017 tillage has a detrimental effect on soil aggregates total n concentration and soil structure stability and therefore can lead to lower om protection and a higher mineralization rate warren raffa et al 2021 besides the absence of soil tillage can increase the superficial the first 0 2 m of soil hydraulic conductivity in vineyards as a consequence of higher macroporosity and om abundance bordoni et al 2019 zero tillage also led to increased aggregate stability soil water holding capacity water infiltration and wue bai et al 2018 in a long term experiment lasting 15 years reduced tillage led to an enrichment of soc and nutrients and also of labile c in the still tilled top 10 cm of soil krauss et al 2020 besides with reduced tillage compared to conventional plowing a pronounced stratification of soc stocks to a soil depth of 50 cm was found together with higher aggregate and hydrostructural stability greater microbial biomass in both the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers and higher dehydrogenase activity in the topsoil in addition there was an increase in gram negative bacteria fungi and protozoa in general and amf nitrifiers and denitrifiers specifically and a lower bacteria to fungi ratio suggesting a more fungal based community krauss et al 2020 in another study zero tilled soils contained 9 more soil c and 30 more microbial biomass c than tilled soil and had an increased presence of aromatic functional groups indicating greater preservation of recalcitrant c also the microbial dehydrogenase cellulase xylanase β glucosidase phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities were higher in zero tilled soils than in tilled soils mangalassery et al 2015 lu et al 2018 reported that no tillage soil had 9 1 12 2 more soil macro aggregates a 10 0 greater bulk soc content and significantly higher percentages of septoglomus and glomus than soil receiving tillage similarly intensive tillage negatively affected the abundance and diversity of amf oehl et al 2005 and a meta analysis including 54 field studies in different soils and crops in five continents concluded that reduced tillage increased the richness of amf taxa by 11 compared to conventional tillage bowles et al 2016 however the effects of periodic tillage on other soil biota earthworms and springtails collembola in vineyards are not necessarily detrimental because they can be modified by the plant biomass and soil quality buchholz et al 2017 it has been reported that reduced zero tillage while reducing fuel labor and machinery costs can also reduce soil emissions of no2 zurovec et al 2017 and co2 and ch4 mangalassery et al 2014 2015 and can help to mitigate global warming but scarce data are available for vineyards 6 3 organic mulching organic mulching placing a ground cover of organic materials on the soil surface also adds organic matter to the soil prevents soil erosion retains soil moisture improves some physico chemical soil properties regulates soil temperature reduces soil water evaporation enhances weed control and reduces the need for tillage medrano et al 2015 lewis et al 2020 gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 thus by applying organic mulches e g a barley straw mulch in vineyards fig 2b soil water availability and wue can be improved through reductions of soil erodibility evaporation runoff leaching and soil penetration resistance prosdocimi et al 2016 in this way it has been observed that mulches increase the water availability in the soil the upper part of the profile by 2 5 in vineyards medrano et al 2015 besides using pruning waste as an organic mulch could be an environment friendly alternative to reduce soil evaporation and increase crop water productivity in large areas where vineyards are drip irrigated lópez urrea et al 2020 achieved a reduction in the vineyard etc of 16 18 with organic mulching in another study in a drip irrigated di vineyard the combination of an organic mulch vine prunings with no tillage enhanced the vine water status as a result of the higher soil water content these soil management practices seem to have been useful in reducing the direct soil water loss and limiting early transpiration losses as eventually revealed by the better vine water status buesa et al 2021 nevertheless these authors concluded that the final greater compaction and lower infiltration capacity of soils under mulching and no tillage suggest that complementary soil improvement practices should be adopted to avoid these negative effects besides yield increases 1 t ha from composted mulch were found in the low yielding areas and under a high mulch rate 153 m3 ha under vine 60 cm wide 7 5 cm depth in different vineyards chardonnay shiraz merlot cs in australia the yield increase as a result of mulch treatment was attributed to the improved soil environmental conditions of reduced diurnal temperature fluctuations and increased soil water availability for vine production chan et al 2010 related to global warming vineyards with a mulch tend to suffer less thermal and water stress fraga and santos 2018 with improvements also in the canopy microclimate and weed control gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 fraga and santos 2018 analyzed the likely impacts of mulching under future climates reporting that this strategy may indeed mitigate some detrimental cc impacts on yield they stated that mulching is a cost effective measure that may mitigate future yield losses by 10 25 and that the mulching benefits would be greatest in the warmest years cataldo et al 2020 indicated that mulching with straw and vegetable residues can be a valuable tool for the enhancement of wine quality sugar content more balanced while maintaining an excellent anthocyanin and total polyphenol content of the cabernet sauvignon berries in mediterranean wine growing regions having soils with low water availability it therefore appears to be a valid soil management technique that is sustainable conservative and less impactful than tillage besides recent results demonstrate that groundcover practices in vineyards especially if managed as mulch e g cc sown in autumn mown in late spring and left as dead on soil surface mulch or spontaneous vegetation mown in late spring and left as dead mulch on soil surface can improve soil health already in a short time period as compared to tillage warren raffa et al 2021 by increasing som improving n cycling reducing soil erodibility and maintaining soil life those practices can substantially contribute to increasing the sustainability of the wine sector in mediterranean europe warren raffa et al 2021 organic mulching could also contribute to a circular economy through the recycling of pruning residues mirás avalos and araujo 2021 nevertheless mulching could be problematic for organic growers since they represent an expensive input in the vineyard besides other issues such as the amount and availability of material needed place of origin and transport mulch layer thickness to be effective against weeds around 5 cm its cost and periodical reapplication could limit its use ferrara et al 2012 more studies about cost benefit analysis of these practices are necessary 6 4 use of cover crops another useful and sustainable soil management practice to increase soc and promote soil quality improvements in mediterranean semi arid vineyards is the use of cover crops seeded and or spontaneous inter rows and or under vines fig 3c and d cover crops reduce the risk of water runoff and soil erosion in the vineyard improve soil fertility and structure and enhance the som content the microbial abundance and diversity in the soil virto et al 2012 diacono et al 2021 and the presence of soil borne fungi hendgen et al 2018 and amf trouvelot et al 2015 besides with the use of ground covers both labile and stable fractions improve their soc content particularly the labile fraction which improves soil fertility garcía díaz et al 2018 in addition the increase in the stable fraction promotes atmospheric co2 sequestration in the soil via an increase in soc stocks compared to conventional tillage soil structure and functional soil properties improve through better aggregate stability pore connectivity nutrient retention and infiltration rates garcía díaz et al 2017 therefore vineyards that incorporate cover crops store more water due to reduced run off soil erosion and evaporation higher infiltration rates and higher soil water holding capacity than those without a permanent vegetation cover or that are tilled garcía díaz et al 2017 lazcano et al 2020 in vineyards it has been found that there is higher root biomass input with spontaneous ground covers compared to seeded ground covers resulting in higher soc increases and soil quality improvement consequently under low rainfall conditions 400 mm per year spontaneous vegetation properly managed according to the site conditions e g a vegetation cover mowed every spring at a height of 10 cm and left on the soil surface can be an effective soil management strategy to reverse soil degradation and increase soil quality in mediterranean vineyards garcía díaz et al 2018 this is interesting because a seeded ground cover requires an economic investment in seeds and the use of machinery for soil conditioning whilst a spontaneous ground cover can be established directly by ceasing tillage these results show the great potential of diverse spontaneous vegetation cover in the vineyard inter row for maintaining pest control services in viticultural landscapes möth et al 2021 reiff et al 2021 similarly in a mediterranean vineyard long term establishment of a natural green cover resident species resulted in an increment in the soc content a larger dry aggregate size and a reduction of bulk density furthermore these changes were associated with higher functional microbial community diversity and a higher density of spores of am fungi capó bauçà et al 2019 möller et al 2021 reported that the strategy of conserving weeds growing spontaneously between the vine rows in mediterranean vineyards and trimming them mechanically when they reach a large size increases parasitoid abundance and the number of parasitoid species biological control potential compared to herbicides application cover cropping with deep rooting mycorrhizal plants and low disturbance management reduced no till can also foster sub soil amf communities with important implications for c sequestration and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions sosa hernández et al 2019 in addition green covers promote multiple ecosystem services in vineyards while addressing cc adaptation winter et al 2018 lazcano et al 2020 ruiz et al 2020 compared to conventional tillage ground vegetation management by cover cropping and the conservation of a native ground cover strongly promote biodiversity conservation winter et al 2018 paiola et al 2020 greater abundance of beneficial arthropods for potential natural pest control danne et al 2010 judt et al 2019 more complex soil microarthropod communities bordoni et al 2019 greater soc sequestration and soil fertility novara et al 2019 and a higher diversity and abundance of pollinators mainly wild bees wilson et al 2018 kratschmer et al 2019 under vine cover cropping using trifolium fragiferum has also proved to be a potentially useful tool for sustainable soil management in mediterranean conditions causing virtually no change in vine performance and competing well against the installation of undesired adventitious species besides the avoidance of mechanical tillage and herbicides use abad et al 2020 although cover crops may not be suitable for use in arid areas since they compete with vines for water especially in the summer months in rain fed vineyards and or with young vines marques et al 2020 some positive effects of permanent or off season cover crops have been shown in di vineyards for example in mature rdi merlot vineyards in california permanent cover crops resident vegetation oats or legumes and no till practices may be implemented with little immediate effect on grape productivity steenwerth et al 2013 in addition under irrigated semi arid mediterranean conditions cover crops enhance grapevine fine root growth higher root density both under the vines and in the inter row area compared to bare soil management ibañez et al 2013 linares torres et al 2018 the presence of the cover crop forces the vine root system mainly its thinner roots to seek water in increasingly deeper soil compartments tomaz et al 2017 cover crops extract water and nutrients from the soil and thus reduce the vegetative vigor of the vine and can also improve grape quality and the sensorial characteristics of the wines trigo córdoba et al 2015 ibañez et al 2013 thus cover crops can be a useful tool to control the excess vigor especially the strong spring vegetative growth pou et al 2011 of some invigorating varieties and rootstocks e g 140ru 1103 p in rdi vineyards in semi arid areas romero et al 2018 romero and garcía 2020 through competition for water in the vineyard however in low vigor vineyards and with low water volume di strategies in dry areas the combination of permanent resident vegetation with di treatments should be carefully considered as it can reduce yield without any benefits for grape quality lopes et al 2011 cataldo et al 2020 in this way cover crops can influence the chemical composition of soil and vines and compete for water and nutrients depending on the species vystavna et al 2020 in addition both sown and native cover crop species can act as potential reservoirs of black foot associated fungi and promote a negative plant soil feedback león et al 2021 this emphasizes the importance of of selecting the best suited cover crop species or mix of species for their use in viticulture for instance select cover crop species with deep root systems which have higher n use efficiencies better nitrate scavenging abilities and lower n leaching potential could help with cover crop resilience for example deeper delivery of c in the soil profile abdalla et al 2019 therefore depending on the characteristics of the vineyard the degree of competition for water between cover crops and vines can be managed by a increasing the mowing frequency b adjusting the di management c selecting less competitive species such as grasses oats barley rye rather than legumes and or d using temporary off season cover crops to avoid competition during spring and summer mowing the cover crop at budbreak can reduce competition between grapevines and cover crops in drier and warmer growing regions lazcano et al 2020 and after mowing the residues should be incorporated into the soil as green manure or left on the soil surface as a mulch even though this stops root exudation the role of roots in maintaining the soil structure during the dry season is still highly relevant as dead roots hold together and preserve microbially created macroaggregates lazcano et al 2020 besides a recent systematic analysis covering different countries climatic zones managements and crops reveals that by adopting cover crops we could decrease n leaching to ground water and increase soc sequestration without having significant effects on direct n2o emissions overall cover crops can mitigate net greenhouse gas balances by 2 06 2 10 mg co2 eq ha 1 year 1 abdalla et al 2019 for semi arid areas receiving limited rainfall a mixture of grasses and legumes fig 3c or a mixture containing a variety of fescues festuca spp has been recommended medrano et al 2015 mirás avalos and araujo 2021 in a recent study on the adaptation of vineyards to cc santos et al 2020 concluded that in all vineyards the soil should be covered by green vegetation spontaneous or cultivated herbaceous cover crops at least during the rainy season and by dead material as in the case of mediterranean viticulture or partial cover crops in areas with intermittent rainfall during the dry part of the season in conclusion the combination of cover cropping and di can be a valuable tool in mediterranean semi arid deficit irrigated vineyards and justify their widespread adoption but more research into their correct management and economic costs is necessary 6 5 agroforestry systems diversified farming systems such as agroforestry systems where trees are deliberately integrated with crops are complex agroecosystems better able to adapt to and resist the effects of cc altieri et al 2015 these land use systems that combine vines as a woody perennial crop and trees were traditionally used in countries of southern europe such as italy portugal spain greece and france lang et al 2019 they provide environmental benefits such as improved soil health biodiversity conservation c sequestration and efficient resource use and play an important role in a multifunctional and sustainable agricultural landscape providing ecological services by reduction of the wind erosion of soil and desertification zhang et al 2018 in agroforestry trees intercept a large fraction of the light available to the crops and there is competition for water and n between trees and crops thus appropriate management such as the choice of the species combination e g trees with a low water demand such as oaks olives or almonds the tree arrangement e g pruning and the distance between the crop rows and trees is important to minimize inter specific competition knowledge of the interaction between vines and trees is very scarce and much more research is necessary in mediterranean semi arid conditions but preliminary results suggest that an agri silvicultural system could be useful for the resource preserving production of high quality wine for instance in mixed cropping systems of grapevines v vinifera cvs riesling and sauvignon blanc with oak quercus petraea and poplar populus tremula x p alba the availability of n to grapevines was favorable and water relations were improved whereas the wine quality was similar to monoculture control the trees were able to reduce water and n losses without negative effects on wine quality lang et al 2019 agroforestry based vineyards in three viticultural areas in the southwest of france showed a decrease in maximal temperatures on the vines particularly on days with high evaporative demand and after 9 years the cultivation of trees alongside vines had not impacted the yield and vigor of the vines or the composition of the grapes bourgade et al 2020 the intercropping of vines with trees for instance syrah and grenache cultivated with pinus pinea fig 2e or cypress cupressus sempervirens pear pyrus communis and service tree sorbus domestica can modify the microclimate and potentially the grapevine responses to water stress through three mechanisms shading wind breaking and evapotranspiration grimaldi et al 2017 the microclimatic benefits can cause the grapes to ripen weeks later than in surrounding areas leading to higher quality wine and increased tolerance of vines to heat and frost and the trees harbor populations of beneficial insects agroforestry also sequesters large amounts of c from the atmosphere and is therefore a prime solution to counter the effects of cc 6 6 use of mutualistic plant microbe interactions arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi amf ecosystems services provided by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi amf include among others 1 increase grapevine growth and nutrition by a better access to soil nutrients 2 increase the tolerance to abiotic stresses such as water stress and protect against biotic stresses such as root diseases 3 produce glycoproteins and a dense hyphal network that increases soil volume explored soil structure and stability improves soil water retention save soil nutrients and reduce fertilizer requirement and 4 increase plant fruit quality for human health e g enhancing flavonols hydroxycinnamic acids and carotenoids in leaves and anthocyanins in berries trouvelot et al 2015 massa et al 2020 torres et al 2018a 2018b 2021a 2021b nowadays mutualistic plant microbe interactions offer a novel approach to enhance agricultural productivity also reducing environmental costs that are mainly due to the massive use of chemical fertilizers massa et al 2020 some vineyard agricultural practices and soil managements such as the use of herbaceous plants as cover crops reduced p and n fertilization and reduce irrigation volume e g rdi favor the presence of native arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi meanwhile others practices such as high p and n fertilization full irrigation use of soil pesticides and intense tillage reduce amf root colonization and diversity trouvelot et al 2015 schreiner 2020 today viticulturists are introducing commercially available microbial inoculants to the soil these inoculants include plant growth promoting bacteria and or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi although amf inoculants are commercially available and widely used as bioinoculants in plant nurseries and in field grown vineyards it is not yet clear whether this practice is beneficial for grapevine rootstocks and vineyard performance in the field the inconsistent effects among rootstocks and inocula indicate that the effectiveness of mycorrhizal inocula for enhancing plant growth is unpredictable holland et al 2018 and several factors such as rootstock edaphoclimatic characteristics and native living microbiota in vineyard soils should be taken into account before making the decision of inoculating the vineyard torres et al 2021a overall taking into account that native amf in a given zone are often reported to be more efective than the non native ones hence the importance of better knowing the structure of native amf communities also for possible applications for sustainable agricultural ecosystems massa et al 2020 nevertheless recent studies about the inoculation of amf in grapevines indicate some promising results 1 there are interactive effects between amf inoculation and irrigation amf inoculation in young vines improved the grapevine vegetative growth water status and photosynthetic activity especially when vines were subjected to reduced irrigation not at full irrigation torres et al 2021a 2 amf inoculation exerts a reinforcement on native mycorrhizal colonisation the inoculation with amf led to the increase of positive associations between vineyard soil living microbes and can be positive to strengthen beneficial microbial networks and consequently achieve better soil quality torres et al 2021b 3 mineral nutrient uptake genes were upregulated after inoculation with different inoculants f mosseae vs a fungal and bacterial consortium but the degree of upregulation differed between them suggesting a specific response to a specific inoculum balestrini et al 2017 several of the common upregulated genes were involved in nitrogen metabolism mainly in relation to nitrate suggesting that in grapevine these beneficial root associated microbes are particularly efficient in stimulating plant responses to nitrogen balestrini et al 2017 4 amf inoculation in cs and sangiovese cvs enhanced the production of volatile organic compounds vocs e g monoterpenes in roots and leaves that may participate in mycorrhizal plant symbiosis establishment and function and play a key role in the interaction of plants with the environment and are involved in defense mechanisms velásquez et al 2020b 2020a 7 combining di sustainable soil use and agroecology future prospects in mediterranean vineyards most potential adaptations to water scarcity under future cc have been evaluated individually and few combined adaptations under irrigated conditions have been reported naulleau et al 2021 recent results show the benefits of combining two or more adaptation strategies with regard to limiting the adverse effects of cc thus the implementation of effective combinations of these adaptations enables compromises to be reached between future water availability and grapevine performance and sustainability and provides better solutions for adapting to cc naulleau et al 2021 for instance the yield benefit loss prevention achieved by the use of a cultivar that is adapted to cc could be even greater when combined with an appropriate irrigation treatment naulleau et al 2021 similarly the application of compost increases the soil water storage capacity and berry quality and reduces irrigation needs compared to irrigation without compost cirigliano et al 2017 chrysargyris et al 2018 found that no tillage compensated for a lack of irrigation while minimal tillage allowed better rainfall infiltration the introduction of a cover crop as a living mulch combined with no till could be a powerful tool to enhance the sustainability of systems without compromising the crop yields montemurro et al 2020 while the combination of an organic mulch with no tillage seems to reduce direct water evaporation from the soil lópez urrea et al 2020 buesa et al 2021 besides the combination of pri and soil mulching as water saving strategies could increase the irrigation wue in arid and semiarid areas farah et al 2021 we hypothesize that the application of optimized water saving di strategies involving low water volumes such as rdi and pri combined with drought tolerant rootstock scion combinations and sustainable soil management practices such as composting mulching cover crops and reduced tillage can decrease irrigation needs optimize irrigation and improve wue in vineyards in semi arid regions fig 3 thus it has a great potential role in the adaptation to and mitigation of cc however the greatest and most durable benefits will likely result from the combination of these adaptation measures with more radical agroecological measures that will increase biodiversity and strengthen the resilience of farms and rural communities these include the diversification of agroecosystems in the form of polycultures agroforestry systems and crop livestock mixed systems the use of hedgerows and water conservation and harvesting and the general enhancement of agrobiodiversity heterogeneity and complexity fig 2f g altieri et al 2015 landscape simplification increases vineyard pest outbreaks and insecticide use while increasing landscape complexity reduces the likelihood of suffering pest outbreaks thus decreasing the costs associated with yield losses and insecticide applications paredes et al 2021 it has been also reported that increasing plant species diversity in agroecosystems at different spatiotemporal scales e g floral herbaceous cover crops semi natural field borders trees provides winter refuge for beneficial predators and parasitoids and reduces the impacts of crop pests and diseases as well as the dependence on synthetic plant protection products ratnadass et al 2021 scott clem and harmon threatt 2021 the progression towards sustainability requires changes and improvements in the management of vineyards with each step of improvement the inputs are gradually reduced while the water use efficiency rainfall irrigation resilience and sustainability in the vineyard increase fig 4 many of these agronomic and agroecological practices can be combined in mediterranean vineyards under more holistic approaches such as organic and biodynamic farming but more research is necessary the main objectives of these agroecological approaches are a to maintain improve the fertility of the soil b to produce healthy plants that can resist diseases and pests c to increase agrobiodiversity and d to produce food of the highest possible quality agroecological practices that reduce the dependence of cropping systems on synthetic inputs are numerous and diverse and the transition towards agroecological systems can be progressive or fast merot et al 2019 the transition towards organic farming is a good example of an advanced agroecological transition figs 4 and 5 the organic farming transition can be addressed in terms of sequences of input reduction for higher efficiency using precision viticulture implementation of soil conservation practices and input substitution from mineral to organic fertilizers and approved pesticides to achieve a redesigned organic farming system based on agroecological principles merot et al 2019 figs 4 and 5 vineyards are amongst the most intensive forms of agriculture with a high use of pesticides mainly herbicides and fungicides table 5 and often result in simplified landscapes increased soil erosion and soil and water pollution hence organic viticulture can bring multiple benefits especially related to the omission of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and their associated negative effects gunstone et al 2021 table 5 and the fostering of biological pest control services muneret et al 2019 and increased biodiversity table 4 organic vineyards are considered environmentally sound when best practices are followed and show several agronomic environmental and economic benefits at different levels compared to conventional integrated ones meissner et al 2019 but important challenges have to be addressed specially related to high fungicide inputs frequent sulfur and copper applications and their negative effects on arthropods and natural enemies reiff et al 2021 table 4 besides the time elapsed since conversion from intensive to organic farming may also be important with respect to improving soil properties and vine performance this is because soil quality develops in the long term towards a balanced steady state ecosystem as indicated by a rising soc concentration and microbial biomass and diversity and by changes in soil nutrient fluxes and pools katayama et al 2019 skinner et al 2019 for instance in the first 4 years after conversion to organic and biodynamic management the soil mineral nitrogen content and vegetative growth of grapevines were reduced significantly by the two biological treatments compared to integrated management resulting in a morphology that increased the grapes exposure to light and consequently reduced the susceptibility of the vines to acetic acid rot and botrytis cinerea infection meissner et al 2019 the european commission within the european green deal has defined the action plan for the development of organic production 2021 2027 with the objective of at least 25 of the eu s agricultural land being under organic farming by 2030 as a measure to contribute to ecosystem restoration emissions reduction and c sequestration services european commision 2021 for instance aguilera et al 2015 reported in fruit tree orchards in spain on average a 56 decrease of greenhouse gas emissions under organic versus conventional cropping on an area basis on a product basis greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 39 on average specifically in vineyards they reported a reduction in net global warming potential of 28 mainly due to avoided emissions from fertilizer production and increased carbon sequestration aguilera et al 2015 the application of water saving strategies rdi pri within organic farming systems has not been explored but could have environmental benefits e g greater resource use efficiency as well as enhancing berry polyphenolic and nutraceutical quality because both systems separately increase it however it could also have a great impact on productivity because both systems reduce yield tables 1 and 4 therefore there is a need to improve current organic practices to achieve higher yield and productivity at the farm level moving from a system with low inputs and low outputs to one with low external inputs and medium output rahmann et al 2016 there is still room for improvement by a scaling up best organic farming practices b adapting precision technologies and tools to organic farming and c blending mostly organic with certain more efficient and sustainable conventional practices rahmann et al 2016 ferrara and de feo 2018 besides other techniques to cope with drought and global warming such as the use of local and traditional genotypes new fungus resistant drought tolerant varieties adequate soil selection and preparation modifications in training systems and row orientation canopy management changes in plant density late winter pruning and minimal pruning leibar et al 2017 van leeuwen 2019a frioni et al 2020 santos et al 2020 gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 can also be useful in the short and long term to improve productivity and wue many of these may be integrated in more sustainable viticultural models in mediterranean areas the development of high water use efficiency rainfed systems in semiarid mediterranean areas where there is no access to water as occur in most low productive rainfed

potential pérez álvarez et al 2021a besides recent analysis shows that low density 4 1 inter row x inter vine 2500 vines ha 1 trellised dry farmed vineyards can be also an economically sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to cultivate vines and produce high quality wines in increasingly warm and dry conditions under climate change compared to high density 2 1 inter row x inter vine 5000 vines ha 1 van leeuwen et al 2019b these low density vineyards will experience less water deficit under warmer and drier climate conditions although this difference is less pronounced in soils

and wine quality in vineyards we also show how these irrigation practices combined with more sustainable soil management and other agroecological practices can help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on wine grapes cultivation and make irrigated mediterranean vineyards more resilient and sustainable we analyse the deficit irrigation di strategies used most often for different varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions we review the latest advances in the application of regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying irrigation pri strategies in grapevines red and white grapes as well as other irrigation methods used less frequently in vineyards to improve wueyield berry quality and irrigation efficiency such as subsurface drip irrigation we also analyze recent findings concerning the physiological response of the vine to water stress with more holistic approaches such as hydraulic safety marging and stress distance and discuss how to translate these physiological approaches into the practical application of rdi management in field conditions according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination we review optimum vine water status ranges and the thresholds proposed for better deficit irrigation scheduling in vineyards in addition we consider sustainable soil management practices such as cover crops mulching composting reduced tillage mutualistic plant microorganisms interactions and agroforestry and their potential as beneficial agroecological practices to improve wue soil

introduction in the mediterranean basin viticulture plays a vital role in the socio economic life of the region which often lacks other viable economic alternatives in the southeast of spain woody crops are of great importance regarding their agroforestry contribution and any reduction in their cultivation may lead to abandonment of the land and the consequential problems of erosion and desertification romero and garcía garcía 2020 the situation of vineyards is particularly serious in regions with very limiting climatic conditions such as a shortage of rainfall the establishment of sustainable production patterns based on socio economic and environmental criteria is a key strategy in the progression toward viable and competitive wine production it is necessary to establish systems that make cultivation sustainable by promoting the quality of the wine grape and by implementing working methods with favorable social economic and environmental consequences for rural populations and the environment a productive specialization according to the localization of the grape cultivation quality wines produced in specified regions qwpsr and a consequent differentiation of the product depending on its quality and the surrounding environmental and landscape features could make wine production a viable activity linked to the rural environment fortunately the interest in more sustainable and holistic approaches in viticulture including organic biodynamic and agroforestry farming systems is growing baiano 2021 alternative farming systems place special emphasis on the health of the whole agroecosystem with a strong focus on the preservation of biodiversity soil fertility and soil biological activity by supporting the soil microorganisms and using good agroecological farming practices unfortunately in many mediterranean areas vineyards are frequently located on poor soils which have little organic matter and low fertility and are often bare without a natural or sown vegetation cover under rainfed conditions therefore the processes of degradation erosion and loss of soil are very intense in these semiarid areas and little is known about how to properly manage the soil to avoid these disturbances besides vineyard soils are often subjected to intensive cultivation with frequent tillage and may receive intensive application of herbicides fertilizers and other phytosanitary products this may lead to the accumulation of copper or other fungicides in soils with a negative impact on soil microbiota and soil biological activity hence conventional viticulture does not give too much importance to the soil quality and fertility and is often considered to reduce soil biodiversity and functionality and to drive soil biota extinction by the use of soil destructive farming practices thus in vineyards a number of practices such as intensive tillage high chemical fertilization rates and the frequent and intensive use of herbicides and other pesticides have been seen to impact negatively on soil biological activity and the presence of beneficial soil microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf trouvelot et al 2015 krauss et al 2020 recent studies predict greater warming and more severe water shortage in the south of europe especially in the iberian peninsula and more particularly the south and southeast of the iberian peninsula as a result of climate change cc fraga et al 2016 santos et al 2020 these regions will face great challenges and will need major efforts to adapt to increasing costs and to maintain the quality and productivity of vineyards fraga et al 2012 guiot and cramer 2016 resco et al 2016 santillan et al 2020 for example a study conducted to explore the possible measures of adaptation to cc in several spanish wine producing regions pointed out that the protected designations of origin of jumilla and la mancha are two of the most vulnerable areas which may suffer a high impact due to a great increase in the projected temperature and a decrease in precipitation resco et al 2016 the expected increase in global air temperature and in the intensity of climatic anomalies such as droughts and heatwaves as predicted by cc models for most of the semi arid regions where grapevine vitis vinifera l production occurs fraga et al 2016 will generate a high vapor pressure deficit vpd at the atmospheric level which will produce an increase in the annual rate of potential evapotranspiration eto of around 75 125 mm by the 2050 s for most of europe dezsi et al 2018 in this scenario there will be an increase in the water needs of vines and irrigation will be necessary to maintain the long term sustainability of vineyards and to prevent severe stress in many wine producing regions in the south of the iberian peninsula iglesias and garrote 2015 in this regard a recent study predicted an increase in vine irrigation requirements in arid and semi arid regions of south australia between 3 5 and 7 5 under future climate projections depending on the soil type and indicate that the greatest increase in irrigation requirements will occur during the early part of the season and not in the months of maximum demand phogat et al 2020 moreover in highly vulnerable semi arid regions to maintain the long term sustainability of the vineyards until the year 2050 and beyond it will be necessary to implement changes in vineyard management applying additional adaptation measures besides efficient irrigation especially related with a sustainable soil management applying soil conservation practices and the use of drought high temperature tolerant genotypes with high wue fraga et al 2018 santos et al 2020 tortosa et al 2020 in recent years a considerable effort has been made in mediterranean vineyards to develop and optimize efficient irrigation techniques and deficit irrigation di strategies e g regulated deficit irrigated rdi that require moderate low water volumes in order to improve berry quality and water use efficiency wue quality in vineyards in semiarid areas with successful results table 1 besides the current concerns of consumers about alcohol consumption and health and the associations between wine cancer and health have increased the interest in the elaboration of healthier wines with lower alcohol content and higher concentrations of anthocyanins tannins and other potentially beneficial polyphenols champ and kundu champ 2019 pérez álvarez et al 2021b thus specific low input rdi strategies intended to maximize the polyphenol content and nutraceutical potential can be a good option for healthier and more distinctive red wines recent studies have reported that rdi can alter the must amino acid profile grape aroma potential and wine volatile organic compounds terpenes unsaturated fatty acids alcohols volatile esters in different varieties viognier tempranillo verdejo gewürztraminer among others providing a basis for the management of grape aroma in rdi vineyards lun ju et al 2018 ju et al 2018 vilanova et al 2019 wang et al 2019 valdés et al 2019 kovalenko et al 2021 lizama et al 2021 in rainfed systems soil management is crucial to reduce water losses however we have less experience of efficient soil management in deficit irrigated vineyards and we know little about the best sustainable soil management practices for improving long term soil fertility and quality under deficit irrigated semiarid conditions more sustainable management of the soil within an organic vineyard context in addition to the ecosystem services generated can have a direct effect on the soil water balance evaporation infiltration rate water holding capacity etc and can increase the efficiency of the use of water and nutrients this would allow us to save water manage irrigation more efficiently and possibly achieve better adaptation of di vineyards to cc the aim of this update review is a show the state of the art and the latest progress in the management of di in vineyards b identify and establish common criteria when developing and optimizing di strategies c translate novel physiological approaches and advances into the practical application of di management according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination d highlight the importance of how sustainable soil management and other agroecological practices can optimize the management and sustainability of di in vineyards by describing and quantifying the effects of the sustainable viticultural management systems and soil and irrigation management practices this review update provides decision support for producers consumers and researchers in addition new findings concerning the response of the vine to water stress are described and we discuss how to translate these physiological approaches into the practical application of rdi management in field conditions according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination we consider the combination of sustainable soil management practices and their potential as beneficial agroecological practices to improve wue soil vine performance and other ecological services in rdi vineyards within a more sustainable farming system therefore this study also provides helpful guidance for defining future areas of research the idea is to contribute to a better design of sustainable cc resilient mediterranean di vineyards systems in the most vulnerable areas of the mediterranean basin based on agroecological principles with a special focus on the combination of long term sustainable water use and soil management practices literature searches of peer reviewed

variety of methods and techniques lysimeters heat pulse heat balance bowen energy balance surface renewal energy balance eddy covariance and soil water balance to estimate the components of the water balance and the water requirements of crops crop evapotranspiration etc including vineyards the models that are more commonly used for estimating the seasonal irrigation needs of crops use local crop weather and soil based measurements fandiño et al 2012 the model proposed by allen et al 1998 is one of the most used at a practical level due to its simplicity and robustness this model adopt a crop coefficient kc as the ratio between etc and the reference crop evapotranspiration eto which depends on climatic factors such as net radiation soil heat flux density air temperature wind speed and saturation vapor pressure deficit according to the fao penman monteith equation then etc is operationally estimated as etc kc eto allen et al 1998 factors determining the kc of vineyards include the crop growth stage canopy height and architecture that relate to the trellis system the fraction of soil covered by the crop presence of mulches or active ground cover as well as the soil fraction wetted and exposed to radiation that relates to the irrigation method and soil management crop management and local climate williams and ayars 2005 fandiño et al 2012 there are two options for using kc the single crop coefficient approach where kc represents time averaged combined effects of crop transpiration and soil evaporation most studies on vineyards irrigation use single crop coefficients to calculating etc and to determine the amount of irrigation water required at different crop growth stages and the kc related to the phenological stages of the vineyard williams and ayars 2005 in other way the dual kc approach where the kc value is divided into a basal crop coefficient kcb representing plant transpiration and an evaporation coefficient ke representing evaporation from the soil surface resulting kc kcb ke under water stress conditions the actual crop evapotranspiration eta can be considered being lower than etc and defined as eta ks kcb ke eto where eta is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 kcb is the basal crop coefficient ks is the water stress coefficient ke is the soil evaporation coefficient and eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 allen et al 1998 ks is a dimensionless transpiration reduction factor dependent on available soil water the estimation of ks requires a water balance computation for the root zone hence the importace of having the necessary information regarding the water content in the soil average soil water content for the effective root zone θi 1 m3 m 3 the water content at field capacity θfc m3 m 3 and the water content at wilting point θpc m3 m 3 allen et al 1998 the correct estimation of etc in grapevines acquires a special relevance not only in current studies to establish real needs but also to estimate future irrigation requirements in response to climate change thus projected weather is going to be increasingly important in scheduling etc based irrigation in a short and medium term phogat et al 2020 the application of water below the etc requirements is termed deficit irrigation di irrigation supply under di is reduced relative to that needed to meet maximum etc fereres and soriano 2007 two common di approaches that has been applied in wine grapes consists of the replacement of only fractions of the water lost by crop evapotranspiration etc during the growing season applying the same fraction of etc throughout the year sustained deficit irrigation sdi or different fractions of etc during specific pre and or post veraison periods rdi table 1 with sdi the water deficit increases progressively as the season advances due to a combination of the uniform application of a reduced amount and the depletion of the soil water reserve this pattern allows for water stress to develop slowly and for the plants to adapt to the water deficits in soils with significant water storage capacity fereres and soriano 2007 and in some cases has produced satisfactory results in vines table 1 for instance lizama et al 2021 in cv bobal concluded that watering at 35 of the etc during growing season sdi is a recommended irrigation strategy for optimizing grape skin seed and volatile composition in comparison with full irrigation thereby allowing for an increase in yield as compared to rainfed vines other of the most effective di irrigation techniques utilized in vineyards in arid and semi arid areas is regulated deficit irrigation rdi as it offers greater potential to save water optimize irrigation application reduce excessive vine vigor increase productive water use efficiency wueyield and improve berry and wine quality costa et al 2007 iglesias and garrote 2015 recent studies carried out under different edaphoclimatic and experimental conditions with several wine grape varieties and rootstocks and with different rdi strategies and water volumes applied have given quite similar results with significant improvements in many cases in wueyield and berry quality although also with yield losses averaging between 10 and 24 compared to conventional or standard irrigation sustained di and full irrigation practices table 1 although in many countries vineyards are rainfed the results indicate that low moderate water volume rdi can be an useful tool in many different situations and viticultural areas for irrigated vineyard sustainability in addition any reduction in irrigation water application due to the introduction of rdi practices will lead to energy savings because the application of irrigation in the vineyard is usually performed by technologies such as pressurized irrigation systems and drip irrigation and therefore is dependent on significant energy inputs for the pumping of water frequently from deeper wells that require more energy decreases in the soil moisture content caused by rdi implementation may also have positive effects on the soil c cycle and promote soil c sequestration due to reduced n2o greenhouse gas emissions with no negative effect on soil organic c soc and aggregates stability in the short term compared to full irrigation zornoza et al 2018 emissions of ch4 and the net global warming potential gwp can also be decreased by reducing the application of irrigation water and optimizing irrigation saptoka et al 2020 however when reduced irrigation was applied greater rate of co2 emissions were reported compared to flood irrigation this was attributed to increased aeration of soils that favored soil organic matter decomposition enhancing soil co2 production saptoka et al 2020 besides an increased soil temperature as consequence global warming accompanied by a decline in soil water content and water stress could also increase soil microbial respiration and soil co2 emmisions to the atmosphere saptoka et al 2020 badraghi et al 2021 other benefits of the water stress and low water availability caused by rdi include a reduction of the intensity of pests and diseases one example of this is a fall in leafhopper density in some regions e g california where leafhoppers are pests and this benefit might allow the frequency of insecticide application to be lowered costello and patterson 2012 also lower bunch rot incidence and reduced transmission efficiency for pierce s disease related to plant insect interactions have been found with rdi mirás avalos and araujo 2021 recently heyman et al 2021 concluded that deficit irrigation maintained at 40 of the full irrigation based on the volumetric water content of the soil may help to avoid downy mildew epidemics in vines thus deficit irrigation induced resistance to plasmopara vitícola the causal agent of downy mildew in chardonnay and xynisteri and aba seems to be involved in the observed drought induced resistance to p viticola however one negative consequence of reducing irrigation water use by rdi is the greater risk of increased soil salinity due to reduced leaching fereres and soriano 2007 the effect of rdi depends on the phenological stage and the severity of the stress imposed in each stage fig 1 with efficient scheduling of rdi the soil and plant water statuses are maintained within a narrow tolerance range thus it is necessary to deﬁne several optimum threshold values and ranges for soil plant stress indicators to avoid severe damage to root and leaf function and drastic yield and berry quality losses romero et al 2010 any over irrigation undermines the advantages of rdi and can cost more in terms of the water used and significant losses of water by leaching while under application can lead to severe yield penalties and loss of quality nonetheless these indicators depend on the iso anisohydric behavior of the variety rootstock combination resulting from its interaction with the environment the use of rdi imposes a water shortage during specific phenological periods and is based on the principle that plant sensitivity to water stress in terms of yield and berry quality is different depending on the vine phenological stage and the severity of the stress imposed mccarthy et al 2002 although the sensitivity to water stress differs among wine grape varieties levin alexander et al 2019 cochetel et al 2020 as a general guideline grapevines without water stress have midday stem water potential ψs values above 1 mpa at mild water stress ψs is between 1 0 and 1 2 mpa and at moderate water stress ψs is between 1 2 and 1 4 mpa values equal to or below 1 4 mpa correspond to severe water stress table 2 which can be dangerous for vine performance and vineyard lifespan if maintained for a long time romero et al 2010 using as references other plant water status indicators different water stress ranges and thresholds in different phenological periods have also been established to enable more precise irrigation scheduling and rdi management in vineyards table 2 as these physiological thresholds change during growing season optimum ranges of ψs in different phenological periods were established for monastrell vines in order to improve berry quality romero et al 2013 from budburst to fruit set 0 6 ψs 0 9 mpa from fruit set to veraison 1 2 ψs 1 3 mpa and from veraison to harvest 1 3 ψs 1 4 mpa the sensitivity of the vine to water stress in different phenological stages has been established previously fig 1 basile et al 2011 reported that berry composition in terms of the concentration of anthocyanins and polyphenols was improved when no water stress occurred from anthesis to fruit set with mild water stress between fruit set and veraison and moderate to severe water stress in post veraison the early season budburst flowering fruit set is considered a more critical and water stress sensitive period from a productive point of view than other phenological periods mccarthy 1997 severe water stress during flowering and fruit set can cause cluster desiccation and flower and fruit abscission which reduce fruit load bud fertility and the development of inflorescences and affect bud fruitfulness the following year wample and smithyman 2002 besides from budburst to fruit set it is difficult to control the soil water content by rdi compared to other phenological periods due to the frequent occurrence of rainfall events during spring and the low evaporative demand romero et al 2013 thus water deficits do not usually occur very early in the season in most viticultural mediterranean regions because 1 the soil water availability in the root zone is high 2 the vine is not at full canopy expansion and 3 the atmospherically driven demand and vine water needs are low nevertheless the tendency for lower soil content in spring is becoming more usual due to drier winters as consequence of global warming nevertheless a very light vine water stress 0 6 ψs 0 8 mpa table 2 maintained from budburst to fruit set under rdi was found to be sufficient to reduce shoot growth in monastrell grapevines without affecting significantly the photosynthetic activity romero et al 2013 this can be positive making relatively more carbon c available for non vegetative sinks such as flowers and berries especially with vigorous rootstock scion combinations following this approach for many rdi strategies in vineyards early season irrigation does not start until a certain threshold value of ψs or a certain mild water stress level in the vine is reached and it may even be the case that no irrigation is applied in this period budburst fruit set table 1 on the other hand adequate post harvest irrigation usually between 20 and 40 etc is also important to stimulate root growth in this period and to ensure that the necessary carbohydrates reserves are accumulated for the beginning of the following year in wine grapes cultivation rdi is commonly applied during the two phenological periods that coincide with the highest evaporative demand and vine water needs in order to save water and to increase wueyield and berry and wine quality fig 1 table 1 firstly a water deficit is applied from fruit set to veraison pre veraison water deficit to control berry size and reduce vine vigor mccarthy et al 2002 in this period there is a certain overlap between the vegetative and reproductive growth phases phase i of berry development fig 1 subsequently a water deficit is applied after veraison during berry ripening phase iii post veraison water deficit in order to increase the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds castellarin et al 2007a 2007b in general the pre veraison water deficit is more effective than the post veraison water deficit in reducing vegetative development and berry growth santesteban et al 2011 intrigliolo et al 2012 buesa et al 2017 levin et al 2020 and can also accelerate the change in berry color herrera and castellarin 2016 besides qrt pcr data show an alteration in gene expression caused by early water deficit pre veraison and underline the role of gene regulation transcription factors and mirnas involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway within secondary metabolism as a vine response to mitigate water stress zombardo et al 2020 however the severity of water deficit during pre veraison can adversely affect subsequent ripening for instance romero et al 2013 found that complete irrigation cut off during the pre veraison period from fruit set to veraison substantially decreased berry growth at veraison as well as photosynthetic activity the pre veraison water status and the recovery of photosynthesis during early ripening which inhibited the flavonoids and sugar metabolism and translocation to fruit during the veraison early ripening period in rdi monastrell grapevines berry quality color development and synthesis of sugars and anthocyanins seems to be more sensitive to vine water status in the early rather than the late stages of the ripening process mathews anderson 1989 rdi applied after veraison increases the concentration at harvest of key free terpenes such as geraniol and citronellol for gewürztraminer grapes and can potentially improve wine aroma kovalenko et al 2021 a post veraison improvement in the cluster microclimate under rdi greater sun exposure of clusters and higher incident par in the clusters can also increase anthocyanin flavonol accumulation and bring about compositional changes compared to more irrigated vines deluc et al 2009 grimplet et al 2009 romero et al 2016c as the total levels of malvidin glucosides and flavonols are generally enhanced under increased light intensity downey et al 2006 anthocyanins and flavonols are important components in the determination of wine style and quality as flavonols can conjugate with anthocyanins a process called copigmentation that reinforces the long term stability of wine color and the nutraceutical properties of rdi wines castellarin et al 2015 nevertheless both pre and post veraison moderate water deficits have the potential to benefit berry and wine quality in different ways including 1 a reduced berry weight and size and a higher skin pulp ratio chacón vozmediano et al 2020 2 an improvement in the cluster microclimate due to a reduced canopy leaf area and more open canopies 3 changes in the root to shoot ratio 4 an altered endogenous hormonal response e g increased abscisic acid aba in roots leaves and or berries and or 5 greater expression of key genes regulating flavonoid biosynthesis e g the anthocyanins synthesis pathway sugar unloading and accumulation of proline and other amino acids alatzas et al 2021 in addition pre and post veraison water stress affect the anthocyanin composition differently suggesting a differential regulation of the genes involved in the last steps of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway ollé et al 2011 these authors found in shiraz vines that pre veraison water stress had no effect on total proanthocyanidin accumulation but increased the accumulation of all anthocyanins except malvidin and p coumaroylated derivatives whereas post veraison water stress enhanced the overall anthocyanin biosynthesis particularly of malvidin and p coumaroylated derivatives these results suggest the possibility of developing rdi strategies that produce both pre and post veraison stresses to maximize anthocyanin accumulation since the two stresses differently impact the hydroxylation and methylation of anthocyanins ollé et al 2011 although this response can depend on the genotype of the cultivar rdi di strategies have also been shown in different varieties tempranillo cabenet sauvignon monastrell bobal among others to 1 up regulate the expression of several genes responsible for proanthocyanidins synthesis increasing flavanols and tannins contents in seeds and skins and the berry antioxidant capacity genebra et al 2014 caceres mella et al 2017 2 increase volatile phenols content which plays a significant role in wine aroma lizama et al 2021 3 enhance the expression of flavonoid 3 5 hydroxylase f3 5 h involved in b ring trihydroxylation relative to that of flavonoid 3 hydroxylase f3 h involved in b ring dihydroxylation consequently increasing the proportion of b ring tri hydroxylated anthocyanins castellarin et al 2007a 2007b santesteban et al 2011 pinasseau et al 2017 romero et al 2019 and 3 stimulate the activity of the 3 o and 5 o methyltransferase enzymes resulting in an increase in methylated anthocyanins mainly malvidin derivatives romero et al 2016c yang et al 2020b 2020a and acylated anthocyanins especially malvidin 3 acetyl glucoside lun ju et al 2019 in berries and wines improving also the nutraceutical properties and health benefits of red rdi wines quintieri et al 2013 tri hydroxylated anthocyanins are more stable against oxidation or degradation than di hydroxylated forms mori et al 2007 which could be another reason besides f 3 5 h upregulation for their higher proportion under greater water stress and high temperature yu and kurtural 2020 in contrast in water stressed table grapes cvs autumn royal and italia the amount of di hydroxylated anthocyanins increased relatively more than that of the tri hydroxylated anthocyanins under rdi catacchio et al 2019 the total water consumption of vineyards 100 crop evapotranspiration etc under full water supply well watered plants ranges from 300 to 700 mm per season depending on meteorological conditions affecting eto and kc and the grapevine variety environment interaction medrano et al 2015 lópez urrea et al 2012 torres et al 2021a the common rdi approach that has been applied in wine grapes consists of the replacement of fractions of the water lost by crop evapotranspiration etc during the growing season table 1 however some studies have shown that irrigation comprising a constant fraction of that received by well watered plants might result in either excessive or insufficient irrigation hochberg et al 2017 this emphasizes the advantage of utilizing plant water status indicators based on vine water demand rather than only weather soil moisture etc based methods to manage specialized irrigation techniques such as rdi fereres and soriano 2007 acevedo opazo et al 2010 thus physiologically based rdi approaches that have been successfully applied in vineyards consist of the application of irrigation based on the optimum water status measured more frequently as the ψs pre dawn leaf water potential ψpd midday leaf water potential ψl leaf stomatal conductance gs or intrinsic leaf water use efficiency wueintrinsic a gs or less frequently as the c isotope discrimination δ13c and canopy temperature tc crop water stress index cwsi to maintain the vine water status within the optimum range proposed table 2 romero et al 2013 chacón vozmediano et al 2020 alternatively irrigation water may be applied only when the physiological indicator parameter drops below a certain threshold value of water stress cifre et al 2005 cancela et al 2016 matese et al 2018 munitz et al 2020 barbagallo et al 2021 sometimes all these approaches have been combined in specific rdi strategies with satisfactory results table 1 our current knowledge of the effects of water stress on grapevine photosynthesis yield and quality indicates that gs can be an earlier indicator of water stress than ψs chaves et al 2003 therefore the maintenance of grapevines in a gs range between 0 05 and 0 15 mol m 2 s 1 may in principle allow 1 maximum wueintrinsic 2 rapid reversibility of photosynthesis upon irrigation 3 relatively moderate yield losses compared to intensive irrigation and 4 optimization of grape quality characters cifre et al 2005 although this can also depend on the stomatal response of the variety to water stress similarly romero et al 2010 reported an optimum gs range between 0 11 and 0 15 mol m 2 s 1 for rdi monastrell grapevines for improvement of wueyield and berry quality in semi arid areas table 2 in field conditions probably linking plant and soil indices for water stress management is the best option from a practical point of view gs porometer ψs pressure chamber or tc infrared thermometer or ground based thermography costa et al 2019 combined with discrete continuos soil moisture measurement may be a better way to quantify the water stress in grapevines because although it requires some technical training and are time consuming measurements its acquisition management and interpretation is not excessively complex or expensive an rdi strategy must be developed and optimized for each particular condition taking into account not only the edaphoclimatic conditions and the particular variety rootstock combination but also the irrigation water availability production ceilings established style of grape and wine that is desired wine consumer preferences etc for example for cabernet sauvignon munitz et al 2020 concluded that when maximal yield is desirable early irrigation initiation during spring at budburst should be taken into consideration the postponement of irrigation initiation until advanced stages of the growing season was associated with improved berry composition and this method could be applied in premium vineyards with special precautions bearing in mind the cumulative effects of drought stress similarly limiting the water supply to 25 of etc during early berry development and then increasing it to 100 of etc at veraison proved to be an interesting irrigation management option for cabernet sauvignon in semiarid conditions of southeastern washington soil is deep silt loam rainfall 120 mm year 1 keller et al 2016 this rdi regime limited vigor and berry size and conserved irrigation water while avoiding detrimental long term effects on vine growth and yield however this rdi strategy has room for improvement to save water and improve berry quality probably the application of 100 etc post veraison provided too much water as indicated by high ψs values between 0 79 and 0 97 mpa and 70 etc post veraison where ψs had more adequate values from 0 87 to 1 28 mpa may be a better option since it gave similar or even higher rates of photosynthesis keller et al 2016 other authors have proposed that late irrigation at veraison could also be a useful strategy to delay shoot growth thus reducing the photosynthates available to the clusters and delaying grape ripening and promote adaptation to cc in warm areas gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 theocharis et al 2021 however excessive late irrigation is not recommended due to possible dilution effect and fungi disease incidence the maintenance of vine water status within an optimum range moderate water stress during the veraison harvest period table 2 avoiding dangerous levels of ψs and severe water stress could be a useful strategy to manage adequately late irrigation in vineyards romero et al 2013 negative carry over effects of some rdi strategies can also be important if maximization of grapevine yields or sustained long term high productivity is the main goal buesa et al 2017 shellie 2019 munitz et al 2020 a recent study in 15 field grown grapevine cultivars reported that pre veraison water deficits not only reduce yield in the current season by reducing berry size but can also reduce yield the following season by reducing bud fruitfulness through a reduction in the number of clusters vine thus to maximize grapevine yields water should be applied early to avoid pre veraison water deficits that can inhibit berry growth in the current season and bud fruitfulness in the following season levin et al 2020 probably pre veraison water deficits giving an average ψl 1 5 mpa as reported in levin s study 1 5 to 1 6 mpa an indicator of severe water stress table 2 were enough to disrupt the development of cluster primordia in the buds the authors concluded that an average pre veraison vine water status of ψl 1 3 mpa may be considered a preliminary critical value below which bud fruitfulness is negatively affected levin et al 2020 post veraison water deficit also has the potential to impact on both yield and fruit composition during both the current season and the subsequent one petrie et al 2004 as a general guide most of the rdi strategies that have shown benefits involved the application of moderate or low seasonal irrigation water volumes between 50 and 150 mm year 1 in different edaphoclimatic conditions table 1 studies of physiologically based irrigation scheduling for different wine grape varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions found significant correlations between midday ψs and berry quality components and showed ψs to be a suitable physiological indicator that enabled accurate water supply and irrigation scheduling in rdi wine grapes for both red and white varieties cancela et a 2016 romero et al 2010 2016b in this way a recent meta analysis concluded that both ψs and ψpd have more discrimination ability than ψl with regard to accurate measurement of vine water status and therefore in rdi vineyards ψl should be replaced as a general rule by either midday stem or pre dawn water potential readings santesteban et al 2019 however other studies reported that ψpd is poorly related to soil water content compared to ψs and ψl and would not be useful for the accurate determination of vine water status under high frequency di while ψl could be a reliable indicator of grapevine water status if one uses the appropriate technique to measure it williams and trout 2005 williams 2017 many studies have revealed that the maintenance of moderate levels of water stress measured as midday stem water potential with an optimum ψs range between 1 2 and 1 4 mpa ψs never being allowed to fall below 1 4 mpa table 2 during the pre and post veraison periods mainly from fruit set to harvest could improve wue berry quality and irrigation management in rdi grapevines table 1 castellarin et al 2007a 2007b romero et al 2010 2013 acevedo opazo et al 2010 levin et al 2020 rdi vineyards typically function well within this safe range of water potentials which do not lead to cavitation xylem embolism or turgor loss charrier et al 2016 2018 gambetta et al 2020 in this range grapevines can experience decreased transpiration e stomatal conductance hydraulic conductance photosynthesis and fruit yield in contrast more severe water deficit e g ψs 1 6 or 1 7 mpa might induce turgor loss and xylem cavitation e g if the minimum ψ that leads to a 50 loss of stem hydraulic conductivity ψ50 is reached that could lead to intense leaf shedding and even vine mortality charrier et al 2016 gambetta et al 2020 in support of this recent results confirm that the ψstem value at which 50 of the xylem embolisms is observed leaf p50 mpa ranges from 1 4 to 2 0 mpa in many varieties such as semillon syrah grenache or chardonnay dayer et al 2020 therefore these critical threshold values can be used in many environmental conditions and varieties for optimum rdi management however not very restrictive long term rdi strategies should be applied especially in warm arid semi arid areas to prevent ψs from reaching or exceeding these critical levels for long periods for example romero et al 2010 reported for a drought tolerant combination monastrell 1103 p that a severe rdi strategy produced an average ψs of 1 4 mpa during summer associated with high air temperatures tªmax 35 ºc although the critical threshold ψ50 of vulnerability to embolism and cavitation was probably not exceeded there was an intense leaf fall in summer as also observed in other varieties charrier et al 2018 a drastic reduction in photosynthesis and a reduction in the quality of the grapes and wines in addition to long term harmful effects due to severe water stress romero et al 2013 2016b 2016c less information is available on the effect of water deficit rdi on phenolic composition and berry and wine quality in white grapes the quality of white wines and their aromatic profile are strongly influenced by the vine water status during the growing season but the optimum ranges of vine water status have not been clearly established in white varieties due to high variability therefore zufferey et al 2020 reported that no water stress or a very mild water stress from bloom to fruit ripening ψpd 0 25 mpa is positive for wine quality and benefits the development of aromatic components in white varieties such as arvine compared to mild moderate water stress 0 3 ψpd 0 5 mpa these authors also reported that the wines from plants subjected to water stress and with a deficiency of yeast available nitrogen content yan in the must non irrigated vines during hot and dry seasons presented a less distinctive typicity and developed a lower aromatic expression with a more bitter taste than wines from non stressed plants that were better appreciated similarly ψpd above 0 2 0 22 mpa increased grape aroma potential in muscat blanc and sauvignon blanc cataldo et al 2021 in contrast mild di strategies 0 2 mpa ψpd 0 4 mpa have been shown to maintain or improve fruit quality in moscatel while improving wue chaves et al 2007 in the same way in cv muscat of alexandria irrigation at 50 etc 136 mm year 1 until harvest under sustained deficit irrigation sdi was sufficient to maintain an optimum vine water status mild water stress for the entire season avoiding severe vine water stress thresholds ψs 1 1 mpa and sᴪ 35 mpa day 1 there was no significant reduction in yield while accumulation of grape sugar was higher and wue was much higher than in the control 259 mm year 1 and in treatments involving pre post veraison water stress buesa et al 2017 in the same way for cv riesling reynolds et al 2010 reported that the concentrations of free and bound terpenes were correlated with the midday ψl suggesting that mild water stress 1 1 ψl 1 3 mpa may be beneficial for wine flavor in contrast a severe or sometimes even a moderate water stress can have a negative impact on white wine quality van leeuwen et al 2019 particularly affecting the finesse and the typicality of aromas the organoleptic characteristics and the perception of bitterness zufferey et al 2020 furthermore high water stress is often accompanied by a reduction in the yan of the must which can be detrimental for white grapes being associated with a decrease in the aromatic precursors concentration in must and in aromas in wines zufferey et al 2020 nevertheless other studies of di with prolonged and severe water stress during the growing season ψs 1 5 mpa reported that di can potentially impact the quality of white wines cv old tocai friulano by increasing the accumulation of potential antioxidant and flavour compounds e g derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids zeaxanthin and volatile organic compounds voc such as monoterpenes in the grapes savoi et al 2016 confirming inter cultivar differences in the molecular response to drought pinasseau et al 2017 this indicates that the vineyard characteristics and grape variety also influence the response to di chaves et al 2007 future studies that evaluate the impact of specific mild moderate rdi strategies on berry and wine quality in different white varieties will be necessary 3 di strategies according to the genotypic characteristics different cultivars have been shown to have different responses to di and there are several physiological traits that can determine this sensitivity and the vine s response to water availability such as a xylem architecture and plant hydraulics b stomatal regulation c aba dynamics d osmotic adjustment e root characteristics and f aquaporin regulation simonneau et al 2017 gambetta et al 2020 the response to water stress involves multiple strategies and can be modulated by the rootstock variety combination mainly through regulation of the primary and secondary metabolism romero et al 2018 degu et al 2019 zombardo et al 2020 even drought tolerant variety rootstock combinations seem to have several distinct characteristic traits strategies table 3 more holistic approaches that integrate these multiple traits and take into account this variation are necessary to predict the response of different genotypes to water stress gambetta et al 2020 and to develop optimize rdi strategies according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety rootstock combination table 3 therefore parameters such as ψ50 and the hydraulic safety margin hsm defined as the difference between the water potential at 90 stomatal closure pg s 90 and ψ50 dayer et al 2020 may be physiologically relevant and useful to compare vulnerability to drought among varieties in different environmental conditions the idea of a vine s stress distance the amount of time that a particular vine could go without water under a given set of environmental conditions before reaching the critical water potential threshold or ψcrit gambetta et al 2020 can also be useful to establish or refine optimum physiological thresholds in different genotypes and environmental conditions for better rdi management for example a strategy to increase the stress distance could be either to decrease canopy transpiration and maximum water use e g favoring smaller canopies using low vigor rootstocks for example 110 r or 161 49 c and or genotypes with tighter stomatal regulation 140ru 161 49 c or to increase water availability to the vine e g increasing the rooting volume with low planting densities deeper irrigation events with more water reaching deep into the soil profile and deeper roots and or using genotypes with greater root system development for example 140ru or 1103 p table 3 gambetta et al 2020 recent advances in vine physiology also show that 1 in general severe drought induced embolism appears to be uncommon for field grown grapevines in the current conditions and probably in the medium term charrier et al 2018 2 vines maintain a significant hsm during the growing season even during the critical period of midsummer with the smallest hsm charrier et al 2018 3 a drought stress memory in grapevines involves growth and physiological changes during recurrent drought events probably through epigenomic changes which can explain certain plasticity in the response to long term di in wine grapes depending on the variety and environmental conditions tombesi et al 2018 zamorano et al 2021 and 4 temperature and evaporative demand drive variation in stomatal and hydraulic traits across grape cultivars bartlett and sinclair 2021 for instance cultivars grown in warmer dryer regions exhibited drought tolerance traits that would reduce transpiration e g cultivars with a lower maximum gs and conserve soil water longer into the growing season in contrast cultivars grown in cooler regions show greater stem embolism resistance and more anisohydric stomatal behavior i e more negative water potential threshold for 50 stomatal closure bartlett and sinclair 2021 recent physiological approaches using classification and regression trees reported that both ψl and concentration of aba are important for characterizing the physiology of the growing season and its effects on phenol grape quality this approach permitted the most decisive variables for predicting the most vulnerable vineyards and wine quality parameters associated with water stress sánchez ortiz et al 2021 simmoneau et al 2017 also indicated that anisohydric cultivars such as chardonnay and syrah may be recommended in the case of short periods of water stress e g moderate short rdi table 3 while isohydric ones appear more suitable in the face of long periods of severe drought e g moderate severe and more prolonged rdi however this classification has been questioned hochberg et al 2018 and recent results indicate that cultivars respond similarly to one another at high and low water status but their stomatal behavior differs at moderate water deficits which are used frequently in rdi thus v vinifera cultivars possess both iso and anisohydric stomatal behaviors that depend on the intensity of the water deficit levin alexander et al 2019 besides recent advances indicate a high genetic variability in nighttime transpiration in vines enight associated with residual diffusion through the stomata coupel ledru et al 2016 that can contribute considerably to nighttime water loss and reduced wue and transpiration efficiency e g it was found to average 12 of the total daily transpiration in tempranillo montoro et al 2020 studies made in syrah and grenache reported that genotypes with reduced enight limit water use without altered growth and with higher transpiration efficiency and suggest that reduced nighttime transpiration is a relevant breeding target for high water use efficiency in grapevine coupel ledru et al 2016 in contrast other studies indicate that nighttime transpiration represents a negligible part of the water loss and does not increase the risk of water stress and hydraulic failure in several grapevine varieties grenache syrah and semillon dayer et al 2021 nevertheless the studies show 1 the minimum conductance gmin the minimum water loss after stomatal closure may became more important during drought progression dayer et al 2021 and 2 the highest enight corresponded to days in which the daytime transpiration and soil moisture content were very low more water stress montoro et al 2020 clearly more studies are necessary to explore the contribution of nocturnal water loss to drought tolerance and wue in grapevines and more effort has to be made by agronomists and field technicians in translating these new physiological approaches and advances into more practical applications of rdi scheduling and management in field conditions besides the decoupling of the accumulation of sugars and that of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds observed in field grown vines submitted to heat stress can have consequences for the anthocyanins sugar ratio and the color alcohol balance sadras and moran 2012 this suggests that rdi strategies as applied nowadays will have to be adapted e g higher volumes and or modified frequency or di strategy to new climatic conditions e g high summer temperatures and greater soil water deficits as a consequence of global warming to minimize undesirable effects on berry and wine quality for instance sadras and moran 2012 reported that water deficit increased the anthocyanin total soluble solids tss ratio in cabernet franc and they proposed that a water deficit established shortly before veraison could partially restore this ratio however this will depend on the variety rootstock and the local climatic conditions nevertheless critical periods such as midsummer coinciding with veraison and ripening with more intense frequent and prolonged heat wave episodes as predicted by cc models will have to be managed carefully under rdi to maintain a secure hsm and avoid dangerous levels of ψs and harmful effects on berry quality 4 partial root zone drying irrigation pri and irrigation management in wine grapes di strategies have been developed and applied more frequently using conventional surface drip irrigation but other physiologically based irrigation methods have also been used in di wine grape crops such as partial root zone drying irrigation pri the pri technique involves drying part of the root system while simultaneously maintaining the remaining roots in a well watered state this seeks to promote the production of chemical signals in the dry roots e g abscisic acid aba at the same time the irrigated roots supply sufficient water to the shoots to prevent plant water deficit because the effect is transient in practice it is necessary to keep part of the root system dry to maximize the production of root signals and to apply water to the other side of the vine for a particular period alternating at intervals of 7 14 d kriedemann and goodwin 2003 in pri vineyards there is also a tendency towards deeper water percolation and water extraction from deeper soil layers collins et al 2010 romero et al 2012 2018 as a consequence of a deeper root system development dos santos et al 2007 compared to rdi vines although this response can also depend on the irrigation volume applied and on the total content of available soil water some studies have indicated that the benefits of pri relative to rdi depend also on 1 genotypic variation in root distribution and the proportion of root biomass exposed to drying soil martín vertedor and dodd 2011 and 2 the volumetric soil water content maintained in the wet root zone θv wet hutton and loveys 2011 this is determined by irrigation management irrigation frequencies and volumes the maintenance of a high θv wet during drying re watering cycles seems to be important to improve the vine performance of wine grapes under long term pri in semi arid conditions romero et al 2012 in this respect the stomatal behavior and hormonal response have been found to be related more closely to θv wet as also predicted by a model of sap flow during pri dodd et al 2008a b and the relative contribution of both sides θv wet vs θv dry during a pri cycle than to θvdry alone thus in monastrell 1103 p ample irrigation and the maintenance of a high water content in the wet root zone at 10 60 cm produced higher whole vine hydraulic conductance and led to a significant effect on water uptake in the irrigated root zone that compensated for diminished water uptake from the drier soil romero et al 2012 as observed in other species under pri kang et al 2002 hu et al 2011 probably the deeper water percolation through the soil observed for pri with a high irrigation volume was also more beneficial for 1103 p because this rootstock shows deeper root growth during the warm and dry summer period alsina et al 2011 and could benefit from deeper irrigation table 3 however this compensatory effect was not observed when a low water content was maintained in the wet root zone and the total soil water availability was low probably due to limited sap flow from roots in drying soil when θv dry was too low romero et al 2014 similarly pri vines irrigated at 100 etc maintained higher night time sap flow water uptake during growing season compared to control vines 100 etc but this did not happen when it was watered at 50 etc fuentes et al 2014 probably an increased root volume and depth in pri 100 etc increased the buffer capacity of soils soil moisture to maintain physiological functioning at day and night time fuentes et al 2014 wang et al 2012b recommended that θv wet should be maintained relatively high whereas in the drying zone it should not be very low both conditions being crucial to maintain high soil and plant water statuses while sustaining aba signaling the early onset of cavitation and embolism of drying root xylem with soil moisture levels close to wilting point may restrict water flow and delay root water uptake after rewatering as observed in pri field grown syrah vines fuentes et al 2014 these authors suggested that shifting sides every 10 days for pri treatments for their specific soil conditions soil had a strong compactation layer at 40 cm was too long and they recommended shorter cycles of pri additional work is required to define the thresholds and optima of θv in wet and dry root zones in wine grapes to translate improved knowledge of root to shoot signaling into viable irrigation management strategies that ensure reproducible benefits of pri nevertheless more recent studies indicate that depending on the specific rootstock scion interaction pri can also be beneficial for vine performance even with low irrigation water volumes decreased θv in the wet root zone and lower root water uptake compared to rdi romero et al 2018 2019 thus compared to rdi the application of pri with low water volumes 85 90 mm year 1 improved substantially the monastrell yield berry quality and nutraceutical potential especially for low vigor rootstocks 161 49 c 110 r romero et al 2018 in contrast for high vigor rootstocks 1103 p 140ru rdi was better for wine composition and global quality probably two factors are implicated in this response 1 a higher cumulative water stress in pri compared to rdi due to the low irrigation volumes applied in the wet root zone and increased secondary metabolism and 2 the smaller and more restricted root system of low vigor rootstocks compared to that of high vigor rootstocks which can be more beneficial for the application of pri since a higher proportion of root biomass is exposed to drying soil martín vertedor and dodd 2011 although further research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis besides a study that investigated the synergic effect of pri and saline irrigation water on shiraz and grenache grapevines showed that under pri vines were generally enriched in na k cl and ca2 ions compared to well watered plants under the same saline conditions however in pri vines the cl concentration was low in leaves and higher in roots compared to control plants exposed to the same water volume and saline conditions degaris et al 2016 in irrigated semi arid viticultural areas where evaporation from the soil is high the application of pri can also be relevant because the reduction in evaporation under pri relative to an rdi regime due to the lower number of emission points that wet the soil at one time alters the partitioning between evaporation and transpiration fereres and soriano 2007 although this aspect also needs more investigation intrinsic changes in vine physiology and berry secondary metabolism caused specifically by pri in comparison to rdi have been reported in different field grown grape varieties santos et al 2007 bindon et al 2008 conesa et al 2016 romero et al 2016b 2016c and hormonal changes induced by pri seem to be involved field grown pri monastrell vines showed an increased xylem sap aba concentration following re irrigation romero et al 2014 and an altered endogenous hormonal status of the berries at harvest compared to rdi vines romero et al 2015 long term pri applied for 7 years improved the phenolic profile and enhanced the nutraceutical properties of monastrell berries and wines higher concentrations of flavonols malvidins acylated anthocyanins and amino acids compared to rdi with the same volume of water romero et al 2016b as aba is implicated in berry ripening and the grapevine response to stress ferrandino and lovisolo 2014 the increase in the xylem berry aba concentration may explain the increases in the concentrations of ﬂavonoids and stilbenes observed with pri alonso et al 2021 however it is not only aba that seems to be involved in the response to pri since pri also altered significantly the concentrations of salicylic acid sa which increased and jasmonic acid ja which decreased in the berries compared to rdi romero et al 2015 the increased levels of endogenous sa in pri vines might have contributed also to enhanced accumulation of phenolic compounds at harvest niculcea et al 2013 2014 ruiz garcía et al 2012 pri can also alter the sensory perception of wines romero et al 2019 found that pri wines were more aromatic than rdi wines with an increased presence of some volatile unpleasant alcohols in the wines in cabernet sauvignon pri increased the presence of volatile c13 norisoprenoids some with positive sensory characteristics in wines β damascenone β ionone and others with negative characteristics such as a kerosene like odor 1 1 6 trimethyl 1 2 dihydronaphtalene tdn bindon et al 2007 a better vine water status and greater growth restriction have often been reported in field grown pri vines compared to rdi with the same water volume applied for both white and red wine varieties and mainly in more drought sensitive varieties de souza et al 2005 grant et al 2007 the restriction of vegetative growth in pri grapevines is explained better by chemical signals rather than hydraulic signals and probably involves a reduction in cytokinins or an increase in ethylene stoll et al 2000 rodrigues et al 2008 in recent pot experiments carried out by ian dodd s lab re watering the dry side of the pot increased the xylem and leaf concentrations of a precursor of ethylene acc and the leaf ethylene evolution in pri plants thus both local foliar and long distance root to shoot variation in the acc 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid status seem important in the regulation of the temporal dynamics of foliar ethylene evolution in plants exposed to pri pérez pérez et al 2020 some results also indicate a positive effect on yield and wue in vines when pri is applied during the whole of the growing season from budburst to harvest suggesting that early onset of pri is more desirable to intensify the pri response than late onset de la hera et al 2007 the growth restriction due to pri can be beneficial because it allows an increase in the cluster exposure to solar radiation and an improved cluster microclimate with some potential to improve fruit quality chaves et al 2007 however other studies did not find substantial changes in vegetative development or yield intrigliolo and castel 2009 or even reported increases in pruning weight dry et al 2001 shoot plant dry biomass wang et al 2008 and leaf area under pri compared to rdi with the same irrigation water volume antolín et al 2006 de la hera et al 2007 romero and cutillas 2012 although there is still discussion on the relative benefits of pri this irrigation method shows great potential to improve berry and wine quality when applied in combination with optimized rdi strategies in semi arid areas however the success of pri is dependent on several factors such as the variety rootstock interaction soil climate characteristics environmental conditions during the growing season cultivation practices and irrigation management for example fine textured soils promote the release of non hydraulic signals root to shoot hormonal signaling putatively aba tramontini et al 2013 which probably makes the application of pri more beneficial and an improvement in the final berry quality in other soil types e g sandy soils which do not promote root to shoot stress signaling tramontini et al 2013 the pri effects on vine performance and berry quality may not be beneficial although in sandy soils some positive effects of pri relative to rdi have been reported chaves et al 2007 dos santos et al 2007 nevertheless the influence of the soil type on chemical signaling in pri vines needs further research besides in wine grapes it has been observed that pri effects may be more marked with more drought responsive varieties castelao and in years with lower precipitation de souza et al 2005 other studies show that pri vines seem to be more affected negatively by high temperatures high tªmax and tªmin during the growing season than rdi and sdi vines indicating that cooler and wetter years may enhance the pri response romero et al 2016a also decreased total vine water use and sap flow rates under conditions of high evaporative demand have been observed for pri rodrigues et al 2008 collins et al 2010 thus pri reduced vine water use by up to 50 at moderate vpd 3 kpa compared with control vines irrigated at the same level collins et al 2010 interestingly in recent years a wide range of other pri specific positive responses has been observed in different species for example pri improved photosynthetic capacity parameters carboxylation efficiency co2 saturated photosynthetic rate intrinsic wuei wang et al 2012 and changed the stomatal morphology smaller guard cells lower stomatal density allowing a more conservative control of plant water use than with rdi yang et al 2012 besides pri has also received attention because re wetting dry soil provokes both physical and biological changes which affect microbial processes and soil nutrient availability and can improve crop nutrition dodd et al 2015 jovanovic and stikic 2018 hence some studies showed that pri increases the activity of soil microorganisms root nutrient uptake capacity and soil n availability improves n nutrition and optimizes n distribution in the canopy li et al 2010 sun et al 2013b wang et al 2009 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2013 the explanation is that re wetting of previously dry soil induces an increase in n mineralization due to changes in physical soil aggregate disruption and biological stimulation of the soil microbial biomass and its activities in the mineralization of soil organic compounds dodd et al 2015 although dry wet cycles of soil may stimulate the mineralization of soil organic c and nitrogen n leading to increased n bioavailability to plants they can potentially also increase c and n losses thus some authors have suggested that pri might not be a sustainable irrigation practice in terms of c and n sequestration in soil plant systems sun et al 2013 these changes in soil microbial processes induced by the moderate water deficits imposed by pri can be relevant in vines because changes in the soil microbiome composition and microbial community structure are related with the expression of local terroir distinctive grape metabolite composition sensory properties and characteristics of wines gupta et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 however all these results have been reported for species such as maize tomato or potato so further research is necessary to corroborate these findings in field grown pri wine grapes nevertheless in wine grapes pri is more expensive and complex to install and to manage than conventional rdi garcía garcía et al 2012 romero and garcía 2020 depending on the rootstock scion combination yield losses can also be important in pri 18 in 161 49 c monastrell romero et al 2018 overall with low irrigation water volumes applied in the wet root zone so it is important to study under what circumstances pri could be economically justified 5 strategies to optimize irrigation efficiency and water savings in deficit irrigation improved efficiency in the use of applied irrigation water in vineyards using optimized di irrigation methods and strategies can be reached by 1 minimizing non productive water wasted water lost by evaporation from the soil and deep water percolation below the root system 2 maximizing root water uptake by the plant water uptaked by the plant useful water and 3 maintaining a reduced optimum leaf plant transpiration by stomatal regulation and or control of vigor and leaf area development subsurface drip irrigation has also been used although less frequently in vineyards under water deficit irrigation management irrigation of grapevines cabernet sauvignon 140ru via a subsurface drip system resulted in greater water savings around 20 due to reduced evaporation yield and wueyield without affecting the must composition compared to surface drip irrigation pisciotta et al 2018 direct root zone irrigation drz is a novel and efficient subsurface drip irrigation technique for water conservation developed to deliver water directly to the root zone at specific irrigation rates and delivery depths approx 60 cm depth and has been applied recently in wine grapes ma et al 2020b compared to surface drip irrigation drz improved the grape yield by 9 12 and wueyield by 9 11 with minor effects on berry composition while maintaining a better vine water status ma et al 2020b the authors concluded that deeper subsurface water delivery in drz may encourage deep rooting to alleviate the water stress in grapevine under seasonal drought ma et al 2020b more recent advances indicate that for grapevine drz improves vine water status increases significantly photosynthesis stomatal conductance and transpiration but decreases a gs and alters rooting patterns by significantly restricting shallow root growth and encouraging root development in the deeper soil profile compared to surface irrigation ma et al 2020a deep rooting patterns can help grapevines to take up water from deeper layers thus optimizing growth and alleviating water stress during periods of heat and drought ma et al 2020a in future studies the amounts and depth of water delivery should be adjusted for this irrigation system and the economic cost benefit analysis installation costs and environmental returns of drz compared with those of other di methods and strategies under different environmental conditions to optimize the drz di method future studies also need to investigate this irrigation system in different soil types and with different grapevine varieties in vineyards the application of pri strategies with subsurface drip irrigation pri sub has not been explored to date but the results in another woody crop lemon indicate that pri sub has great potential to save irrigation water in semi arid areas pérez pérez et al 2017 however higher total investment costs 1338 ha 10 higher compared to surface drip irrigation and greater management complexity problems of maintenance leaks may limit its use in low return semiarid mediterranean vineyards if we take into account the economic effect on the annual cost of production ha the increase is only 4 garcía garcía et al 2021 new technologies are being applied in precision viticulture especially smart irrigation systems based on a network of soil profile moisture sensors that monitor the real time soil water status content continuously shafi et al 2019 these can help achieve better and more precise rdi pri subsurface surface drip irrigation management in different ways through 1 maintenance of more adequate soil water levels in the root zone 2 control of deep water percolation below the root zone adjusting the irrigation accordingly 3 estimation observation of root water uptake rates at different depths and the soil water seasonal dynamic and 4 the correct implementation of wet dry pri cycles e g heterogeneous distribution of soil moisture fig 1 supporting information however there are certain limitations in the use of soil water sensors such as high soil heterogeneity the pattern of the wetted zone in drip irrigated vines vines with deeper roots high sensitivity to salinity the temperature air gaps and the percentage of stones williams 2017 buesa et al 2021 also there is a lack of soil moisture thresholds that can be used to determine whether a rdi vineyard is suffering from water stress and to what extent due to the weak correlations found between the soil water content and vine water status miras avalos and araujo 2021 other factors that may be important in improving irrigation efficiency and vineyard performance under rdi pri strategies and that have been scarcely studied are the frequency of irrigation the emitter spacing and water distribution patterns and the water volume applied in each irrigation event discharge flow rate the effect of the irrigation frequency seems to be more relevant than that of the emitter spacing and water distribution pattern sebastian et al 2016 the results obtained in syrah vineyards indicate that applying a small irrigation dose with a high frequency every 2 days to a heavy clay soil may lead to an efficiency loss compared to every 4 days as the wetted soil volume created is small and close to the soil surface favoring evaporation for a low total application of water 137 mm year 1 sebastian et al 2015 as applied usually in rdi strategies besides under low water availability plants irrigated every 4 days had higher average net assimilation than plants irrigated every 2 days sebastian et al 2016 in contrast for table grapes grown in sandy soils more frequent irrigation resulted more beneficial than low frequency irrigation myburgh 2012 high frequency irrigation of field grown pri vines in semi arid areas 3 5 times per week seems to be beneficial to maintain adequate soil moisture in the wet root zone romero et al 2012 2014 but little is known about the influence of lower irrigation frequencies 1 2 times per week on pri vines performance besides recent results indicate that less frequent irrigation events in addition to reducing evaporation from the soil lead to lower n2o emissions though the amount is dependent upon the local climate saptoka et al 2020 less frequent water application allows more time for oxygen to penetrate into the soil matrix between irrigation events which would favor microbial nitrification when soil water content is low enough these factors lead to a suppression of all microbial activity in the soil and hence an overall decrease in n2o emission saptoka et al 2020 interestingly in merlot and syrah vineyards am fungal colonization was higher when irrigation was performed every three days compared with daily irrigation indicating an irrigation frequency effect on the physiology of the fungal communities holland et al 2014 therefore more importance should be given to this factor when implementing rdi pri strategies and more research is necessary besides di applied as an early or late rdi strategy also promotes arbuscular colonization of fine roots by mycorrhizal fungi in grapevines in semi arid arid climates making the root system of the vine more efficient in water and nutrient uptake schreiner et al 2007 this suggests that the application of water saving irrigation strategies e g low input optimized rdi pri strategies combined with more sustainable agroecological practices such as the use of cover crops mulching composting and reduced tillage can enhance soil beneficial microorganisms mycorrhiza and growth promoting bacteria in addition to saving water and increasing the wue this would favor a more sustainable soil use and vine performance and promote other important ecosystem services in di vineyards 6 soil health sustainable soil management and vineyard water use efficiency soil health or quality can be broadly defined as the capacity of a living soil to function within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries to sustain plant and animal productivity maintain or enhance water and air quality and promote plant and animal health and other ecosystems services doran 2002 bünemann et al 2018 nowadays the sustainable management of soil in agriculture is strongly promoted by european policies and initiatives for example the european green deal and the from farm to fork program of the european commission aimed at preserving and or improving soil quality and fertility as soil will maintain its functionalities and productive efficiency only through the conservation of a diverse and active soil microbiome giacinto et al 2020 currently one of the missions of the european commission aims to ensure soil health for healthy food people nature and climate and it is intended that by 2030 at least 75 of all soils in each eu country will be healthy and able to provide essential services that we depend on http ec europa eu mission soil the soil microbiome impacts on the organic matter decomposition nutrient cycling and buffering soil structure redox balance and degradation of pollutants furthermore it influences plant health and growth both positively processes such as mycorrhization symbiotic interactions and resistance induction and negatively pathogenic infection thus the microbiota can be considered as a key player in soil functionality ensuring soil productivity and product quality in agricultural production systems despite the fact that little is known about the importance of single organisms for ecosystem functionality or about redundancy among organisms it is commonly agreed that high biodiversity can ensure vital and productive soils and buffers negative impacts hendgen et al 2018 giacinto et al 2020 vineyard soils are of major interest as they are an important determinant of grape and wine quality a common basis for the classification of vineyard sites and part of the so called terroir of wines terroir includes specific soil included microbial terroir topography climate landscape characteristics and biodiversity features two basic points for sustainable soil management are 1 minimization of soil organic c soc losses with conservation agriculture techniques altieri et al 2015 and 2 enhancement of the soil organic matter som content by the addition of quantities of organic materials animal manure prunings compost mulch tree leaves cover crops crops that leave large amounts of residues etc on a regular basis as a key strategy to enhance the soil quality and the resilience of vineyards som improves the soil s water retention capacity and infiltration thus diminishing runoff and the transport of soil particles with water during intense rainfall events altieri et al 2015 lazcano et al 2020 soil organic carbon soc improves surface soil aggregation by promoting the formation of clay organic matter complexes and thereby aggregate stability in the soil hendgen et al 2020 the management effects on the soc balance of soils in field can be expected after five years at the earliest which underlines the importance of long term sustainable management and of long term research studies hendgen et al 2020 therefore the development of long term strategies to ensure that the som pool increases preferably maintaining it above the threshold or critical level of 15 g kg 1 5 by weight is essential to reduce soil degradation risks and reverse degradation trends lal 2015 these soil management practices that increase som and the soil water holding capacity are widely used in alternative viticulture such as organic and biodynamic viticulture and they increase the usage of green water water that is sourced directly by the vineyard from natural sources such as rainfall and snow good management of this water stored in the soil is crucial to reduce the vine irrigation requirements and increase the rainfall wue medrano et al 2015 besides in a drip irrigated vineyard soil evaporation e can represent up to 30 40 of the seasonal grapevine crop evapotranspiration etc lópez urrea et al 2020 and model predictions indicate higher evaporation losses from the soil 40 43 of etc adj under future climate scenarios phogat et al 2020 thus appropriate vineyard soil management and irrigation scheduling can reduce soil e thereby improving crop wue and water conservation lópez urrea et al 2020 in accordance with the potential global contributions to cc mitigation and adaptation of the options to combat agricultural land degradation proposed by ipcc 2019 the strategy for soil quality soil fertility restoration should a minimize soil erosion and compaction b create a positive soc budget increase soc and improve the availability of macro and micronutrients c enhance rhizospheric processes and activity and the species diversity of soil biota micro meso and macro d agro forestry and e improve soil structural stability and pore geometry lal et al 2015 there are several practices that contribute to this fig 2 6 1 application of soil amendments compost biochar in vineyards the addition of high quality compost commonly added to soil as an organic fertilizer and soil amendment fig 2a increases som retains moisture increases the gravimetric soil water content and soil structural stability decreases soil bulk density and soil erosion provides beneficial micronutrients that may not normally be added to the soil increases soil microbial biomass microbial diversity and microbiological activity increases the abundance and diversity of earthworms improves soil porosity and soil quality and may have beneficial effects against plant pathogens pérès et al 1998 brown and cotton 2011 mugnai et al 2012 mehta et al 2014 bai et al 2018 de corato 2020 krauss et al 2020 lazcano et al 2020 for example in monastrell the use of organic amendments distillery organic waste compost 5 ton ha improved soil fertility and grape yield especially in the drip irrigated trellising vineyards compared to vineyards without organic amendments in addition reduced co2 emissions compared to manure application marín martínez et al 2021 in pinot noir vineyards the application of organic fertilizers increased the abundance of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes as compared to the synthetic fertilizer reducing the relative abundance of plant parasitic or herbivore nematodes and suggesting a strong role of organic fertilizer inputs in maintaining a balanced and complex food web lazcano et al 2021 similarly the use of organic soil amendments generally decreased the total plant parasitic nematode tppn populations while increasing the total non plant parasitic free living nematodes tfln thus increasing the tfln tppn ratios in a vineyards rahman et al 2014 also in mediterranean type soils compost additions increase the aggregate stability infiltration rate and soil water holding capacity and may provide some resilience to drought conditions and improve wue lazcano et al 2020 in merlot vineyards compost application 5 tonnes ha depending on the soil characteristics increased the som microbial biomass soil mg content and leaf chlorophyll content and affected vine productivity increasing yield and berry weight ponchia et al 2012 in a drip irrigated vineyard in a mediterranean type climate the combined effects of moderate irrigation and on farm compost application 7 5 tonnes ha induced an improvement in the quality polyphenols accumulation of grapes of variety montepulciano compared to moderate irrigation without compost cirigliano et al 2017 besides compost can bolster food safety by increasing soil microbial diversity and activity and even promote bacterial communities that suppress pathogens which can act as competitors or antagonists and reduce pathogen survival devarajan et al 2021 however when applying compost the type of compost or soil amendment the application rate and the nutrient input into the vineyard have to be considered and managed carefully depending on the type of soil and thus avoid inappropriate use for instance the inorganic and organic n inputs increase with the compost application rate lazcano et al 2020 high n inputs might cause nitrate leaching into groundwater and lead to excessive plant vigor dense foliage in the cluster zone and compact clusters which are directly linked to a higher predisposition towards bunch rot santos et al 2020 soil phosphorus p is also typically increased by compost application and the combined effect of a relatively low p demand by the wine grapes and increased p availability due to p sorption inhibition can lead to excess p in the soil following compost application in addition compost application usually increases soil extractable potassium k with very high levels of soil k corresponding to higher application rates the strongest effect of compost applications to vineyard soils on wine quality may be due to the k supply with increased k and ph observed in grapes and musts as a result of compost addition chan et al 2010 lazcano et al 2020 besides depending on the quality of processed input material compost may contain considerable heavy metal contents which can have potential negative effects thus the use of high quality compost preferably from organic farming with a low medium nutrient content n 2 3 2 6 p2o5 1 4 1 6 k2o 1 1 1 5 and low moderate rates of application 5 7 5 tonnes ha year can be a good alternative for sustainable vineyards nevertheless improvements in vine wue yield and berry and wine quality especially the polyphenol composition following application of compost require further investigation another important issue is the availability of high quality organic compost and associated costs that can be a limiting factor overall when we take into account its use in large viticultural areas biochar is a high c material resulting from biomass pyrolysis that possesses a stable fixed c structure with high porosity a high specific surface area and high alkalinity when applied as a soil amendment it can increase soil c and soil water retention sorb soil pollutants reduce the soil nutrient leaching potential reduce the yield scaled greenhouse gas intensity ghgi by 17 41 and mitigate cc liu et al 2019 hou et al 2020 in mediterranean vineyard soils biochar addition 5 t ha 1 was found to increase the c sequestration potential by decreasing the soil microbial biomass and som mineralization andrés et al 2019 also montagnoli et al 2021 showed that biochar addition stimulated earlier root lengthening increased the root number at the onset of the season raised the soil ph nutrient concentrations and soil water content during the driest and warmest period and reduced the bulk density in a montepulciano vineyard biochar application 10 t ha 1 significantly increased the soc 20 7 available ammonium 84 4 and available water 11 8 contents of the soil while it also promoted the formation of the large fraction of macro aggregates ø 2 mm besides an increase in fine root biomass associated with radial growth occurred immediately after biochar application and during the water shortage period amendola et al 2017 biochar made from crop residues or sustainable renewable sources produced at low temperatures 400 c and with a high ph 9 0 might contribute to a lower production cost of biochar liu et al 2019 nevertheless the balance between the cost of biochar production and the benefits agronomic and environmental provided by biochar use should also be focused on further long term studies in vineyards 6 2 elimination of soil mechanical disturbances zero tillage management of agricultural soils has the potential to enhance soil c storage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions also less intensive conventional tillage or zero tillage could be another strategy to increase som in vineyards as tillage is one of the major driving forces of soc mineralization and continuous tillage is one of the main causes of som depletion and the current low som content in mediterranean vineyards garcía díaz et al 2017 tillage has a detrimental effect on soil aggregates total n concentration and soil structure stability and therefore can lead to lower om protection and a higher mineralization rate warren raffa et al 2021 besides the absence of soil tillage can increase the superficial the first 0 2 m of soil hydraulic conductivity in vineyards as a consequence of higher macroporosity and om abundance bordoni et al 2019 zero tillage also led to increased aggregate stability soil water holding capacity water infiltration and wue bai et al 2018 in a long term experiment lasting 15 years reduced tillage led to an enrichment of soc and nutrients and also of labile c in the still tilled top 10 cm of soil krauss et al 2020 besides with reduced tillage compared to conventional plowing a pronounced stratification of soc stocks to a soil depth of 50 cm was found together with higher aggregate and hydrostructural stability greater microbial biomass in both the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers and higher dehydrogenase activity in the topsoil in addition there was an increase in gram negative bacteria fungi and protozoa in general and amf nitrifiers and denitrifiers specifically and a lower bacteria to fungi ratio suggesting a more fungal based community krauss et al 2020 in another study zero tilled soils contained 9 more soil c and 30 more microbial biomass c than tilled soil and had an increased presence of aromatic functional groups indicating greater preservation of recalcitrant c also the microbial dehydrogenase cellulase xylanase β glucosidase phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities were higher in zero tilled soils than in tilled soils mangalassery et al 2015 lu et al 2018 reported that no tillage soil had 9 1 12 2 more soil macro aggregates a 10 0 greater bulk soc content and significantly higher percentages of septoglomus and glomus than soil receiving tillage similarly intensive tillage negatively affected the abundance and diversity of amf oehl et al 2005 and a meta analysis including 54 field studies in different soils and crops in five continents concluded that reduced tillage increased the richness of amf taxa by 11 compared to conventional tillage bowles et al 2016 however the effects of periodic tillage on other soil biota earthworms and springtails collembola in vineyards are not necessarily detrimental because they can be modified by the plant biomass and soil quality buchholz et al 2017 it has been reported that reduced zero tillage while reducing fuel labor and machinery costs can also reduce soil emissions of no2 zurovec et al 2017 and co2 and ch4 mangalassery et al 2014 2015 and can help to mitigate global warming but scarce data are available for vineyards 6 3 organic mulching organic mulching placing a ground cover of organic materials on the soil surface also adds organic matter to the soil prevents soil erosion retains soil moisture improves some physico chemical soil properties regulates soil temperature reduces soil water evaporation enhances weed control and reduces the need for tillage medrano et al 2015 lewis et al 2020 gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 thus by applying organic mulches e g a barley straw mulch in vineyards fig 2b soil water availability and wue can be improved through reductions of soil erodibility evaporation runoff leaching and soil penetration resistance prosdocimi et al 2016 in this way it has been observed that mulches increase the water availability in the soil the upper part of the profile by 2 5 in vineyards medrano et al 2015 besides using pruning waste as an organic mulch could be an environment friendly alternative to reduce soil evaporation and increase crop water productivity in large areas where vineyards are drip irrigated lópez urrea et al 2020 achieved a reduction in the vineyard etc of 16 18 with organic mulching in another study in a drip irrigated di vineyard the combination of an organic mulch vine prunings with no tillage enhanced the vine water status as a result of the higher soil water content these soil management practices seem to have been useful in reducing the direct soil water loss and limiting early transpiration losses as eventually revealed by the better vine water status buesa et al 2021 nevertheless these authors concluded that the final greater compaction and lower infiltration capacity of soils under mulching and no tillage suggest that complementary soil improvement practices should be adopted to avoid these negative effects besides yield increases 1 t ha from composted mulch were found in the low yielding areas and under a high mulch rate 153 m3 ha under vine 60 cm wide 7 5 cm depth in different vineyards chardonnay shiraz merlot cs in australia the yield increase as a result of mulch treatment was attributed to the improved soil environmental conditions of reduced diurnal temperature fluctuations and increased soil water availability for vine production chan et al 2010 related to global warming vineyards with a mulch tend to suffer less thermal and water stress fraga and santos 2018 with improvements also in the canopy microclimate and weed control gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 fraga and santos 2018 analyzed the likely impacts of mulching under future climates reporting that this strategy may indeed mitigate some detrimental cc impacts on yield they stated that mulching is a cost effective measure that may mitigate future yield losses by 10 25 and that the mulching benefits would be greatest in the warmest years cataldo et al 2020 indicated that mulching with straw and vegetable residues can be a valuable tool for the enhancement of wine quality sugar content more balanced while maintaining an excellent anthocyanin and total polyphenol content of the cabernet sauvignon berries in mediterranean wine growing regions having soils with low water availability it therefore appears to be a valid soil management technique that is sustainable conservative and less impactful than tillage besides recent results demonstrate that groundcover practices in vineyards especially if managed as mulch e g cc sown in autumn mown in late spring and left as dead on soil surface mulch or spontaneous vegetation mown in late spring and left as dead mulch on soil surface can improve soil health already in a short time period as compared to tillage warren raffa et al 2021 by increasing som improving n cycling reducing soil erodibility and maintaining soil life those practices can substantially contribute to increasing the sustainability of the wine sector in mediterranean europe warren raffa et al 2021 organic mulching could also contribute to a circular economy through the recycling of pruning residues mirás avalos and araujo 2021 nevertheless mulching could be problematic for organic growers since they represent an expensive input in the vineyard besides other issues such as the amount and availability of material needed place of origin and transport mulch layer thickness to be effective against weeds around 5 cm its cost and periodical reapplication could limit its use ferrara et al 2012 more studies about cost benefit analysis of these practices are necessary 6 4 use of cover crops another useful and sustainable soil management practice to increase soc and promote soil quality improvements in mediterranean semi arid vineyards is the use of cover crops seeded and or spontaneous inter rows and or under vines fig 3c and d cover crops reduce the risk of water runoff and soil erosion in the vineyard improve soil fertility and structure and enhance the som content the microbial abundance and diversity in the soil virto et al 2012 diacono et al 2021 and the presence of soil borne fungi hendgen et al 2018 and amf trouvelot et al 2015 besides with the use of ground covers both labile and stable fractions improve their soc content particularly the labile fraction which improves soil fertility garcía díaz et al 2018 in addition the increase in the stable fraction promotes atmospheric co2 sequestration in the soil via an increase in soc stocks compared to conventional tillage soil structure and functional soil properties improve through better aggregate stability pore connectivity nutrient retention and infiltration rates garcía díaz et al 2017 therefore vineyards that incorporate cover crops store more water due to reduced run off soil erosion and evaporation higher infiltration rates and higher soil water holding capacity than those without a permanent vegetation cover or that are tilled garcía díaz et al 2017 lazcano et al 2020 in vineyards it has been found that there is higher root biomass input with spontaneous ground covers compared to seeded ground covers resulting in higher soc increases and soil quality improvement consequently under low rainfall conditions 400 mm per year spontaneous vegetation properly managed according to the site conditions e g a vegetation cover mowed every spring at a height of 10 cm and left on the soil surface can be an effective soil management strategy to reverse soil degradation and increase soil quality in mediterranean vineyards garcía díaz et al 2018 this is interesting because a seeded ground cover requires an economic investment in seeds and the use of machinery for soil conditioning whilst a spontaneous ground cover can be established directly by ceasing tillage these results show the great potential of diverse spontaneous vegetation cover in the vineyard inter row for maintaining pest control services in viticultural landscapes möth et al 2021 reiff et al 2021 similarly in a mediterranean vineyard long term establishment of a natural green cover resident species resulted in an increment in the soc content a larger dry aggregate size and a reduction of bulk density furthermore these changes were associated with higher functional microbial community diversity and a higher density of spores of am fungi capó bauçà et al 2019 möller et al 2021 reported that the strategy of conserving weeds growing spontaneously between the vine rows in mediterranean vineyards and trimming them mechanically when they reach a large size increases parasitoid abundance and the number of parasitoid species biological control potential compared to herbicides application cover cropping with deep rooting mycorrhizal plants and low disturbance management reduced no till can also foster sub soil amf communities with important implications for c sequestration and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions sosa hernández et al 2019 in addition green covers promote multiple ecosystem services in vineyards while addressing cc adaptation winter et al 2018 lazcano et al 2020 ruiz et al 2020 compared to conventional tillage ground vegetation management by cover cropping and the conservation of a native ground cover strongly promote biodiversity conservation winter et al 2018 paiola et al 2020 greater abundance of beneficial arthropods for potential natural pest control danne et al 2010 judt et al 2019 more complex soil microarthropod communities bordoni et al 2019 greater soc sequestration and soil fertility novara et al 2019 and a higher diversity and abundance of pollinators mainly wild bees wilson et al 2018 kratschmer et al 2019 under vine cover cropping using trifolium fragiferum has also proved to be a potentially useful tool for sustainable soil management in mediterranean conditions causing virtually no change in vine performance and competing well against the installation of undesired adventitious species besides the avoidance of mechanical tillage and herbicides use abad et al 2020 although cover crops may not be suitable for use in arid areas since they compete with vines for water especially in the summer months in rain fed vineyards and or with young vines marques et al 2020 some positive effects of permanent or off season cover crops have been shown in di vineyards for example in mature rdi merlot vineyards in california permanent cover crops resident vegetation oats or legumes and no till practices may be implemented with little immediate effect on grape productivity steenwerth et al 2013 in addition under irrigated semi arid mediterranean conditions cover crops enhance grapevine fine root growth higher root density both under the vines and in the inter row area compared to bare soil management ibañez et al 2013 linares torres et al 2018 the presence of the cover crop forces the vine root system mainly its thinner roots to seek water in increasingly deeper soil compartments tomaz et al 2017 cover crops extract water and nutrients from the soil and thus reduce the vegetative vigor of the vine and can also improve grape quality and the sensorial characteristics of the wines trigo córdoba et al 2015 ibañez et al 2013 thus cover crops can be a useful tool to control the excess vigor especially the strong spring vegetative growth pou et al 2011 of some invigorating varieties and rootstocks e g 140ru 1103 p in rdi vineyards in semi arid areas romero et al 2018 romero and garcía 2020 through competition for water in the vineyard however in low vigor vineyards and with low water volume di strategies in dry areas the combination of permanent resident vegetation with di treatments should be carefully considered as it can reduce yield without any benefits for grape quality lopes et al 2011 cataldo et al 2020 in this way cover crops can influence the chemical composition of soil and vines and compete for water and nutrients depending on the species vystavna et al 2020 in addition both sown and native cover crop species can act as potential reservoirs of black foot associated fungi and promote a negative plant soil feedback león et al 2021 this emphasizes the importance of of selecting the best suited cover crop species or mix of species for their use in viticulture for instance select cover crop species with deep root systems which have higher n use efficiencies better nitrate scavenging abilities and lower n leaching potential could help with cover crop resilience for example deeper delivery of c in the soil profile abdalla et al 2019 therefore depending on the characteristics of the vineyard the degree of competition for water between cover crops and vines can be managed by a increasing the mowing frequency b adjusting the di management c selecting less competitive species such as grasses oats barley rye rather than legumes and or d using temporary off season cover crops to avoid competition during spring and summer mowing the cover crop at budbreak can reduce competition between grapevines and cover crops in drier and warmer growing regions lazcano et al 2020 and after mowing the residues should be incorporated into the soil as green manure or left on the soil surface as a mulch even though this stops root exudation the role of roots in maintaining the soil structure during the dry season is still highly relevant as dead roots hold together and preserve microbially created macroaggregates lazcano et al 2020 besides a recent systematic analysis covering different countries climatic zones managements and crops reveals that by adopting cover crops we could decrease n leaching to ground water and increase soc sequestration without having significant effects on direct n2o emissions overall cover crops can mitigate net greenhouse gas balances by 2 06 2 10 mg co2 eq ha 1 year 1 abdalla et al 2019 for semi arid areas receiving limited rainfall a mixture of grasses and legumes fig 3c or a mixture containing a variety of fescues festuca spp has been recommended medrano et al 2015 mirás avalos and araujo 2021 in a recent study on the adaptation of vineyards to cc santos et al 2020 concluded that in all vineyards the soil should be covered by green vegetation spontaneous or cultivated herbaceous cover crops at least during the rainy season and by dead material as in the case of mediterranean viticulture or partial cover crops in areas with intermittent rainfall during the dry part of the season in conclusion the combination of cover cropping and di can be a valuable tool in mediterranean semi arid deficit irrigated vineyards and justify their widespread adoption but more research into their correct management and economic costs is necessary 6 5 agroforestry systems diversified farming systems such as agroforestry systems where trees are deliberately integrated with crops are complex agroecosystems better able to adapt to and resist the effects of cc altieri et al 2015 these land use systems that combine vines as a woody perennial crop and trees were traditionally used in countries of southern europe such as italy portugal spain greece and france lang et al 2019 they provide environmental benefits such as improved soil health biodiversity conservation c sequestration and efficient resource use and play an important role in a multifunctional and sustainable agricultural landscape providing ecological services by reduction of the wind erosion of soil and desertification zhang et al 2018 in agroforestry trees intercept a large fraction of the light available to the crops and there is competition for water and n between trees and crops thus appropriate management such as the choice of the species combination e g trees with a low water demand such as oaks olives or almonds the tree arrangement e g pruning and the distance between the crop rows and trees is important to minimize inter specific competition knowledge of the interaction between vines and trees is very scarce and much more research is necessary in mediterranean semi arid conditions but preliminary results suggest that an agri silvicultural system could be useful for the resource preserving production of high quality wine for instance in mixed cropping systems of grapevines v vinifera cvs riesling and sauvignon blanc with oak quercus petraea and poplar populus tremula x p alba the availability of n to grapevines was favorable and water relations were improved whereas the wine quality was similar to monoculture control the trees were able to reduce water and n losses without negative effects on wine quality lang et al 2019 agroforestry based vineyards in three viticultural areas in the southwest of france showed a decrease in maximal temperatures on the vines particularly on days with high evaporative demand and after 9 years the cultivation of trees alongside vines had not impacted the yield and vigor of the vines or the composition of the grapes bourgade et al 2020 the intercropping of vines with trees for instance syrah and grenache cultivated with pinus pinea fig 2e or cypress cupressus sempervirens pear pyrus communis and service tree sorbus domestica can modify the microclimate and potentially the grapevine responses to water stress through three mechanisms shading wind breaking and evapotranspiration grimaldi et al 2017 the microclimatic benefits can cause the grapes to ripen weeks later than in surrounding areas leading to higher quality wine and increased tolerance of vines to heat and frost and the trees harbor populations of beneficial insects agroforestry also sequesters large amounts of c from the atmosphere and is therefore a prime solution to counter the effects of cc 6 6 use of mutualistic plant microbe interactions arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi amf ecosystems services provided by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi amf include among others 1 increase grapevine growth and nutrition by a better access to soil nutrients 2 increase the tolerance to abiotic stresses such as water stress and protect against biotic stresses such as root diseases 3 produce glycoproteins and a dense hyphal network that increases soil volume explored soil structure and stability improves soil water retention save soil nutrients and reduce fertilizer requirement and 4 increase plant fruit quality for human health e g enhancing flavonols hydroxycinnamic acids and carotenoids in leaves and anthocyanins in berries trouvelot et al 2015 massa et al 2020 torres et al 2018a 2018b 2021a 2021b nowadays mutualistic plant microbe interactions offer a novel approach to enhance agricultural productivity also reducing environmental costs that are mainly due to the massive use of chemical fertilizers massa et al 2020 some vineyard agricultural practices and soil managements such as the use of herbaceous plants as cover crops reduced p and n fertilization and reduce irrigation volume e g rdi favor the presence of native arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi meanwhile others practices such as high p and n fertilization full irrigation use of soil pesticides and intense tillage reduce amf root colonization and diversity trouvelot et al 2015 schreiner 2020 today viticulturists are introducing commercially available microbial inoculants to the soil these inoculants include plant growth promoting bacteria and or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi although amf inoculants are commercially available and widely used as bioinoculants in plant nurseries and in field grown vineyards it is not yet clear whether this practice is beneficial for grapevine rootstocks and vineyard performance in the field the inconsistent effects among rootstocks and inocula indicate that the effectiveness of mycorrhizal inocula for enhancing plant growth is unpredictable holland et al 2018 and several factors such as rootstock edaphoclimatic characteristics and native living microbiota in vineyard soils should be taken into account before making the decision of inoculating the vineyard torres et al 2021a overall taking into account that native amf in a given zone are often reported to be more efective than the non native ones hence the importance of better knowing the structure of native amf communities also for possible applications for sustainable agricultural ecosystems massa et al 2020 nevertheless recent studies about the inoculation of amf in grapevines indicate some promising results 1 there are interactive effects between amf inoculation and irrigation amf inoculation in young vines improved the grapevine vegetative growth water status and photosynthetic activity especially when vines were subjected to reduced irrigation not at full irrigation torres et al 2021a 2 amf inoculation exerts a reinforcement on native mycorrhizal colonisation the inoculation with amf led to the increase of positive associations between vineyard soil living microbes and can be positive to strengthen beneficial microbial networks and consequently achieve better soil quality torres et al 2021b 3 mineral nutrient uptake genes were upregulated after inoculation with different inoculants f mosseae vs a fungal and bacterial consortium but the degree of upregulation differed between them suggesting a specific response to a specific inoculum balestrini et al 2017 several of the common upregulated genes were involved in nitrogen metabolism mainly in relation to nitrate suggesting that in grapevine these beneficial root associated microbes are particularly efficient in stimulating plant responses to nitrogen balestrini et al 2017 4 amf inoculation in cs and sangiovese cvs enhanced the production of volatile organic compounds vocs e g monoterpenes in roots and leaves that may participate in mycorrhizal plant symbiosis establishment and function and play a key role in the interaction of plants with the environment and are involved in defense mechanisms velásquez et al 2020b 2020a 7 combining di sustainable soil use and agroecology future prospects in mediterranean vineyards most potential adaptations to water scarcity under future cc have been evaluated individually and few combined adaptations under irrigated conditions have been reported naulleau et al 2021 recent results show the benefits of combining two or more adaptation strategies with regard to limiting the adverse effects of cc thus the implementation of effective combinations of these adaptations enables compromises to be reached between future water availability and grapevine performance and sustainability and provides better solutions for adapting to cc naulleau et al 2021 for instance the yield benefit loss prevention achieved by the use of a cultivar that is adapted to cc could be even greater when combined with an appropriate irrigation treatment naulleau et al 2021 similarly the application of compost increases the soil water storage capacity and berry quality and reduces irrigation needs compared to irrigation without compost cirigliano et al 2017 chrysargyris et al 2018 found that no tillage compensated for a lack of irrigation while minimal tillage allowed better rainfall infiltration the introduction of a cover crop as a living mulch combined with no till could be a powerful tool to enhance the sustainability of systems without compromising the crop yields montemurro et al 2020 while the combination of an organic mulch with no tillage seems to reduce direct water evaporation from the soil lópez urrea et al 2020 buesa et al 2021 besides the combination of pri and soil mulching as water saving strategies could increase the irrigation wue in arid and semiarid areas farah et al 2021 we hypothesize that the application of optimized water saving di strategies involving low water volumes such as rdi and pri combined with drought tolerant rootstock scion combinations and sustainable soil management practices such as composting mulching cover crops and reduced tillage can decrease irrigation needs optimize irrigation and improve wue in vineyards in semi arid regions fig 3 thus it has a great potential role in the adaptation to and mitigation of cc however the greatest and most durable benefits will likely result from the combination of these adaptation measures with more radical agroecological measures that will increase biodiversity and strengthen the resilience of farms and rural communities these include the diversification of agroecosystems in the form of polycultures agroforestry systems and crop livestock mixed systems the use of hedgerows and water conservation and harvesting and the general enhancement of agrobiodiversity heterogeneity and complexity fig 2f g altieri et al 2015 landscape simplification increases vineyard pest outbreaks and insecticide use while increasing landscape complexity reduces the likelihood of suffering pest outbreaks thus decreasing the costs associated with yield losses and insecticide applications paredes et al 2021 it has been also reported that increasing plant species diversity in agroecosystems at different spatiotemporal scales e g floral herbaceous cover crops semi natural field borders trees provides winter refuge for beneficial predators and parasitoids and reduces the impacts of crop pests and diseases as well as the dependence on synthetic plant protection products ratnadass et al 2021 scott clem and harmon threatt 2021 the progression towards sustainability requires changes and improvements in the management of vineyards with each step of improvement the inputs are gradually reduced while the water use efficiency rainfall irrigation resilience and sustainability in the vineyard increase fig 4 many of these agronomic and agroecological practices can be combined in mediterranean vineyards under more holistic approaches such as organic and biodynamic farming but more research is necessary the main objectives of these agroecological approaches are a to maintain improve the fertility of the soil b to produce healthy plants that can resist diseases and pests c to increase agrobiodiversity and d to produce food of the highest possible quality agroecological practices that reduce the dependence of cropping systems on synthetic inputs are numerous and diverse and the transition towards agroecological systems can be progressive or fast merot et al 2019 the transition towards organic farming is a good example of an advanced agroecological transition figs 4 and 5 the organic farming transition can be addressed in terms of sequences of input reduction for higher efficiency using precision viticulture implementation of soil conservation practices and input substitution from mineral to organic fertilizers and approved pesticides to achieve a redesigned organic farming system based on agroecological principles merot et al 2019 figs 4 and 5 vineyards are amongst the most intensive forms of agriculture with a high use of pesticides mainly herbicides and fungicides table 5 and often result in simplified landscapes increased soil erosion and soil and water pollution hence organic viticulture can bring multiple benefits especially related to the omission of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and their associated negative effects gunstone et al 2021 table 5 and the fostering of biological pest control services muneret et al 2019 and increased biodiversity table 4 organic vineyards are considered environmentally sound when best practices are followed and show several agronomic environmental and economic benefits at different levels compared to conventional integrated ones meissner et al 2019 but important challenges have to be addressed specially related to high fungicide inputs frequent sulfur and copper applications and their negative effects on arthropods and natural enemies reiff et al 2021 table 4 besides the time elapsed since conversion from intensive to organic farming may also be important with respect to improving soil properties and vine performance this is because soil quality develops in the long term towards a balanced steady state ecosystem as indicated by a rising soc concentration and microbial biomass and diversity and by changes in soil nutrient fluxes and pools katayama et al 2019 skinner et al 2019 for instance in the first 4 years after conversion to organic and biodynamic management the soil mineral nitrogen content and vegetative growth of grapevines were reduced significantly by the two biological treatments compared to integrated management resulting in a morphology that increased the grapes exposure to light and consequently reduced the susceptibility of the vines to acetic acid rot and botrytis cinerea infection meissner et al 2019 the european commission within the european green deal has defined the action plan for the development of organic production 2021 2027 with the objective of at least 25 of the eu s agricultural land being under organic farming by 2030 as a measure to contribute to ecosystem restoration emissions reduction and c sequestration services european commision 2021 for instance aguilera et al 2015 reported in fruit tree orchards in spain on average a 56 decrease of greenhouse gas emissions under organic versus conventional cropping on an area basis on a product basis greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 39 on average specifically in vineyards they reported a reduction in net global warming potential of 28 mainly due to avoided emissions from fertilizer production and increased carbon sequestration aguilera et al 2015 the application of water saving strategies rdi pri within organic farming systems has not been explored but could have environmental benefits e g greater resource use efficiency as well as enhancing berry polyphenolic and nutraceutical quality because both systems separately increase it however it could also have a great impact on productivity because both systems reduce yield tables 1 and 4 therefore there is a need to improve current organic practices to achieve higher yield and productivity at the farm level moving from a system with low inputs and low outputs to one with low external inputs and medium output rahmann et al 2016 there is still room for improvement by a scaling up best organic farming practices b adapting precision technologies and tools to organic farming and c blending mostly organic with certain more efficient and sustainable conventional practices rahmann et al 2016 ferrara and de feo 2018 besides other techniques to cope with drought and global warming such as the use of local and traditional genotypes new fungus resistant drought tolerant varieties adequate soil selection and preparation modifications in training systems and row orientation canopy management changes in plant density late winter pruning and minimal pruning leibar et al 2017 van leeuwen 2019a frioni et al 2020 santos et al 2020 gutierrez gamboa et al 2021 can also be useful in the short and long term to improve productivity and wue many of these may be integrated in more sustainable viticultural models in mediterranean areas the development of high water use efficiency rainfed systems in semiarid mediterranean areas where there is no access to water as occur in most low productive rainfed vineyards can be also crucial and an opportunity to recover local and traditional crop systems traditional cultivars less known varieties new drought tolerant and fungal resistant genotypes training systems prunings etc apply the best soil management practices e g mulching or cover crops trees to reduce soil erosion water losses increase soil water storage capacity and improve berry nutraceutical potential pérez álvarez et al 2021a besides recent analysis shows that low density 4 1 inter row x inter vine 2500 vines ha 1 trellised dry farmed vineyards can be also an economically sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to cultivate vines and produce high quality wines in increasingly warm and dry conditions under climate change compared to high density 2 1 inter row x inter vine 5000 vines ha 1 van leeuwen et al 2019b these low density vineyards will experience less water deficit under warmer and drier climate conditions although this difference is less pronounced in soils with less water holding capacity this solution is also economically viable particularly for vineyards producing lower value kg grapes and is perfectly adapted for mechanization van leeuwen et al 2019b the idea is to design agricultural systems e g vineyards resilient to cc and the effective diffusion of these agronomical technologies and agroecological practices will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to cc altieri et al 2015 bernardo et al 2018 more intense research into the combined use of these agronomic agroecological practices within more sustainable irrigated rainfed viticultural models looking for synergies in semi arid mediterranean vineyards is necessary declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

9841,in recent years livestock producers have widely sown tropical perennial grasses such as digit grass digitaria eriantha in the frost prone summer dominant rainfall zone of eastern australia tropical grasses require substantial nitrogen inputs to maintain water productivity and forage quality perennial legumes offer a potential nitrogen source for these perennial grasses when sown in a mixed sward lucerne medicago sativa is the perennial legume most widely sown in grazing systems in south eastern australia in this study conducted over the period 2014 2018 we compared the soil water dynamics and rainwater productivity of pure stands of digit grass fertilized with applied nitrogen lucerne desmanthus desmanthus virgatus and leucaena leucaena leucocephala and binary mixtures of digit grass not fertilized with applied nitrogen with each legume we found that often growing season actual evapotranspiration eta was similar among the treatments p 0 05 but rainwater productivity kg dm ha mm and proportion of legume herbage mass were not p 0 05 our results showed that the lucerne digit grass mix was equally productive and efficient as fertilized digit grass p 0 05 particularly in the latter three seasons however lucerne dominated the herbage mass c 67 legume leucaena production was delayed by frost and severely impacted by competition with digit grass and generally underperformed both lucerne and desmanthus this observation did always not hold when alfalfa mosaic virus amv impacted desmanthus in specific seasons our experiment has shown that a mixed sward of lucerne digit grass is highly productive and offered high rainwater productivity both desmanthus and leucaena in mixes with digit grass provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass in specific seasons and under specific conditions but both underperformed overall compared with lucerne keywords root depth water balance water use efficiency 1 introduction tropical perennial grass species such as digit grass digitaria eriantha can be highly productive and persistent and have become increasingly sown in areas that receive substantial winter rainfall moore et al 2014 or southern latitudes of australia e g mccormick et al 2009 maximizing rainwater productivity within pasture systems is a substantial challenge particularly in a summer dominant yet variable rainfall environment murphy et al 2019 tropical grasses quickly respond to water availability and forage quality improves with nitrogen n fertilizer application boschma et al 2017 however sole reliance on applied n fertilizer on a pure grass sward can be expensive and perhaps may limit the upper threshold of forage quality tropical perennial grass nutritive values of crude protein 13 19 metabolizable energy density 7 9 9 5 mj kg dm and digestibility 28 6 33 7 adf make them best suited to maintaining dry animals or moderate liveweight gains boschma et al 2017 companion legumes are one option that can offer both an n source to the grass and increase forage quality of the sward boschma and harris 2009 northern inland new south wales nsw presents a challenging environment for temperate annual legumes to germinate grow and set seed when growing within a sown summer active perennial grass sward boschma et al 2014 tropical grasses can utilize all plant available soil water over summer e g murphy et al 2019 however autumn is the season with the lowest rainfall resulting in low plant available soil water when temperate annual legumes germinate therefore with a variable break of the season e g lodge and johnson 2008 germination is unreliable further high spring temperatures often restrict temperate legume productivity and seed set thereby limiting the persistence of these legumes boschma et al 2011a lucerne medicago sativa is the most widely grown perennial legume in this region and has general acceptance as forage by growers notwithstanding the potential for causing bloat in cattle however the persistence of lucerne is a problem and production declines over time as the plant population diminishes lodge 1991 stand life for grazed lucerne can be as little as 5 years before renovation is required lodge 1991 however the potential of lucerne as a companion legume to digit grass was first illustrated by tow 1993 offering complementary soil water extraction and nitrogen cycling with the digit grass tow et al 1997b more recently evaluation of legumes that are potential companions with tropical perennial grasses in our environment identified a range of options both annual and perennial temperate and tropical worthy of field evaluation in mixtures li et al 2008 boschma and harris 2009 desmanthus desmanthus virgatus and leucaena leucaena leucocephala were two perennial tropical legumes that demonstrated high persistence and reasonable production boschma and harris 2009 harris et al 2019 both desmanthus e g clem and hall 1994 hall and walker 2005 rangel and gomide 2005 and leucaena e g radrizzani et al 2016 have demonstrated their suitability to livestock systems in tropical australia however they have yet to be evaluated directly with lucerne in a summer dominant yet variable rainfall environment in more temperate regions in a field experiment conducted at tamworth nsw australia we compared the performance of digit grass lucerne desmanthus and leucaena when grown as both pure swards and in binary mixtures of digit grass with each of the legumes the overall objective was to determine whether any of the legume grass mixtures can match the herbage production of pure digit grass pasture fertilized with applied n we used data sets of soil water dynamics water extraction rooting depth herbage production and rainwater productivity over four years 2014 2018 to evaluate two hypotheses 1 pure swards of desmanthus and leucaena would contribute herbage growth equal with lucerne and 2 the complementary evapotranspiration patterns of the tropical legumes and digit grass in mixed swards would enhance rainwater productivity compared with a lucerne digit grass sward 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment located at tamworth agricultural institute 31 08 44 s 150 58 04 e 400 m above sea level was on a brown vertosol isbell 2002 the annual average rainfall at tamworth is 674 mm with 60 falling during the warm season between october march an automatic weather station located at the site recorded rainfall 0 5 mm pluviometer at 30 min intervals we removed the existing pasture in november 2012 glyphosate 450 g l a i applied at 1 5 l ha and maintained fallow over summer 2012 13 before sowing a cover crop of oat avena fatua in autumn 2013 in late winter 2013 before the cover crop reached maturity we terminated it with glyphosate 1 5 l ha the site was fallow over summer 2013 14 and through winter 2014 to accumulate stored soil water and mineralize nitrogen in september 2014 cultivation prepared the seedbed before sowing the experimental treatments in november 2014 2 2 experimental design and establishment the experiment was a row column design with 9 treatments each plot 6 9 m and three replicates with plots arranged in 6 rows 5 columns each replicate comprised 2 rows 5 columns the tenth plot in each replicate was sown to digit grass as a fill area and was not examined the 9 treatments table 1 included digit grass cv premier desmanthus cv marc leucaena cv tarramba and lucerne cv venus that were sown as pure swards of each species and then as binary mixes of digit grass with each legume the leucaena treatments which represent an alley system of twin hedgerows of leucaena separated by an alley of grass were allocated to row 2 of each replicate group the final two treatments were digit grass sown in the alley between rows of leucaena digit grass desmanthus and lucerne treatments were sown on 19 november 2014 into a prepared seedbed at 0 17 m row spacing using a cone seeder with press wheels sowing rates adjusted for viable seed percentage were chosen to achieve plant densities consistent with commercial practice harris et al 2014 pure swards of digit grass desmanthus and lucerne were sown at 2 4 and 2 kg ha of viable seed respectively table 1 the mixtures were sown in alternate rows resulting in seeding rates per hectare that were half that of the pure swards of each species lucerne and desmanthus seeds were inoculated with commercial rhizobia and kept cool before sowing to establish leucaena we ripped twin rows 0 5 m deep 1 0 m apart and 9 0 m in length along the centre axis of the plot the ripped lines were pre irrigated using inverted soaker hoses to ensure high soil water content at planting on 21 november 2014 we planted 9 week old leucaena seedlings at 0 5 m intervals giving a total plant density of 3333 trees ha the soil surface of leucaeana le plots was covered with sugar cane mulch at 1500 kg dm ha for the duration of the experiment to prevent soil erosion these plots were maintained as weed and digit grass free for 2 5 m on either side of the leucaena rows with an annual application in october december of imazethapyr 700 g kg a i at 140 g ha for the mixture with digit grass le di the twin rows were perpendicular to the grass sowing rows which were sown to within 1 0 m from the leucaena rows to prevent digit grass seedlings from encroaching on the leucaena rows in the mixture le di in the first 12 months after planting we applied imazethapyr 700 g kg a i at 140 g ha in december 2014 2 2 1 treatment management herbicides were applied throughout the experiment to control annual broadleaf and grass weed seedlings in pure digit grass plots di mcpa 500 g l a i at 1 l ha dicamba 500 g l a i at 400 ml ha and metsulfuron methyl 600 g kg a i at 2 g ha were applied as required to control broadleaf weeds in pure plots of desmanthus de imazethapyr 700 g kg a i at 70 g ha was applied in winter and or spring as needed as a pre emergent herbicide lucerne lu received applications of flumetsulam 800 g kg a i at 25 g ha 2 4 db amine 500 g l a i at 1 5 l ha or fluazifop p 212 g l a i at 500 ml ha as required to control seedlings of grass and broad leaf weeds digit grass lucerne plots lu di received applications of flumetsulam 800 g kg a i at 25 g ha and 2 4 db amine 500 g l a i at 1 5 l ha to control seedlings of grass and broadleaf weeds the entire experiment received 200 kg ha single superphosphate 8 8 phosphorus 11 sulphur applied in spring each year from 2014 to 2018 additionally the pure digit grass treatment di received 110 kg ha urea 46 n applied in both spring and summer total of 220 kg ha timed to occur with rainfall to minimize volatilization digit grass in mixtures or in the alley between leucaena rows le ir le di ir were not fertilised with n in the establishment year 2014 15 treatments of digit grass and desmanthus set seed at the final herbage assessment each growing season usually in may desmanthus was left ungrazed to allow seed set at the beginning of the next growing season usually in september treatment plots were mown to remove residual frosted material and the leucaena plants trimmed to 0 3 m height except for 2016 when the plants remained green throughout the uncommonly mild winter 2 3 installation of neutron probe access tubes and soil profile description we measured soil water content with a neutron moisture meter nmm cpn503 dr hydroprobe boart longyear co martinez ca at the centre of each plot we installed an aluminium access tube 49 mm extern diam sealed at the bottom to 1 9 m depth first we extracted a soil core 51 mm extern diam with a hydraulic push coring machine we used 1 l of a clay slurry 1 kg bentonite 1 l water to fill any voids and ensure good contact between the soil and the access tube murphy et al 2017 a cap was placed over the top of the access tube to prevent rainwater from entering the retained soil cores were analysed for soil characteristics and to calibrate the nmm using methods described in murphy et al 2017 gravimetric soil water content g g of the soil cores was determined for segments that aligned with neutron probe sample depths i e 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 then 0 2 m intervals to 1 9 m for each core segment we determined soil bulk density mg m3 using the soil dry weight and volume of the core segment we determined soil ph cacl2 electrical conductivity ec1 5 ds m and soil particle size distribution at each depth on three air dried soil cores the soil profile was non saline ec1 5 0 65 ds m and had a trend of increasing alkalinity with depth ph cacl2 8 2 at the soil surface to ph cacl2 8 8 9 1 in the lower profile at 0 9 1 9 m table 2 the proportion of soil particles of different sizes sand 20 2000 µm silt 2 20 µm clay 2 µm gravel 2000 µm for each layer were determined using the laser diffraction method malvern mastersizer 2000 the proportion of clay was higher than for either sand or silt for all sampling layers table 2 clay content was 39 for sampling layers below 0 3 m depth while silt content was high at both the surface 38 3 and in the deepest sampling layer 38 but decreased in the middle profile 32 35 soil texture at the surface 0 0 1 m was silty clay loam and trended to silty clay at depths 0 1 m the soil physical data were used in pedotransfer functions mckenzie and cresswell 2002 to predict soil water content values for the drained upper limit c 10 kpa and crop lower limit c 1500 kpa for each soil layer the profile stored soil water at the drained upper limit and crop lower limit were 817 1 1 and 439 0 1 mm respectively indicating a potential plant available water content pawc mm of 378 1 0 mm 2 3 1 neutron moisture meter calibration to calibrate the neutron moisture meter we determined the relationship between neutron count and values of volumetric soil water content swc θvol m3 m3 we included data points from the time we installed access tubes and at other times when swc was high near the drained upper limit and low near the crop lower limit giving a full range of values n 140 lodge et al 2010 for each soil sampling layer values of volumetric swc θvol and neutron count were plotted and logarithmic regression y 131 559 ln x 26 398 best explained the relationship between swc x and neutron count y r2 0 87 n 140 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 soil water content at approximately 21 day intervals we used counts from the neutron moisture meter to determine soil water content swc this sampling interval over the period from 20 november 2014 9 may 2018 gave 52 sample dates at the midpoint of each 0 2 m soil layer from 0 1 to 0 3 m to a maximum depth of 1 9 m 16 s counts were taken values of volumetric swc for each layer were converted to stored soil water ssw mm and summed to obtain values for the upper 0 1 0 7 m middle 0 7 1 3 m lower 1 3 1 9 m and the total profile 0 1 1 9 m 2 4 2 herbage production herbage production kg dm ha was estimated on 22 occasions at approximately 6 week intervals during the pasture growing season september may over 4 years the first assessment in early spring was primarily a measure of lucerne growth as it was the only treatment that grew through winter annual herbage production was determined by accumulating values from 1 july 30 june for each of 4 growing years green herbage mass was estimated by 2 observers who randomly placed 4 quadrats 0 4 0 4 m along separate transects that ran along the long axis of each plot a total of 8 quadrats per plot the observers assessed each quadrat for total herbage production to a height of 0 1 m using a continuous 0 5 scale 0 nil 5 high and the percentage of sown legume and grass estimated on a dry weight basis at each sampling time 20 calibration quadrats 0 4 m 0 4 m selected to cover the range of herbage mass and proportion of legume at the site were also assessed and harvested to 0 1 m above ground level the herbage was sorted into sown legume sown grass and other all voluntary species each portion was dried at 80 c for 48 h before weighing scores and percentage estimates for these calibration quadrats were regressed linear or quadratic r 2 0 75 n 20 against actual herbage mass kg dm ha and percentage of legume and grass to determine the herbage mass of each component in each treatment plot recording the physical dimensions of the leucaena shrubs and using a standard visual technique e g murphy et al 2017 provided growth and herbage production data for leucaena firstly we measured the overall width m and height m of the leucaena twin rows at 4 points along the hedge rows secondly we harvested a typical cane e g length and amount of edible leaf and stem from one leucaena plant in each plot to use as a visual standard using this standard we counted the number of similar canes on each of 4 randomly selected plants in each row total of 8 plants plot the edible material from the typical cane leaf and stem 10 mm diameter was then removed dried at 80 c for 48 h and weighed to determine the edible herbage mass for the plot kg dm ha we multiplied the value from the reference cane by the mean count of canes per plant and the total number of plants per hectare 3333 ha after each assessment a mob of sheep was used to crash graze the plots to a residual height of about 0 1 m a flail or rotary mower equipped with a catcher removed any residual stem 0 1 m in height fences around the leucaena plots were used to control sheep access and prevent overgrazing of leucaena plants after grazing any long stems that were beyond the reach of sheep were cut back to a height of 1 2 m 2 4 3 plant persistence near the start and end of each growing year c november and may we assessed plant frequency brown 1954 of digit grass lucerne and desmanthus the number of cells 0 1 0 1 m containing a live plant of either digit grass or legume were counted in two fixed quadrats 1 0 1 0 m total 100 cells in each plot about 7 days after grazing and the proportion of occurrence determined leucaena plants in each row were counted to record any losses 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 soil water content and maximum extractable water swc data for each treatment were plotted for each measurement layer and sampling time periods of 3 months or more during each growing season september may when swc declined without interruption by complete profile rewetting i e significant rainfall events were identified these periods demonstrated the capacity of the treatments to extract soil water murphy and lodge 2006 the difference between the values of ssw for each measurement layer and treatment at the start and end date of each period was calculated as the maximum extractable water mew mm neal et al 2012 values of mew for each measurement layer were summed to values for the upper 0 1 0 7 m middle 0 7 1 3 m lower 1 3 1 9 m and full 0 1 1 9 m soil profile layers analysis of variance was used to model values of mew for each soil profile layer against the factors treatment year and their interaction the model accounted for replicate effects within each year by including the interaction of year x replicate as a block term a 5 level of significance determined the least significant difference lsd 2 5 2 plant root depth we identified plant root depth from changes in soil water content between the dates used to determine mew murphy and lodge 2006 on each date the trend in swc over depth among the three replicate values was modelled using a linear mixed model the model included depth as a covariate and a fixed term to model the linear trend over depth and a spline term as a random effect to model a smooth curvilinear trend verbyla et al 1999 terms to account for differences between the replicates were included as random effects in the model predicted values of swc with depth s e of prediction were plotted for each treatment and plant root depth identified as the maximum depth where the errors did not intersect murphy and lodge 2006 murphy et al 2019 2 5 3 rainfall refill efficiency soil moisture accumulation or refill mm occurred when digit grass desmanthus and leucaena were frosted and not growing typically may to september we identified periods when swc changed from lowest to highest then we calculated soil water refill swr mm for each soil profile layer i e upper 0 1 0 7 m middle 0 7 1 3 m lower 1 3 1 9 m and full 0 1 1 9 m the rainfall refill efficiency was calculated by dividing swr by total rainfall during the period analysis of variance determined significant differences among start and end stored soil water swr in each soil profile layer and rainfall refill efficiency a 5 level of significance determined the least significant difference lsd 2 5 4 plant production the trend in herbage production kg dm ha and legume percentage was modelled using a linear mixed model for each treatment the model included sample date as a covariate and a fixed term to model the linear trend over time and a spline term as a random effect to model smooth curvilinear trend predicted values of herbage production were accumulated for each growing year 1 july 30 june analysis of variance was used to model values of accumulated plant dry matter against the factors of treatment year and their interaction the lsd was calculated using a 5 level of significance the model accounted for replicate effects within each year by including the interaction of year x replicate as a block term 2 5 5 plant persistence trend in plant frequency was modelled using a linear mixed model for each plant density the model included sample date as a covariate and a fixed term to model the linear trend over time and a spline term as a random effect to model smooth curvilinear trend predicted values of plant frequency with time s e of prediction were plotted to determine changes for each treatment 2 5 6 rainwater productivity for each 6 week interval during the growing year rainwater productivity kg dm ha mm was calculated by dividing herbage production kg dm ha by actual evapotranspiration eta mm actual evapotranspiration was determined by soil water balance under the assumption that no water was lost by runoff or deep drainage using the equation et a p δs r o d d where p is precipitation δs is change in stored soil water r o is runoff and d d is deep drainage all measured in mm rainwater productivity of dry matter production for each treatment was calculated for each growing year and total dry matter production over 3 years significant differences were determined by analysis of variance and lsd calculated using a 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 soil water dynamics seasonal rainfall at the site demonstrated distinct periods of above and below average totals fig 1 totals were well above average for a 6 month period when the experiment commenced e g summer 2014 15 and autumn 2015 fig 1 in the following 2 years seasonal rainfall totals from winter 2015 to autumn 2016 were below average from winter 2016 to autumn 2017 rainfall was well above average and total rainfall for the 12 months to end of may 2017 was 940 mm equating to the 94th percentile the final year of the experiment was exceedingly dry fig 1 and total rainfall for the 12 months to end of may 2018 was 337 mm equating to the 3rd percentile it is essential to recognize the fluctuation in seasonal rainfall to explore the subsequent dynamics of soil water extraction and profile refill the heat maps of soil water content provide a visual representation of soil water dynamics though time and depth fig 2 they clearly illustrate that these summer active pasture species had a repeating pattern of drying the soil profile in summer and soil profile wetting in winter when they were largely inactive fig 2 soil water contents were lowest in the autumn and highest in the spring closer examination revealed differences among the treatments in both the depth and intensity of soil profile drying and soil profile wetting from establishment in spring 2014 and then through summer the treatments de de di and le di had greater intensity of soil drying than the other treatments fig 2c e and f in 2015 16 all treatments resulted in a distinct increase in soil dryness which coincided with below average rainfall fig 1 the treatments that achieved the greatest depth and intensity of soil dryness were di lu lu di and le di ir fig 2 digit grass fig 2a vigorously dried the soil to 1 2 m depth at the same time leucaena le contrasted as having less intense drying fig 2b lucerne fig 2d and lu di fig 2g extracted little stored soil water in 2014 15 due to the slow growth at the start of these treatments however in later years lu showed intense drying for a longer period september may compared with de or de di the patterns of soil water content of digit grass sown in the leucaena inter row le ir or le di ir fig 2h and i were like that of pure digit di fig 2a until autumn 2016 after that however these treatments had

similar amounts of soil water p 0 05 table 3 with the 2017 mean value 224 mm table 3 being highest of all years after a closer examination of the data we found that the residuals were large for a single treatment plot in one replication of different treatments in 2016 and 2017 these large residuals resulted in non significant differences between the treatments mean mew was lowest in 2018 while lu extracted the least p 0 05 table 3 soil water extraction and subsequent root depth for 2017 and 2018 are illustrated graphically in fig 3 plant root depth varied considerably between treatments and between years all treatments achieved their maximum root depth in either 2015 1 68 1 80 m or 2016 1 56 1 80 m and expressed their minimum root depth in 2018 0 20 1 08 m table 3 five treatments de lu

rainfall refill coefficient were different p 0 05 among the treatments for 2015 and 2017 but not 2016 table 4 the mean soil profile refill largely reflected the amount of rainfall received when pastures were inactive profile refill in 2016 254 mm was more than double that of 2015 100 mm and 6 times that of 2017 41 mm table 4 while the mean rainfall refill coefficients in 2015 and 2016 were similar 59 v 62 and three times greater than in 2017 15 table 4 values among treatments were significantly different p 0 05 only in 2015 in 2015 lu and lu di treatments 22 and 33 mm captured less p 0 05 winter rainfall than the other treatments while de 167 mm captured more than le ir 87 mm table 4 at the start of winter in 2015 these lucerne treatments had wetter soil profiles fig 2 which resulted in little available storage capacity to capture rainfall in 2017 lu and lu di captured significantly less of the below average winter rainfall than most other treatments table 4 resulting in significantly lower rainfall refill coefficients table 4 in the latter year low groundcover in the lu and lu di together with below average rainfall suppressed rainfall capture 3 2 plant production 3

ranging 10 6 19 1 kg dm ha mm table 5 as a pure grass sward di generally had greater p 0 05 grass herbage mass compared with the grass component in each of the legume mixtures de di lu di and le di 3928 12 325 kg dm ha table 5 however grass herbage mass in 2016 for le di 10 424 kg dm ha was like that of di 13 286 kg dm ha table 5 grass herbage mass for le ir 8283 12 325 kg dm ha le di ir 9732 10 825 kg dm ha and di 10 819 13 286 kg dm ha were all similar p 0 05 in the early stage of the experiment in the 2015 and 2016 seasons but as the experiment progressed the interrow treatments produced less grass p 0 05 than di table 5 legume herbage mass differed p 0 05 among the treatments each year but the best performing legume also varied each year in 2015 de 14 370 kg dm ha table 5 had the greatest p 0 05 legume herbage mass in 2016 legume herbage masses for de lu and lu di were similar p 0 05 8185 10 669 kg dm ha but greater than le 4731 kg dm ha and the lowest was le di 1355 kg dm ha table 5 in 2017 legume herbage mass for lu 16 913 kg dm ha was greatest p 0 05 while de di and le di 2547 and 2638 kg dm ha respectively were lowest p 0 05 leucaena as a pure stand le produced more p 0 05 legume herbage mass 4512 10 326 kg dm ha than its mixture with digit grass le di 1355 2638 kg dm ha in all years table 5 the changes in legume production influenced the proportion of legume in total herbage mass within treatments and between years the proportion of leucaena in le di increased each year of the experiment from 12 to 42 mean 26 in contrast the proportion of desmanthus in de di decreased each year from 71 to 23 mean 41 the proportion of lucerne in lu di fluctuated ranging 59 75 with a higher mean level of 67 3 2 2 leucaena hedgerow dimensions at every sample date the leucaena hedgerows in the le treatment were taller range 0 1 0 61 m mean 0 32 m and wider range 0 23 0 74 m mean 0 49 m than those in the le di treatment fig 4a b these differences reflected the variation in treatment legume herbage mass as described above 3 2 3 plant frequency digit grass in the pure sward di le di and le di ir generated the highest values of grass plant frequency and they steadily increased as the experiment progressed increasing from 57 to 73 84 86 fig 5a the frequencies of digit grass in the mixtures with desmanthus de di and lucerne lu di were initially half de di or less than a third lu di of the pure digit sward reflecting differences in sowing rates and competition among seedlings however during the experiment the grass plant frequency in these treatments doubled de di from 38 to 76 lu di from 22 to a high of 51 despite the increase in grass frequency in lu di it remained significantly lower than all other treatments fig 5a frequency of legume in the mixed swards was generally less than in the pure swards the frequency of desmanthus in its mixture de di 31 13 was always significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the pure sward de which was relatively stable declining from 45 to 41 fig 5b the frequency of lucerne in its mixture lu di 32 49 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the pure sward lu 44 66 for most of the experiment however frequency in both lucerne treatments declined to a similar level of 20 25 in the latter part of the experiment fig 5b 3 3 actual evapotranspiration and rainwater productivity actual evapotranspiration among the treatments in the growing years from 2015 to 2017 despite some considerable variation in values was largely similar p 0 05 table 5 mean values of eta varied by 100 mm from year to year 751 644 and 856 mm for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2018 however lu had lower eta p 0 05 than all other treatments 316c 346 384 mm table 5 rainwater productivity among the treatments differed in all years p 0 05 table 5 in 2015 treatments containing lucerne or leucaena 3 8 7 9 kg dm ha mm were less efficient than all other treatments 11 4 17 9 kg dm ha mm table 5 in 2016 le and de di 7 3 and 11 5 kg dm ha mm respectively were less efficient than di le ir or le di 19 1 19 8 kg dm ha mm in 2017 lu di and lu 17 8 and 19 1 kg dm ha mm respectively were the most efficient treatments among the other treatments di and le di 14 1 and 13 7 kg dm ha mm were more efficient than de and le di ir 9 7 and 9 4 kg dm ha mm in 2018 the leucaena inter rows and de di 6 6 8 5 kg dm ha mm were less efficient than most of the other treatments but de di was similarly efficient to di 8 5 and 10 6 kg dm ha mm respectively 4 discussion tropical grasses are highly responsive to plant nutrition especially applied n boschma et al 2015 the di treatment in our experiment fertilized with 100 kg n ha year resulted in 10 t dm ha year and rainwater productivity of 14 6 kg dm ha mm over the 4 years of the study on average digit grass total evapotranspiration was 666 mm it extracted 174 mm of soil water and its root depth was 1 30 m these characteristics demonstrated efficient rainwater productivity however tropical grass pastures are prone to n rundown and a decline in productivity through time myers and robbins 1991 peck et al 2011 the rainwater productivity for all treatments dominated by di declined markedly from 2016 to 2018 di 19 1 10 6 le ir 19 5 7 2 le di ir 14 7 6 6 kg dm ha mm applied n fertilizer alleviated those declines but without the influence of legume the declines were substantial e g the alley zones well away from the leucaena the decline in rainwater productivity for lu di was less severe 16 2 12 3 kg dm ha mm lucerne has an extensive track record as a quality pasture legume and is a benchmark for perennial legume production in this environment boschma et al 2011b murphy et al 2014 the primary objective of our study was to determine whether either of the novel tropical legumes desmanthus or leucaena can match the production of lucerne the secondary objectives were to assess if legume grass mixtures using these tropical legumes can match production of the lucerne grass mixture and whether any of the legume grass mixtures can match the productivity of pure tropical grass pasture fertilized with n 4 1 desmanthus and leucaena do not match production by lucerne in this environment lucerne was the standout performer among the legumes as expected in this environment boschma et al 2011a however lucerne dominated digit grass in the mixture yielding 67 of overall herbage mass in grazed pastures the proportion of legume that optimizes n transfer to the grasses maybe as low as 30 louarn et al 2016 in our study lucerne initially underperformed but it excelled in the second and third years this slow start to above ground production is common as lucerne plants in the first year establish crown reserves brown et al 2006 however in subsequent years the now established plants commenced active growth up to 6 weeks before the digit grass thereby lucerne capitalized on first use of stored soil water and so dominated herbage production given that lucerne based treatments had the lowest rainfall refill efficiency levels brought about by a relatively short period of inactivity during winter and lower groundcover the first use of stored soil water is particularly important the consequence of this low refill is lucerne s increased reliance on growing season rainfall to sustain growth this low level of profile refill contrasts to more temperate locations with a strongly winter dominant rainfall pattern that enables refill of stored soil water e g mccaskill et al 2016 in all years lucerne growing in the mixture with digit lu di yielded 50 of the herbage mass of the pure lucerne treatment demonstrating overyielding the overyielding of lucerne occurred at the expense of digit grass which yielded approximately 25 of the fertilized grass treatment elsewhere in the region however digit lucerne mixes fertilized with additional n outyielded fertilized monocultures of either digit or lucerne by up to 70 due to the complementary growth patterns and efficiencies in nitrogen use tow et al 1997a in our experiment we speculate that lucerne over yielded in the mixture because our stand density was initially very high lucerne plant frequency was variable year to year but in both pure swards and its mixture with digit grass it declined over the 4 years maintaining lucerne is an ongoing challenge whether in a pure pasture lodge 1991 or mixed sward li et al 2008 grazing management sympathetic to lucerne s requirements for storage of root carbohydrate reserves can extend stand life teixeira et al 2007 however in this environment a combination of insect damage disease and water logging leads to eventual failure of the stand lodge 1991 desmanthus in our experiment started particularly strong and the level of production despite frosting in winter demonstrated its suitability to this environment overall desmanthus de produced more herbage mass than all treatments except digit grass di but a large proportion of this mass grew in the first growing season 2015 14 t dm ha after that alfalfa mosaic virus amv infection severely curtailed production the decline in productivity was most noticeable in the mixture de di with steep declines in both the plant frequency and the proportion of legume the unexpected infection of desmanthus with amv was a first for this species in australia van leur et al 2019 desmanthus with amv infection showed a subdued yield response in 2017 compared with that of both le and lu the impact of amv on existing plants was seen most clearly in the mixture where seedlings did not recruit the plant frequency declined total herbage mass declined rainwater productivity declined and within the run of seasons there was no opportunity for successful recruitment of seedlings we observed some recruitment of seedlings in de plots but not among the de di mixture ordinarily desmanthus cv marc is a prolific seeder and readily recruits seedlings where it was reported as both productive and persistent boschma et al 2021 the impact of amv on the treatment was disappointing however the disease demonstrated the risks of exposing a species grown outside of its main area of adaptation to different pests and diseases we were not able to quantify the degree that infection with amv diminished production leucaena contributed significantly less legume herbage mass in all years compared with lucerne apart from the final dry year when all yields were low in mixtures competition from digit grass negatively impacted leucaena yield best management practice in more tropical environments recommends establishing the grass after the leucaena rather than in the same year pachas et al 2019 leucaena seedlings are slow to establish and respond poorly to competition dalzell et al 2006 however local experience indicated that establishing the mixed pasture over 2 years is not suitable in this environment harris et al 2019 therefore in establishing le di we attempted to minimize grass competition on the leucaena by maintaining a bare buffer of 1 0 m adjacent to the leucaena twin hedgerows the smaller dimensions of the leucaena hedgerows in le di compared with le at the end of the establishment year demonstrated that this buffer was inadequate to alleviate competition by the grass this suggests that if both leucaena and digit grass are simultaneously established then a wider grass free buffer is required e g a minimum of 3 m the grass could set seed in the first year and then encroach on leucaena without ill effect leucaena was subject to frost damage and totally frosted in three of the four years of our experiment in these years leucaena plants recommenced growth as fresh buds from the plant crown in early october rainfall in the winter and spring of 2016 was above average fig 1 resulting in warmer overnight temperatures and mild frost leucaena plants did not succumb to frost in that winter and so enabled it to grow strongly from spring and accumulate its maximum annual yields of 10 3 t and 2 6 t dm ha in le and le di respectively this contrasted with the other years where first grazing was delayed until december or january the delay in growth and grazing to late in the summer growing season needs to be considered within the structure of a productive livestock enterprise in 2018 a hotter and drier year leucaena demonstrated its ability to continue production under testing growing conditions in such challenging growing conditions the two leucaena based treatments le and le di were the most productive closer examination of the swc data showed that le and le di had higher levels of stored soil water remaining at the end of the 2018 growing season for example le 575 mm total stored soil water had 100 mm additional stored soil water remaining compared with di or lu di 473 and 474 mm total stored soil water respectively leucaena s canopy structure is suspected of facilitating rainwater harvesting channeling rainwater down its stems to the base of the plant resulting in higher stored soil water pers comm s dalzell our soil water content data may support that hypothesis alternatively we speculate that the impact of frost damage may delay the leucaena growing season to such an extent that it is not able to grow enough leaf area within the growing season to utilize the soil water resource leucaena s soil water extraction patterns require further investigation in this type of environment 4 2 can a legume grass mixture match fertilized digit grass a legume grass mixture that is as productive and water efficient as fertilized pure digit grass is highly desirable negating the need for annual n fertilizer applications and could potentially deliver a higher quality forage base digit grass 40 2 t dm ha had the highest total production measured over the 4 growing years however in the 2015 growing year being the establishment year 6 weekly growth was not assessed in all treatments e g leucaena and desmanthus therefore a fairer comparison of total and annual production can be made in the 2016 2018 growing seasons for this latter period total production from lu di 31 3 t dm ha exceeded that of di 29 4 t dm ha but lucerne remained the dominant component accounting for up to 75 of the herbage mass in specific seasons table 5 total production for le di was 27 9 t dm ha and annual production was not different to that of digit grass in each of these three years but legume was the minor component accounting for 42 of the herbage mass table 5 total production from de di was 19 4 t dm ha but annual production declined year on year and by 2018 the proportion of legume declined to a low of 23 table 5 therefore we consider that the lu di mixture appeared the most desirable of these legume grass mixtures in our environment the annual yield of legume in a legume grass mixture is an essential indicator of both potential grass yield and livestock production e g louarn et al 2016 waldron et al 2020 in this case digit grass requires nitrogen fixed by the legume while the legume increases overall forage quality e g bork et al 2017 digit grass is highly responsive to nitrogen applied at 50 100 kg n ha boschma et al 2015 a conservative estimate for nitrogen fixed by a legume based pasture is 20 25 kg n per tonne of legume shoot dm peoples and baldock 2001 therefore to maintain digit grass growth rates in these mixtures we estimate that annual legume production needs to be in the range of 2 5 4 t dm ha per year the only legume in our mixtures to consistently achieve this level was lucerne desmanthus in de di did so in the first year 9 8 t dm ha but after that declined while leucaena s maximum yield in the le di mixture was 2 6 t dm ha however annual legume production from the le treatment without the direct competition from digit grass was 6 5 t dm ha which demonstrated leucaena s potential in this environment 4 3 complementary evapotranspiration patterns did not always support greater rainwater productivity total evapotranspiration by the treatments only differed in the 2018 growing season when the onset of drought conditions impacted water availability therefore any differences in rainwater productivity were in the main due to significant differences in yield of herbage mass within each growing season for example le and le di in 2016 and de and de di in 2018 we found that yield and rainwater productivity of the mixtures only rarely underperformed that of the pure legume or digit grass and we suggest this as evidence of a high degree of complementarity between the tropical grass and these summer active legumes the few occasions when the mixtures underperformed were associated with either in the establishment year e g lucerne leucaena or the impact of disease e g desmanthus within each year the range in evapotranspiration values among treatments was considerable e g 2015 137 mm 2016 99 mm 2017 77 mm and we were surprised that these differences were not significant in other studies the least significant differences in total evapotranspiration among treatments were as little as 21 mm murphy et al 2019 however for our experiment we found large residuals associated with specific replicates of some treatments were the reason for the lack of significant differences differences in stored soil water among the replicates resulted in large error terms and lack of significance the dynamics of competition for soil water resources between the legume and grass in the mixtures is likely to determine the longer term survival of the legume grass mixture lucerne is highly competitive as a seedling boschma et al 2010 and as a mature plant mainly because it begins its growth earlier in the season than the tropical grass murphy et al 2019 lucerne is an early and aggressive water user and is generally assumed to have a deep root system e g dunin et al 2001 this earlier access to the soil water resource enables lucerne to dominate soil water extraction and so production compounding this effect are the reduced window to refill the soil profile resulting in a lesser amount of soil water available to the grass 4 4 roots and competition for stored soil water tropical grasses have an extensive fibrous root system with large root density in the upper 1 5 m of the soil profile e g pachas et al 2018b murphy et al 2019 which enables a high level of utilization of stored soil water lucerne and leucaena have root systems dominated by vertical tap roots e g sim et al 2017 allowing extraction of soil water to greater depth interaction between roots of leucaena and rhodes grass chloris gayana in southern queensland indicated that the grass roots had a much higher root density than leucaena pachas et al 2018b the likely below ground interaction of roots between the species here appears to have translated into above ground impacts on herbage production as similarly reported by pachas et al 2018a the competition by digit grass hampered leucaena production in the mixture resulting in hedgerows that were less tall and less wide leucaena total herbage mass in le di was typically just 25 of that in le further exacerbating the underperformance compared with lucerne based treatments we infer that competition from digit grass growing too close to the leucaena plants during the establishment year has severely limited leucaena production thus confirming similar findings from queensland for desmanthus its rooting depth and structure are not known from physical sampling however our soil water extraction data suggested desmanthus treatments in the first growing season aggressively extracted stored soil water 191 mm table 3 and to a great depth 1 80 m table 3 the evapotranspiration and herbage yield data indicate that desmanthus was negatively impacted after infection by amv and that has made it difficult to critically evaluate its performance against the hypothesis of complementary evapotranspiration patterns the issue of amv infection in desmanthus needs resolving for its potential as a productive legume pasture in a lucerne growing area to be realized the final year of the experiment was exceedingly dry plant root depth herbage mass total evapotranspiration and rainwater productivity were all substantially lower than in previous years the exception to this was the performance of le and le di in those treatments leucaena plants remained green and actively grew throughout the season we hypothesize that leucaena was able to continue growing because it had higher soil water content e g fig 2 and presence of plant roots at 2 0 m depth once more the findings from our experiment suggest that lucerne as a legume in a mixture with digit grass is highly suited to this environment e g tow 1993 both desmanthus and leucaena provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass in specific seasons and under specific conditions however both underperformed compared with lucerne across the three years of the experiment 4 5 unanswered questions lucerne dominated herbage production by contributing 67 dm when grown in mixture with digit grass which reinforces findings from separate experiments e g 61 of dm murphy et al 2014 therefore we recommend that further studies determine the optimal proportion of lucerne within mixtures with digit grass we suggest that the optimal proportion of lucerne is one that generates legume herbage mass 2 5 4 t dm ha per year while maintaining overall production and rainwater productivity at or better than fertilized digit grass initial production and seed set from desmanthus were impressive but the impact of amv on subsequent production and or regeneration from seed appeared substantial the sharp decline in desmanthus plant frequency within the de di mix alludes to issues related to either seed set in the grazed stand or the subsequent regeneration from seed however the design of the current study did not allow examination of such issues further studies are required to determine amv susceptibility between lines of d virgatus and other desmanthus spp also heritability of amv through subsequent generations and quantify its effect on production leucaena production appears to fall short of what we need in this environment for it to make a meaningful contribution to a grazing system the impact of frost on leucaena herbage production warrants a closer examination in queensland new leucaena plants are grazed once they are more than 1 5 2 0 m tall otherwise recovery after grazing is slow overall production is limited and the plant frame weakened dalzell et al 2006 for our frost prone plants first grazing generally occurred in late november or early december or about 8 10 weeks after last frosts given that optimal time for regrowth is about 8 12 weeks dalzell et al 2006 depending on soil moisture and temperature leucaena in our environment might be grazed just two or possibly three times per season so limiting its overall contribution to the grazing system further studies are warranted to determine the minimum temperature thresholds where leucaena is viable and where it is best positioned in the landscape to minimise frost impact harris et al 2019 5 conclusions production from leucaena whether in pure or mixed swards was less than that of both lucerne and desmanthus particularly before its infection with amv we found that lucerne in mixed swards with digit grass was highly productive both desmanthus and leucaena provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass in mixes with digit grass in specific

9841,in recent years livestock producers have widely sown tropical perennial grasses such as digit grass digitaria eriantha in the frost prone summer dominant rainfall zone of eastern australia tropical grasses require substantial nitrogen inputs to maintain water productivity and forage quality perennial legumes offer a potential nitrogen source for these perennial grasses when sown in a mixed sward lucerne medicago sativa is the perennial legume most widely sown in grazing systems in south eastern australia in this study conducted over the period 2014 2018 we compared the soil water dynamics and rainwater productivity of pure stands of digit grass fertilized with applied nitrogen lucerne desmanthus desmanthus virgatus and leucaena leucaena leucocephala and binary mixtures of digit grass not fertilized with applied nitrogen with each legume we found that often growing season actual evapotranspiration eta was similar among the treatments p 0 05 but rainwater productivity kg

the latter three seasons however lucerne dominated the herbage mass c 67 legume leucaena production was delayed by frost and severely impacted by competition with digit grass and generally underperformed both lucerne and desmanthus this observation did always not hold when alfalfa mosaic virus amv impacted desmanthus in specific seasons our experiment has shown that a mixed sward of lucerne digit grass is highly productive and offered high rainwater productivity both desmanthus and leucaena in mixes with digit grass provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass in specific seasons and under specific conditions but both underperformed overall compared with lucerne keywords root depth water balance water use efficiency 1 introduction tropical perennial grass species such as digit grass digitaria eriantha can be highly productive and persistent and have become increasingly sown in areas that receive substantial winter rainfall moore et al 2014 or southern latitudes of australia e g mccormick et al 2009 maximizing rainwater productivity within pasture systems is a substantial challenge particularly in a summer dominant yet variable rainfall environment murphy et al 2019 tropical grasses quickly respond to water availability and forage quality improves with nitrogen n fertilizer application boschma et al 2017 however sole reliance on applied n fertilizer on a pure grass sward can be expensive and perhaps may limit the upper threshold of forage quality tropical perennial grass nutritive values of crude protein 13 19 metabolizable energy density 7 9 9 5 mj kg dm and digestibility 28 6 33 7 adf make them best suited to maintaining dry animals or moderate liveweight gains boschma et al 2017 companion legumes are one option that can offer both an n source to the grass and increase forage quality of the sward boschma and harris 2009 northern inland new south wales nsw presents a challenging environment for temperate annual legumes to germinate grow and set seed when growing within a sown summer active perennial grass sward boschma et al 2014 tropical grasses can utilize all plant available soil water over summer e g murphy et al 2019 however autumn is the season with the lowest rainfall resulting in low plant available soil water when temperate annual legumes germinate therefore with a variable break of the season e g lodge and johnson 2008 germination is unreliable further high spring temperatures often restrict temperate legume productivity and seed set thereby limiting the persistence of these legumes boschma et al 2011a lucerne medicago sativa is the most widely grown perennial legume in this region and has general acceptance as forage by growers notwithstanding the potential for causing bloat in cattle however the persistence of lucerne is a problem and production declines over time as the plant population diminishes lodge 1991 stand life for grazed lucerne can be as little as 5 years before renovation is required lodge 1991 however the potential of lucerne as a companion legume to digit grass was first illustrated by tow 1993 offering complementary soil water extraction and nitrogen cycling with the digit grass tow et al 1997b more recently evaluation of legumes that are potential companions with tropical perennial grasses in our environment identified a range of options both annual and perennial temperate and tropical worthy of field evaluation in mixtures li et al 2008 boschma and harris 2009 desmanthus desmanthus virgatus and leucaena leucaena leucocephala were two perennial tropical legumes that demonstrated high persistence and reasonable production boschma and harris 2009 harris et al 2019 both desmanthus e g clem and hall 1994 hall and walker 2005 rangel and gomide 2005 and leucaena e g radrizzani et al 2016 have demonstrated their suitability to livestock systems in tropical australia however they have yet to be evaluated directly with lucerne in a summer dominant yet variable rainfall environment in more temperate regions in a field experiment conducted at tamworth nsw australia we compared the performance of digit grass lucerne desmanthus and leucaena when grown as both pure swards and in binary mixtures of digit grass with each of the legumes the overall objective was to determine whether any of the legume grass mixtures can match the herbage production of pure digit grass pasture fertilized with applied n we used data sets of soil water dynamics water extraction rooting depth herbage production and rainwater productivity over four years 2014 2018 to evaluate two hypotheses 1 pure swards of desmanthus and leucaena would contribute herbage growth equal with lucerne and 2 the complementary evapotranspiration patterns of the tropical legumes and digit grass in mixed swards would enhance rainwater productivity compared with a lucerne digit grass sward 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment located at tamworth agricultural institute 31 08 44 s 150 58 04 e 400 m above sea level was on a brown vertosol isbell 2002 the annual average rainfall at tamworth is 674 mm with 60 falling during the warm season between october march an automatic weather station located at the site recorded rainfall 0 5 mm pluviometer at 30 min intervals we removed the existing pasture in november 2012 glyphosate 450 g l a i applied at 1 5 l ha and maintained fallow over summer 2012 13 before sowing a cover crop of oat avena fatua in autumn 2013 in late winter 2013 before the cover crop reached maturity we terminated it with glyphosate 1 5 l ha the site was fallow over summer 2013 14 and through winter 2014 to accumulate stored soil water and mineralize nitrogen in september 2014 cultivation prepared the seedbed before sowing the experimental treatments in november 2014 2 2 experimental design and establishment the experiment was a row column design with 9 treatments each plot 6 9 m and three replicates with plots arranged in 6 rows 5 columns each replicate comprised 2 rows 5 columns the tenth plot in each replicate was sown to digit grass as a fill area and was not examined the 9 treatments table 1 included digit grass cv premier desmanthus cv marc leucaena cv tarramba and lucerne cv venus that were sown as pure swards of each species and then as binary mixes of digit grass with each legume the leucaena treatments which represent an alley system of twin hedgerows of leucaena separated by an alley of grass were allocated to row 2 of each replicate group the final two treatments were digit grass sown in the alley between rows of leucaena digit grass desmanthus and lucerne treatments were sown on 19 november 2014 into a prepared seedbed at 0 17 m row spacing using a cone seeder with press wheels sowing rates adjusted for viable seed percentage were chosen to achieve plant densities consistent with commercial practice harris et al 2014 pure swards of digit grass desmanthus and lucerne were sown at 2 4 and 2 kg ha of viable seed respectively table 1 the mixtures were sown in alternate rows resulting in seeding rates per hectare that were half that of the pure swards of each species lucerne and desmanthus seeds were inoculated with commercial rhizobia and kept cool before sowing to establish leucaena we ripped twin rows 0 5 m deep 1 0 m apart and 9 0 m in length along the centre axis of the plot the ripped lines were pre irrigated using inverted soaker hoses to ensure high soil water content at planting on 21 november 2014 we planted 9 week old leucaena seedlings at 0 5 m intervals giving a total plant density of 3333 trees ha the soil surface of leucaeana le plots was covered with sugar cane mulch at 1500 kg dm ha for the duration of the experiment to prevent soil erosion these plots were maintained as weed and digit grass free for 2 5 m on either side of the leucaena rows with an annual application in october december of imazethapyr 700 g kg a i at 140 g ha for the mixture with digit grass le di the twin rows were perpendicular to the grass sowing rows which were sown to within 1 0 m from the leucaena rows to prevent digit grass seedlings from encroaching on the leucaena rows in the mixture le di in the first 12 months after planting we applied imazethapyr 700 g kg a i at 140 g ha in december 2014 2 2 1 treatment management herbicides were applied throughout the experiment to control annual broadleaf and grass weed seedlings in pure digit grass plots di mcpa 500 g l a i at 1 l ha dicamba 500 g l a i at 400 ml ha and metsulfuron methyl 600 g kg a i at 2 g ha were applied as required to control broadleaf weeds in pure plots of desmanthus de imazethapyr 700 g kg a i at 70 g ha was applied in winter and or spring as needed as a pre emergent herbicide lucerne lu received applications of flumetsulam 800 g kg a i at 25 g ha 2 4 db amine 500 g l a i at 1 5 l ha or fluazifop p 212 g l a i at 500 ml ha as required to control seedlings of grass and broad leaf weeds digit grass lucerne plots lu di received applications of flumetsulam 800 g kg a i at 25 g ha and 2 4 db amine 500 g l a i at 1 5 l ha to control seedlings of grass and broadleaf weeds the entire experiment received 200 kg ha single superphosphate 8 8 phosphorus 11 sulphur applied in spring each year from 2014 to 2018 additionally the pure digit grass treatment di received 110 kg ha urea 46 n applied in both spring and summer total of 220 kg ha timed to occur with rainfall to minimize volatilization digit grass in mixtures or in the alley between leucaena rows le ir le di ir were not fertilised with n in the establishment year 2014 15 treatments of digit grass and desmanthus set seed at the final herbage assessment each growing season usually in may desmanthus was left ungrazed to allow seed set at the beginning of the next growing season usually in september treatment plots were mown to remove residual frosted material and the leucaena plants trimmed to 0 3 m height except for 2016 when the plants remained green throughout the uncommonly mild winter 2 3 installation of neutron probe access tubes and soil profile description we measured soil water content with a neutron moisture meter nmm cpn503 dr hydroprobe boart longyear co martinez ca at the centre of each plot we installed an aluminium access tube 49 mm extern diam sealed at the bottom to 1 9 m depth first we extracted a soil core 51 mm extern diam with a hydraulic push coring machine we used 1 l of a clay slurry 1 kg bentonite 1 l water to fill any voids and ensure good contact between the soil and the access tube murphy et al 2017 a cap was placed over the top of the access tube to prevent rainwater from entering the retained soil cores were analysed for soil characteristics and to calibrate the nmm using methods described in murphy et al 2017 gravimetric soil water content g g of the soil cores was determined for segments that aligned with neutron probe sample depths i e 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 then 0 2 m intervals to 1 9 m for each core segment we determined soil bulk density mg m3 using the soil dry weight and volume of the core segment we determined soil ph cacl2 electrical conductivity ec1 5 ds m and soil particle size distribution at each depth on three air dried soil cores the soil profile was non saline ec1 5 0 65 ds m and had a trend of increasing alkalinity with depth ph cacl2 8 2 at the soil surface to ph cacl2 8 8 9 1 in the lower profile at 0 9 1 9 m table 2 the proportion of soil particles of different sizes sand 20 2000 µm silt 2 20 µm clay 2 µm gravel 2000 µm for each layer were determined using the laser diffraction method malvern mastersizer 2000 the proportion of clay was higher than for either sand or silt for all sampling layers table 2 clay content was 39 for sampling layers below 0 3 m depth while silt content was high at both the surface 38 3 and in the deepest sampling layer 38 but decreased in the middle profile 32 35 soil texture at the surface 0 0 1 m was silty clay loam and trended to silty clay at depths 0 1 m the soil physical data were used in pedotransfer functions mckenzie and cresswell 2002 to predict soil water content values for the drained upper limit c 10 kpa and crop lower limit c 1500 kpa for each soil layer the profile stored soil water at the drained upper limit and crop lower limit were 817 1 1 and 439 0 1 mm respectively indicating a potential plant available water content pawc mm of 378 1 0 mm 2 3 1 neutron moisture meter calibration to calibrate the neutron moisture meter we determined the relationship between neutron count and values of volumetric soil water content swc θvol m3 m3 we included data points from the time we installed access tubes and at other times when swc was high near the drained upper limit and low near the crop lower limit giving a full range of values n 140 lodge et al 2010 for each soil sampling layer values of volumetric swc θvol and neutron count were plotted and logarithmic regression y 131 559 ln x 26 398 best explained the relationship between swc x and neutron count y r2 0 87 n 140 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 soil water content at approximately 21 day intervals we used counts from the neutron moisture meter to determine soil water content swc this sampling interval over the period from 20 november 2014 9 may 2018 gave 52 sample dates at the midpoint of each 0 2 m soil layer from 0 1 to 0 3 m to a maximum depth of 1 9 m 16 s counts were taken values of volumetric swc for each layer were converted to stored soil water ssw mm and summed to obtain values for the upper 0 1 0 7 m middle 0 7 1 3 m lower 1 3 1 9 m and the total profile 0 1 1 9 m 2 4 2 herbage production herbage production kg dm ha was estimated on 22 occasions at approximately 6 week intervals during the pasture growing season september may over 4 years the first assessment in early spring was primarily a measure of lucerne growth as it was the only treatment that grew through winter annual herbage production was determined by accumulating values from 1 july 30 june for each of 4 growing years green herbage mass was estimated by 2 observers who randomly placed 4 quadrats 0 4 0 4 m along separate transects that ran along the long axis of each plot a total of 8 quadrats per plot the observers assessed each quadrat for total herbage production to a height of 0 1 m using a continuous 0 5 scale 0 nil 5 high and the percentage of sown legume and grass estimated on a dry weight basis at each sampling time 20 calibration quadrats 0 4 m 0 4 m selected to cover the range of herbage mass and proportion of legume at the site were also assessed and harvested to 0 1 m above ground level the herbage was sorted into sown legume sown grass and other all voluntary species each portion was dried at 80 c for 48 h before weighing scores and percentage estimates for these calibration quadrats were regressed linear or quadratic r 2 0 75 n 20 against actual herbage mass kg dm ha and percentage of legume and grass to determine the herbage mass of each component in each treatment plot recording the physical dimensions of the leucaena shrubs and using a standard visual technique e g murphy et al 2017 provided growth and herbage production data for leucaena firstly we measured the overall width m and height m of the leucaena twin rows at 4 points along the hedge rows secondly we harvested a typical cane e g length and amount of edible leaf and stem from one leucaena plant in each plot to use as a visual standard using this standard we counted the number of similar canes on each of 4 randomly selected plants in each row total of 8 plants plot the edible material from the typical cane leaf and stem 10 mm diameter was then removed dried at 80 c for 48 h and weighed to determine the edible herbage mass for the plot kg dm ha we multiplied the value from the reference cane by the mean count of canes per plant and the total number of plants per hectare 3333 ha after each assessment a mob of sheep was used to crash graze the plots to a residual height of about 0 1 m a flail or rotary mower equipped with a catcher removed any residual stem 0 1 m in height fences around the leucaena plots were used to control sheep access and prevent overgrazing of leucaena plants after grazing any long stems that were beyond the reach of sheep were cut back to a height of 1 2 m 2 4 3 plant persistence near the start and end of each growing year c november and may we assessed plant frequency brown 1954 of digit grass lucerne and desmanthus the number of cells 0 1 0 1 m containing a live plant of either digit grass or legume were counted in two fixed quadrats 1 0 1 0 m total 100 cells in each plot about 7 days after grazing and the proportion of occurrence determined leucaena plants in each row were counted to record any losses 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 soil water content and maximum extractable water swc data for each treatment were plotted for each measurement layer and sampling time periods of 3 months or more during each growing season september may when swc declined without interruption by complete profile rewetting i e significant rainfall events were identified these periods demonstrated the capacity of the treatments to extract soil water murphy and lodge 2006 the difference between the values of ssw for each measurement layer and treatment at the start and end date of each period was calculated as the maximum extractable water mew mm neal et al 2012 values of mew for each measurement layer were summed to values for the upper 0 1 0 7 m middle 0 7 1 3 m lower 1 3 1 9 m and full 0 1 1 9 m soil profile layers analysis of variance was used to model values of mew for each soil profile layer against the factors treatment year and their interaction the model accounted for replicate effects within each year by including the interaction of year x replicate as a block term a 5 level of significance determined the least significant difference lsd 2 5 2 plant root depth we identified plant root depth from changes in soil water content between the dates used to determine mew murphy and lodge 2006 on each date the trend in swc over depth among the three replicate values was modelled using a linear mixed model the model included depth as a covariate and a fixed term to model the linear trend over depth and a spline term as a random effect to model a smooth curvilinear trend verbyla et al 1999 terms to account for differences between the replicates were included as random effects in the model predicted values of swc with depth s e of prediction were plotted for each treatment and plant root depth identified as the maximum depth where the errors did not intersect murphy and lodge 2006 murphy et al 2019 2 5 3 rainfall refill efficiency soil moisture accumulation or refill mm occurred when digit grass desmanthus and leucaena were frosted and not growing typically may to september we identified periods when swc changed from lowest to highest then we calculated soil water refill swr mm for each soil profile layer i e upper 0 1 0 7 m middle 0 7 1 3 m lower 1 3 1 9 m and full 0 1 1 9 m the rainfall refill efficiency was calculated by dividing swr by total rainfall during the period analysis of variance determined significant differences among start and end stored soil water swr in each soil profile layer and rainfall refill efficiency a 5 level of significance determined the least significant difference lsd 2 5 4 plant production the trend in herbage production kg dm ha and legume percentage was modelled using a linear mixed model for each treatment the model included sample date as a covariate and a fixed term to model the linear trend over time and a spline term as a random effect to model smooth curvilinear trend predicted values of herbage production were accumulated for each growing year 1 july 30 june analysis of variance was used to model values of accumulated plant dry matter against the factors of treatment year and their interaction the lsd was calculated using a 5 level of significance the model accounted for replicate effects within each year by including the interaction of year x replicate as a block term 2 5 5 plant persistence trend in plant frequency was modelled using a linear mixed model for each plant density the model included sample date as a covariate and a fixed term to model the linear trend over time and a spline term as a random effect to model smooth curvilinear trend predicted values of plant frequency with time s e of prediction were plotted to determine changes for each treatment 2 5 6 rainwater productivity for each 6 week interval during the growing year rainwater productivity kg dm ha mm was calculated by dividing herbage production kg dm ha by actual evapotranspiration eta mm actual evapotranspiration was determined by soil water balance under the assumption that no water was lost by runoff or deep drainage using the equation et a p δs r o d d where p is precipitation δs is change in stored soil water r o is runoff and d d is deep drainage all measured in mm rainwater productivity of dry matter production for each treatment was calculated for each growing year and total dry matter production over 3 years significant differences were determined by analysis of variance and lsd calculated using a 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 soil water dynamics seasonal rainfall at the site demonstrated distinct periods of above and below average totals fig 1 totals were well above average for a 6 month period when the experiment commenced e g summer 2014 15 and autumn 2015 fig 1 in the following 2 years seasonal rainfall totals from winter 2015 to autumn 2016 were below average from winter 2016 to autumn 2017 rainfall was well above average and total rainfall for the 12 months to end of may 2017 was 940 mm equating to the 94th percentile the final year of the experiment was exceedingly dry fig 1 and total rainfall for the 12 months to end of may 2018 was 337 mm equating to the 3rd percentile it is essential to recognize the fluctuation in seasonal rainfall to explore the subsequent dynamics of soil water extraction and profile refill the heat maps of soil water content provide a visual representation of soil water dynamics though time and depth fig 2 they clearly illustrate that these summer active pasture species had a repeating pattern of drying the soil profile in summer and soil profile wetting in winter when they were largely inactive fig 2 soil water contents were lowest in the autumn and highest in the spring closer examination revealed differences among the treatments in both the depth and intensity of soil profile drying and soil profile wetting from establishment in spring 2014 and then through summer the treatments de de di and le di had greater intensity of soil drying than the other treatments fig 2c e and f in 2015 16 all treatments resulted in a distinct increase in soil dryness which coincided with below average rainfall fig 1 the treatments that achieved the greatest depth and intensity of soil dryness were di lu lu di and le di ir fig 2 digit grass fig 2a vigorously dried the soil to 1 2 m depth at the same time leucaena le contrasted as having less intense drying fig 2b lucerne fig 2d and lu di fig 2g extracted little stored soil water in 2014 15 due to the slow growth at the start of these treatments however in later years lu showed intense drying for a longer period september may compared with de or de di the patterns of soil water content of digit grass sown in the leucaena inter row le ir or le di ir fig 2h and i were like that of pure digit di fig 2a until autumn 2016 after that however these treatments had elevated soil water content compared with di the treatments that had intense soil drying throughout the late stages of the experiment were di lu de di and lu di fig 2a d f and g 3 1 1 mew and plant root depth in 2015 de 191 mm extracted more soil water than five of the other treatments lu di lu le ir le di ir and di 56 113 mm p 0 05 table 3 however in 2016 and 2017 all treatments extracted similar amounts of soil water p 0 05 table 3 with the 2017 mean value 224 mm table 3 being highest of all years after a closer examination of the data we found that the residuals were large for a single treatment plot in one replication of different treatments in 2016 and 2017 these large residuals resulted in non significant differences between the treatments mean mew was lowest in 2018 while lu extracted the least p 0 05 table 3 soil water extraction and subsequent root depth for 2017 and 2018 are illustrated graphically in fig 3 plant root depth varied considerably between treatments and between years all treatments achieved their maximum root depth in either 2015 1 68 1 80 m or 2016 1 56 1 80 m and expressed their minimum root depth in 2018 0 20 1 08 m table 3 five treatments de lu lu di le di and le di ir achieved a maximum root depth of 1 80 m while four di le le ir and de di ranged 1 56 1 75 m table 3 3 1 2 rainfall refill efficiency change in profile stored soil water mm and rainfall refill coefficient were different p 0 05 among the treatments for 2015 and 2017 but not 2016 table 4 the mean soil profile refill largely reflected the amount of rainfall received when pastures were inactive profile refill in 2016 254 mm was more than double that of 2015 100 mm and 6 times that of 2017 41 mm table 4 while the mean rainfall refill coefficients in 2015 and 2016 were similar 59 v 62 and three times greater than in 2017 15 table 4 values among treatments were significantly different p 0 05 only in 2015 in 2015 lu and lu di treatments 22 and 33 mm captured less p 0 05 winter rainfall than the other treatments while de 167 mm captured more than le ir 87 mm table 4 at the start of winter in 2015 these lucerne treatments had wetter soil profiles fig 2 which resulted in little available storage capacity to capture rainfall in 2017 lu and lu di captured significantly less of the below average winter rainfall than most other treatments table 4 resulting in significantly lower rainfall refill coefficients table 4 in the latter year low groundcover in the lu and lu di together with below average rainfall suppressed rainfall capture 3 2 plant production 3 2 1 herbage mass and proportion of legume digit grass as a pure sward di delivered annual herbage mass ranging 4070 13 286 kg dm ha with total eta of 384 855 mm resulting in rainwater productivity ranging 10 6 19 1 kg dm ha mm table 5 as a pure grass sward di generally had greater p 0 05 grass herbage mass compared with the grass component in each of the legume mixtures de di lu di and le di 3928 12 325 kg dm ha table 5 however grass herbage mass in 2016 for le di 10 424 kg dm ha was like that of di 13 286 kg dm ha table 5 grass herbage mass for le ir 8283 12 325 kg dm ha le di ir 9732 10 825 kg dm ha and di 10 819 13 286 kg dm ha were all similar p 0 05 in the early stage of the experiment in the 2015 and 2016 seasons but as the experiment progressed the interrow treatments produced less grass p 0 05 than di table 5 legume herbage mass differed p 0 05 among the treatments each year but the best performing legume also varied each year in 2015 de 14 370 kg dm ha table 5 had the greatest p 0 05 legume herbage mass in 2016 legume herbage masses for de lu and lu di were similar p 0 05 8185 10 669 kg dm ha but greater than le 4731 kg dm ha and the lowest was le di 1355 kg dm ha table 5 in 2017 legume herbage mass for lu 16 913 kg dm ha was greatest p 0 05 while de di and le di 2547 and 2638 kg dm ha respectively were lowest p 0 05 leucaena as a pure stand le produced more p 0 05 legume herbage mass 4512 10 326 kg dm ha than its mixture with digit grass le di 1355 2638 kg dm ha in all years table 5 the changes in legume production influenced the proportion of legume in total herbage mass within treatments and between years the proportion of leucaena in le di increased each year of the experiment from 12 to 42 mean 26 in contrast the proportion of desmanthus in de di decreased each year from 71 to 23 mean 41 the proportion of lucerne in lu di fluctuated ranging 59 75 with a higher mean level of 67 3 2 2 leucaena hedgerow dimensions at every sample date the leucaena hedgerows in the le treatment were taller range 0 1 0 61 m mean 0 32 m and wider range 0 23 0 74 m mean 0 49 m than those in the le di treatment fig 4a b these differences reflected the variation in treatment legume herbage mass as described above 3 2 3 plant frequency digit grass in the pure sward di le di and le di ir generated the highest values of grass plant frequency and they steadily increased as the experiment progressed increasing from 57 to 73 84 86 fig 5a the frequencies of digit grass in the mixtures with desmanthus de di and lucerne lu di were initially half de di or less than a third lu di of the pure digit sward reflecting differences in sowing rates and competition among seedlings however during the experiment the grass plant frequency in these treatments doubled de di from 38 to 76 lu di from 22 to a high of 51 despite the increase in grass frequency in lu di it remained significantly lower than all other treatments fig 5a frequency of legume in the mixed swards was generally less than in the pure swards the frequency of desmanthus in its mixture de di 31 13 was always significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the pure sward de which was relatively stable declining from 45 to 41 fig 5b the frequency of lucerne in its mixture lu di 32 49 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that in the pure sward lu 44 66 for most of the experiment however frequency in both lucerne treatments declined to a similar level of 20 25 in the latter part of the experiment fig 5b 3 3 actual evapotranspiration and rainwater productivity actual evapotranspiration among the treatments in the growing years from 2015 to 2017 despite some considerable variation in values was largely similar p 0 05 table 5 mean values of eta varied by 100 mm from year to year 751 644 and 856 mm for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2018 however lu had lower eta p 0 05 than all other treatments 316c 346 384 mm table 5 rainwater productivity among the treatments differed in all years p 0 05 table 5 in 2015 treatments containing lucerne or leucaena 3 8 7 9 kg dm ha mm were less efficient than all other treatments 11 4 17 9 kg dm ha mm table 5 in 2016 le and de di 7 3 and 11 5 kg dm ha mm respectively were less efficient than di le ir or le di 19 1 19 8 kg dm ha mm in 2017 lu di and lu 17 8 and 19 1 kg dm ha mm respectively were the most efficient treatments among the other treatments di and le di 14 1 and 13 7 kg dm ha mm were more efficient than de and le di ir 9 7 and 9 4 kg dm ha mm in 2018 the leucaena inter rows and de di 6 6 8 5 kg dm ha mm were less efficient than most of the other treatments but de di was similarly efficient to di 8 5 and 10 6 kg dm ha mm respectively 4 discussion tropical grasses are highly responsive to plant nutrition especially applied n boschma et al 2015 the di treatment in our experiment fertilized with 100 kg n ha year resulted in 10 t dm ha year and rainwater productivity of 14 6 kg dm ha mm over the 4 years of the study on average digit grass total evapotranspiration was 666 mm it extracted 174 mm of soil water and its root depth was 1 30 m these characteristics demonstrated efficient rainwater productivity however tropical grass pastures are prone to n rundown and a decline in productivity through time myers and robbins 1991 peck et al 2011 the rainwater productivity for all treatments dominated by di declined markedly from 2016 to 2018 di 19 1 10 6 le ir 19 5 7 2 le di ir 14 7 6 6 kg dm ha mm applied n fertilizer alleviated those declines but without the influence of legume the declines were substantial e g the alley zones well away from the leucaena the decline in rainwater productivity for lu di was less severe 16 2 12 3 kg dm ha mm lucerne has an extensive track record as a quality pasture legume and is a benchmark for perennial legume production in this environment boschma et al 2011b murphy et al 2014 the primary objective of our study was to determine whether either of the novel tropical legumes desmanthus or leucaena can match the production of lucerne the secondary objectives were to assess if legume grass mixtures using these tropical legumes can match production of the lucerne grass mixture and whether any of the legume grass mixtures can match the productivity of pure tropical grass pasture fertilized with n 4 1 desmanthus and leucaena do not match production by lucerne in this environment lucerne was the standout performer among the legumes as expected in this environment boschma et al 2011a however lucerne dominated digit grass in the mixture yielding 67 of overall herbage mass in grazed pastures the proportion of legume that optimizes n transfer to the grasses maybe as low as 30 louarn et al 2016 in our study lucerne initially underperformed but it excelled in the second and third years this slow start to above ground production is common as lucerne plants in the first year establish crown reserves brown et al 2006 however in subsequent years the now established plants commenced active growth up to 6 weeks before the digit grass thereby lucerne capitalized on first use of stored soil water and so dominated herbage production given that lucerne based treatments had the lowest rainfall refill efficiency levels brought about by a relatively short period of inactivity during winter and lower groundcover the first use of stored soil water is particularly important the consequence of this low refill is lucerne s increased reliance on growing season rainfall to sustain growth this low level of profile refill contrasts to more temperate locations with a strongly winter dominant rainfall pattern that enables refill of stored soil water e g mccaskill et al 2016 in all years lucerne growing in the mixture with digit lu di yielded 50 of the herbage mass of the pure lucerne treatment demonstrating overyielding the overyielding of lucerne occurred at the expense of digit grass which yielded approximately 25 of the fertilized grass treatment elsewhere in the region however digit lucerne mixes fertilized with additional n outyielded fertilized monocultures of either digit or lucerne by up to 70 due to the complementary growth patterns and efficiencies in nitrogen use tow et al 1997a in our experiment we speculate that lucerne over yielded in the mixture because our stand density was initially very high lucerne plant frequency was variable year to year but in both pure swards and its mixture with digit grass it declined over the 4 years maintaining lucerne is an ongoing challenge whether in a pure pasture lodge 1991 or mixed sward li et al 2008 grazing management sympathetic to lucerne s requirements for storage of root carbohydrate reserves can extend stand life teixeira et al 2007 however in this environment a combination of insect damage disease and water logging leads to eventual failure of the stand lodge 1991 desmanthus in our experiment started particularly strong and the level of production despite frosting in winter demonstrated its suitability to this environment overall desmanthus de produced more herbage mass than all treatments except digit grass di but a large proportion of this mass grew in the first growing season 2015 14 t dm ha after that alfalfa mosaic virus amv infection severely curtailed production the decline in productivity was most noticeable in the mixture de di with steep declines in both the plant frequency and the proportion of legume the unexpected infection of desmanthus with amv was a first for this species in australia van leur et al 2019 desmanthus with amv infection showed a subdued yield response in 2017 compared with that of both le and lu the impact of amv on existing plants was seen most clearly in the mixture where seedlings did not recruit the plant frequency declined total herbage mass declined rainwater productivity declined and within the run of seasons there was no opportunity for successful recruitment of seedlings we observed some recruitment of seedlings in de plots but not among the de di mixture ordinarily desmanthus cv marc is a prolific seeder and readily recruits seedlings where it was reported as both productive and persistent boschma et al 2021 the impact of amv on the treatment was disappointing however the disease demonstrated the risks of exposing a species grown outside of its main area of adaptation to different pests and diseases we were not able to quantify the degree that infection with amv diminished production leucaena contributed significantly less legume herbage mass in all years compared with lucerne apart from the final dry year when all yields were low in mixtures competition from digit grass negatively impacted leucaena yield best management practice in more tropical environments recommends establishing the grass after the leucaena rather than in the same year pachas et al 2019 leucaena seedlings are slow to establish and respond poorly to competition dalzell et al 2006 however local experience indicated that establishing the mixed pasture over 2 years is not suitable in this environment harris et al 2019 therefore in establishing le di we attempted to minimize grass competition on the leucaena by maintaining a bare buffer of 1 0 m adjacent to the leucaena twin hedgerows the smaller dimensions of the leucaena hedgerows in le di compared with le at the end of the establishment year demonstrated that this buffer was inadequate to alleviate competition by the grass this suggests that if both leucaena and digit grass are simultaneously established then a wider grass free buffer is required e g a minimum of 3 m the grass could set seed in the first year and then encroach on leucaena without ill effect leucaena was subject to frost damage and totally frosted in three of the four years of our experiment in these years leucaena plants recommenced growth as fresh buds from the plant crown in early october rainfall in the winter and spring of 2016 was above average fig 1 resulting in warmer overnight temperatures and mild frost leucaena plants did not succumb to frost in that winter and so enabled it to grow strongly from spring and accumulate its maximum annual yields of 10 3 t and 2 6 t dm ha in le and le di respectively this contrasted with the other years where first grazing was delayed until december or january the delay in growth and grazing to late in the summer growing season needs to be considered within the structure of a productive livestock enterprise in 2018 a hotter and drier year leucaena demonstrated its ability to continue production under testing growing conditions in such challenging growing conditions the two leucaena based treatments le and le di were the most productive closer examination of the swc data showed that le and le di had higher levels of stored soil water remaining at the end of the 2018 growing season for example le 575 mm total stored soil water had 100 mm additional stored soil water remaining compared with di or lu di 473 and 474 mm total stored soil water respectively leucaena s canopy structure is suspected of facilitating rainwater harvesting channeling rainwater down its stems to the base of the plant resulting in higher stored soil water pers comm s dalzell our soil water content data may support that hypothesis alternatively we speculate that the impact of frost damage may delay the leucaena growing season to such an extent that it is not able to grow enough leaf area within the growing season to utilize the soil water resource leucaena s soil water extraction patterns require further investigation in this type of environment 4 2 can a legume grass mixture match fertilized digit grass a legume grass mixture that is as productive and water efficient as fertilized pure digit grass is highly desirable negating the need for annual n fertilizer applications and could potentially deliver a higher quality forage base digit grass 40 2 t dm ha had the highest total production measured over the 4 growing years however in the 2015 growing year being the establishment year 6 weekly growth was not assessed in all treatments e g leucaena and desmanthus therefore a fairer comparison of total and annual production can be made in the 2016 2018 growing seasons for this latter period total production from lu di 31 3 t dm ha exceeded that of di 29 4 t dm ha but lucerne remained the dominant component accounting for up to 75 of the herbage mass in specific seasons table 5 total production for le di was 27 9 t dm ha and annual production was not different to that of digit grass in each of these three years but legume was the minor component accounting for 42 of the herbage mass table 5 total production from de di was 19 4 t dm ha but annual production declined year on year and by 2018 the proportion of legume declined to a low of 23 table 5 therefore we consider that the lu di mixture appeared the most desirable of these legume grass mixtures in our environment the annual yield of legume in a legume grass mixture is an essential indicator of both potential grass yield and livestock production e g louarn et al 2016 waldron et al 2020 in this case digit grass requires nitrogen fixed by the legume while the legume increases overall forage quality e g bork et al 2017 digit grass is highly responsive to nitrogen applied at 50 100 kg n ha boschma et al 2015 a conservative estimate for nitrogen fixed by a legume based pasture is 20 25 kg n per tonne of legume shoot dm peoples and baldock 2001 therefore to maintain digit grass growth rates in these mixtures we estimate that annual legume production needs to be in the range of 2 5 4 t dm ha per year the only legume in our mixtures to consistently achieve this level was lucerne desmanthus in de di did so in the first year 9 8 t dm ha but after that declined while leucaena s maximum yield in the le di mixture was 2 6 t dm ha however annual legume production from the le treatment without the direct competition from digit grass was 6 5 t dm ha which demonstrated leucaena s potential in this environment 4 3 complementary evapotranspiration patterns did not always support greater rainwater productivity total evapotranspiration by the treatments only differed in the 2018 growing season when the onset of drought conditions impacted water availability therefore any differences in rainwater productivity were in the main due to significant differences in yield of herbage mass within each growing season for example le and le di in 2016 and de and de di in 2018 we found that yield and rainwater productivity of the mixtures only rarely underperformed that of the pure legume or digit grass and we suggest this as evidence of a high degree of complementarity between the tropical grass and these summer active legumes the few occasions when the mixtures underperformed were associated with either in the establishment year e g lucerne leucaena or the impact of disease e g desmanthus within each year the range in evapotranspiration values among treatments was considerable e g 2015 137 mm 2016 99 mm 2017 77 mm and we were surprised that these differences were not significant in other studies the least significant differences in total evapotranspiration among treatments were as little as 21 mm murphy et al 2019 however for our experiment we found large residuals associated with specific replicates of some treatments were the reason for the lack of significant differences differences in stored soil water among the replicates resulted in large error terms and lack of significance the dynamics of competition for soil water resources between the legume and grass in the mixtures is likely to determine the longer term survival of the legume grass mixture lucerne is highly competitive as a seedling boschma et al 2010 and as a mature plant mainly because it begins its growth earlier in the season than the tropical grass murphy et al 2019 lucerne is an early and aggressive water user and is generally assumed to have a deep root system e g dunin et al 2001 this earlier access to the soil water resource enables lucerne to dominate soil water extraction and so production compounding this effect are the reduced window to refill the soil profile resulting in a lesser amount of soil water available to the grass 4 4 roots and competition for stored soil water tropical grasses have an extensive fibrous root system with large root density in the upper 1 5 m of the soil profile e g pachas et al 2018b murphy et al 2019 which enables a high level of utilization of stored soil water lucerne and leucaena have root systems dominated by vertical tap roots e g sim et al 2017 allowing extraction of soil water to greater depth interaction between roots of leucaena and rhodes grass chloris gayana in southern queensland indicated that the grass roots had a much higher root density than leucaena pachas et al 2018b the likely below ground interaction of roots between the species here appears to have translated into above ground impacts on herbage production as similarly reported by pachas et al 2018a the competition by digit grass hampered leucaena production in the mixture resulting in hedgerows that were less tall and less wide leucaena total herbage mass in le di was typically just 25 of that in le further exacerbating the underperformance compared with lucerne based treatments we infer that competition from digit grass growing too close to the leucaena plants during the establishment year has severely limited leucaena production thus confirming similar findings from queensland for desmanthus its rooting depth and structure are not known from physical sampling however our soil water extraction data suggested desmanthus treatments in the first growing season aggressively extracted stored soil water 191 mm table 3 and to a great depth 1 80 m table 3 the evapotranspiration and herbage yield data indicate that desmanthus was negatively impacted after infection by amv and that has made it difficult to critically evaluate its performance against the hypothesis of complementary evapotranspiration patterns the issue of amv infection in desmanthus needs resolving for its potential as a productive legume pasture in a lucerne growing area to be realized the final year of the experiment was exceedingly dry plant root depth herbage mass total evapotranspiration and rainwater productivity were all substantially lower than in previous years the exception to this was the performance of le and le di in those treatments leucaena plants remained green and actively grew throughout the season we hypothesize that leucaena was able to continue growing because it had higher soil water content e g fig 2 and presence of plant roots at 2 0 m depth once more the findings from our experiment suggest that lucerne as a legume in a mixture with digit grass is highly suited to this environment e g tow 1993 both desmanthus and leucaena provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass in specific seasons and under specific conditions however both underperformed compared with lucerne across the three years of the experiment 4 5 unanswered questions lucerne dominated herbage production by contributing 67 dm when grown in mixture with digit grass which reinforces findings from separate experiments e g 61 of dm murphy et al 2014 therefore we recommend that further studies determine the optimal proportion of lucerne within mixtures with digit grass we suggest that the optimal proportion of lucerne is one that generates legume herbage mass 2 5 4 t dm ha per year while maintaining overall production and rainwater productivity at or better than fertilized digit grass initial production and seed set from desmanthus were impressive but the impact of amv on subsequent production and or regeneration from seed appeared substantial the sharp decline in desmanthus plant frequency within the de di mix alludes to issues related to either seed set in the grazed stand or the subsequent regeneration from seed however the design of the current study did not allow examination of such issues further studies are required to determine amv susceptibility between lines of d virgatus and other desmanthus spp also heritability of amv through subsequent generations and quantify its effect on production leucaena production appears to fall short of what we need in this environment for it to make a meaningful contribution to a grazing system the impact of frost on leucaena herbage production warrants a closer examination in queensland new leucaena plants are grazed once they are more than 1 5 2 0 m tall otherwise recovery after grazing is slow overall production is limited and the plant frame weakened dalzell et al 2006 for our frost prone plants first grazing generally occurred in late november or early december or about 8 10 weeks after last frosts given that optimal time for regrowth is about 8 12 weeks dalzell et al 2006 depending on soil moisture and temperature leucaena in our environment might be grazed just two or possibly three times per season so limiting its overall contribution to the grazing system further studies are warranted to determine the minimum temperature thresholds where leucaena is viable and where it is best positioned in the landscape to minimise frost impact harris et al 2019 5 conclusions production from leucaena whether in pure or mixed swards was less than that of both lucerne and desmanthus particularly before its infection with amv we found that lucerne in mixed swards with digit grass was highly productive both desmanthus and leucaena provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass in mixes with digit grass in specific seasons and under specific conditions but both underperformed overall compared with lucerne funding this research was funded by meat livestock australia meat livestock australia donor company and nsw

9842,ideotypic characteristics of durum wheat associated with higher yield under different water and temperature regimes were studied under mediterranean conditions six semi dwarf cultivars with contrasting agronomic performance were grown during two consecutive years under winter planted rainfed and winter planted support irrigation conditions and a late planting trial under support irrigation at the inia station of colmenar de oreja madrid different traits were assessed to inform on water status root performance phenology photosynthetic capacity crop growth grain yield and agronomic yield components under support irrigation and normal planting genotypes with higher grain yield exhibited better water status lower δ13c and canopy temperature assimilation of more superficial water higher δ18o earlier heading and greater plant height and ear density under water limited conditions rainfed the best genotypes also exhibited better water status lower δ13c and earlier heading but higher specific root length with extraction of water from deeper soil layers lower δ18o more efficient n metabolism higher δ15n and nbi and consequently stronger growth plant height and ndvi and greater ear density and thousand grain weight under warmer conditions late planting the best genotypes also exhibited better water status lower δ13c and greater plant height and photoprotective mechanisms higher flavonoid content and lower chlorophyll content however the strong differences in drought between consecutive years determined other specific ideotypic traits within each of the three growing conditions and the particular year our study suggests specific ideotypes when breeding durum wheat under different agronomic scenarios but also stresses that interannual

importance and extent of cultivated area food and agriculture organization 2019a however durum wheat production is usually conditioned by climate factors particularly water availability and elevated temperatures araus et al 2003 loss and siddique 1994 sabella et al 2020 xynias et al 2020 zampieri et al 2020 to date breeding programs have been mostly focused on selecting genotypes based on grain yield along with traits that include phenology and tolerance to local or regional pests and diseases as a result declining genetic advance has been reported in different regions of the mediterranean basin chairi et al 2018 and particularly when cultivars are confronted with weather variability kahiluoto et al 2019 to deal with these circumstances farmers are more and more directed towards tactical management which relies on flexibility in sowing time and choice of cultivar hunt et al 2019 monitoring of crops to adjust fertilizer application basically nitrogen supply and control the impact of biotic stresses and wherever possible providing support irrigation food and agriculture organization 2019b mihailescu and soares 2020 the variability in growing conditions together with the trends presented by ongoing climate change call for the development and use of wheat cultivars that can adapt efficiently to the available water and withstand increased temperatures while maintaining a relatively high yield therefore there is a need for tailored breeding in terms of developing cultivars suitable to different growing conditions in the mediterranean integrating phenotyping approaches within breeding strategies can pave the way to create more productive and resilient cultivars that are well adapted to specific agro environments li et al 2018 increasing emphasis has been given to field crop phenotyping where different remote sensing approaches are deployed due to their high throughput and non invasive nature to assess crop growth potential photosynthetic capacity or even water status araus and cairns 2014 araus et al 2018 eventually the combination of remote sensing assessment with specific laboratory approaches such as stable carbon isotope signatures may improve the predictive capacity of the phenotyping process gracia romero et al 2019 kefauver et al 2017 rezzouk et al 2020 nevertheless a critical hurdle for phenotyping approaches is the limited access to the belowground part of the plant under field conditions root phenotyping may be key when seeking to improve productivity and stability under conditions like those present in mediterranean agro environments where water availability limits to a greater or lesser extent yield and its stability li et al 2019 maccaferri et al 2016 in fact under elevated temperatures and water deficit roots are reported to be more responsive in terms of growth than the aboveground parts of the plant which may subsequently affect water uptake plant growth and yield petr 1991 pinto and reynolds 2015 technologies developed for root phenotyping have been mainly applied to plants growing in containers under controlled conditions making the subsequent translation of results to the real i e field condition often difficult atkinson et al 2019 under field conditions the throughput of root phenotyping practices is still low to medium nevertheless even if it is not feasible to screen the progeny of large breeding panels these techniques may still serve to thoroughly characterize potential parents to inform strategic crosses and in general terms to define ideotypes for specific growing conditions maccaferri et al 2011 2016 root crown phenotyping commonly known as shovelomics is a phenotyping technique to directly assess root properties this technique was first developed for maize trachsel et al 2011 and further applied to other crops including wheat maccaferri et al 2016 york et al 2018b york et al 2018b the approach consists of exploring the upper 15 30 cm of the rhizosphere via manual digging and root excavation to assess the properties of the roots wasson et al 2020 york et al 2018a root angle among other root traits was reported to be useful for improving plant productivity under drought conditions and can contribute to breeding advances wasaya et al 2018 in barley for instance wild genotypes exhibited a more vertical angular spread that allowed them to obtain water from deeper levels therefore favouring survival bengough et al 2004 reynolds et al 2007 a similar trend was observed in wheat genotypes grown under rainfed conditions where deeper roots with higher root density at depth and lower root densities at the surface were related to higher grain yield passioura 1982 wasaya et al 2018 soil coring is another approach that aims to overcome some of the main limitations inherent to shovelomics enabling exploration of the root system at deeper soil levels wasson et al 2020 york et al 2018b however this approach is substantially lower in throughput and much more costly than shovelomics other potential approaches to phenotype root architecture and or functioning in the field were well documented such as electrical resistance tomography srayeddin and doussan 2009 the use of electromagnetic inductance whalley et al 2017 or ground penetrating radar liu et al 2016 2017 have been reported but again the levels of throughput cost and or precision are limitations given the difficult nature of their direct assessment root traits may be approached indirectly using above ground phenotyping as an alternative araus and cairns 2014 wasaya et al 2018 tracy et al 2020 for example a widely considered parameter that reflects the roots access to water resources is canopy temperature ct a study in wheat conducted under field conditions examined the phenotypic relationship between ct soil moisture and the root dry weight in different soil profiles and concluded that ct can serve as an indicator of a genotype s ability to maintain transpiration via the extraction of water from deeper soil profiles lopes and reynolds 2010 further in drought stressed environments and where water access is limited transpiration and the subsequent canopy cooling effect can be supported by deeper roots li et al 2019 lopes and reynolds 2010 enhanced photosynthesis due to an increase in stomatal conductance provision of better access to water resources and associated with genetic advance are well documented in wheat roche 2015 li et al 2019 stable isotope composition may also prove to be efficient for measuring root activities in an indirect manner under mediterranean conditions araus et al 2003 2013 as well as in arid conditions under irrigation lopes and reynolds 2010 higher yielding wheat genotypes were associated with low carbon isotope composition δ13c or high isotope discrimination from the surrounding co2 atmosphere δ13c by the maturing grains in fact the δ13c of plant tissues informs on the intercellular to atmospheric ratio of co2 ci ca within the plant farquhar et al 1989 with stomatal conductance usually being the main factor determining ci ca another approach for assessing root function is analysis of the stable water composition in plant water thus oxygen isotope composition δ18o when analysed in water from the base of the wheat stem kale çelik et al 2018 millar et al 2018 sanchez bragado et al 2019 as well as woody plants west et al 2006 has been proposed as a tracing method to assess the depth of soil from which the water has been extracted in the case of plant nutrients like nitrogen besides reflecting its source the stable nitrogen isotope composition δ15n in dry matter broadly informs about the effect of water status on nitrogen metabolism araus et al 2013 yousfi et al 2009 2012 2013 zhang et al 2013 altogether these approaches can contribute to a more efficient phenotyping not only when supported by further simulation modelling condon 2020 but even to empirically define the ideotype most suited for a particular growing condition therefore the present study combines different phenotyping approaches aboveground and belowground to identify the ideotypic characteristics associated with a better genotypic performance in durum wheat under mediterranean growing conditions in spain that vary in water availability and temperature this range of conditions was achieved through winter planting under rainfed conditions and support irrigation and a late planting under support irrigation and evaluating these conditions during two consecutive years 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material field experiments and growth conditions field trials were located at the experimental station of colmenar de oreja aranjuez madrid 40 04 n 3 31 w 590 m a s l which belongs to the spanish instituto nacional de investigación y tecnología agraria y alimentaria inia and were undertaken during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 crop seasons trials were established in a complete block design with three replicates each plot consisted of seven rows planted 20 cm apart and a seed rate of 250 seeds m 2 representing an area of 7 1 5 m2 for each of the two crop seasons a normal winter planting under either rainfed conditions or support irrigation and a late planting under support irrigation were assessed hereafter trials will be referred to as inp for irrigated normal planting ilp for irrigated late planting and rnp for rainfed normal planting in each trial a set of 24 post green revolution commercial durum wheat triticum turgidum l subsp durum desf husn cultivars were grown from which six cultivars were selected with contrasting agronomic performance i e high versus low yield selection of these cultivars was according to yield data from the previous crop

physiological maturity for both seasons trials were machine harvested during the first half of july 2 2 leaf pigments the content of different leaf pigments per area basis was assessed at anthesis using a portable leaf clip sensor dualex force a orsay france which operates with a red reference beam at 650 nm and a uv light at 375 nm cerovic et al 2012 this sensor produces relative measures of chlorophyll a b flavonoid and anthocyanin contents and calculates the nitrogen balance index nbi which is the ratio of chlorophyll flavonoids related to the nitrogen and carbon allocation it is a nitrogen plant status indicator that is directly correlated with nitrogen mass content and therefore to the availability of n and it is less sensitive to the variations in leaf age and leaf thickness than the chlorophylls cerovic et al 2012 for each plot measurements were carried out on the adaxial side of flag leaves of five random plants selected from the central rows of each plot 2 3 canopy

through a multispectral agronomic index known as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this index based on the contrasting reflectance of the canopy within the visible and near infrared

late planting ilp and rainfed normal planting rnp compared to irrigated normal planting inp under warmer conditions of ilp harvest index hi thousand grain weight tgw grain number per ear gn ear density total grain nitrogen yield gny and plant height ph were decreased compared to the inp trial with a significantly shortened days to heading dth interval table 2 similarly under water limited conditions rnp hi tgw gn ear density gny and ph were lower compared to inp in addition ndvi was smaller under rnp than inp and even ilp genotypes exhibited significant differences in gy and all the other measured parameters included in the table table 2 trial by genotype interaction was significant for all the traits except for gy tgw and ndvi during the second season 2018 2019 gy and ear density in ilp were similar but hi and tgw were higher and ear density gny and ph were lower compared to inp the rest of the traits were not significantly different in contrast under rnp gy decreased threefold compared to the irrigated trials inp ilp hi gn ear density gny ph and ndvi were also lower in rnp than in the inp and ilp trials while tgw increased in rnp compared to the other two trials genotypic differences were significant for gy hi tgw gn ear density and gny table 2 the genotype by trial interaction was only significant for gy tgw and gny considering the trial crop season and genotype effects the three way anova revealed that all the traits gy hi tgw gn ear density gny ph and ndvi included in table 3 showed significant effects for the three factors data in brief table 3 interactions were also significant for most of the traits except ph and ndvi moreover values for all the traits except for ph and ndvi were higher in the first season than the second season table 2 3 2 effects of planting date water supply and season on stable isotope compositions nitrogen content and canopy temperature during the first season 2017 2018 grain nitrogen content ngrain and carbon isotope composition δ13cgrain were higher and grain nitrogen isotope composition δ15ngrain was lower in ilp compared with inp however the oxygen isotope composition of the shoot water δ18oshoot water exhibited similar values in ilp to inp under rnp canopy temperature ct δ13cgrain δ18oshoot water and ngrain were higher and δ15ngrain lower compared to inp genotype differences were shown in all measured traits except for ct where values were not available for the ilp trial table 3 the genotype by trial interaction was only significant for δ18oshoot water in the second season 2018 2019 ct and the nitrogen isotope composition of the leaf δ15nleaf were significantly lower in ilp than inp while the δ18oshoot water and the carbon isotope composition of the leaf δ13cleaf were significantly higher in ilp compared with inp in contrast under rnp conditions ct ngrain δ18oshoot water δ13cleaf and δ13cgrain were greater and the δ15nleaf and δ15ngrain lower than in the inp trial genotypes were not significantly different across all measured traits table 3 the genotype by trial interaction was only significant for δ15nleaf the three way anova season trial and genotype showed a significant trial effect for all the traits included in table 3 data in brief table 4 a genotype effect was also significant for all the traits except for ct while season had a significant effect for all the traits except ct and the δ15ngrain data in brief table 4 the interaction between season and trial was significant for all the traits while almost all the other interactions were absent except for the ilp trials the δ13cgrain was lower i e more negative in the first season than the second season in the case of δ18o and except for rnp values were higher less negative in the first season 3 3 effects of planting date water supply and season on leaf pigments the effect of trial was significant during the first season 2017 2018 for all leaf pigments whereas the genotypic effect was present for chlorophylls flavonoids and nbi the chlorophyll and flavonoid contents were higher in ilp than in inp while the anthocyanin content was lower in ilp than in inp and nbi was not significantly different however the flavonoid and anthocyanin values under rnp conditions were higher and chlorophylls and nbi lower than in inp table 4 there was no genotype by trial interaction for any of the traits included in the table in the second season 2018 2019 however significant effects of trials and genotypes were shown for flavonoids and nbi alone in fact no significant differences were shown between the ilp and inp trials for the measured traits while under rnp only the flavonoid content was higher than in the rest of trials table 4 no interaction between genotype and trial existed the three way anova trial genotype and season for the pigment traits included in table 4 exhibited significant year effects for all the traits data in brief table 4 trial and genotype effects were also significant for all the traits interactions were only significant for season by trial 3 4 effects of planting date water supply and season on root traits to investigate root characteristics the genotypic and trial effect and their interaction were analyzed in traits derived from the rgb images from the shovelomics study table 5 in the first season 2017 2018 trial and genotype effects were only significant for the root network surface nsurf root network volume nvol and specific root length srl in addition the effect of trials was also observed for root width root connected components ccomp maximum roots maxr and root network length nlen while a genotypic effect was shown for root network area nwa root ccomp maxr nlen nwa and nsurf traits were lower in the ilp than in the inp trial in contrast root width nvol and srl did not exhibit any differences between ilp and inp root width ccomp nlen nwa and nsurf were lower under rnp than in inp conditions oppositely maxr and srl were higher in the rnp than in the inp trial table 6 there was no interaction between trial and genotypes for any of the traits during the second season 2018 2019 the effect of trial was significant across all root traits except for root angle ra and the nwdr ratio while genotypic effects were significant for width ccomp medr ndepth srl and nwdr the interaction exhibited significant differences only for ccomp ndepth conva and srl ccomp ndepth nwa nsurf nvol network solidity and ldist were lower and maxr medr nwidth conva bush and srl were higher in the ilp than in the inp trial however all traits were lower in rnp than in the inp trial except for ccomp bush network solidity srl and ldist which showed no differences table 5 the three way anova trial genotype and season for root traits exhibited significant year and trial effects for almost all the traits data in brief table 5 while genotype effects were significant for less than half of the traits width ccomp ndepth nvol srl and nwdr the interaction between year and trial was significant for most traits except for medr nwa nsurf nvol and nwdr however the two way interaction between year and genotype was significant for nlen nwa nsurf nvol conva and ldist only and between trial and genotype was significant for ndepth and nwdr only whereas the three way interaction year trial and genotype was only significant for ccomp ndepth and ra 3 5 relationships between grain yield and agronomic physiological and root traits relationships between gy and yield components stable isotopes ct and leaf pigments in the three growing conditions combined and separated are presented in table 6 most traits exhibited significant correlations against gy when combining all trials within each crop season during the first season ear density gny and ph were positively correlated with gy within each growing condition inp ilp and rnp under irrigated conditions inp and ilp higher hi tgw and lower δ13cgrain and dth were correlated with an increased gy higher δ18oshoot water values correlated positively with gy under inp the ndvi and nbi correlated negatively and flavonoids positively with gy under ilp whereas under rnp the ndvi correlated positively with gy during the second crop season hi and gny correlated positively with gy within each of the three growing conditions in addition tgw ear density ph δ18oshoot water and flavonoid correlated positively and ngrain negatively with gy under inp gn correlated positively and nitrogen content nleaf and ngrain negatively with gy under ilp however under rnp the gn ph and ndvi correlated positively and the carbon isotope compositions δ13cleaf and δ13cgrain negatively with gy the correlations of root traits with gy were studied for each crop season and the three different growing conditions data in brief table 6 during the first season 2017 2018 positive correlations were exhibited only for a few traits ccomp nvol and network solidity and when combining all growing conditions therefore no correlations were found within any of the growing conditions in the second season 2018 2019 most root traits except medr nwidth ra and nwdr were correlated significantly with gy when combining all three growing conditions within each growing condition no correlations existed except for a positive correlation of ccomp with gy in the inp trial and a negative correlation of ndepth with gy under ilp data in brief table 6 principal component analysis pca was performed for each growing condition and season individually fig 3 for the six different environments tested the three growing conditions and the two seasons gy was placed opposite to δ13c and the δ15n of grains and more or less close to tgw and ear density dth which was only measured in the first season was also placed more or less opposite to gy in the three growing conditions except for the inp in the first season where ra was placed opposite to gy and very close to δ13c of grains in the other five trials it was placed rather perpendicular to gy slr was placed on the same side as gy in the inp and rnp trials of both seasons and in ilp of the second season regarding the ilp of the first season slr was placed opposite to gy but the eigenvector for slr was very short the δ18oshoot water was placed close to gy in the inp trials of both seasons whereas in the ilp trial it was placed clearly opposite to the gy in the first season and rather perpendicular to the gy in the second season in the case of the rnp trial δ18oshoot water was placed rather perpendicular to gy in the first season and opposite to gy in the second season ph was placed close to gy in the four normal planting trials inp and rnp of both seasons but it was perpendicular to the two late planting trials other traits such as flavonoids or the δ15n of the grains were placed either on the same side as opposite to or perpendicular to gy depending on the specific environmental conditions the set of traits used in the pca clearly separated the two categories of genotypes for the three growing conditions in the first year as well as for the inp in the second year while for ilp and rnp in the second year the separation was somewhat less evident pca was also undertaken per agronomic condition rnp inp and ilp which meant combining the two consecutive years for each agronomic condition and only considering the traits in common measured during the two years data in brief fig 1 under inp conditions higher gy was related to a higher δ18oshoot water together with a higher hi and tgw and more open i e higher ra as well as lower more negative δ13cgrains ph and flavonoid content whereas the other traits were less important or not associated under rnp conditions gy was positively related with δ18oshoot water nbi δ15ngrains srl and somehow hi and ra whereas δ18oshoot water δ13cgrains ct and flavonoids where the other traits were weakly or not related in the case of ilp gy was closely and positively associated with hi and negatively associated with δ13cgrains and to a lesser extent with ngrain and the biomass ndvi at anthesis 4 discussion 4 1 effect of growing conditions on grain yield agronomic components and physiological traits grain yield is defined as the product of biomass and harvest index and is determined by the agronomic yield components of ear density number of grains per ear and thousand grain weight donald and hamblin 1976 depending on the severity and timing of stress during the crop cycle all of the above agronomic traits may be affected to a greater or lesser degree garcia del moral et al 2003 giunta et al 1993 shpiler and blum 1990 in our study the reduction in all agronomic traits as in the case of rainfed versus irrigated conditions was in agreement with these reports furthermore interannual variability in environmental conditions was also evident with the second crop season 2018 2019 being drier than the first one 2017 2018 as a consequence of much lower rainfall and higher temperatures fig 2 as a result grain yield was lower in the second 2018 2019 compared to the first season 2017 2018 particularly under rainfed conditions rnp but also under support irrigation inp moreover during the first season the lower gy in the rnp compared with inp was associated with a major decrease in ear density as well as rather minor decreases in grain number per ear and tgw which were the two agronomic yield components determined later in the crop cycle table 2 however in the much drier conditions of the second season ear density and gn in particular which decreased by nearly 60 were strongly affected under rnp compared with inp while tgw was higher under rnp compared with inp probably due to the strong decrease in sink capacity caused by the reduction in the number of grains per ear chairi et al 2020 slafer et al 2005 increases in temperature also affected gy and its agronomic components negatively through a shorter crop duration including grain filling accelerated leaf senescence and eventually a poorer grain set garcia del moral et al 2003 royo et al 2000 in our study late planting during the first season affected tgw and grains per ear negatively compared with the normal planting under support irrigation however under the drier conditions of the second season the affected agronomic yield component was ear density which is determined before tgw and grains per ear such results are in agreement with previous studies reporting the negative effect of late planting on gy and yield components in wheat grown under mediterranean conditions joshi et al 2016 ma et al 2018 rezzouk et al 2020 moreover exposure to high temperatures around anthesis induces pollen sterility which reduces grain size and final yield in wheat wheeler et al 1996 while this may have been the case in the rnp trials late planting genotypes were grown under supplied irrigation and exhibited a canopy temperature below 30 c table 3 which negates any relevance for heat decreasing the number of grains per ear plant height reaches its maximum around anthesis provided that all genotypes have similar height in the absence of stress this trait may be considered an indicator on how drought or shorter growth period associated with warmer temperatures may affect growth blum and sullivan 1997 de vita et al 2007 thus the late planting trials exhibited smaller plants than the normal planting trial under support irrigation in accordance with a shorter crop duration however ilp produced taller plants than rnp presumably as a consequence of the better water status in the former due to the support irrigation table 2 here ph was positively associated with high gy across the normal planting trials of the two seasons regardless of whether they were under support irrigation or rainfed conditions table 6 but in the case of late planting ph only correlated during the first season canopy temperature and carbon isotope composition are physiological traits that are proposed as instantaneous ct and integrative δ13c indicators for assessing crop water status araus et al 2003 araus and cairns 2014 blum 2009 lopes and reynolds 2010 the negative relationships of gy with ct rezzouk et al 2020 thapa et al 2018 yousfi et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 and δ13c araus et al 2003 rezzouk et al 2020 whalley et al 2008 across trials table 6 support these traits as indicators of water regime during crucial phenological stages e g ct measured at anthesis and during the complete growth cycle e g δ13c in mature grains in fact a lower ct has been associated with higher transpiration blum 2009 while a more negative δ13c particularly in mature grains indicates that the water input received by the crop is greater araus et al 2003 and in fact it is usually the consequence of a higher stomatal conductance condon 2020 roche 2015 associated with a better water status in agreement with this the δ13c of grains was clearly more negative under support irrigation than under rainfed conditions in both seasons table 2 in addition under the drier conditions of the second season δ13c values of both inp and rnp were higher less negative and differences in the δ13c of grains between the support irrigation and the rainfed trials were also higher compared to the first season the ct at anthesis was also clearly higher under rainfed than support irrigation conditions particularly during the second season late planting trials even when exposed to warmer temperatures and therefore to higher water demand than the normal planting exhibited values of grain δ13c and ct much closer to inp than rnp due to the irrigation regime crop water status not only depends on the water inputs amount of irrigation and or precipitation and outputs evapotranspirative demand water uptake from the soil may also be involved in the differences in water status across trials in our study when the data from all trials were combined δ18oshoot water correlated positively with δ13c r 0 588 p 0 01 and ct r 0 639 p 0 01 δ18oshoot water has been proposed as indicator of how deep in the soil the roots extract water with lower δ18oshoot water values indicating greater depth of water extraction kale çelik et al 2018 millar et al 2018 sanchez bragado et al 2019 therefore the above correlations suggest that the greater the depth of water extraction from the soil lower δ18oshoot water the better the water status lower δ13c and ct of the plant on the other hand the negative relationships between gy and δ13c in mature grains within at least half of the six trials assayed the combination of the three growing conditions and the two seasons table 6 as well as the opposite placement of gy and δ13c in all six pcas fig 3 suggest that the best genotypes in all tested environments were these exhibiting better water status and thus higher stomatal conductance these results also support the fact that even when trials were conducted under good agronomic conditions provided through supplemental irrigation and a good rainy season and consequently rather high yields water may still limit productivity this was the case in the support irrigation normal planting during the first season which attained yields close to 7 mg ha 1 araus et al 2008 roche 2015 but even in the rainfed normal planting of the second season which was the driest of the six trials an average yield of 1 3 mg ha 1 there was a significant negative correlation between gy and δ13c these results are in line with the fact that the effective use of water blum 2009 makes the difference in terms of productivity under drought conditions araus et al 2008 roche 2015 root architecture is another criterion that has been widely emphasized in the literature regarding the crucial role that roots play in water and nutrient uptake loss and siddique 1994 rogers and benfey 2015 although information on a direct relationship between grain yield and root growth angle is scarce several studies have proven the contribution of deeper root growth in providing better water status and thus higher grain yield in wheat genotypes grown in water limited and or elevated temperature environments bai et al 2019 condon 2020 pinto and reynolds 2015 rogers and benfey 2015 in our study but only for the second season which was much drier root angle spread assessed through the conva parameter was higher in the two trials under support irrigation than in the rainfed trial table 5 a similar pattern but without reaching statistical significance was observed for the ra measured with a protractor fig 3 higher ra indicates a shallower root system probably associated with the irrigation regime imposed while in the case of rainfed conditions plants were more dependent on roots that explored deeper in the soil profile however in the case of the first season there was no clear pattern related to the different growing conditions concerning the late planting under support irrigation these conditions produced quite a different root system pattern compared to the normal planting depending on the crop season during the dry conditions of the second year plants of the ilp trial exhibited more superficial roots higher ccomp resulting in a wider root convex hull higher conva a wider root network width higher nwidth and thinner roots lower root width and higher srl when compared to the inp and the rnp trials table 5 however during the first season all these root traits exhibited an opposite pattern under ilp compared to the two normal planting trials in fact during the first season roots were thinner lower width and higher srl and root number ccomp was reduced in the rainfed trial rnp compared to the two trials under support irrigation the trend of thinner roots in response to water deficit agrees with reports for durum wheat under controlled lysimetric conditions elazab et al 2012 2016 and for bread wheat under field conditions peng et al 2019 however unlike the findings of these studies the srl during the second season of our study was higher and root width lower under ilp in comparison to both the severe water conditions of the rnp trial and also inp conditions table 5 these root traits may contribute to a more efficient uptake of water and nutrients under the high irrigation regime of the ilp during the second season where water and nutrients are already accessible in the upper soil layer it is worth mentioning than the ilp of the second season received a huge amount of irrigation fig 2 and exhibited a yield comparable to that of the irrigated trial in the normal planting these different patterns of response across seasons and irrespective of the agronomic growing conditions irrigation and planting time illustrate the strong plasticity of the root system in response to the water regime 4 2 phenology a keystone of mediterranean ideotypes phenology and particularly heading and anthesis dates plays a major role in the adaptation of cereals to mediterranean environments phenology has been progressively shortened through breeding for adaptation to mediterranean conditions loss and siddique 1994 de vita et al 2007 in addition an earlier anthesis usually contributes indirectly to an extended grain filling period van oosterom and acevedo 1992 araus et al 2002 in our study shorter dth measured during the first crop season 2017 2018 was correlated with increased gy in genotypes grown in the support irrigation trials inp and ilp of the two growing conditions table 5 and was further supported by the different placement of the two sets of genotypes in the pca biplots corresponding to the 2017 2018 season fig 3 however the future ability to exploit such phenotypic adjustment using varieties with shorter crop durations has limits araus et al 2002 chairi et al 2018 prieto et al 2020 therefore other ideotypic traits need to be identified in that sense the direct role of phenology was subsequently removed by assessing the pca within each agronomic condition with only the traits that were common across the two years thus excluding dth data in brief fig 1 in this case and for the three conditions a low δ13cgrain was a positive trait meaning that plants that maintained more open stomata were the most productive a better nitrogen assimilation capacity higher nbi under inp and rnp together with higher δ15ngrain under rnp and a lower accumulation of photoprotective pigments flavonoids in both the inp and rnp seem to be good ideotype indicators the importance of other traits changed depending on the agronomic conditions e g root traits or even shifted from positive to negative when compared between inp and rnp such as for δ18oshoot water in that particular case the results suggested that the capacity for water capture in the upper soil layers under irrigation conditions or deeper soil layers under rainfed are positive traits the specific traits associated with a better genotypic performance within each of the six growing conditions tested are discussed below 4 3 genotypic ideotypes under support irrigation and normal planting date under the relatively good growing conditions provided by normal planting under support irrigation inp the most productive genotypes exhibited better water status lower δ13cgrain more superficial water extracted higher δ18oshoot water enhanced growth higher ndvi and ph at anthesis and higher values in the agronomic yield components ear density and tgw and hi in addition to phenological adjustment through shorter days to heading fig 3 however compared to the first crop season 2017 2018 drought conditions were more evident during the second season 2018 2019 resulting in an increase in protective pigments flavonoids being associated with a better genotypic performance increases in protective pigments such as flavonoids and anthocyanins in response to drought stress are well documented in wheat ma et al 2014 naderi et al 2020 meanwhile ra was positioned opposite from gy during the first season fig 3 meaning that the best genotypes were those that maintained shallow roots while in the much drier conditions of the second season the trend changed with gy and ra placed perpendicular to each other while this suggests a lack of a clear role concerning ra during the second season these results may be also understood as the root system being shaped to not only extract shallow water but to also capturing water that percolates from the upper part of the soil profile via development of deeper roots elazab et al 2016 reported in a study with durum wheat grown under lysimetric conditions and a rain shelter that better genotypic performance under water deficit conditions was associated with an increase in srl assessed as the ratio of root length to dry biomass thus slr was positively correlated with shoot biomass across genotypes under moderate water stress but absent under full irrigation provided by maintaining container water capacity at 100 in our study even the support irrigation inp and ilp trials were exposed to some degree of water stress under field conditions which agrees with the fact that in five of the six pcas fig 3 the relationship between srl and gy was linear and negative meaning that thinner roots is a rather positive genotypic trait regardless of the growing conditions 4 4 genotypic performance under rainfed conditions under the moderate water limited conditions of the rainfed trial during the first crop season greater gy was achieved in genotypes exhibiting a better capacity for nitrogen assimilation higher nbi and δ15ngrain deeper water extraction lower δ18oshoot water better water status lower δ13c and ct thinner roots high srl deeper root growth lower ra phenotypical adjustment lower dth and higher flavonoid content fig 3 however during the severe water stress experienced during the second season the best genotypes besides exhibiting again a better water status lower δ13c showed no clear pattern in terms of root angle or the soil profile location of extracted water δ18oshoot water the nitrogen status nbi and δ15ngrain or the accumulation of flavonoids in any case for both years the best genotypes exhibited greater growth higher ph and biomass higher ndvi at anthesis together with higher yield components particularly higher tgw in the first crop season and higher grain number per ear in the second crop season our results agree with previous studies emphasizing the pivotal role of deep root development condon 2020 lopes and reynolds 2010 rogers and benfey 2015 wasaya et al 2018 but particularly under the moderate water stress conditions of the rainfed crop during the first season thus when grown under water limited conditions the most productive genotypes adjusted their root development into narrow root angle spreads low ra and conva for better access to water resources in deeper soil sections 4 5 genotype performance under elevated temperatures the most productive genotypes under ilp conditions were associated with better water status lower δ13c nevertheless the relative importance of agronomic yield components root characteristics and protection pigments varied depending on the crop season as did other factors such as green biomass fig 3 during the first season the best genotypes exhibited lower green biomass lower ndvi and higher flavonoid content at anthesis probably associated with a lower leaf biomass however they also demonstrated higher ear density and tgw along with extraction of more superficial water due to the higher δ18oshoot water while ra played no clear role during the second season the best genotypes exhibited more biomass at anthesis lower flavonoid content and larger grain number per ear but had lower ear density ra was positioned somewhat perpendicular to gy particularly in the first season fig 3 which did not support root angle at least measured with the shovelomics approach as a trait conferring genotypic adaptation however despite the fact that rra had no clear involvement the apparent extraction of deeper water lower more negative δ18oshoot water was placed on the same side as gy fig 3 in a study performed under conditions comparable to our late planting trial genotypes with cooler canopies were reported as having deep root development which was inferred from the higher root density in the 30 60 cm soil layer and resulted in better agronomic performance pinto and reynolds 2015 moreover it is possible that plants invest their resources into simultaneous development of shallow roots and deep roots to catch superficial moisture and moisture retained deep in the soil profile respectively as it has been proposed in a recent study on root traits contributing to higher yields in wheat bai et al 2019 4 6 conclusions increased water deficit and temperature remain major challenges for sustainable production of wheat under mediterranean conditions here we have studied the agronomic phenological and physiological characteristics associated with ideotypic performance of durum wheat genotypes under different mediterranean environment conditions a trait that was clearly associated with genotypic performance was phenological adaptation with genotypes that reached heading earlier being the best performers regardless of the growing conditions considered this was the case for all of the six different scenarios studied across which occurred a nearly seven fold difference in grain yield in addition physiological traits such as the carbon isotope composition δ13c of mature grains and to a lesser extent the oxygen isotope composition δ18o of the shoot water and the canopy temperature at anthesis were key traits for characterizing water status and crop adaptation to the different growing conditions including assessment of genotypic performance root angle and specific root length as assessed through the shovelomics approach may give some further insights particularly when characterizing the specific water regime imposed on the trials rainfall alone or combined with irrigation in any case our study proves that beyond some traits earlier reproductive stage lower grain δ13c associated with better genotypic performance under a wide range of mediterranean conditions other shoot and root traits are correlated with specific genotypic performance under a given growing condition fig 4 and specific season in this sense rainfed and even standard support irrigation conditions are strongly affected by annual variability in precipitation and temperature which makes it necessary to tailor the ideotype concept to the specific conditions of each environment referred to as the particular combination of agronomic conditions and season for this reason introducing versatile and efficient root phenotyping techniques may contribute towards a deeper understanding of ideotype requirements within each particular environment

9842,ideotypic characteristics of durum wheat associated with higher yield under different water and temperature regimes were studied under mediterranean conditions six semi dwarf cultivars with contrasting agronomic performance were grown during two consecutive years under winter planted rainfed and winter planted support irrigation conditions and a late planting trial under support irrigation at the inia station of colmenar de oreja madrid different traits were assessed to inform on water status root performance phenology photosynthetic capacity crop growth grain yield and agronomic yield components under support irrigation and normal planting genotypes with higher grain yield exhibited better water status lower δ13c and canopy temperature assimilation of more superficial water higher δ18o earlier heading and greater plant height and ear density under water limited conditions rainfed the best genotypes also exhibited better water status lower δ13c and earlier heading but higher specific root length with extraction of water from deeper soil layers lower δ18o more efficient n metabolism higher δ15n and nbi and consequently stronger growth plant height and ndvi and greater ear density and thousand grain weight under warmer conditions late planting the best genotypes also exhibited better water status lower δ13c and greater plant height and photoprotective mechanisms higher flavonoid content and lower chlorophyll content however the strong differences in drought between consecutive years determined other specific ideotypic traits within

importance and extent of cultivated area food and agriculture organization 2019a however durum wheat production is usually conditioned by climate factors particularly water availability and elevated temperatures araus et al 2003 loss and siddique 1994 sabella et al 2020 xynias et al 2020 zampieri et al 2020 to date breeding programs have been mostly focused on selecting genotypes based on grain yield along with traits that include phenology and tolerance to local or regional pests and diseases as a result declining genetic advance has been reported in different regions of the mediterranean basin chairi et al 2018 and particularly when cultivars are confronted with weather variability kahiluoto et al 2019 to deal with these circumstances farmers are more and more directed towards tactical management which relies on flexibility in sowing time and choice of cultivar hunt et al 2019 monitoring of crops to adjust fertilizer application basically nitrogen supply and control the impact of biotic stresses and wherever possible providing support irrigation food and agriculture organization 2019b mihailescu and soares 2020 the variability in growing conditions together with the trends presented by ongoing climate change call for the development and use of wheat cultivars that can adapt efficiently to the available water and withstand increased temperatures while maintaining a relatively high yield therefore there is a need for tailored breeding in terms of developing cultivars suitable to different growing conditions in the mediterranean integrating phenotyping approaches within breeding strategies can pave the way to create more productive and resilient cultivars that are well adapted to specific agro environments li et al 2018 increasing emphasis has been given to field crop phenotyping where different remote sensing approaches are deployed due to their high throughput and non invasive nature to assess crop growth potential photosynthetic capacity or even water status araus and cairns 2014 araus et al 2018 eventually the combination of remote sensing assessment with specific laboratory approaches such as stable carbon isotope signatures may improve the predictive capacity of the phenotyping process gracia romero et al 2019 kefauver et al 2017 rezzouk et al 2020 nevertheless a critical hurdle for phenotyping approaches is the limited access to the belowground part of the plant under field conditions root phenotyping may be key when seeking to improve productivity and stability under conditions like those present in mediterranean agro environments where water availability limits to a greater or lesser extent yield and its stability li et al 2019 maccaferri et al 2016 in fact under elevated temperatures and water deficit roots are reported to be more responsive in terms of growth than the aboveground parts of the plant which may subsequently affect water uptake plant growth and yield petr 1991 pinto and reynolds 2015 technologies developed for root phenotyping have been mainly applied to plants growing in containers under controlled conditions making the subsequent translation of results to the real i e field condition often difficult atkinson et al 2019 under field conditions the throughput of root phenotyping practices is still low to medium nevertheless even if it is not feasible to screen the progeny of large breeding panels these techniques may still serve to thoroughly characterize potential parents to inform strategic crosses and in general terms to define ideotypes for specific growing conditions maccaferri et al 2011 2016 root crown phenotyping commonly known as shovelomics is a phenotyping technique to directly assess root properties this technique was first developed for maize trachsel et al 2011 and further applied to other crops including wheat maccaferri et al 2016 york et al 2018b york et al 2018b the approach consists of exploring the upper 15 30 cm of the rhizosphere via manual digging and root excavation to assess the properties of the roots wasson et al 2020 york et al 2018a root angle among other root traits was reported to be useful for improving plant productivity under drought conditions and can contribute to breeding advances wasaya et al 2018 in barley for instance wild genotypes exhibited a more vertical angular spread that allowed them to obtain water from deeper levels therefore favouring survival bengough et al 2004 reynolds et al 2007 a similar trend was observed in wheat genotypes grown under rainfed conditions where deeper roots with higher root density at depth and lower root densities at the surface were related to higher grain yield passioura 1982 wasaya et al 2018 soil coring is another approach that aims to overcome some of the main limitations inherent to shovelomics enabling exploration of the root system at deeper soil levels wasson et al 2020 york et al 2018b however this approach is substantially lower in throughput and much more costly than shovelomics other potential approaches to phenotype root architecture and or functioning in the field were well documented such as electrical resistance tomography srayeddin and doussan 2009 the use of electromagnetic inductance whalley et al 2017 or ground penetrating radar liu et al 2016 2017 have been reported but again the levels of throughput cost and or precision are limitations given the difficult nature of their direct assessment root traits may be approached indirectly using above ground phenotyping as an alternative araus and cairns 2014 wasaya et al 2018 tracy et al 2020 for example a widely considered parameter that reflects the roots access to water resources is canopy temperature ct a study in wheat conducted under field conditions examined the phenotypic relationship between ct soil moisture and the root dry weight in different soil profiles and concluded that ct can serve as an indicator of a genotype s ability to maintain transpiration via the extraction of water from deeper soil profiles lopes and reynolds 2010 further in drought stressed environments and where water access is limited transpiration and the subsequent canopy cooling effect can be supported by deeper roots li et al 2019 lopes and reynolds 2010 enhanced photosynthesis due to an increase in stomatal conductance provision of better access to water resources and associated with genetic advance are well documented in wheat roche 2015 li et al 2019 stable isotope composition may also prove to be efficient for measuring root activities in an indirect manner under mediterranean conditions araus et al 2003 2013 as well as in arid conditions under irrigation lopes and reynolds 2010 higher yielding wheat genotypes were associated with low carbon isotope composition δ13c or high isotope discrimination from the surrounding co2 atmosphere δ13c by the maturing grains in fact the δ13c of plant tissues informs on the intercellular to atmospheric ratio of co2 ci ca within the plant farquhar et al 1989 with stomatal conductance usually being the main factor determining ci ca another approach for assessing root function is analysis of the stable water composition in plant water thus oxygen isotope composition δ18o when analysed in water from the base of the wheat stem kale çelik et al 2018 millar et al 2018 sanchez bragado et al 2019 as well as woody plants west et al 2006 has been proposed as a tracing method to assess the depth of soil from which the water has been extracted in the case of plant nutrients like nitrogen besides reflecting its source the stable nitrogen isotope composition δ15n in dry matter broadly informs about the effect of water status on nitrogen metabolism araus et al 2013 yousfi et al 2009 2012 2013 zhang et al 2013 altogether these approaches can contribute to a more efficient phenotyping not only when supported by further simulation modelling condon 2020 but even to empirically define the ideotype most suited for a particular growing condition therefore the present study combines different phenotyping approaches aboveground and belowground to identify the ideotypic characteristics associated with a better genotypic performance in durum wheat under mediterranean growing conditions in spain that vary in water availability and temperature this range of conditions was achieved through winter planting under rainfed conditions and support irrigation and a late planting under support irrigation and evaluating these conditions during two consecutive years 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material field experiments and growth conditions field trials were located at the experimental station of colmenar de oreja aranjuez madrid 40 04 n 3 31 w 590 m a s l which belongs

block design with three replicates each plot consisted of seven rows planted 20 cm apart and a seed rate of 250 seeds m 2 representing an area of 7 1 5 m2 for each of the two crop seasons a normal winter planting under either rainfed conditions or support irrigation and a late planting under support irrigation were assessed hereafter trials will be referred to as inp for irrigated normal planting ilp for irrigated late planting and rnp for rainfed normal planting in each trial a set of 24 post green revolution commercial durum wheat triticum turgidum l subsp durum desf husn cultivars were grown from which six cultivars were selected with contrasting agronomic performance i e high versus low yield selection of these cultivars was according to yield data from the previous crop season together with the two crop seasons included in this study which were evaluated at the inia station stated above as well as at a second inia station located in coria del rio seville under irrigated normal planting conditions data in brief table 1 information about the provenance of the six selected genotypes is presented in table 1 together with their comparative agronomic performance

physiological maturity for both seasons trials were machine harvested during the first half of july 2 2 leaf pigments the content of different leaf pigments per area basis was assessed at anthesis using a portable leaf clip sensor dualex force a orsay france which operates with a red reference beam at 650 nm and a uv light at 375 nm cerovic et al 2012 this sensor produces relative measures of chlorophyll a b flavonoid and anthocyanin contents and calculates the nitrogen balance index nbi which is the ratio of chlorophyll flavonoids related to the nitrogen and carbon allocation it is a nitrogen plant status indicator that is directly correlated with nitrogen mass content and therefore to the availability of n and it is less sensitive to the variations in leaf age and leaf thickness than the chlorophylls cerovic et al 2012 for each plot measurements were carried out on the adaxial side of flag leaves of five random plants selected from the central rows of each plot 2 3 canopy temperature canopy temperature ct was assessed using a portable infrared ir thermometer phototemptm mxstm td raytek california usa the ir sensor was placed at a distance of 80 cm from the canopy pointing the laser beam towards plant leaves with the sun towards the rear gracia romero et al 2019 2 4 normalized difference vegetation index the pattern of crop growth was estimated in real time through a multispectral agronomic index known as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this index based on the contrasting reflectance of the canopy within the visible and near infrared regions of the spectrum is used to assess agronomic traits related to the density of green in the canopy such as crop emergence vigour total biomass or the level of senescence stay green during the last part of the crop cycle ndvi measurements were performed using a greenseeker sensor trimble sunnyvale ca usa this portable spectroradiometer operates through an active optical sensor in the red 660 10 nm and near infrared nir 780 15 nm wavelengths crain et al 2012 ndvi values were obtained by skimming the active sensor perpendicularly across the canopy of each selected plot at a constant

captured zenithally at 60 cm above the roots alongside a scale reference then saved in tiff format for later analysis root angle ra was measured directly using a geometric protractor root rgb images were further analyzed using giaroots general image analysis of roots georgia tech research corporation and duke university usa which is an open source software for the automated analysis of root architecture galkovskyi et al 2012 image processing was carried out using the adaptive image thresholding processing option where around 200 images were computed per trial the measured traits and the corresponding definition have been detailed previously in galkovskyi et al 2012 briefly giaroot detects pixels of the thresholded root image to estimate different root traits including i crown root related parameters such as average root width width number of connected components ccomp and the maximum maxr and median medr number of roots ii root system dimensions such as root network depth ndepth root network length nlen and root network width nwidth iii root density through network area nwa network surface area nsurf and network volume nvol and iv root angle via network convex area

approximately 50 of ears had emerged plant height ph was determined at anthesis a ruler was placed zenithally in the central rows of each selected plot and values were taken by observing the whole canopy and averaging the distance from the ground to the overall tip of the ears excluding the awns at maturity ear density ears m 2 was determined by counting the ear density in a 1 m length of a

other measured parameters included in the table table 2 trial by genotype interaction was significant for all the traits except for gy tgw and ndvi during the second season 2018 2019 gy and ear density in ilp were similar but hi and tgw were higher and ear density gny and ph were lower compared to inp the rest of the traits were not significantly different in contrast under rnp gy decreased threefold compared to the irrigated trials inp ilp hi gn ear density gny ph and ndvi were also lower in rnp than in the inp and ilp trials while tgw increased in rnp compared to the other two trials genotypic differences were significant for gy hi tgw gn ear density and gny table 2 the genotype by trial interaction was only significant for gy tgw and gny considering the trial crop season and genotype effects the three way anova revealed that all the traits gy hi tgw gn ear density gny ph and ndvi included in table 3 showed significant effects for the three factors data in brief table 3 interactions were also significant for most of the traits except ph and ndvi moreover values for all the traits except for ph and ndvi were higher in the first season than the second season table 2 3 2 effects of planting date water supply and season on stable isotope compositions nitrogen content and canopy temperature during the first season 2017 2018 grain nitrogen content ngrain and carbon isotope composition δ13cgrain were higher and grain nitrogen isotope composition δ15ngrain was lower in ilp compared with inp however the oxygen isotope composition of the shoot water δ18oshoot water exhibited similar values in ilp to inp under rnp canopy temperature ct δ13cgrain δ18oshoot water and ngrain were higher and δ15ngrain lower compared to inp genotype differences were shown in all measured traits except for ct where values were not available for the ilp trial table 3 the genotype by trial interaction was only significant for δ18oshoot water in the second season 2018 2019 ct and the nitrogen isotope composition of the leaf δ15nleaf were significantly lower in ilp than inp while the δ18oshoot water and the carbon isotope composition of the leaf δ13cleaf were significantly higher in ilp compared with inp in contrast under rnp conditions ct ngrain δ18oshoot water δ13cleaf and δ13cgrain were greater and the δ15nleaf and δ15ngrain lower than in the inp trial genotypes were not significantly different across all measured traits table 3 the genotype by trial interaction was only significant for δ15nleaf the three way anova season trial and genotype showed a significant trial effect for all the traits included in table 3 data in brief table 4 a genotype effect was also significant for all the traits except for ct while season had a significant effect for all the traits except ct and the δ15ngrain data in brief table 4 the interaction between season and trial was significant for all the traits while almost all the other interactions were absent except for the ilp trials the δ13cgrain was lower i e more negative in the first season than the second season in the case of δ18o and except for rnp values were higher less negative in the first season 3 3 effects of planting date water supply and season on leaf pigments the effect of trial was significant during the first season 2017 2018 for all leaf pigments whereas the genotypic effect was present for chlorophylls flavonoids and nbi the chlorophyll and flavonoid contents were higher in ilp than in inp while the anthocyanin content was lower in ilp than in inp and nbi was not significantly different however the flavonoid and anthocyanin values under rnp conditions were higher and chlorophylls and nbi lower than in inp table 4 there was no genotype by trial interaction for any of the traits included in the table in the second season 2018 2019 however significant effects of trials and genotypes were shown for flavonoids and nbi alone in fact no significant differences were shown between the ilp and inp trials for the measured traits while under rnp only the flavonoid content was higher than in the rest of trials table 4 no interaction between genotype and trial existed the three way anova trial genotype and season for the pigment traits included in table 4 exhibited significant year effects for all the traits data in brief table 4 trial and genotype effects were also significant for all the traits interactions were only significant for season by trial 3 4 effects of planting date water supply and season on root traits to investigate root characteristics the genotypic and trial effect and their interaction were analyzed in traits derived from the rgb images from the shovelomics study table 5 in the first season 2017 2018 trial and genotype effects were only significant for the root network surface nsurf root network volume nvol and specific root length srl in addition the effect of trials was also observed for root width root connected components ccomp maximum roots maxr and root network length nlen while a genotypic effect was shown for root network area nwa root ccomp maxr nlen nwa and nsurf traits were lower in the ilp than in the inp trial in contrast root width nvol and srl did not exhibit any differences between ilp and inp root width ccomp nlen nwa and nsurf were lower under rnp than in inp conditions oppositely maxr and srl were higher in the rnp than in the inp trial table 6 there was no interaction between trial and genotypes for any of the traits during the second season 2018 2019 the effect of trial was significant across all root traits except for root angle ra and the nwdr ratio while genotypic effects were significant for width ccomp medr ndepth srl and nwdr the interaction exhibited significant differences only for ccomp ndepth conva and srl ccomp ndepth nwa nsurf nvol network solidity and ldist were lower and maxr medr nwidth conva bush and srl were higher in the ilp than in the inp trial however all traits were lower in rnp than in the inp trial except for ccomp bush network solidity srl and ldist which showed no differences table 5 the three way anova trial genotype and season for root traits exhibited significant year and trial effects for almost all the traits data in brief table 5 while genotype effects were significant for less than half of the traits width ccomp ndepth nvol srl and nwdr the interaction between year and trial was significant for most traits except for medr nwa nsurf nvol and nwdr however the two way interaction between year and genotype was significant for nlen nwa nsurf nvol conva and ldist only and between trial and genotype was significant for ndepth and nwdr only whereas the three way interaction year trial and genotype was only significant for ccomp ndepth and ra 3 5 relationships between grain yield and agronomic physiological and root traits relationships between gy and yield components stable isotopes ct and leaf pigments in the three growing conditions combined and separated are presented in table 6 most traits exhibited significant correlations against gy when combining all trials within each crop season during the first season ear density gny and ph were positively correlated with gy within each growing condition inp ilp and rnp under irrigated conditions inp and ilp higher hi tgw and lower δ13cgrain and dth were correlated with an increased gy higher δ18oshoot water values correlated positively with gy under inp the ndvi and nbi correlated negatively and flavonoids positively with gy under ilp whereas under rnp the ndvi correlated positively with gy during the second crop season hi and gny correlated positively with gy within each of the three growing conditions in addition tgw ear density ph δ18oshoot water and flavonoid correlated positively and ngrain negatively with gy under inp gn correlated positively and nitrogen content nleaf and ngrain negatively with gy under ilp however under rnp the gn ph and ndvi correlated positively and the carbon isotope compositions δ13cleaf and δ13cgrain negatively with gy the correlations of root traits with gy were studied for each crop season and the three different growing conditions data in brief table 6 during the first season 2017 2018 positive correlations were exhibited only for a few traits ccomp nvol and network solidity and when combining all growing conditions therefore no correlations were found within any of the growing conditions in the second season 2018 2019 most root traits except medr nwidth ra and nwdr were correlated significantly with gy when combining all three growing conditions within each growing condition no correlations existed except for a positive correlation of ccomp with gy in the inp trial and a negative correlation of ndepth with gy under ilp data in brief table 6 principal component analysis pca was performed for each growing condition and season individually fig 3 for the six different environments tested the three growing conditions and the two seasons gy was placed opposite to δ13c and the δ15n of grains and more or less close to tgw and ear density dth which was only measured in the first season was also placed more or less opposite to gy in the three growing conditions except for the inp in the first season where ra was placed opposite to gy and very close to δ13c of grains in the other five trials it was placed rather perpendicular to gy slr was placed on the same side as gy in the inp and rnp trials of both seasons and in ilp of the second season regarding the ilp of the first season slr was placed opposite to gy but the eigenvector for slr was very short the δ18oshoot water was placed close to gy in the inp trials of both seasons whereas in the ilp trial it was placed clearly opposite to the gy in the first season and rather perpendicular to the gy in the second season in the case of the rnp trial δ18oshoot water was placed rather perpendicular to gy in the first season and opposite to gy in the second season ph was placed close to gy in the four normal planting trials inp and rnp of both seasons but it was perpendicular to the two late planting trials other traits such as flavonoids or the δ15n of the grains were placed either on the same side as opposite to or perpendicular to gy depending on the specific environmental conditions the set of traits used in the pca clearly separated the two categories of genotypes for the three growing conditions in the first year as well as for the inp in the second year while for ilp and rnp in the second year the separation was somewhat less evident pca was also undertaken per agronomic condition rnp inp and ilp which meant combining the two consecutive years for each agronomic condition and only considering the traits in common measured during the two years data in brief fig 1 under inp conditions higher gy was related to a higher δ18oshoot water together with a higher hi and tgw and more open i e higher ra as well as lower more negative δ13cgrains ph and flavonoid content whereas the other traits were less important or not associated under rnp conditions gy was positively related with δ18oshoot water nbi δ15ngrains srl and somehow hi and ra whereas δ18oshoot water δ13cgrains ct and flavonoids where the other traits were weakly or not related in the case of ilp gy was closely and positively associated with hi and negatively associated with δ13cgrains and to a lesser extent with ngrain and the biomass ndvi at anthesis 4 discussion 4 1 effect of growing conditions on grain yield agronomic components and physiological traits grain yield is defined as the product of biomass and harvest index and is determined by the agronomic yield components of ear density number of grains per ear and thousand grain weight donald and hamblin 1976 depending on the severity and timing of stress during the crop cycle all of the above agronomic traits may be affected to a greater or lesser degree garcia del moral et al 2003 giunta et al 1993 shpiler and blum 1990 in our study the reduction in all agronomic traits as in the case of rainfed versus irrigated conditions was in agreement with these reports furthermore interannual variability in environmental conditions was also evident with the second crop season 2018 2019 being drier than the first one 2017 2018 as a consequence of much lower rainfall and higher temperatures fig 2 as a result grain yield was lower in the second 2018 2019 compared to the first season 2017 2018 particularly under rainfed conditions rnp but also under support irrigation inp moreover during the first season the lower gy in the rnp compared with inp was associated with a major decrease in ear density as well as rather minor decreases in grain number per ear and tgw which were the two agronomic yield components determined later in the crop cycle table 2 however in the much drier conditions of the second season ear density and gn in particular which decreased by nearly 60 were strongly affected under rnp compared with inp while tgw was higher under rnp compared with inp probably due to the strong decrease in sink capacity caused by the reduction in the number of grains per ear chairi et al 2020 slafer et al 2005 increases in temperature also affected gy and its agronomic components negatively through a shorter crop duration including grain filling accelerated leaf senescence and eventually a poorer grain set garcia del moral et al 2003 royo et al 2000 in our study late planting during the first season affected tgw and grains per ear negatively compared with the normal planting under support irrigation however under the drier conditions of the second season the affected agronomic yield component was ear density which is determined before tgw and grains per ear such results are in agreement with previous studies reporting the negative effect of late planting on gy and yield components in wheat grown under mediterranean conditions joshi et al 2016 ma et al 2018 rezzouk et al 2020 moreover exposure to high temperatures around anthesis induces pollen sterility which reduces grain size and final yield in wheat wheeler et al 1996 while this may have been the case in the rnp trials late planting genotypes were grown under supplied irrigation and exhibited a canopy temperature below 30 c table 3 which negates any relevance for heat decreasing the number of grains per ear plant height reaches its maximum around anthesis provided that all genotypes have similar height in the absence of stress this trait may be considered an indicator on how drought or shorter growth period associated with warmer temperatures may affect growth blum and sullivan 1997 de vita et al 2007 thus the late planting trials exhibited smaller plants than the normal planting trial under support irrigation in accordance with a shorter crop duration however ilp produced taller plants than rnp presumably as a consequence of the better water status in the former due to the support irrigation table 2 here ph was positively associated with high gy across the normal planting trials of the two seasons regardless of whether they were under support irrigation or rainfed conditions table 6 but in the case of late planting ph only correlated during the first season canopy temperature and carbon isotope composition are physiological traits that are proposed as instantaneous ct and integrative δ13c indicators for assessing crop water status araus et al 2003 araus and cairns 2014 blum 2009 lopes and reynolds 2010 the negative relationships of gy with ct rezzouk et al 2020 thapa et al 2018 yousfi et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 and δ13c araus et al 2003 rezzouk et al 2020 whalley et al 2008 across trials table 6 support these traits as indicators of water regime during crucial phenological stages e g ct measured at anthesis and during the complete growth cycle e g δ13c in mature grains in fact a lower ct has been associated with higher transpiration blum 2009 while a more negative δ13c particularly in mature grains indicates that the water input received by the crop is greater araus et al 2003 and in fact it is usually the consequence of a higher stomatal conductance condon 2020 roche 2015 associated with a better water status in agreement with this the δ13c of grains was clearly more negative under support irrigation than under rainfed conditions in both seasons table 2 in addition under the drier conditions of the second season δ13c values of both inp and rnp were higher less negative and differences in the δ13c of grains between the support irrigation and the rainfed trials were also higher compared to the first season the ct at anthesis was also clearly higher under rainfed than support irrigation conditions particularly during the second season late planting trials even when exposed to warmer temperatures and therefore to higher water demand than the normal planting exhibited values of grain δ13c and ct much closer to inp than rnp due to the irrigation regime crop water status not only depends on the water inputs amount of irrigation and or precipitation and outputs evapotranspirative demand water uptake from the soil may also be involved in the differences in water status across trials in our study when the data from all trials were combined δ18oshoot water correlated positively with δ13c r 0 588 p 0 01 and ct r 0 639 p 0 01 δ18oshoot water has been proposed as indicator of how deep in the soil the roots extract water with lower δ18oshoot water values indicating greater depth of water extraction kale çelik et al 2018 millar et al 2018 sanchez bragado et al 2019 therefore the above correlations suggest that the greater the depth of water extraction from the soil lower δ18oshoot water the better the water status lower δ13c and ct of the plant on the other hand the negative relationships between gy and δ13c in mature grains within at least half of the six trials assayed the combination of the three growing conditions and the two seasons table 6 as well as the opposite placement of gy and δ13c in all six pcas fig 3 suggest that the best genotypes in all tested environments were these exhibiting better water status and thus higher stomatal conductance these results also support the fact that even when trials were conducted under good agronomic conditions provided through supplemental irrigation and a good rainy season and consequently rather high yields water may still limit productivity this was the case in the support irrigation normal planting during the first season which attained yields close to 7 mg ha 1 araus et al 2008 roche 2015 but even in the rainfed normal planting of the second season which was the driest of the six trials an average yield of 1 3 mg ha 1 there was a significant negative correlation between gy and δ13c these results are in line with the fact that the effective use of water blum 2009 makes the difference in terms of productivity under drought conditions araus et al 2008 roche 2015 root architecture is another criterion that has been widely emphasized in the literature regarding the crucial role that roots play in water and nutrient uptake loss and siddique 1994 rogers and benfey 2015 although information on a direct relationship between grain yield and root growth angle is scarce several studies have proven the contribution of deeper root growth in providing better water status and thus higher grain yield in wheat genotypes grown in water limited and or elevated temperature environments bai et al 2019 condon 2020 pinto and reynolds 2015 rogers and benfey 2015 in our study but only for the second season which was much drier root angle spread assessed through the conva parameter was higher in the two trials under support irrigation than in the rainfed trial table 5 a similar pattern but without reaching statistical significance was observed for the ra measured with a protractor fig 3 higher ra indicates a shallower root system probably associated with the irrigation regime imposed while in the case of rainfed conditions plants were more dependent on roots that explored deeper in the soil profile however in the case of the first season there was no clear pattern related to the different growing conditions concerning the late planting under support irrigation these conditions produced quite a different root system pattern compared to the normal planting depending on the crop season during the dry conditions of the second year plants of the ilp trial exhibited more superficial roots higher ccomp resulting in a wider root convex hull higher conva a wider root network width higher nwidth and thinner roots lower root width and higher srl when compared to the inp and the rnp trials table 5 however during the first season all these root traits exhibited an opposite pattern under ilp compared to the two normal planting trials in fact during the first season roots were thinner lower width and higher srl and root number ccomp was reduced in the rainfed trial rnp compared to the two trials under support irrigation the trend of thinner roots in response to water deficit agrees with reports for durum wheat under controlled lysimetric conditions elazab et al 2012 2016 and for bread wheat under field conditions peng et al 2019 however unlike the findings of these studies the srl during the second season of our study was higher and root width lower under ilp in comparison to both the severe water conditions of the rnp trial and also inp conditions table 5 these root traits may contribute to a more efficient uptake of water and nutrients under the high irrigation regime of the ilp during the second season where water and nutrients are already accessible in the upper soil layer it is worth mentioning than the ilp of the second season received a huge amount of irrigation fig 2 and exhibited a yield comparable to that of the irrigated trial in the normal planting these different patterns of response across seasons and irrespective of the agronomic growing conditions irrigation and planting time illustrate the strong plasticity of the root system in response to the water regime 4 2 phenology a keystone of mediterranean ideotypes phenology and particularly heading and anthesis dates plays a major role in the adaptation of cereals to mediterranean environments phenology has been progressively shortened through breeding for adaptation to mediterranean conditions loss and siddique 1994 de vita et al 2007 in addition an earlier anthesis usually contributes indirectly to an extended grain filling period van oosterom and acevedo 1992 araus et al 2002 in our study shorter dth measured during the first crop season 2017 2018 was correlated with increased gy in genotypes grown in the support irrigation trials inp and ilp of the two growing conditions table 5 and was further supported by the different placement of the two sets of genotypes in the pca biplots corresponding to the 2017 2018 season fig 3 however the future ability to exploit such phenotypic adjustment using varieties with shorter crop durations has limits araus et al 2002 chairi et al 2018 prieto et al 2020 therefore other ideotypic traits need to be identified in that sense the direct role of phenology was subsequently removed by assessing the pca within each agronomic condition with only the traits that were common across the two years thus excluding dth data in brief fig 1 in this case and for the three conditions a low δ13cgrain was a positive trait meaning that plants that maintained more open stomata were the most productive a better nitrogen assimilation capacity higher nbi under inp and rnp together with higher δ15ngrain under rnp and a lower accumulation of photoprotective pigments flavonoids in both the inp and rnp seem to be good ideotype indicators the importance of other traits changed depending on the agronomic conditions e g root traits or even shifted from positive to negative when compared between inp and rnp such as for δ18oshoot water in that particular case the results suggested that the capacity for water capture in the upper soil layers under irrigation conditions or deeper soil layers under rainfed are positive traits the specific traits associated with a better genotypic performance within each of the six growing conditions tested are discussed below 4 3 genotypic ideotypes under support irrigation and normal planting date under the relatively good growing conditions provided by normal planting under support irrigation inp the most productive genotypes exhibited better water status lower δ13cgrain more superficial water extracted higher δ18oshoot water enhanced growth higher ndvi and ph at anthesis and higher values in the agronomic yield components ear density and tgw and hi in addition to phenological adjustment through shorter days to heading fig 3 however compared to the first crop season 2017 2018 drought conditions were more evident during the second season 2018 2019 resulting in an increase in protective pigments flavonoids being associated with a better genotypic performance increases in protective pigments such as flavonoids and anthocyanins in response to drought stress are well documented in wheat ma et al 2014 naderi et al 2020 meanwhile ra was positioned opposite from gy during the first season fig 3 meaning that the best genotypes were those that maintained shallow roots while in the much drier conditions of the second season the trend changed with gy and ra placed perpendicular to each other while this suggests a lack of a clear role concerning ra during the second season these results may be also understood as the root system being shaped to not only extract shallow water but to also capturing water that percolates from the upper part of the soil profile via development of deeper roots elazab et al 2016 reported in a study with durum wheat grown under lysimetric conditions and a rain shelter that better genotypic performance under water deficit conditions was associated with an increase in srl assessed as the ratio of root length to dry biomass thus slr was positively correlated with shoot biomass across genotypes under moderate water stress but absent under full irrigation provided by maintaining container water capacity at 100 in our study even the support irrigation inp and ilp trials were exposed to some degree of water stress under field conditions which agrees with the fact that in five of the six pcas fig 3 the relationship between srl and gy was linear and negative meaning that thinner roots is a rather positive genotypic trait regardless of the growing conditions 4 4 genotypic performance under rainfed conditions under the moderate water limited conditions of the rainfed trial during the first crop season greater gy was achieved in genotypes exhibiting a better capacity for nitrogen assimilation higher nbi and δ15ngrain deeper water extraction lower δ18oshoot water better water status lower δ13c and ct thinner roots high srl deeper root growth lower ra phenotypical adjustment lower dth and higher flavonoid content fig 3 however during the severe water stress experienced during the second season the best genotypes besides exhibiting again a better water status lower δ13c showed no clear pattern in terms of root angle or the soil profile location of extracted water δ18oshoot water the nitrogen status nbi and δ15ngrain or the accumulation of flavonoids in any case for both years the best genotypes exhibited greater growth higher ph and biomass higher ndvi at anthesis together with higher yield components particularly higher tgw in the first crop season and higher grain number per ear in the second crop season our results agree with previous studies emphasizing the pivotal role of deep root development condon 2020 lopes and reynolds 2010 rogers and benfey 2015 wasaya et al 2018 but particularly under the moderate water stress conditions of the rainfed crop during the first season thus when grown under water limited conditions the most productive genotypes adjusted their root development into narrow root angle spreads low ra and conva for better access to water resources in deeper soil sections 4 5 genotype performance under elevated temperatures the most productive genotypes under ilp conditions were associated with better water status lower δ13c nevertheless the relative importance of agronomic yield components root characteristics and protection pigments varied depending on the crop season as did other factors such as green biomass fig 3 during the first season the best genotypes exhibited lower green biomass lower ndvi and higher flavonoid content at anthesis probably associated with a lower leaf biomass however they also demonstrated higher ear density and tgw along with extraction of more superficial water due to the higher δ18oshoot water while ra played no clear role during the second season the best genotypes exhibited more biomass at anthesis lower flavonoid content and larger grain number per ear but had lower ear density ra was positioned somewhat perpendicular to gy particularly in the first season fig 3 which did not support root angle at least measured with the shovelomics approach as a trait conferring genotypic adaptation however despite the fact that rra had no clear involvement the apparent extraction of deeper water lower more negative δ18oshoot water was placed on the same side as gy fig 3 in a study performed under conditions comparable to our late planting trial genotypes with cooler canopies were reported as having deep root development which was inferred from the higher root density in the 30 60 cm soil layer and resulted in better agronomic performance pinto and reynolds 2015 moreover it is possible that plants invest their resources into simultaneous development of shallow roots and deep roots to catch superficial moisture and moisture retained deep in the soil profile respectively as it has been proposed in a recent study on root traits contributing to higher yields in wheat bai et al 2019 4 6 conclusions increased water deficit and temperature remain major challenges for sustainable production of wheat under mediterranean conditions here we have studied the agronomic phenological and physiological characteristics associated with ideotypic performance of durum wheat genotypes under different mediterranean environment conditions a trait that was clearly associated with genotypic performance was phenological adaptation with genotypes that reached heading earlier being the best performers regardless of the growing conditions considered this was the case for all of the six different scenarios studied across which occurred a nearly seven fold difference in grain yield in addition physiological traits such as the carbon isotope composition δ13c of mature grains and to a lesser extent the oxygen isotope composition δ18o of the shoot water and the canopy temperature at anthesis were key traits for characterizing water status and crop adaptation to the different growing conditions including assessment of genotypic performance root angle and specific root length as assessed through the shovelomics approach may give some further insights particularly when characterizing the specific water regime imposed on the trials rainfall alone or combined with irrigation in any case our study proves that beyond some traits earlier reproductive stage lower grain δ13c associated with better genotypic performance under a wide range of mediterranean conditions other shoot and root traits are correlated with specific genotypic performance under a given growing condition fig 4 and specific season in this sense rainfed and even standard support irrigation conditions are strongly affected by annual variability in precipitation and temperature which makes it necessary to tailor the ideotype concept to the specific conditions of each environment referred to as the particular combination of agronomic conditions and season for this reason introducing versatile and efficient root phenotyping techniques may contribute towards a deeper understanding of ideotype requirements within each particular environment

9843,the north china plain is the main producing area of winter wheat in china due to the relatively poor condition of water resources the competition of water between industry and agriculture is fierce the increasing shortage of water resources has led to serious overexploitation of groundwater in some areas agricultural development is faced with severe challenges in order to ensure regional food security and sustainable winter wheat planting 52 cities of north china plain ncp in the following of the paper use the shorted name ncp were taken as research units to analyze the matching characteristics of agricultural water and land resources so as to reveal the direction of irrigated agriculture development and winter wheat suitable planting layout considering their balance in future the paper firstly analyzed the cultivated area determined by water resource and irrigation development by agricultural available water and then pointed out the direction of water suited planting layout of winter wheat the results showed that 1 the gini coefficient showed an increasing trend which indicated that the area of cultivated land and irrigation area supported by water resources have nearly reached the upper limit the large scale extension of both cultivated and irrigation area is impossible under the restriction of water 2 the amount of agricultural available water resources per unit of effective irrigation area and the effective precipitation increased gradually from north to south in the ncp but the spatial distribution of water requirement of winter wheat in its growth period changed in the opposite way this indicated the poor spatiotemporal match between winter wheat planting and water resources leading to the cost of spending more water to maintain wheat production 3 the further development of irrigation and the water suited planting of winter wheat should pay attention to the southern part of the plain with rich water such as southern henan province jiangsu province anhui province etc to ensure the regional agricultural development that is of great significance to the regional sustainable development water shortage alleviation and national grain safety keywords north china plain water resources cultivated land area winter wheat development layout water suited planting 1 introduction the two rigid constraints affecting agricultural development are water resources and land resources namely agricultural land and water resources shortages of either land resources or water will hind the development of agriculture especially crop planting in reality due to the dislocation distribution of global water and land resources it is more prominent for the constraint of water shortage on regional agricultural development according to the fao report 2020 food and agriculture condition most of 60 irrigation area face with the severe shortage of water fao 2020 e g northwest china huang et al 2012 yu et al 2017 africa nyam et al 2021 middle east wehbe and temimi 2021 central australia hornbuckle et al 2005 western america gleick 2010 to ensure grain product as much as possible at present about 41 of the global irrigation water amount comes from these water originally used for ecology system fao 2020 therefore the balanced utilization of agricultural water and land resources is particularly important for sustainable development of agriculture and its region valipour et al 2015 china an agricultural country is 7 of the world s arable land area accounting for about 130 million hectares feeds 22 of the world s population under the background situation of serious mismatch of spatial distribution between water and land resources the huaihe river basin and the areas to the north of china account for 63 15 of china s land area but only 19 of china s water resources irrigation plays an important role however the dislocation of spatial distribution of water and land resources is aggravated coupled with the impact of climate change and high intensity human activities ren et al 2008 zhou 2017 and the increasingly intension of water shortage these changes become more prominent to the rigid restraint of agricultural development it has become the focus of regional agricultural sustainable development based on the water resources rigid constrain and the land water resources balanced utilization therefore lots of studies on the matching development of agricultural water and land resources have emerged du et al 2019 li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2014 at present most of the researches take regional cultivated land or available land and runoff water resources as the research objects under specific period condition of the static evaluation of natural background condition of water and land resources chen et al 2019 dong et al 2018 ren et al 2008 sun et al 2018 wu and bao 2003 these not only fail to reflect the direct influence of planting structure including the water requirement under different planting structure and its effective precipitation in the utilization of agricultural water and land resources but also fail to reveal the influence of water resources evolution and agricultural development process on the balanced development of water and land resources the ncp is the main production area of winter wheat and one of economically developed areas in china at same time it is also one of typical irrigation areas chen et al 2010 for agricultural development due to the poor natural water resources condition and seriously misallocation of it and cultivated land because of the existence of the long term unreasonable utilization of water resources the development and utilization ratio of the water resources have exceeded the international warning line and the groundwater has been seriously overexploited which has caused the largest underground water funnel area in the world liu et al 2001 shi et al 2011 reducing winter wheat as high water consumption crops planting area has become one of the main measures to alleviate the groundwater overexploited sun et al 2011 yu et al 2020 and the overdraft of underground water has been effectively alleviated by the implement of the relevant measures including a variety of water saving irrigation technology winter wheat acreage controlling and so on wang et al 2018 however it will be threatened to the dominant planting structure with winter wheat and the responding grain capacity in the cnp if the measure to reducing winter wheat area is implemented for a long time as a major food crop winter wheat plays an important role in food security and has ecology function in the ncp it will be vital important to reasonable control the development of irrigated area and winter wheat planting layout under the constraint of water resources for the regional sustainable development and the dominant position of winter wheat consequently to reveal the reasonable development of irrigation and winter wheat in the ncp based on the concept of the water land matching development the paper studied the match characteristic between the water resources and cultivated area the effective irrigation area and agricultural water utilization and the available water resources used by winter wheat in it growth stage the paper is structured into 5 sections section 1 is the introduction section 2 presents outline of the study area section 3 presents the methods and data section 4 presents an analysis of the change of match characteristic about the water resources and cultivated area the effective irrigation area and agricultural water utilization and the direction of the irrigation area and winter wheat water suited planting in the ncp and section 5 discusses the results and draws a conclusion 2 overview of the study area 2 1 location the ncp located at 32 40 n 114 121 e spans haihe river basin yellow river basin and huaihe river basin including 54 prefecture level cities in 7 provinces cities of beijing tianjin hebei shandong henan anhui and jiangsu from north to south it covers a total land area of 494 000 km2 fig 1 2 2 water resources conditions the amount of precipitation and water resources in the ncp are relatively small and appear increasing trend from north to south in spatial distribution fig 2 according to water resources bulletin data the amount of the annual average water resources in whole region in period of 2001 2017 were 103 753 billion m3 75 4 of the water resources are distributed in the huaihe river basin in the south of north china plain covering 20 cities including 6 cities in anhui province 5 cities in jiangsu province and 9 cities in southeastern henan province 20 9 of the water resources are distributed in haihe river basin in the north of the ncp covering 18 cities including 9 cities in hebei province 3 cities in northern shandong province 4 cities in henan province beijing and tianjin the narrow and long yellow river basin lying in middle of the ncp only accounts for less than 5 the detail was shown in table 1 under the influence of global climate change and human activities the precipitation gap between the north and south had further increased in recent years fig 3 2 3 condition of the water resources development and utilization water resources are in serious shortage due to the unbalanced development of regional economy and water resources distribution according to the average amount of water resources in 2001 2017 and the water use amount in 2017 shown in table 2 the development and utilization rate of water resources in the ncp reached 85 9 especially the haihe river basin in the north reached 135 which seriously affected the sustainable development of the region agriculture as a major water user is facing rigid water resources constraints it is an inevitable choice for alleviating regional agricultural water shortage and sustainable agricultural development to determine irrigation and planting area based on water to realize the matching development of cultivated land and water resources since the agricultural planting area in beijing and tianjin is relatively small the other 52 prefectural cities in the ncp with large agricultural distribution area are selected as typical research units 3 research methods and data sources 3 1 research methods 3 1 1 the gini coefficient the gini coefficient proposed by the italian scientist corrado gini in 1921 was initially used to measure the balance of income distribution among residents the method li et al 2016 was introduced into the study on the matching of water and land resources by wu a chinese scholar in 2003 wu and bao 2003 it has become an important indicator to quantitatively measure the spatial matching degree of water and land resources in the region in this paper the relationship between income and population is replaced by cultivated area and total water resources and the gini coefficient is extended to study the matching degree of water and soil resources it can be calculated as 1 gn a a b where gn is the gini coefficient a is the area enclosed by the 45 degree line and the fitted gini curve b is the area enclosed by the fitted curve and the coordinate axis the value of gini coefficient is between 0 and 1 the smaller the value the closer gini curve is to the 45 degree line shows the higher matching degree of water and land resources on the contrary the worse the matching degree of water and land resource according to the division criterion of the gini coefficient stipulated by undp it can be divided into 5 grades shown in table 3 hong 2007 that are a excellently matching b well matching c relatively reasonable matching d poorly matching e extremely poorly matching and the corresponding value ranges of gini coefficient are 0 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 5 1 3 1 2 the calculation of the available water resources for agriculture agricultural development in the ncp is highly dependent on irrigation water because the precipitation cannot meet water requirement of agricultural production so irrigation area and the available water resources on the irrigation area have become the fundamental guarantee for agricultural development in the whole regional due to the amount of the available water allowably used to agriculture have nearly reached the upper limit of the total control value of water allowable amount in the whole ncp under the current development conditions and the strictest water resources management the amount of the available of water for agriculture per unit area and the index of its abundance degree were analyzed as 2 re i r i 1 n i 1 n r i 100 i 1 2 3 n 3 r i w i α i ia i 4 α i u ai u i where re i is index of the available agricultural water resources abundance degree per unit area in unit i r i is the amount of available water resources for agricultural irrigation per unit area in unit i mm w i is the amount of water resources in unit i 104 m3 ia i is the area of effective irrigation in unit i 104 ha α i is the proportion of the amount of the agricultural water use in total water use in unit i 104 m3 104 m3 u ai and u i is the water amount used by agriculture and the total water use amount in unit i respectively i is the ith calculated unit i 1 2 n n is the total number of units in the study n 52 the abundance degree of agricultural water resources is judged by the value of r e i it can be divided into 3 grades according to the ratio of the available agricultural water amount the agriculture in unit to that of the total region in the paper table 4 that is the corresponding grade is extreme shortage when it is less than or equal to 0 5 when it is from 0 5 to 0 9 the grade present relatively insufficient when the index is more than 0 9 the corresponding grade is relatively rich hong 2007 3 1 3 the calculation of winter wheat s water requirement and its supplement irrigation water the utilization of agricultural water resources is closely related to not only irrigation area but also the types of crops and the meteorological condition due to the mismatch between the growth period of winter wheat from the end of september to the june of the second year and the time of precipitation winter wheat has become one of the crops with the largest demand for irrigation water in the ncp in order to reduce the amount of irrigation water it is the key link to water suited development of winter wheat based on the matching development of water and cultivated land resources the water requirement of winter wheat zhao et al 2020 is calculated by the reference evapotranspiration et 0 and the crop coefficient kc et 0 is calculated by the penman monteith formula recommended by unesco united nations educational scientific and cultural organization wang et al 2020 the specific calculations are as 5 twd k c et 0 6 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where twd is the water requirement for winter wheat mm k c is the crop coefficient of winter wheat in growth period et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm r n is the net radiation on the surface of the crop mj m2

kpa is the inclination of the pressure curve γ is the hygrometer constant kpa effective precipitation in winter wheat growth period is the amount of rainfall that can be directly or indirectly utilized by winter wheat gong et al 2020 nie et al 2019 when effective precipitation cannot meet the water requirement of winter wheat for growth the irrigation water wu et al 2019 is need the specific calculation isas 7 ep t w d i f p t w d p i f p t w d 8 ir 0 i f e p t w d t w d e p i f e p t w d where ep is the effective precipitation in winter wheat growth period mm twd is the water

the paper were from the china meteorological data sharing network http adc cma gov cn the sites in the ncp and surrounding areas were screened and 82 regular weather stations with data series from 2001 to 2017 were selected the data mainly included the daily precipitation average temperature average maximum temperatures average minimum temperature air relative humidity average wind speed and sunshine hours the average spatial value of each meteorological element was obtained by spatial interpolation the water resources amount and the amount of agricultural water utilization in 2001 2017 were from the china water resources bulletin and the provincial or municipal water resources bulletins http www mwr gov cn the cultivated area effective irrigated area population and winter wheat planting area were obtained from the national or provincial statistical yearbooks in 2002 2019 and economic statistical annual reports http www stats gov cn the crop coefficient kc in the calculation of water requirement of winter wheat were derived from the national agricultural science data sharing center database http www agridata cn and field investigations 4 results 4 1 change in matching degree of agricultural water and cultivated land resources the gini coefficient were calculated in the three water resources conditions with hydrological series of 1956 2000 2001 2017 and 2010 2017 and the current cultivated area to reveal the change of matching degree the results showed that the match between the current cultivated land and the water resources of the three hydrological series were good overall fig 4 and their corresponding gini coefficient are 0 2497 0 2946 and 0 2849 respectively which are in the good match range of the united nations gini coefficients but with the change of water resources conditions from 1956 2000 to 2001 2017 to 2001 2017 the gini coefficient showed an increasing trend under the current cultivated land condition the support of local limited water resources to cultivated land had gradually reached the upper limit in recent 18 years and they are close to the critical state the critical value is 0 3 even though the water resources increased under the influence of climate change in the last 8 years the gini coefficient of 0 2849 also trended to the critical matching state that is to say the cultivated area cannot be further increased by large scale due to the limitation of water resources if the cultivated area is continued to expand by large scale it will need to pay a greater price in addition their matches characteristic also showed a downward trend according gini coefficient between the effective irrigation area and the amount of agricultural water utilization from 2012 to 2017 and the corresponding gini coefficient changed from 0 2647 in 2012 to 0 2985 in 2017 fig 5 the matching degree of the two was also towards the critical state it indicated that it is impossible to add the large scale development of effective irrigated area because of the limited agricultural water availability under the condition of the strict water resources management even if further development of water saving in conclusion from the view of the whole region of the ncp the possibility would be minimal to ensure food production by a large scale increasing cultivated area and the effective irrigation under the rigid constrain of the available water for agriculture in addition the irrigation rate irrigated area cultivated area of 74 3 in the ncp which is at a higher level in china also showed the potential for further development of irrigation is limited so in order to further guarantee the agricultural development the future development direction based on the spatial balanced development of land and water resources should be carried out it also is one of important methods to adjust the planting structure according to the spatial distribution characteristics of water resources abundance degree to ensure food security 4 2 the spatial distribution of the agricultural available water resources and its index of abundance degree by analyzing the agricultural available water resources and its index of abundance degree in 52 basic research units the results showed that the average agricultural available water resources per unit of the effective irrigated area was 3668 m3 ha in the whole ncp it accounted for only 14 of the national average level and there was extremely uneven spatial distribution with an increasing trend from north to south the details are shown in fig 6 according to the judgment standard in the section of 3 1 2 the areas with relatively rich grade of agricultural available water resources are mainly distributed in the 20 cities locating in the southern of the yellow river basin and huaihe river basins their corresponding index of abundance were greater 0 9 among the 20 cities eight cities were in shandong province four cities in anhui province five cities in jiangsu province and three cities in henan province among the 20 cities xinyang city was the most abundant followed by the five cities in jiangsu province their corresponding agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigation area was 10 170 m3 ha and 59 00 m3 ha accounting for 2 8 times and 2 times the average value of the whole ncp respectively the extreme shortage grade of agricultural available water resources was mainly distributed in the following 11 cities handan xingtai hengshui cangzhou and langfang in hebei province qingdao and dongying in shandong province and puyang zhengzhou xuchang and luohe in henan province their corresponding index of abundances were less than 0 5 in which hengshui city was the smallest only 0 239 the cities of shijiazhuang baoding and tangshan in hebei province northwest zone of shandong province and the northeast zone of henan province were in the grade of relatively insufficient of agricultural available water resources their amount of agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigated area was 1500 2500 m3 ha and the corresponding index of abundance is approximately 0 5 to 0 7 the detailed agricultural available water resources spatial distribution of the index of abundance and the grade were shown in fig 7 in conclusion there was a serious spatial imbalance distribution for agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigated area among them hebei province had limited local water resources however the cities in anhui and jiangsu provinces and some cities in henan province with relatively rich agricultural available water resources according to the concept of water resources quantity based agricultural development these cities have the potential to further develop the irrigated area by small scale including yantai weihai rizhao laiwu and linyi in shandong province luoyang zhumadian and xinyang in henan province fuyang and bengbu in anhui province at present the relatively low irrigation rate of cultivated land also provided evidence for the further development of irrigation area in these cities 4 3 optimizing planting of winter wheat based on the amount of agricultural available water resources due to the most widely planted of winter wheat and the mismatch between its growth period and precipitation time in the ncp a large amount of water resources is required for irrigation in its growth period so the winter wheat planting layout became one of the decisive factors for the rational utilization of limited and uneven distribution agricultural available water resources in ncp the average values of the water requirement of winter wheat effective precipitation and irrigation water from 2001 to 2017 are shown in fig 8 the average value of the water requirement of winter wheat in the whole ncp was 445 16 mm under the average meteorological condition from 2001 to 2017 with a gradually increasing spatial distribution from south to north fig 9 specifically it in hebei province lying the norther of north china plain was relatively higher which maintained about 461 9 545 2 mm the relatively smaller value is in henan province anhui province and jiangsu province in south of north china plain with 339 6 413 3 mm among the 52 cities the largest value was cangzhou city of hebei province and the smallest value was shangqiu city of henan province their difference was nearly 1 6 times which were 1 22 times and 0 78 times of the average level of the whole region respectively the 164 76 mm average effective precipitation were spatial increasing trend from north to south in the whole north china plain fig 10 among them the relatively less value was in hebei province in the northern part of shandong province and in the northern part of henan province the least value was located in hebei province which accounts for less than 35 of the water requirement of winter wheat cities with greater effective precipitation than average value of the whole north china plain were in eastern shandong province southern henan province anhui province and jiangsu province these cites had more than 45 ratio of effective precipitation to water requirement of winter wheat in xinyang zhumadian luohe zhoukou fuyang huainan bengbu bozhou huai an yancheng suqian and lianyungang city and the ratio in the 6 cities including xinyang zhumadian fuyang huainan yancheng and huai an accounted for more than half of the water requirement of winter wheat for the irrigation the average of the ncp was about 280 4 mm which was spatially opposite to the effective precipitation fig 11 the zone with higher demand for irrigation was in most of hebei northern henan and shandong provinces which were above the average and the largest value of irrigation appeared in hebei province for the proportion of irrigation to the water requirement of winter wheat fig 12 the irrigation water amount accounting for more than 70 of the water requirement of winter wheat need to be provide in hebei province except qinhuangdao city followed by irrigation in central shandong province and northern henan province accounting for about 65 of the water requirement of winter wheat in the north of anhui province and the north of jiangsu province their proportion of the irrigation amount to the water requirement of winter wheat with about 50 were relatively smallest 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 discussion the ncp is the dominant producing area of winter wheat and the main producing area of grain in china due to the shortage of water resources the mismatch of spatial distribution of water and land resources and the decoupling between the growth period of winter wheat and precipitation time irrigation has become the guarantee of regional agricultural development however with the increasingly fierce competition for water between industry and agriculture agricultural water resources are facing severe challenges the farming is facing more severe water shortage because irrigation area and winter wheat a typical water consuming crop are distributed in the north of the ncp with more scare according to the third assessment report of the ipcc china will still face the increasing situation of the average temperature and by the end of the 21st century the temperature increase may reach 1 3 5 0 the ncp will lie in the high value zone liu et al 2015 the irrigation demand will increase in the ncp in future in order to ensure the sustainable development of the region and the characteristics of the dominant winter wheat growing areas in the ncp employed the gini coefficient the paper analyzed the matching characteristics of water and land resources from two aspects including cultivated land and water resources effective irrigation area and agricultural water use in the ncp and the spatial distribution characteristics of water requirement and its composition of winter wheat were further analyzed the results showed that the decreasing matching were appeared between cultivated land and water resources effective irrigated area and agricultural water use in the whole region the corresponding of gini coefficient reached to 0 2946 and 0 2985 respectively which were in the critical state from the grade of well matching b grade and the relatively reasonable matching c grade it also showed the increasing constraint intensity of water resources to agricultural development in the ncp according to the concept of development determined by water limited the development of cultivated land and effective irrigation area has reached the upper limit the extension of both cultivated and irrigation area is impossible it is possible direction to moderately increase the effective irrigation area in the southern cities of the ncp with relatively abundance water resources mainly including yantai weihai rizhao laiwu and linyi in shandong province luoyang zhumadian and xinyang in henan province fuyang and bengbu in anhui province under the constraint of cultivated land red line the recent change of the effective irrigation area has directly reflected the above results table 5 while ensuring regional food security based on the rationally developing irrigation area under the limited water availability planting structure is also the other main factor affecting agricultural water use to rationally adjust planting and keeping the dominant position of winter wheat in the ncp the paper analyzed the spatial variation of the water requirement and its composition of winter wheat the results showed that it is possible to further undertake winter wheat planting in the southern anhui southern henan and northern jiangsu provinces according to the matching of water and land resources because of the water requirement of winter wheat in the south of the ncp is relatively small and the ratio of effective precipitation in its growth time is larger the amount of water required for irrigation is relatively low in the whole region moreover the assessment of climate suitability for winter wheat planting in anhui province lu et al 2020 and the future water supply scope of the diversion project according to the feasibility study report of diversion project from yangtse river to huaihe river for 12 cities in anhui province and 2 cities in henan province provide support from two aspects of regional climate adaptability and water supply so the southern region of north china plain such as xinyang zhumadian fuyang huainan yancheng and huai an and so on is likely to undertake winter wheat planting there are many studies on the analysis of climate conditions and the adjustment of planting structure the planting area of winter wheat moves south there are many studies on the adjustment of planting structure moving winter wheat planting area south by analyzing climatic conditions such as diao in 2019 diao 2019 and ma in 2012 ma et al 2012 the study of diao indicated the suitable planting regions for winter wheat mainly concentrating in the southern part of the cnp including the south of hebei the north of henan and the north of anhui by analyzing the effects of temperature precipitation temperature radiation and other factors on yield diao 2019 the study of ma is about the analyzing and zoning of the eco climate suitability on winter wheat varieties in anhui province ma et al 2012 the research conclusions from the perspective of climate conditions were similar with the paper results from the perspective of water resources affecting winter wheat so associating with the above characteristic of water resources the agricultural available water resources the water requirement of winter wheat effective precipitation and the amount of the irrigation rationally developing irrigation area and adjusting the winter wheat planting area to move the south of the ncp would be benefit to improve utilization of the effective precipitation and reduce the total amount of irrigation water further effectively alleviate the shortage of agricultural water resources and the worse situation of groundwater in northern meanwhile food production safety and the status of winter wheat will also be ensured however it is worth noting that this study focuses on the analysis of farmland irrigation area and winter wheat planting development layout with water and land resources as the core other factors affecting winter wheat planting and terrain need to be further analyzed 5 2 conclusions the gini coefficient of the cultivated land area and the water resources increased from 0 2497 1956 2000 to 0 2946 2001 2017 and the gini coefficient of the effective irrigated area and the water utilization amount increased from 0 2647 2001 to 0 2985 2017 in the ncp the changes reflect an overall downward trend in matching of water and land resources the cut off for a good match grade b is 0 3 which shows that the support of water resources for agricultural irrigated area has reached the upper limit and it would be impossible for the large scale extension development of cultivated land and irrigated area under the constrain of the water resources the amount of agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigation area in the ncp increased gradually from north to south while the water requirement of winter wheat changed in the opposite way and the effective precipitation as one of composition of the water requirement showed a similar trend to that of agricultural available water resources it could be seen that the south of the ncp had the possibility of further moderately development irrigation area and undertaking winter wheat planting considering the current situation of water distribution and the irrigation area associated with the matching characteristic of water and land resources in the 52 cities in the whole plain it was possible to further develop the irrigated area in these cities in the south of north china plain including yantai weihai rizhao laiwu and linyi in shandong province luoyang zhumadian and xinyang in henan province fuyang and bengbu in anhui province among them xinyang zhumadian fuyang huainan yancheng and huai an have the potential to undertake winter wheat planting this would be helpful to alleviate the situation of water shortage pressure and groundwater over extraction in the north in conclusion faced with the impact of climate change and high intensity human activities on water resources and the rigid demand for water in future development to ensure agricultural sustainable development and the dominant position of winter wheat planting in the ncp it would be one of the important development directions for moderately increasing the development of effective irrigated area and adjustment of winter wheat planting layout based on the matching of water and land resources combining with agricultural water saving technology funding this research was supported

9843,the north china plain is the main producing area of winter wheat in china due to the relatively poor condition of water resources the competition of water between industry and agriculture is fierce the increasing shortage of water resources has led to serious overexploitation of groundwater in some areas agricultural development is faced with severe challenges in order to ensure regional food security and sustainable winter wheat planting 52 cities of north china plain ncp in the following of the paper use the shorted name ncp were taken as research units to analyze the matching characteristics of agricultural water and land resources so as to reveal the direction of irrigated agriculture development and winter wheat suitable planting layout considering their balance in future the paper firstly analyzed the cultivated area determined by water resource and irrigation development by agricultural available water and then pointed out the direction of water suited planting layout of winter wheat the results showed that 1 the gini coefficient showed an increasing trend which indicated that the area of cultivated land and irrigation area supported by water resources have nearly reached the upper limit the large scale extension of both cultivated and irrigation area is impossible under the restriction of water 2 the amount of agricultural available water resources per unit of effective irrigation area and the effective precipitation increased gradually from north to south in the ncp but the spatial distribution of water requirement of winter wheat in its growth period changed in the opposite way this indicated the poor spatiotemporal match between winter wheat planting and water resources leading to the cost of spending more water to maintain wheat production 3 the further development of irrigation and the water suited planting of winter wheat should pay attention to the southern part of the plain with rich water such as southern henan province jiangsu province anhui province etc to ensure the regional agricultural development that is of great significance to the regional sustainable development water shortage alleviation and national grain safety keywords north china plain water resources cultivated land area winter wheat development layout water suited planting 1 introduction the two rigid constraints affecting agricultural development are water resources and land resources namely agricultural land and water resources shortages of either land resources or water will hind the development of agriculture especially crop planting in reality due to the dislocation distribution of global water and land resources it is more prominent for the constraint of water shortage on regional agricultural development according to the fao report 2020 food and agriculture condition most of 60 irrigation area face with the severe shortage of water fao 2020 e g northwest china huang et al 2012 yu et al 2017 africa nyam et al 2021 middle east wehbe and temimi 2021 central australia hornbuckle et al 2005 western america gleick 2010 to ensure grain product as much as possible at present about 41 of the global irrigation water amount comes from these water originally used for ecology system fao 2020 therefore the balanced utilization of agricultural water and land resources is particularly important for sustainable development of agriculture and its region valipour et al 2015 china an agricultural country is 7 of the world s arable land area accounting for about 130 million hectares feeds 22 of the world s population under the background situation of serious mismatch of spatial distribution between water and land resources the huaihe river basin and the areas to the north of china account for 63 15 of china s land area but only 19 of china s water resources irrigation plays an important role however the dislocation of spatial distribution of water and land resources is aggravated coupled with the impact of climate change and high intensity human activities ren et al 2008 zhou 2017 and the increasingly intension of water shortage these changes become more prominent to the rigid restraint of agricultural development it has become the focus of regional agricultural sustainable development based on the water resources rigid constrain and the land water resources balanced utilization therefore lots of studies on the matching development of agricultural water and land resources have emerged du et al 2019 li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2014 at present most of the researches take regional cultivated land or available land and runoff water resources as the research objects under specific period condition of the static evaluation of natural background condition of water and land resources chen et al 2019 dong et al 2018 ren et al 2008 sun et al 2018 wu and bao 2003 these not only fail to reflect the direct influence of planting structure including the water requirement under different planting structure and its effective precipitation in the utilization of agricultural water and land resources but also fail to reveal the influence of water resources evolution and agricultural development process on the balanced development of water and land resources the ncp is the main production area of winter wheat and one of economically developed areas in china at same time it is also one of typical irrigation areas chen et al 2010 for agricultural development due to the poor natural water resources condition and seriously misallocation of it and cultivated land because of the existence of the long term unreasonable utilization of water resources the development and utilization ratio of the water resources have exceeded the international warning line and the groundwater has been seriously overexploited which has caused the largest underground water funnel area in the world liu et al 2001 shi et al 2011 reducing winter wheat as high water consumption crops planting area has become one of the main measures to alleviate the groundwater overexploited sun et al 2011 yu et al 2020 and the overdraft of underground water has been effectively alleviated by the implement of the relevant measures including a variety of water saving irrigation technology winter wheat acreage controlling and so on wang et al 2018 however it will be threatened to the dominant planting structure with winter wheat and the responding grain capacity in the cnp if the measure to reducing winter wheat area is implemented for a long time as a major food crop winter wheat plays an important role in food security and has ecology function in the ncp it will be vital important to reasonable control the development of irrigated area and winter wheat planting layout under the constraint of water resources for the regional sustainable development and the dominant position of winter wheat consequently to reveal the reasonable development of irrigation and winter wheat in the ncp based on the concept of the water land matching development the paper studied the match characteristic between the water resources and cultivated area the effective irrigation area and agricultural water utilization and the available water resources used by winter wheat in it growth stage the paper is structured into 5 sections section 1 is the introduction section 2 presents outline of the study area section 3 presents the methods and data section 4 presents an analysis of the change of match characteristic about the water resources and cultivated area the effective irrigation area and agricultural water utilization and the direction of the irrigation area and winter wheat water suited planting in the ncp and section 5 discusses the results and draws a conclusion 2 overview of the study area 2 1 location the ncp located at 32 40 n 114 121 e spans haihe river basin yellow river basin and huaihe river basin including 54 prefecture level cities in 7 provinces cities of beijing tianjin hebei shandong henan anhui and jiangsu from north to south it covers a total land area of 494 000 km2 fig 1 2 2 water resources conditions the amount of precipitation and water resources in the ncp are relatively small and appear increasing trend from north to south in spatial distribution fig 2 according to water resources bulletin data the amount of the annual average water resources in whole region in period of 2001 2017 were 103 753 billion m3 75 4 of the water resources are distributed in the huaihe river basin in the south of north china plain covering 20 cities including 6 cities in anhui province 5 cities in jiangsu province and 9 cities in southeastern henan province 20 9 of the water resources are distributed in haihe river basin in the north of the ncp covering 18 cities including 9 cities in hebei province 3 cities in northern shandong province 4 cities in henan province beijing and tianjin the narrow and long yellow river basin lying in middle of the ncp only accounts for less than 5 the detail was shown in table 1 under the influence of global climate change and human activities the precipitation gap between the north and south had further increased in recent years fig 3 2 3 condition of the water resources development and utilization water resources are in serious shortage due to the unbalanced development of regional economy and water resources distribution according to the average amount of water resources in 2001 2017 and the water use amount in 2017 shown in table 2 the development and utilization rate of water resources in the ncp reached 85 9 especially the haihe river basin in the north reached 135 which seriously affected the sustainable development of the region agriculture as a major water user is facing rigid water resources constraints it is an inevitable choice for alleviating regional agricultural water shortage and sustainable agricultural development to determine irrigation and planting area based on water to realize the matching development of cultivated land and water resources since the agricultural planting area in beijing and tianjin is relatively small the other 52 prefectural cities in the ncp with large agricultural distribution area are selected as typical research units 3 research methods and data sources 3 1 research methods 3 1 1 the gini coefficient the gini coefficient proposed by the italian scientist corrado gini in 1921 was initially used to measure the balance of income distribution among residents the method li et al 2016 was introduced into the study on the matching of water and land resources by wu a chinese scholar in 2003 wu and bao 2003 it has become an important indicator to quantitatively measure the spatial matching degree of water and land resources in the region in this paper the relationship between income and population is replaced by cultivated area and total water resources and the gini coefficient is extended to study the matching degree of water and soil resources it can be calculated as 1 gn a a b where gn is the gini coefficient a is the area enclosed by the 45 degree line and the fitted gini curve b is the area enclosed by the fitted curve and the coordinate axis the value of gini coefficient is between 0 and 1 the smaller the value the closer gini curve is to the 45 degree line shows the higher matching degree of water and land resources on the contrary the worse the matching degree of water and land resource according to the division criterion of the gini coefficient stipulated by undp it can be divided into 5 grades shown in table 3 hong 2007 that are a excellently matching b well matching c relatively reasonable matching d poorly matching e extremely poorly matching and the corresponding value ranges of gini coefficient are 0 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 5 1 3 1 2 the calculation of the available water resources for agriculture agricultural development in the ncp is highly dependent on irrigation water because the precipitation cannot meet water requirement of agricultural production so irrigation area and the available water resources on the irrigation area have become the fundamental guarantee for agricultural development in the whole regional due to the amount of the available water allowably used to agriculture have nearly reached the upper limit of the total control value of water allowable amount in the whole ncp under the current development conditions and the strictest water resources management the amount of the available of water for agriculture per unit area and the index of its abundance degree were analyzed as 2 re i r i 1 n i 1 n r i 100 i 1 2 3 n 3 r i w i α i ia i 4 α i u ai u i where re i is index of the available agricultural water resources abundance degree per unit area in unit i r i is the amount of available water resources for agricultural irrigation per unit area in unit i mm w i is the amount of water resources in unit i 104 m3 ia i is the area of effective irrigation in unit i 104 ha α i is the proportion of the amount of the agricultural water use in total water use in unit i 104 m3 104 m3 u ai and u i is the water amount used by agriculture and the total water use amount in unit i respectively i is the ith calculated unit i 1 2 n n is the total number of units in the study n 52 the abundance degree of agricultural water resources is judged by the value of r e i it can be divided into 3 grades according to the ratio of the available agricultural water amount the agriculture in unit to that of the total region in the paper table 4 that is the corresponding grade is extreme shortage when it is less than or equal to 0 5 when it is from 0 5 to 0 9 the grade present relatively insufficient when the index is more than 0 9 the corresponding grade is relatively rich hong 2007 3 1 3 the calculation of winter wheat s water requirement and its supplement irrigation water the utilization of agricultural water resources is closely related to not only irrigation area but also the types of crops and the meteorological condition due to the mismatch between the growth period of winter wheat from the end of september to the june of the second year and the time of precipitation winter wheat has become one of the crops with the largest demand for irrigation water in the ncp in order to reduce the amount of irrigation water it is the key link to water suited development of winter wheat based on the matching development of water and cultivated land resources the water requirement of winter wheat zhao et al 2020 is calculated by the reference evapotranspiration et 0 and the crop coefficient kc et 0 is calculated by the penman monteith formula recommended by unesco united nations educational scientific and cultural organization wang et al 2020 the specific calculations are as 5 twd k c et 0 6 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where twd is the

the paper were from the china meteorological data sharing network http adc cma gov cn the sites in the ncp and surrounding areas were screened and 82 regular weather stations with data series from 2001 to 2017 were selected the data mainly included the daily precipitation average temperature average maximum temperatures average minimum temperature air relative humidity average wind speed and sunshine hours the average spatial value of each meteorological element was obtained by spatial interpolation the water resources amount and the amount of agricultural water utilization in 2001 2017 were from the china water resources bulletin and the provincial or municipal water resources bulletins http www mwr gov cn the cultivated area effective irrigated area population and winter wheat planting area were obtained from the national or provincial statistical yearbooks in 2002 2019 and economic statistical annual reports http www stats gov cn the crop coefficient kc in the calculation of water requirement of winter wheat were derived from the national agricultural science data sharing center database http www agridata cn and field investigations 4 results 4 1 change in matching degree of agricultural water and cultivated land resources the gini coefficient were calculated in the three water resources conditions with hydrological series of 1956 2000 2001 2017 and 2010 2017 and the current cultivated area to reveal the change of matching degree the results showed that the match between the current cultivated land and the water resources of the three hydrological series were good overall fig 4 and their corresponding gini coefficient are 0 2497 0 2946 and 0 2849 respectively which are in the good match range of the united nations gini coefficients but with the change of water resources conditions from 1956 2000 to 2001 2017 to 2001 2017 the gini coefficient showed an increasing trend under the current cultivated land condition the support of local limited water resources to cultivated land had gradually reached the upper limit in recent 18 years and they are close to the critical state the critical value is 0 3 even though the water resources increased under the influence of climate change in the last 8 years the gini coefficient of 0 2849 also trended to the critical matching state that is to say the cultivated area cannot be further increased by large scale due to the limitation of water resources if the cultivated area is continued to expand by large scale it will need to pay a greater price in addition their matches characteristic also showed a downward trend according gini coefficient between the effective irrigation area and the amount of agricultural water utilization from 2012 to 2017 and the corresponding gini coefficient changed from 0 2647 in 2012 to 0 2985 in 2017 fig 5 the matching degree of the two was also towards the critical state it indicated that it is impossible to add the large scale development of effective irrigated area because of the limited agricultural water availability under the condition of the strict water resources management even if further development of water saving in conclusion from the view of the whole region of the ncp the possibility would be minimal to ensure food production by a large scale increasing cultivated area and the effective irrigation under the rigid constrain of the available water for agriculture in addition the irrigation rate irrigated area cultivated area of 74 3 in the ncp which is at a higher level in china also showed the potential for further development of irrigation is limited so in order to further guarantee the agricultural development the future development direction based on the spatial balanced development of land and water resources should be carried out it also is one of important methods to adjust the planting structure according to the spatial distribution characteristics of water resources abundance degree to ensure food security 4 2 the spatial distribution of the agricultural available water resources and its index of abundance degree by analyzing the agricultural available water resources and its index of abundance degree in 52 basic research units the results showed that the average agricultural available water resources per unit of the effective irrigated area was 3668 m3 ha in the whole ncp it accounted for only 14 of the national average level and there was extremely uneven spatial distribution with an increasing trend from north to south the details are shown in fig 6 according to the judgment standard in the section of 3 1 2 the areas with relatively rich grade of agricultural available water resources are mainly distributed in the 20 cities locating in the southern of the yellow river basin and huaihe river basins their corresponding index of abundance were greater 0 9 among the 20 cities eight cities were in shandong province four cities in anhui province five cities in jiangsu province and three cities in henan province among the 20 cities xinyang city was the most abundant followed by the five cities in jiangsu province their corresponding agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigation area was 10 170 m3 ha and 59 00 m3 ha accounting for 2 8 times and 2 times the average value of the whole ncp respectively the extreme shortage grade of agricultural available water resources was mainly distributed in the following 11 cities handan xingtai hengshui cangzhou and langfang in hebei province qingdao and dongying in shandong province and puyang zhengzhou xuchang and luohe in henan province their corresponding index of abundances were less than 0 5 in which hengshui city was the smallest only 0 239 the cities of shijiazhuang baoding and tangshan in hebei province northwest zone of shandong province and the northeast zone of henan province were in the grade of relatively insufficient of agricultural available water resources their amount of agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigated area was 1500 2500 m3 ha and the corresponding index of abundance is approximately 0 5 to 0 7 the detailed agricultural available water resources spatial distribution of the index of abundance and the grade were shown in fig 7 in conclusion there was a serious spatial imbalance distribution for agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigated area among them hebei province had limited local water resources however the cities in anhui and jiangsu provinces and some cities in henan province with relatively rich agricultural available water resources according to the concept of water resources quantity based agricultural development these cities have the potential to further develop the irrigated area by small scale including yantai weihai rizhao laiwu and linyi in shandong province luoyang zhumadian and xinyang in henan province fuyang and bengbu in anhui province at present the relatively low irrigation rate of cultivated land also provided evidence for the further development of irrigation area in these cities 4 3 optimizing planting of winter wheat based on the amount of agricultural available water resources due to the most widely planted of winter wheat and the mismatch between its growth period and precipitation time in the ncp a large amount of water resources is required for irrigation in its growth period so the winter wheat planting layout became one of the decisive factors for the rational utilization of limited and uneven distribution agricultural available water resources in ncp the average values of the water requirement of winter wheat effective precipitation and irrigation water from 2001 to 2017 are shown in fig 8 the average value of the water requirement of winter wheat in the whole ncp was 445 16 mm under the average meteorological condition from 2001 to 2017 with a gradually increasing spatial distribution from south to north fig 9 specifically it in hebei province lying the norther of north china plain was relatively higher which maintained about 461 9 545 2 mm the relatively smaller value is in henan province anhui province and jiangsu province in south of north china plain with 339 6 413 3 mm among the 52 cities the largest value was cangzhou city of hebei province and the smallest value was shangqiu city of henan province their difference was nearly 1 6 times which were 1 22 times and 0 78 times of the average level of the whole region respectively the 164 76 mm average effective precipitation were spatial increasing trend from north to south in the whole north china plain fig 10 among them the relatively less value was in hebei province in the northern part of shandong province and in the northern part of henan province the least value was located in hebei province which accounts for less than 35 of the water requirement of winter wheat cities with greater effective precipitation than average value of the whole north china plain were in eastern shandong province southern henan province anhui province and jiangsu province these cites had more than 45 ratio of effective precipitation to water requirement of winter wheat in xinyang zhumadian luohe zhoukou fuyang huainan bengbu bozhou huai an yancheng suqian and lianyungang city and the ratio in the 6 cities including xinyang zhumadian fuyang huainan yancheng and huai an accounted for more than half of the water requirement of winter wheat for the irrigation the average of the ncp was about 280 4 mm which was spatially opposite to the effective precipitation fig 11 the zone with higher demand for irrigation was in most of hebei northern henan and shandong provinces which were above the average and the largest value of irrigation appeared in hebei province for the proportion of irrigation to the water requirement of winter wheat fig 12 the irrigation water amount accounting for more than 70 of the water requirement of winter wheat need to be provide in hebei province except qinhuangdao city followed by irrigation in central shandong province and northern henan province accounting for about 65 of the water requirement of winter wheat in the north of anhui province and the north of jiangsu province their proportion of the irrigation amount to the water requirement of winter wheat with about 50 were relatively smallest 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 discussion the ncp is the dominant producing area of winter wheat and the main producing area of grain in china due to the shortage of water resources the mismatch of spatial distribution of water and land resources and the decoupling between the growth period of winter wheat and precipitation time irrigation has become the guarantee of regional agricultural development however with the increasingly fierce competition for water between industry and agriculture agricultural water resources are facing severe challenges the farming is facing more severe water shortage because irrigation area and winter wheat a typical water consuming crop are distributed in the north of the ncp with more scare according to the third assessment report of the ipcc china will still face the increasing situation of the average temperature and by the end of the 21st century the temperature increase may reach 1 3 5 0 the ncp will lie in the high value zone liu et al 2015 the irrigation demand will increase in the ncp in future in order to ensure the sustainable development of the region and the characteristics of the dominant winter wheat growing areas in the ncp employed the gini coefficient the paper analyzed the matching characteristics of water and land resources from two aspects including cultivated land and water resources effective irrigation area and agricultural water use in the ncp and the spatial distribution characteristics of water requirement and its composition of winter wheat were further analyzed the results showed that the decreasing matching were appeared between cultivated land and water resources effective irrigated area and agricultural water use in the whole region the corresponding of gini coefficient reached to 0 2946 and 0 2985 respectively which were in the critical state from the grade of well matching b grade and the relatively reasonable matching c grade it also showed the increasing constraint intensity of water resources to agricultural development in the ncp according to the concept of development determined by water limited the development of cultivated land and effective irrigation area has reached the upper limit the extension of both cultivated and irrigation area is impossible it is possible direction to moderately increase the effective irrigation area in the southern cities of the ncp with relatively abundance water resources mainly including yantai weihai rizhao laiwu and linyi in shandong province luoyang zhumadian and xinyang in henan province fuyang and bengbu in anhui province under the constraint of cultivated land red line the recent change of the effective irrigation area has directly reflected the above results table 5 while ensuring regional food security based on the rationally developing irrigation area under the limited water availability planting structure is also the other main factor affecting agricultural water use to rationally adjust planting and keeping the dominant position of winter wheat in the ncp the paper analyzed the spatial variation of the water requirement and its composition of winter wheat the results showed that it is possible to further undertake winter wheat planting in the southern anhui southern henan and northern jiangsu provinces according to the matching of water and land resources because of the water requirement of winter wheat in the south of the ncp is relatively small and the ratio of effective precipitation in its growth time is larger the amount of water required for irrigation is relatively low in the whole region moreover the assessment of climate suitability for winter wheat planting in anhui province lu et al 2020 and the future water supply scope of the diversion project according to the feasibility study report of diversion project from yangtse river to huaihe river for 12 cities in anhui province and 2 cities in henan province provide support from two aspects of regional climate adaptability and water supply so the southern region of north china plain such as xinyang zhumadian fuyang huainan yancheng and huai an and so on is likely to undertake winter wheat planting there are many studies on the analysis of climate conditions and the adjustment of planting structure the planting area of winter wheat moves south there are many studies on the adjustment of planting structure moving winter wheat planting area south by analyzing climatic conditions such as diao in 2019 diao 2019 and ma in 2012 ma et al 2012 the study of diao indicated the suitable planting regions for winter wheat mainly concentrating in the southern part of the cnp including the south of hebei the north of henan and the north of anhui by analyzing the effects of temperature precipitation temperature radiation and other factors on yield diao 2019 the study of ma is about the analyzing and zoning of the eco climate suitability on winter wheat varieties in anhui province ma et al 2012 the research conclusions from the perspective of climate conditions were similar with the paper results from the perspective of water resources affecting winter wheat so associating with the above characteristic of water resources the agricultural available water resources the water requirement of winter wheat effective precipitation and the amount of the irrigation rationally developing irrigation area and adjusting the winter wheat planting area to move the south of the ncp would be benefit to improve utilization of the effective precipitation and reduce the total amount of irrigation water further effectively alleviate the shortage of agricultural water resources and the worse situation of groundwater in northern meanwhile food production safety and the status of winter wheat will also be ensured however it is worth noting that this study focuses on the analysis of farmland irrigation area and winter wheat planting development layout with water and land resources as the core other factors affecting winter wheat planting and terrain need to be further analyzed 5 2 conclusions the gini coefficient of the cultivated land area and the water resources increased from 0 2497 1956 2000 to 0 2946 2001 2017 and the gini coefficient of the effective irrigated area and the water utilization amount increased from 0 2647 2001 to 0 2985 2017 in the ncp the changes reflect an overall downward trend in matching of water and land resources the cut off for a good match grade b is 0 3 which shows that the support of water resources for agricultural irrigated area has reached the upper limit and it would be impossible for the large scale extension development of cultivated land and irrigated area under the constrain of the water resources the amount of agricultural available water resources per unit effective irrigation area in the ncp increased gradually from north to south while the water requirement of winter wheat changed in the opposite way and the effective precipitation as one of composition of the water requirement showed a similar trend to that of agricultural available water resources it could be seen that the south of the ncp had the possibility of further moderately development irrigation area and undertaking winter wheat planting considering the current situation of water distribution and the irrigation area associated with the matching characteristic of water and land resources in the 52 cities in the whole plain it was possible to further develop the irrigated area in these cities in the south of north china plain including yantai weihai rizhao laiwu and linyi in shandong province luoyang zhumadian and xinyang in henan province fuyang and bengbu in anhui province among them xinyang zhumadian fuyang huainan yancheng and huai an have the potential to undertake winter wheat planting this would be helpful to alleviate the situation of water shortage pressure and groundwater over extraction in the north in conclusion faced with the impact of climate change and high intensity human activities on water resources and the rigid demand for water in future development to ensure agricultural sustainable development and the dominant position of winter wheat planting in the ncp it would be one of the important development directions for moderately increasing the development of effective irrigated area and adjustment of winter wheat planting layout based on the matching of water and land resources combining with agricultural water saving technology funding this research was supported

9844,the projection of reference crop evapotranspiration eto based on global climate models gcms is an important task in many fields under climate change background however eto projections are typically hindered by the limited data availability or high uncertainty of the gcm projected climate variable for eto calculation e g radiation and wind speed in the current study we investigate how the selection of climate variables for eto calculation would influence the reliability and uncertainty of the eto projections based on the penman monteith p m formula and the missing variable estimation approaches provided by fao five variable selection schemes vss that select different subsets of the climate variables for eto calculation are established four emission scenarios five gcms and four statistical downscaling approaches were adopted and their uncertainty contributions were quantified by analyses of variation anova approach results show that among the climate variables except air temperature shortwave radiation caused the lowest uncertainty to the projected eto and is thus suggested as the most suitable variable to be considered for eto projections in most areas wind speed and relative humidity are determined as marginal variables for their limited influences in eto projections yet in some complex terrain regions wind speed could propagate considerable uncertainty to the projected eto differences in gcms is the major source of uncertainty in eto projections while the emission scenario generally ranked as second statistical downscaling approaches contribute limited uncertainty below 10 to eto projections above all this study shows the applicability of using the missing value estimation approaches for the fao56 p m formula to perform future eto projection for the practices with limited gcm data availability and can serve as the reference for selecting suitable variables for eto forecasting in applications keywords reference crop

of 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evaporation from an extensive surface of green grass cover of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered allen et al 1998 eto is key for the determination of the irrigation demand of crops in agricultural management allen et al 1998 xiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b 2019a eto is also useful in many other fields as it can be used as input of hydrological modeling and drought index calculation and used as indicator to evaluate climate change effects lai et al 2019 li et al 2020a zhong et al 2019 global air temperature has been increased over the past decades due to climate change as a main consequence of rising greenhouse gas ghg emissions this has consequently changed the hydrological cycle and intensified evapotranspiration at the global scale huss and hock 2018 ipcc 2013 li et al 2020b 2020c wang et al 2017a wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 enhanced evapotranspiration has been found to pose a threat to local water resources agriculture and ecological systems douville et al 2013 harkness et al 2020 li et al 2020d 2018 sterling et al 2013 wang et al 2018a 2017b and was reported as a factor causing severe drought cook et al 2014 wang et al 2018b therefore the application of clear effective approaches for the projection of eto changes are required zhao et al 2019b 2019a global climate models gcms that simulate future global climate changes provided effective tool to forecast future eto changes perera et al 2014 zhao et al 2019a however due to the different modeling mechanisms ghg emission scenarios and downscaling approaches the gcms developed or attributed by different institutes might output quite different projection results hence projection uncertainty remains as non negligible when applying gcm projected climate variables shi et al 2020 thompson et al 2014 w wang et al 2017 2015 yuan et al 2017 therefore the climate variables projected by gcms usually feature low stability and reliability which limits the effectiveness of gcms based eto forecasting applications kay and davies 2008 kingston et al 2009 mcafee 2013 shi et al 2020 w wang et al 2017 the physical based penman monteith p m formula recommended by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 hereafter as fao56 allen et al 1998 is a well known and widely recognized eto formula for gcm based future eto projection it can accurately derive eto and is also widely regarded as the benchmark to evaluate the performance of other eto estimation approaches paredes and pereira 2019 w yang et al 2019 y yang et al 2019 traditionally the fao56 p m approach requires complete climate variable sets that are well known as air temperature net radiation wind speed and relative humidity before eto calculation it is essential to verify the quality of available climate data and prioritize the use of fao56 p m approach when all variables are usable nevertheless in some practical applications some gcm climate variables might be unavailable restricting the use of the conventional p m approach for gcm based eto projection almorox et al 2015 kay and davies 2008 moreover some gcm projected variables e g wind speed and relative humidity are usually relatively less reliable hence their application in eto calculation may enlarge uncertainties in eto projections randall et al 2007 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2015 these limitations might be overcome by adopting simpler eto formulas that require fewer climate variables almorox et al 2015 kay and davies 2008 paredes et al 2020 however simplified formulas may cannot reasonably capture eto trends mcafee 2013 paredes et al 2020 for instance the temperature based empirical approaches like hargeaves samani formula have higher sensitiveness to air temperature thus their accuracy and uncertainty would be larger due to the great implication of global warming which restricts their applicable conditions baguis et al 2009 mcafee 2013 paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 therefore how to effectively project eto via gcms with limited climate variables and select suitable variables to project eto require further research meanwhile for conditions that data of some variables e g radiation wind speed humidity required for eto calculation are missing fao56 also provided approaches to estimate them by using the air temperature data paredes et al 2020 and ren et al 2016a 2016b have also evaluated the approaches estimating the absent variables for p m formula and found that p m formula with using only temperature still provided reasonable eto estimation and outperformed the simplified temperature based formula nevertheless to the authors knowledge applicability of these estimation approaches for eto projection based on gcms remain to be assessed in the current study with a focus on the fao56 p m formula and the approaches estimating missing variables provided by fao56 we aim to investigate the uncertainty of gcm based eto projections when different climate variables are selected for or eliminated from eto calculations mainland china is taken as the study area because of the vast territory and various humid and arid climate conditions the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate how the selection of climate variables used for eto calculation would influence the projections uncertainty of eto and thus to determine which variables are essential or marginal and 2 to quantify the relative impact of three uncertainty sources i e the differences in emission scenarios gcms and downscaling approaches on eto projections under different climate variable selection schemes so that help to understand the performance of the variable selection schemes under the potential application conditions this study can serve as a reference for selecting suitable climate variables for eto forecasting based on gcm projection for practical conditions with limited data availability and help to understand the relationship between eto projection uncertainty and the adopted climate variable inputs thus helps to facilitate reliable eto forecasting 2 study area and data 2 1 study area mainland china fig 1 with its vast territory and climatic conditions is selected as the study area the elevation is high in the west while low in the east forming a three ladder like terrain wang et al 2017b the eastern and southern regions are generally covered by plain and low hills with a humid subtropical or temperate monsoon climate the northwest region is less influenced by the southeast monsoon and is thus dominated by the arid or semi arid temperate continental climate the southwest is located in the tibetan plateau the highest plateau in the world and is thus dominated by a plateau and alpine climate as a consequence of the various climates and terrains mainland china contains numerous landform and land cover types including forestlands grasslands croplands wetlands deserts and glaciers in addition agriculture is one of the most important industries with cropland occupying an extensive proportion of mainland china however agricultural production and ecological systems are highly sensitive to climate change and the induced severe drought li et al 2018 2020d piao et al 2010 2 2 gcm data the gcm climate projection data from five gcms were adopted from the 5th phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 including gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m these gcms were also selected by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip which aims to provide a consistent set of global impact simulations in the agriculture water biome health and infrastructure sectors at different levels of global warming hempel et al 2013 future climate projections of these gcms were simulated based on the ghg emission scenario set named representative concentration pathways rcps we considered the gcm projections under four rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp 8 5 representing low to high ghg emission levels respectively moss et al 2010 the climate variables used in the gcm projection include daily maximum and minimum air temperature shortwave radiation wind speed and relative humidity all the climate projection data were in monthly scale note that the daily maximum and minimum air temperature data are the maximum minimum air temperature of each day after monthly averaging we used 30 year periods for both the historical baseline 1976 2005 and the future rcp scenario 2041 2070 the gcm projection data were downloaded from the world data center for climate wdcc data portal https cera www dkrz de wdcc ui cerasearch 2 3 in situ climate observations in situ observations of the daily maximum and minimum air temperature sunshine duration hours wind speed and relative humidity were adopted for the statistical downscaling of the gcm projections and coefficient estimations air temperature data was obtained from the 0 5 resolution gridded air temperature dataset over mainland china developed by the china meteorological administration cma this dataset is generated from the observations of 2400 meteorological stations across china using thin plate spline tps interpolation and accounts for elevation the cma dataset has been successfully applied to previous research on eto wang et al 2017c wind speed and relative humidity data were derived from the same 2400 meteorological stations fig 1 and spatially interpolated into the same 0 5 resolution gridcells as the air temperature dataset via tps interpolation the shortwave radiation data was calculated using the sunshine duration data collected from the 2400 meteorological stations via the following formula recommended by fao56 1 r s c r a a s b s n n r a where r s is the actual shortwave radiation r a is the extraterrestrial solar radiation calculated via local latitude and the date c is the transmissivity coefficient n is the sunshine duration n is the maximum possible sunshine duration hours and a s and b s are coefficients that depend on local atmospheric conditions the in situ observed incoming shortwave radiation data of 120 radiation stations located across china see fig 1 from cma were used to estimate a s and b s for each radiation stations the estimated a s ranges from 0 1 to 0 29 while b s ranges from 0 46 to 0 64 over mainland china which are generally in the reasonable ranges see fig a1 in appendix the estimated coefficients were then interpolated into the meteorological stations to calculate the local shortwave radiation via the sunshine duration data which was then spatially interpolated onto the 0 5 resolution gridcells all in situ climate data were obtained daily during 1976 2005 because the eto was calculated for monthly scale in this study the monthly averages were taken for these data note that all in situ cma climate data including the meteorological data from 2400 meteorological stations and the radiation data from the 120 radiation stations have been passed through the rigorous quality control procedures by cma such procedures include climatic range check internal consistency check temporal and spatial consistency check and management by quality control flags in this study the data records not marked by correct flag were regarded as missing values 3 methods 3 1 fao56 penman monteith formula fao56 defines eto at daily scale as the following formula 2 eto 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where t mean r n u 2 and e a are the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c net radiation mj m2 day wind speed at 2 m height m s and actual vapor pressure kpa respectively and δ g γ and e s are the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c soil heat flux mj m2 day psychrometric constant kpa c and saturated vapor pressure kpa respectively all of which are calculated using air temperature data details of calculation formula please see fao56 t mean is typically set to the average of the daily maximum and minimum air temperature abbreviated as tmax and tmin respectively while e a is determined as the product of relative humidity and e s the net radiation r n can be calculated as 3 r n r ns r nl 4 r ns 1 α r s where r ns is the net incoming shortwave radiation α is the albedo set as 0 23 according to fao56 r s is the shortwave radiation and r nl is the net longwave radiation derived from air temperature actual vapor pressure and r s see fao56 although evapotranspiration is an instantaneous process for practical application the eto fao p m formula has been often calculated at daily decade and monthly time scales allen et al 1998 katerji and rana 2011 2014 considering the limitation of computational resources and available gcm projection data the eto is calculated using monthly meteorological data in this study more specifically the eto is firstly calculated at daily scale by the monthly averaged meteorological data and then is multiplied by the number of days of a month to form the monthly scale monthly scale of eto has been used in many theoretical studies paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 pereira et al 2021 and practical works based on gcm peng et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a harkness et al 2020 for monthly calculation fao56 suggested to calculate the soil heat flux g in eq 2 as 5 g t 0 07 t mean t 1 t mean t 1 where g t is the soil heat flux on month t t mean t 1 and t mean t 1 are the monthly mean air temperature on month t 1 and t 1 respectively 3 2 climate variable selection schemes vss for eto calculations five climate variables are required to calculate p m based eto daily maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin shortwave radiation rs wind speed w and relative humidity h in the gcm climate projections tmax and tmin are considered as the most reliable variables and are the most common variables provided by original and downscaled gcm data sources they are also the minimum data requirement for p m eto calculations rs w and h are relatively less reliable and less considered by gcm data providers fao56 provides estimation approaches for these variables when they are unavailable in practice the rs data can be estimated using the diurnal temperature range dtr namely the difference between tmax and tmin following hargreaves and samani 1982 6 r s k rs t max t min e r a where k rs and e are spatially distinct coefficients that depend on local atmosphere conditions and r a is the extraterrestrial radiation in this study for the schemes eliminating rs from gcms the rs projections were estimated by using tmax and tmin projections following paredes and pereira 2019 the coefficients k rs and e were determined by calibration based on tmax and tmin observations and coefficient c in eq 1 at each meteorological station the values are then spatially interpolated onto the 0 5 gridcells the reliability of this approach for p m eto calculation has also been verified by paredes and pereira 2019 and paredes et al 2020 when w data is unavailable a global fixed value or local average value of w is often used in related studies due to the relatively limited influence of wind speed on eto variations cook et al 2014 scheff and frierson 2014 at the monthly timescale fao56 suggests the substitution of wind speed data by regional climatic information on wind speed practices of paredes and pereira 2019 and paredes et al 2020 also have validated the reasonability of applying the local averaged wind speed to substitute the wind speed time series in this study the long term mean wind speed data of each calendar month during historical period from in situ observations is used to substitute the wind speed data for the schemes eliminating wind speed projections 7 w m i 1 n w m i n where w m is the w data to substitute the w projection of gcm and m denotes the calendar month w m i is the in situ observed w data of calendar month m and year i n is the number of years of observed w data when h data is unavailable tmin can be used to substitute or estimate the dew point temperature tdew so that calculate the actual vapor pressure for the close relationship between tmin and tdew ren et al 2016a paredes and pereira 2019 considering that tdew may not equal to tmin in arid regions allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 we established a linear regression model between tdew and tmin using meteorological observations at each 0 5 gridcell 8 t dew a t min b where a and b are the linear regression coefficients between tdew and tmin and are determined by ordinary least squares method when the relative humidity projection is unavailable tdew is estimated from the tmin projections via eq 5 and is consequently used to calculate actual vapor pressure based on the estimation approaches for missing climate variables we established five variable selection schemes vss to investigate the influence of selecting and eliminating different climate variables for gcm based eto projections 1 scheme pm all uses the conventional form of fao56 p m equation all original climate variable projections from gcm tmax tmin rs w and h are adopted 2 scheme pm twh substitutes the rs projection with the tmax and tmin projections determined from eq 4 i e only the tmax tmin w and h projections are adopted 3 scheme pm trh substitutes the w projection with long term mean wind speed data of each calendar month i e only the tmax tmin rs and h projections are adopted 4 scheme pm trw eliminates the h projection where the actual vapor pressure is estimated using the tmin projection i e only the tmax tmin rs and w projections are adopted 5 scheme pm t eliminates the rs w and h projections and only the tmax and tmin projections are adopted calculation flow of the estimation of unavailable climate variables and meanings of the five vss are shown in fig 2 3 3 statistical downscaling approaches raw gcm projections usually have coarse resolution and systematic bias to the reality thus are not suitable to be directly used for eto projection in practices the statistical downscaling procedure is typically required to make the gcm projections fit to the local climate conditions yuan et al 2016 2017 nevertheless there have been several statistical downscaling approaches and the influences of the different approaches on eto projection might be different for the five vss stated above therefore to consider the uncertainty related to the downscaling approach on eto projection we adopted four widely used statistical downscaling approaches for comparison by following yuan et al 2017 the coarse raw gcm projections are initially interpolated onto the 0 5 gridcells via bilinear interpolation and then the four statistical downscaling approaches were adopted for the interpolated gcm data respectively in order to remove the systematic biases between gcm data and in situ observations respectively a simple bias correction sbc gcm climate outputs for both the historical baseline period and future scenarios are simultaneously added for air temperature and relative humidity or multiplied for shortwave radiation and wind speed by a factor for each calendar month in order to make the long term mean values of the gcm historical output and in situ observations become the same for each calendar month 9 y his m x his m x obs m x his m y rcp m x rcp m x o bs m x his m where x his m and x rcp m are the raw gcm outputs for historical and rcp periods of calendar month m respectively y his m and y rcp m are the downscaled gcm outputs x obs m are the in situ observations x obs m and x his m are the mean values of x obs m and x his m for temperature and relative humidity data and indicate addition and subtraction respectively while for shortwave radiation and wind speed data and indicate multiplication and division respectively b simple delta change sdc the historical observational data are regarded as historical baseline data and the future scenario data are generated by adding or multiplying the historical observational data with a factor for each calendar month these factors are the differences or ratios between the climatology of gcm historical outputs and future period outputs 10 y his m x obs m y rcp m x obs m x rcp m x his m c quantile mapping bias correction qmbc this approach is similar to sbc approach but quantile quantile mapping is applied to the gcm outputs for each calendar month so that make the distribution of the gcm outputs become the same as the in situ observations in the historical period 11 y his m p x his m p x obs m p x his m p y rcp m p x rcp m p x obs m p x

frequency p d quantile mapping delta change qmdc similar to sdc but the simple factor conversion in sdc is substituted by quantile quantile mapping 12 y his m p x obs m p y rcp m p x obs m p x rcp m p x his m p details about the concept and calculation of the four statistical downscaling approaches can be found from publications of yuan et al 2016 2017 3 4 quantification of uncertainty magnitude and contribution of uncertainty sources except the differences in eto formulation uncertainty in eto projection based on gcm is also related to several uncertainty sources such as differences in emission scenarios gcms and statistical downscaling approaches yuan et al 2017 therefore eto projection results based on one vs might vary when using different emission scenarios gcms and downscaling approaches to better understand the influence of the adopted vs on eto projection practices it is necessary to quantify and realize the uncertainty magnitude contributed from these uncertainty sources under different vss this study adopted an impact modeling chain framework approach widely applied by the studies related to gcm projection uncertainty bosshard et al 2013 giuntoli et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 uncertainty sources of the impact modeling chain framework consist of four emission scenarios five gcms six statistical downscaling approaches and five vss fig 3 the eto projection uncertainty analysis in this study focused on the changes of eto during the future period δ eto 13 δ eto eto rcp et o his where et o his and eto rcp are the mean annual eto calculated from the historical and future period gcm outputs respectively according to the adopted impact modeling chain framework a total of 4 5 4 5 400 eto change projection sets are calculated for each 0 5 gridcell the standard

by vss relative to other uncertainty sources anova is commonly used to quantify the relative contributions of different uncertainty sources and is based on partitioning the total observed variances into different sources to identify the contribution of each source to the total variance anova is effective in quantitatively determining the uncertainty contribution over the impact modeling chain framework and can also considers the interactions among uncertainty sources e g the uncertainty of vss may depend on both the uncertainty of the climate variables among the gcms anova has been successfully employed in several studies related to water resources and evapotranspiration aryal et al 2019 ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 shi et al 2020 4 results 4 1 validation of fao56 based variable selection schemes before investigating the influences of vss on projection uncertainty of calculated eto it is necessary to assess and compare the reliability of the vss that only adopt part of climatic variables therefore we firstly evaluated the accuracy of the eto calculated from the four vss pm t pm trh pm trw and pm trw using the pm all derived eto as the benchmark following the approaches of paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 2021 we adopted four statistical goodness of fit indicators to assess the accuracy of the monthly eto based on the four vss fig 4 including the coefficient of determination r 2 the regression coefficient of linear regression forced to the origin b 0 the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliff efficiency of modeling ef the r 2 indicates how close are the eto from the vss and the benchmark b 0 quantifies the systematic bias b 0 1 indicates underestimation b 0 1 indicates overestimation rmse is an overall measurement of the differences between eto from the vss and the benchmarks and ef measures the relative magnitude of the mean square error relative to the benchmark data variance all four vss exhibit a high accuracy with r 2 and ef generally greater than 0 9 b 0 close to 1 and rmse below 15 mm mon over most area pm trh and pm trw are observed to be more accurate than pm twh and pm t which eliminate shortwave radiation in particular the former two exhibit r 2 and ef values close to 1 and rmse below 5 mm mon among mainland china while for the latter two ef values are below 0 9 and rmse values are over 10 mm mon in some areas this indicates the strong impact of shortwave radiation on the accuracy of calculated eto and implies that perhaps shortwave radiation should be retained in practice while wind speed and relative humidity exhibit less of an influence even though performances of the all the four vss including the pm t that uses least climate variables are still reasonable and are thus are acceptable for the analysis of eto projections which consists with the findings of ren et al 2016a and paredes et al 2020 note that the reasonable performance of these vss in eto calculation accuracy might be also attributed to the in situ correction for the coefficients in the equations estimating absent variables e g eq 4 which utilized the advantages of local climate observations paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 to sum up all vss are reasonable in eto projection practice and are suitable to be used to investigate their influence on eto projection uncertainty 4 2 quantifying the uncertainty of eto projections to have a preliminary understanding about the influence of adopted statistical downscaling approach and selection of climate variable inputs on eto projection we firstly analyzed the ensemble mean of the eto projection among all emission scenarios and gcms with using different statistical downscaling approaches and vss figs 5 and 6 the spatial trends in eto change are similar across all statistical downscaling approaches and vss with larger eto increments 100 mm over the southwestern tibetan plateau the northern boundary of china regions of the north china plain and parts of southwest china and lower increments 90 mm for other areas particularly in northwest china eto changes also varied with the statistical downscaling approaches with qmdc generally exhibiting the greatest eto increment trends in eto changes fluctuated between the vss in some regions for example unlike the other vss pm t which only uses air temperature data exhibited a minimal increasing trend in eto in north china plain suggesting that variations in radiation wind speed and humidity may be the key factors driving local eto increments these results indicate that even if under the same eto formula p m eliminating the input variables can change the eto projection magnitude fig 6 presents the std of the projected eto change among all emission scenarios and gcms for each statistical downscaling approach and vs respectively the std values essentially quantify the uncertainty of the eto projections the eto projection uncertainty is more influenced by different statistical downscaling approaches and vss compared to the corresponding ensemble means with vs values exhibiting a larger influence on the uncertainty trends of the eto projections in particular pm all and pm twh exhibited the greatest uncertainties in eto projections with higher std values generally reaching 100 mm and wider areas with high std values in particular the std values are observed to be greater for pm twh eliminating radiation input than pm all furthermore pm trh presents the lowest projection uncertainty followed by pm t with std values generally less than 50 mm and 60 mm respectively since pm t only uses air temperature data to calculate eto it would not introduce the uncertainty of other less reliable variables e g wind speed thus the calculated eto would have lower uncertainty than pm all note that the vss involving wind speed pm all pm twh and pm trw generally exhibit high uncertainty std over 80 mm over some areas such as the west of the north china plain and parts of southwest china the vss that do not involve wind speed pm trw and pm t do not present these patterns this reveals the possible key role of wind speed uncertainty in the high eto projection uncertainties of these areas similarly pm trw which eliminates relative humidity generally exhibits lower eto projection uncertainties in some regions compared to the other vss indicating that replacing the humidity projection by estimations from temperature may help to reduce the eto projection uncertainty however the vss eliminating shortwave radiation pm twh and pm t exhibit the higher eto projection uncertainty than the vss involving radiation pm trh over southeast china and the mid south tibetan plateau std between 60 and 80 mm this demonstrates that replacing the radiation projections by estimations from air temperature can increase uncertainty in some regions hence retaining radiation data of gcm projections may be beneficial for eto projections results above show that eliminating the climate variable inputs does not necessarily reduce the eto projection uncertainty for example the radiation and humidity data are estimated from the other climate variables such as the tmin and diurnal temperature range which can introduce uncertainty from the substituted variables in contrast wind speed is substituted by the historical climatology rather than estimated variables directly eliminating the uncertainty from wind speed projections the selection of statistical downscaling approaches can also influence the eto projection uncertainty with qmbc generally exhibiting the lowest uncertainty across all vss fig 5 in addition trends in eto uncertainty vary between sbc sdc and qmdc for example sbc and sdc exhibit larger uncertainties over the north china plain while qmdc uncertainties are higher in the southeast coastal areas and the mid south tibetan plateau as the uncertainties of eto over these areas mainly result from different climate variable inputs this phenomenon may be attributed to the different projection uncertainty responses of the variables to the different sds fig 7 presents the partial std of the annual eto change projections over the statistical downscaling approach gcms and emission scenario for each vs respectively in order to further investigate the key uncertainty sources of the eto projections for different vss we also calculated the std of eto projections across all statistical downscaling approaches gcms and emission scenarios the fourth column named all in fig 7 despite its influence on the projection uncertainty of eto among emission scenarios and gcms statistical downscaling approach presents minimal uncertainty in eto projections with partial std values below 15 mm over most areas similar to the results of previous studies shi et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 emission scenario and gcm induce the most uncertainty on the eto projections std between 30 and 80 mm in most areas with the uncertainty from gcm having a more significant effect than that of emission scenario results also reveal that the trends in eto projection uncertainty related to uncertainty of climate variable inputs e g wind speed in fig 6 are observed in the partial std of gcm this suggests the different gcm mechanisms to be the principal cause of eto projection uncertainties 4 3 contribution of uncertainty sources on eto projections fig 7 presents the anova determined uncertainty contributions to eto change projections from the four uncertainty sources emission scenario gcm statistical downscaling approach and vs and their interactions for each gridcell consistent with the results in section 4 2 and related studies shi et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 emission scenario and gcm generally make the greatest contribution to eto projection uncertainties over mainland china 20 60 in most areas while statistical downscaling approach and vs exhibit the lowest uncertainty contributions 10 in most areas the uncertainty contribution of vs is lower than that reported in the literature of shi et al 2020 this may be because the vss employed in the current study are based on the same p m formula ensuring consistency in the calculated eto magnitudes among different schemes note that the uncertainty contribution of the interaction between the different uncertainty sources are also non negligible contributing 30 60 of the uncertainty over some regions such as the mid south tibetan plateau and areas around the north china plain this trend is similar to the uncertainty patterns related to the selection or elimination of wind speed and radiation figs 6 and 7 more specifically selecting high uncertainty variables or eliminating stable variables can directly determine the magnitude of uncertainty propagated to the eto projections fig 8 4 4 roles of the climate variables in eto projection uncertainty our results demonstrate that although vs exhibits a relatively low uncertainty contribution the interactions with gcm still result in a marked eto projection uncertainty in some areas this may be attributed to the different uncertainty levels among emission scenarios and gcms for different climate variables thus the influence of the climate variable projection uncertainties on eto projections still requires further investigation figs 9 and 10 depict the ensemble means and stds of the climate variable projections a comparison of the ensemble means of variable changes in fig 9 and the stds in fig 10 allows us to easily identify the uncertainty level of the climate variables in different areas for example the ensemble means of air temperature changes generally exceeds 1 5 c while the std is below 1 5 c indicating the relatively small uncertainty level of air temperature moreover the overall change in shortwave radiation is 4 8 w m2 in southeast china while its corresponding std is just 4 w m2 also demonstrating the lower uncertainty level of shortwave radiation in contrast wind speed is associated with great uncertainty over some areas including the west north china plain and parts of southwest china although wind speed exhibits an augmented ensemble mean approx 0 2 0 6 m s over these areas the corresponding std is much larger approx 0 6 1 5 m s and even higher revealing the lower reliability of wind speed projections over these areas furthermore these areas correspond to those with high eto projection uncertainties for wind speed related vss figs 6 and 7 further suggesting that the local high eto projection uncertainty is generally a result of the uncertain wind speed projections these areas are generally located around to or near the boundary of the first and second ladder in mainland china with a complex topography fig 1 this may explain the high uncertainty of wind speed in these regions as wind speed simulations are sensitive to complex topography rasmussen et al 2011 thus wind speed should be used with caution for eto projections over these areas the std of projections across emission scenarios and gcms for the diurnal temperature range dtr used to estimate radiation and relative humidity are also larger than the ensemble means of dtr change projections in some areas for example in the mid south tibetan plateau dtr exhibits a high std of approximately 1 0 1 5 c while the ensemble mean of dtr change is generally lower than 1 0 c in the southeast shore of china where dtr shows almost no overall change corresponding std values are determined close to 0 5 c this may be attributed to the higher uncertainty of vss that eliminate radiation compared to the other vss moreover trends in the ensemble mean of dtr and shortwave radiation changes are different and almost opposing over the tibetan plateau fig 9 these findings suggest that replacing the radiation projection by estimations derived from air temperature should be used with caution 5 discussion although the standard fao56 p m formula is recommended for eto calculations allen et al 1998 the requirement of multiple climate variable inputs is usually far from satisfaction in the current study we evaluated the selection and elimination of climate variables by the missing variable estimation approaches which provides the reference in the selection of climate variables for eto projections when not all variables are available and highlights the importance and reliability of the variables in gcm projections to provide references for other areas across the globe we calculated the ensemble mean and std of the raw climate variable projections not downscaled among emission scenarios and gcms from the raw gcm projections fig 11 this can increase the understanding of global application conditions of eto projections based on our results air temperature variables including tmax and tmin are the basic requirement for eto calculations air temperature is also one of the most reliable and readily available gcm projections as the uncertainty level is generally smaller than the overall trend fig 11 tmax and tmin can also provide information related to other climate variables e g shortwave radiation and humidity allen et al 1998 therefore only using the temperature to project eto is focal point of discussion almorox et al 2015 the effectiveness of the temperature only empirical eto formulas represented by the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1982 is also reported by numerous studies almorox et al 2015 kay and davies 2008 peng et al 2017 however these empirical formulas may tend to overestimate the eto under high temperature conditions sheffield et al 2012 the current study also demonstrated the potential of using just air temperature data for eto calculations via the physical p m formula scheme pm t with relatively low uncertainties exhibited among most regions in the case of missing or unreliable climate variables the temperature only p m formula can be a relatively feasible solution over areas where dtr and shortwave radiation exhibit similar trends fig 11 our results suggest that shortwave radiation should be retained for eto projections compared to the other variables this is mainly attributed to the relatively small projection uncertainty vss including radiation as an input generally exhibit a lower uncertainty than those eliminating radiation fig 6 fig 11 also demonstrates that the std of shortwave radiation is generally smaller than the overall trend in most areas around the world moreover in terms of reliability research has identified shortwave radiation as a major factor determining eto trends in many regions of china and the united states hobbins et al 2012 shaw and riha 2011 wang et al 2017c in practice whether selecting or eliminating wind speed depends on local conditions and thus its role in eto projections is complicated when wind speed is unavailable it is typically substituted by a single value or historical climatology allen et al 1998 cook et al 2014 rather than estimated from other climate projections in most land surface areas around the world change in wind speed are minimal and our results demonstrate that the scheme eliminating wind speed pm trh shows little differences in ensemble mean change and uncertainty with the complete set scheme pm all across these areas this suggests that wind speed may be a marginal variable that can be eliminated over these areas however in other areas wind speed is associated with large projection uncertainty with evident ensemble mean variations as well as high stds that reach two times those of the corresponding ensemble mean changes significantly enhancing the uncertainty of eto projections these areas are distributed in or around the north china plain east siberia eastern europe india south of the brazilian highlands north america etc the majority of which exhibit complex terrain thus the selection or elimination of wind speed should be performed with caution over these regions as they are linked with higher uncertainties as well as potentially missing important trends for such cases if there is evidence that wind speed is less likely to be the major driver of local eto change wind speed can be eliminated compared to wind speed the elimination of relative humidity which is replaced by estimations from the tmin projections has a weaker impact on eto projection uncertainties fig 6 although the scheme eliminating relative humidity underestimates the ensemble mean of eto changes in some areas these differences are generally smaller than the local uncertainty level therefore relative humidity can possibly be replaced by tmin estimations note that in some regions outside china e g mid west siberia relative humidity projections exhibit higher stds than the overall change this is not observed in our results across china and thus more caution should be taken for these areas additionally eliminating the relative humidity might be risky for arid or semi arid areas as the difference between tmin and tdew is generally not negligible over these areas allen et al 1998 our study inevitably has some restrictions although cmip5 has provided a large number of gcms it is less likely to assess all gcms and scenarios due to the limited data availability and computational resources for practical studies particularly for modeling chains including downscaling mcsweeney and jones 2016 as a result using a small subset of gcms typically five gcms can be more feasible however previous research has suggested that using just five gcms may underestimate the uncertainty among all cmip5 gcms mcsweeney and jones 2016 therefore the application of different gcms may alter our results in order to increase the representativeness of the results we adopted the five isi mip selected gcms which have been widely employed for the assessment of water resource and agriculture responses to climate change yang et al 2019b blanc 2017 blanc and sultan 2015 qin et al 2020 6 conclusions in the current study we focus on investigating the influence of selecting or eliminating different climate variables on fao56 based eto projections and on evaluating the uncertainty contributions from different sources on eto projections based on gcms the modeling chain of four emission scenarios five gcms four statistical downscaling approaches and five vss were adopted mainland china with its varied terrain and climate types is selected as the study area the key conclusions are described as follows 1 except air temperature priority should be given to shortwave radiation for eto projection among the climate variables this is attributed to its small projection uncertainty and its key role in driving eto change across many global regions wind speed and relative humidity are considered as marginal variables in most areas and can be eliminated in some complex terrain regions wind speed has considerable projection uncertainty and can largely enhance the uncertainty of eto projections thus cautions should be paid for this condition 2 for all vss differences in gcms generally contribute the most uncertainty to eto projections while differences in emission scenarios generally rank second differences in statistical downscaling approaches have a limited contribution to the uncertainty of eto projections 10 in most areas indicating that the selection of statistical downscaling approaches has less impact on all vss in eto projection above all this study shows the applicability of using the missing value estimation approaches for the fao56 p m formula to perform future eto forecasting for the practices with limited gcm data availability this study also pointed out the key and marginal climate variables for eto projection and the relative impacts of uncertainty sources on eto projection when using different climate variables thereby provides practical reference for facilitating reliable eto forecasting applications declaration of competing

9844,the projection of reference crop evapotranspiration eto based on global climate models gcms is an important task in many fields under climate change background however eto projections are typically hindered by the limited data availability or high uncertainty of the gcm projected climate variable for eto calculation e g radiation and wind speed in the current study we investigate how the selection of climate variables for eto calculation would influence the reliability and uncertainty of the eto projections based on the penman monteith p m formula and the missing variable estimation approaches provided by fao five variable selection schemes vss that select different subsets of the climate variables for eto calculation are established four emission scenarios five gcms and four statistical downscaling approaches were adopted and their uncertainty contributions were quantified by analyses of variation anova approach results show that among the climate variables except air temperature shortwave radiation caused the lowest uncertainty to the projected eto and is thus suggested as the most suitable variable to be considered for eto projections in most areas wind speed and relative humidity are determined as marginal variables for their limited influences in eto projections yet in some complex terrain regions wind speed could propagate considerable uncertainty to the projected eto differences in gcms is the major source of uncertainty in eto projections while the emission scenario generally ranked as second statistical downscaling approaches contribute limited uncertainty below 10 to eto projections above all this study shows the applicability of using the missing value estimation approaches for the fao56 p m formula to perform future eto projection for the practices with limited gcm data availability and can serve as the reference for selecting suitable variables for eto forecasting in applications keywords reference crop

of 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evaporation from an extensive surface of green grass cover of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered allen et al 1998 eto is key for the determination of the irrigation demand of crops in agricultural management allen et al 1998 xiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b 2019a eto is also useful in many other fields as it can be used as input of hydrological modeling and drought index calculation and used as indicator to evaluate climate change effects lai et al 2019 li et al 2020a zhong et al 2019 global air temperature has been increased over the past decades due to climate change as a main consequence of rising greenhouse gas ghg emissions this has consequently changed the hydrological cycle and intensified evapotranspiration at the global scale huss and hock 2018 ipcc 2013 li et al 2020b 2020c wang et al 2017a wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 enhanced evapotranspiration has been found to pose a threat to local water resources agriculture and ecological systems douville et al 2013 harkness et al 2020 li et al 2020d 2018 sterling et al 2013 wang et al 2018a 2017b and was reported as a factor causing severe drought cook et al 2014 wang et al 2018b therefore the application of clear effective approaches for the projection of eto changes are required zhao et al 2019b 2019a global climate models gcms that simulate future global climate changes provided effective tool to forecast future eto changes perera et al 2014 zhao et al 2019a however due to the different modeling mechanisms ghg emission scenarios and downscaling approaches the gcms developed or attributed by different institutes might output quite different projection results hence projection uncertainty remains as non negligible when applying gcm projected climate variables shi et al 2020 thompson et al 2014 w wang et al 2017 2015 yuan et al 2017 therefore the climate variables projected by gcms usually feature low stability and reliability which limits the effectiveness of gcms based eto forecasting applications kay and davies 2008 kingston et al 2009 mcafee 2013 shi et al 2020 w wang et al 2017 the physical based penman monteith p m formula recommended by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 hereafter as fao56 allen et al 1998 is a well known and widely recognized eto formula for gcm based future eto projection it can accurately derive eto and is also widely regarded as the benchmark to evaluate the performance of other eto estimation approaches paredes and pereira 2019 w yang et al 2019 y yang et al 2019 traditionally the fao56 p m approach requires complete climate variable sets that are well known as air temperature net radiation wind speed and relative humidity before eto calculation it is essential to verify the quality of available climate data and prioritize the use of fao56 p m approach when all variables are usable nevertheless in some practical applications some gcm climate variables might be unavailable restricting the use of the conventional p m approach for gcm based eto projection almorox et al 2015 kay and davies 2008 moreover some gcm projected variables e g wind speed and relative humidity are usually relatively less reliable hence their application in eto calculation may enlarge uncertainties in eto projections randall et al 2007 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2015 these limitations might be overcome by adopting simpler eto formulas that require fewer climate variables almorox et al 2015 kay and davies 2008 paredes et al 2020 however simplified formulas may cannot reasonably capture eto trends mcafee 2013 paredes et al 2020 for instance the temperature based empirical approaches like hargeaves samani formula have higher sensitiveness to air temperature thus their accuracy and uncertainty would be larger due to the great implication of global warming which restricts their applicable conditions baguis et al 2009 mcafee 2013 paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 therefore how to effectively project eto via gcms with limited climate variables and select suitable variables to project eto require further research meanwhile for conditions that data of some variables e g radiation wind speed humidity required for eto calculation are missing fao56 also provided approaches to estimate them by using the air temperature data paredes et al 2020 and ren et al 2016a 2016b have also evaluated the approaches estimating the absent variables for p m formula and found that p m formula with using only temperature still provided reasonable eto estimation and outperformed the simplified temperature based formula nevertheless to the authors knowledge applicability of these estimation approaches for eto projection based on gcms remain to be assessed in the current study with a focus on the fao56 p m formula and the approaches estimating missing variables provided by fao56 we aim to investigate the uncertainty of gcm based eto projections when different climate variables are selected for or eliminated from eto calculations mainland china is taken as the study area because of the vast territory and various humid and arid climate conditions the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate how the selection of climate variables used for eto calculation would influence the projections uncertainty of eto and thus to determine which variables are essential or marginal and 2 to quantify the relative impact of three uncertainty sources i e the differences in emission scenarios gcms and downscaling approaches on eto projections under different climate variable selection schemes so that help to understand the performance of the variable selection schemes under the potential application conditions this study can serve as a reference for selecting suitable climate variables for eto forecasting based on gcm projection for practical conditions with limited data availability and help to understand the relationship between eto projection uncertainty and the adopted climate variable inputs thus helps to facilitate reliable eto forecasting 2 study area and data 2 1 study area mainland china fig 1 with its vast territory and climatic conditions is selected as the study area the elevation is high in the west while low in the east forming a three ladder like terrain wang et al 2017b the eastern and southern regions are generally covered by plain and low hills with a humid subtropical or temperate monsoon climate the northwest region is less influenced by the southeast monsoon and is thus dominated by the arid or semi arid temperate continental climate the southwest is located in the tibetan plateau the highest plateau in the world and is thus dominated by a plateau and alpine climate as a consequence of the various climates and terrains mainland china contains numerous landform and land cover types including forestlands grasslands croplands wetlands deserts and glaciers in addition agriculture is one of the most important industries with cropland occupying an extensive proportion of mainland china however agricultural production and ecological systems are highly sensitive to climate change and the induced severe drought li et al 2018 2020d piao et al 2010 2 2 gcm data the gcm climate projection data from five gcms were adopted from the 5th phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 including gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m these gcms were also selected by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip which aims to provide a consistent set of global impact simulations in the agriculture water biome health and infrastructure sectors at different levels of global warming hempel et al 2013 future climate projections of these gcms were simulated based on the ghg emission scenario set named representative concentration pathways rcps we considered the gcm projections under four rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp 8 5 representing low to high ghg emission levels respectively moss et al 2010 the climate variables used in the gcm projection include daily maximum and minimum air temperature shortwave radiation wind speed and relative humidity all the climate projection data were in monthly scale note that the daily maximum and minimum air temperature data are the maximum minimum air temperature of each day after monthly averaging we used 30 year periods for both the historical baseline 1976 2005 and the future rcp scenario 2041 2070 the gcm projection data were downloaded from the world data center for climate wdcc data portal https cera www dkrz de wdcc ui cerasearch 2 3 in situ climate observations in situ observations of the daily maximum and minimum air temperature sunshine duration hours wind speed and relative humidity were adopted for the statistical downscaling of the gcm projections and coefficient estimations air temperature data was obtained from the 0 5 resolution gridded air temperature dataset over mainland china developed by the china meteorological administration cma this dataset is generated from the observations of 2400 meteorological stations across china using thin plate spline tps interpolation and accounts for elevation the cma dataset has been successfully applied to previous research on eto wang et al 2017c wind speed and relative humidity data were derived from the same 2400 meteorological stations fig 1 and spatially interpolated into the same 0 5 resolution gridcells as the air temperature dataset via tps interpolation the shortwave radiation data was calculated using the sunshine duration data collected from the 2400 meteorological stations via the following formula recommended by fao56 1 r s c r a a s b s n n r a where r s is the actual shortwave radiation r a is the extraterrestrial solar radiation calculated via local latitude and the date c is the transmissivity coefficient n is the sunshine duration n is the maximum possible sunshine duration hours and a s and b s are coefficients that depend on local atmospheric conditions the in situ observed incoming shortwave radiation data of 120 radiation stations located across china see fig 1 from cma were used to estimate a s and b s for each radiation stations the estimated a s ranges from 0 1 to 0 29 while b s ranges from 0 46 to 0 64 over mainland china which are generally in the reasonable ranges see fig a1 in appendix the estimated coefficients were then interpolated into the meteorological stations to calculate the local shortwave radiation via the sunshine duration data which was then spatially interpolated onto the 0 5 resolution gridcells all in situ climate data were obtained daily during 1976 2005 because the eto was calculated for monthly scale in this study the monthly averages were taken for these data note that all in situ cma climate data including the meteorological data from 2400 meteorological stations and the radiation data from the 120 radiation stations have been passed through the rigorous quality control procedures by cma such procedures include climatic range check internal consistency check temporal and spatial consistency check and management by quality control flags in this study the data records not marked by correct flag were regarded as missing values 3 methods 3 1 fao56 penman monteith formula fao56 defines eto at daily scale as the following formula 2 eto 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where t mean r n u 2 and e a are the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c net radiation mj m2 day wind speed at 2 m height m s and actual vapor pressure kpa respectively and δ g γ and e s are the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c soil heat flux mj m2 day psychrometric constant kpa c and saturated vapor pressure kpa respectively all of which are calculated using air temperature data details of calculation formula please see fao56 t mean is typically set to the average of the daily maximum and minimum air temperature abbreviated as tmax and tmin respectively while e a is determined as the product of relative humidity and e s the net radiation r n can be calculated as 3 r n r ns r nl 4 r ns 1 α r s where r ns is the net incoming shortwave radiation α is the albedo set as 0 23 according to fao56 r s is the shortwave radiation and r nl is the net longwave radiation derived from air temperature actual vapor pressure and r s see fao56 although evapotranspiration is an instantaneous process for practical application the eto fao p m formula has been often calculated at daily decade and monthly time scales allen et al 1998 katerji and rana 2011 2014 considering the limitation of computational resources and available gcm projection data the eto is calculated using monthly meteorological data in this study more specifically the eto is firstly calculated at daily scale by the monthly averaged meteorological data and then is multiplied by the number of days of a month to form the monthly scale monthly scale of eto has been used in many theoretical studies paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 pereira et al 2021 and practical works based on gcm peng et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a harkness et al 2020 for monthly calculation fao56 suggested to calculate the soil heat flux g in eq 2 as 5 g t 0 07 t mean t 1 t mean t 1 where g t is the soil heat flux on month t t mean t 1 and t mean t 1 are the monthly mean air temperature on month t 1 and t 1 respectively 3 2 climate variable selection schemes vss for eto calculations five climate variables are required to calculate p m based eto daily maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin shortwave radiation rs wind speed w and relative humidity h in the gcm climate projections tmax and tmin are considered as the most reliable variables and are the most common variables provided by original and downscaled gcm data sources they are also the minimum data requirement for p m eto calculations rs w and h are relatively less reliable and less considered by gcm data providers fao56 provides estimation approaches for these variables when they are unavailable in practice the rs data can be estimated using the diurnal temperature range dtr namely the difference between tmax and tmin following hargreaves and samani 1982 6 r s k rs t max t min e r a where k rs and e are spatially distinct coefficients that depend on local atmosphere conditions and r a is the extraterrestrial radiation in this study for the schemes eliminating rs from gcms the rs projections were estimated by using tmax and tmin projections following paredes and pereira 2019 the coefficients k rs and e were determined by calibration based on tmax and tmin observations and coefficient c in eq 1 at each meteorological station the values are then spatially interpolated onto the 0 5 gridcells the reliability of this approach for p m eto calculation has also been verified by paredes and pereira 2019 and paredes et al 2020 when w data is unavailable a global fixed value or local average value of w is often used in related studies due to the relatively limited influence of wind speed on eto variations cook et al 2014 scheff and frierson 2014 at the monthly timescale fao56 suggests the substitution of wind speed data by regional climatic information on wind speed practices of paredes and pereira 2019 and paredes et al 2020 also have validated the reasonability of applying the local averaged wind speed to substitute the wind speed time series in this study the long term mean wind speed data of each calendar month during historical period from in situ observations is used to substitute the wind speed data for the schemes eliminating wind speed projections 7 w m i 1 n w m i n where w m is the w data to substitute the w projection of gcm and m denotes the calendar month w m i is the in situ observed w data of calendar month m and year i n is the number of years of observed w data when h data is unavailable tmin can be used to substitute or estimate the dew point temperature tdew so that calculate the actual vapor pressure for the close relationship between tmin and tdew ren et al 2016a paredes and pereira 2019 considering that tdew may not equal to tmin in arid regions allen et al 1998 paredes and pereira 2019 we established a linear regression model between tdew and tmin using meteorological observations at each 0 5 gridcell 8 t dew a t min b where a and b are the linear regression coefficients between tdew and tmin and are determined by ordinary least squares method when the relative humidity projection is unavailable tdew is estimated from the tmin projections via eq 5 and is consequently used to calculate actual vapor pressure based on the estimation approaches for missing climate variables we established five variable selection schemes vss to investigate the influence of selecting and eliminating different climate variables for gcm based eto projections 1 scheme pm all uses the conventional form of fao56 p m equation all original climate variable projections from gcm tmax tmin rs w and h are adopted 2 scheme pm twh substitutes the rs projection with the tmax and tmin projections determined from eq 4 i e only the tmax tmin w and h projections are adopted 3 scheme pm trh substitutes the w projection with long term mean wind speed data of each calendar month i e only the tmax tmin rs and h projections are adopted 4 scheme pm trw eliminates the h projection where the actual vapor pressure is estimated using the tmin projection i e only the tmax tmin rs and w projections are adopted 5 scheme pm t eliminates the rs w and h projections and only the tmax and tmin projections are adopted calculation flow of the estimation of unavailable climate variables and meanings of the five vss are shown in fig 2 3 3 statistical downscaling approaches raw gcm projections usually have coarse resolution and systematic bias to the reality thus are not suitable to be directly used for eto projection in practices the statistical downscaling procedure is typically required to make the gcm projections fit to the local climate conditions yuan et al 2016 2017 nevertheless there have been several statistical downscaling approaches and the influences of the different approaches on eto projection might be different for the five vss stated above therefore to consider the uncertainty related to the downscaling approach on eto projection we adopted four widely used statistical downscaling approaches for comparison by following yuan et al 2017 the coarse raw gcm projections are initially interpolated onto the 0 5 gridcells via bilinear interpolation and then the four statistical downscaling approaches were adopted for the interpolated gcm data respectively in order to remove the systematic biases between gcm data and in situ observations respectively a simple bias correction sbc gcm climate outputs for both the historical baseline period and future scenarios are simultaneously added for air temperature and relative humidity or multiplied for shortwave radiation and wind speed by a factor for each calendar month in order to make the long term mean values of the gcm historical output and in situ observations become the same for each calendar month 9 y his m x his m x obs m x his m y rcp m x rcp m x o bs m x his m where x his m and x rcp m are the raw gcm outputs for historical and rcp periods of calendar month m respectively y his m and y rcp m are the downscaled gcm outputs x obs m are the in situ observations x obs m and x his m are the mean values of x obs m and x his m for temperature and relative humidity data and indicate addition and subtraction respectively while for shortwave radiation and wind speed data and indicate multiplication and division respectively b simple delta change sdc the historical observational data are regarded as historical baseline data and the future scenario data are generated by adding or multiplying the historical observational data with a factor for each calendar month these factors are the differences or ratios between the climatology of gcm historical outputs and future period outputs 10 y his m x obs m y rcp m x obs m x rcp m x his m c quantile mapping bias correction qmbc this approach is similar to sbc approach but quantile quantile mapping is applied to the gcm outputs for each calendar

and contribution of uncertainty sources except the differences in eto formulation uncertainty in eto projection based on gcm is also related to several uncertainty sources such as differences in emission scenarios gcms and statistical downscaling approaches yuan et al 2017 therefore eto projection results based on one vs might vary when using different emission scenarios gcms and downscaling approaches to better understand the influence of the adopted vs on eto projection practices it is necessary to quantify and realize the uncertainty magnitude contributed from these uncertainty sources under different vss this study adopted an impact modeling chain framework approach widely applied by the studies related to gcm projection uncertainty bosshard et al 2013 giuntoli et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 uncertainty sources of the impact modeling chain framework consist of four emission scenarios five gcms six statistical downscaling approaches and five vss fig 3 the eto projection uncertainty analysis in this study focused on the changes of eto during the future period δ eto 13 δ eto eto rcp et o his where et o his and eto rcp are the mean annual eto calculated from the historical and future period gcm outputs respectively according to the adopted impact modeling chain framework a total of 4 5 4 5 400 eto change projection sets are calculated for each 0 5 gridcell the standard deviation std is used to quantify the uncertainty magnitude of the eto change projections among different uncertainty sources for example in order to determine the uncertainty magnitude among all gcms and emission scenarios for a specific downscale approach and vs we defined the std as 14 st d k l 1 i j 1 i 1 i j 1 j δ eto i j k l δ eto o o k l 2 where st d k l is the std among all gcms and emission scenarios for the k th statistical downscaling approach and l th vs δ et o i j k l is the eto change projected by the i th emission scenario j th gcm emission scenarios for k th statistical downscaling approach and the l th vs δ eto o o k l is the mean value of the eto variations across all emission scenarios and gcms for the k th statistical downscaling approach and l th vs and i and j are the number of emission scenarios and gcms respectively in order to quantify the uncertainty magnitude of a particular uncertainty source emission scenario gcm statistical downscaling approach and vs independent of other uncertainty sources we define the partial std as 15 std es 1 i 1 i 1 i δ eto i o o o δ eto o o o o 2 std cm 1 j 1 j 1 j δ eto o j o o δ eto o o o o 2 std sd 1 k 1 k 1 k δ eto o

and l th vs respectively δ eto o o o o is the mean value of eto change among all uncertainty sources and i j k and l are the number of emission scenarios gcms statistical downscaling approaches and vss respectively this study adopted the analysis of variance anova approach bosshard et al 2013 déqué et al 2007 yip et al 2011 to further quantify the magnitude of eto projection uncertainty caused by vss relative to other uncertainty sources anova is commonly used to quantify the relative contributions of different uncertainty sources and is based on partitioning the total observed variances into different sources to identify the contribution of each source to the total variance anova is effective in quantitatively determining the uncertainty contribution over the impact modeling chain framework and can also considers the interactions among uncertainty sources e g the uncertainty of vss may depend on both the uncertainty of the climate variables among the gcms anova has been successfully employed in several studies related to water resources and evapotranspiration aryal et al 2019 ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 shi et al 2020 4 results 4 1 validation of fao56 based variable selection schemes before investigating the influences of vss on projection uncertainty of calculated eto it is necessary to assess and compare the reliability of the vss that only adopt part of climatic variables therefore we firstly evaluated the accuracy of the eto calculated from the four vss pm t pm trh pm trw and pm trw using the pm all derived eto as the benchmark following the approaches of paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 2021 we adopted four statistical goodness of fit indicators to assess the accuracy of the monthly eto based on the four vss fig 4 including the coefficient of determination r 2 the regression coefficient of linear regression forced to the origin b 0 the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliff efficiency of modeling ef the r 2 indicates how close are the eto from the vss and the benchmark b 0 quantifies the systematic bias b 0 1 indicates underestimation b 0 1 indicates overestimation rmse is an overall measurement of the differences between eto from the vss and the benchmarks and ef measures the relative magnitude of the mean square error relative to the benchmark data variance all four vss exhibit a high accuracy with r 2 and ef generally greater than 0 9 b 0 close to 1 and rmse below 15 mm mon over most area pm trh and pm trw are observed to be more accurate than pm twh and pm t which eliminate shortwave radiation in particular the former two exhibit r 2 and ef values close to 1 and rmse below 5 mm mon among mainland china while for the latter two ef values are below 0 9 and rmse values are over 10 mm mon in some areas this indicates the strong impact of shortwave radiation on the accuracy of calculated eto and implies that perhaps shortwave radiation should be retained in practice while wind speed and relative humidity exhibit less of an influence even though performances of the all the four vss including the pm t that uses least climate variables are still reasonable and are thus are acceptable for the analysis of eto projections which consists with the findings of ren et al 2016a and paredes et al 2020 note that the reasonable performance of these vss in eto calculation accuracy might be also attributed to the in situ correction for the coefficients in the equations estimating absent variables e g eq 4 which utilized the advantages of local climate observations paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 to sum up all vss are reasonable in eto projection practice and are suitable to be used to investigate their influence on eto projection uncertainty 4 2 quantifying the uncertainty of eto projections to have a preliminary understanding about the influence of adopted statistical downscaling approach and selection of climate variable inputs on eto projection we firstly analyzed the ensemble mean of the eto projection among all emission scenarios and gcms with using different statistical downscaling approaches and vss figs 5 and 6 the spatial trends in eto change are similar across all statistical downscaling approaches and vss with larger eto increments 100 mm over the southwestern tibetan plateau the northern boundary of china regions of the north china plain and parts of southwest china and lower increments 90 mm for other areas particularly in northwest china eto changes also varied with the statistical downscaling approaches with qmdc generally exhibiting the greatest eto increment trends in eto changes fluctuated between the vss in some regions for example unlike the other vss pm t which only uses air temperature data exhibited a minimal increasing trend in eto in north china plain suggesting that variations in radiation wind speed and humidity may be the key factors driving local eto increments these results indicate that even if under the same eto formula p m eliminating the input variables can change the eto projection magnitude fig 6 presents the std of the projected eto change among all emission scenarios and gcms for each statistical downscaling approach and vs respectively the std values essentially quantify the uncertainty of the eto projections the eto projection uncertainty is more influenced by different statistical downscaling approaches and vss compared to the corresponding ensemble means with vs values exhibiting a larger influence on the uncertainty trends of the eto projections in particular pm all and pm twh exhibited the greatest uncertainties in eto projections with higher std values generally reaching 100 mm and wider areas with high std values in particular the std values are observed to be greater for pm twh eliminating radiation input than pm all furthermore pm trh presents the lowest projection uncertainty followed by pm t with std values generally less than 50 mm and 60 mm respectively since pm t only uses air temperature data to calculate eto it would not introduce the uncertainty of other less reliable variables e g wind speed thus the calculated eto would have lower uncertainty than pm all note that the vss involving wind speed pm all pm twh and pm trw generally exhibit high uncertainty std over 80 mm over some areas such as the west of the north china plain and parts of southwest china the vss that do not involve wind speed pm trw and pm t do not present these patterns this reveals the possible key role of wind speed uncertainty in the high eto projection uncertainties of these areas similarly pm trw which eliminates relative humidity generally exhibits lower eto projection uncertainties in some regions compared to the other vss indicating that replacing the humidity projection by estimations from temperature may help to reduce the eto projection uncertainty however the vss eliminating shortwave radiation pm twh and pm t exhibit the higher eto projection uncertainty than the vss involving radiation pm trh over southeast china and the mid south tibetan plateau std between 60 and 80 mm this demonstrates that replacing the radiation projections by estimations from air temperature can increase uncertainty in some regions hence retaining radiation data of gcm projections may be beneficial for eto projections results above show that eliminating the climate variable inputs does not necessarily reduce the eto projection uncertainty for example the radiation and humidity data are estimated from the other climate variables such as the tmin and diurnal temperature range which can introduce uncertainty from the substituted variables in contrast wind speed is substituted by the historical climatology rather than estimated variables directly eliminating the uncertainty from wind speed projections the selection of statistical downscaling approaches can also influence the eto projection uncertainty with qmbc generally exhibiting the lowest uncertainty across all vss fig 5 in addition trends in eto uncertainty vary between sbc sdc and qmdc for example sbc and sdc exhibit larger uncertainties over the north china plain while qmdc uncertainties are higher in the southeast coastal areas and the mid south tibetan plateau as the uncertainties of eto over these areas mainly result from different climate variable inputs this phenomenon may be attributed to the different projection uncertainty responses of the variables to the different sds fig 7 presents the partial std of the annual eto change projections over the statistical downscaling approach gcms and emission scenario for each vs respectively in order to further investigate the key uncertainty sources of the eto projections for different vss we also calculated the std of eto projections across all statistical downscaling approaches gcms and emission scenarios the fourth column named all in fig 7 despite its influence on the projection uncertainty of eto among emission scenarios and gcms statistical downscaling approach presents minimal uncertainty in eto projections with partial std values below 15 mm over most areas similar to the results of previous studies shi et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 emission scenario and gcm induce the most uncertainty on the eto projections std between 30 and 80 mm in most areas with the uncertainty from gcm having a more significant effect than that of emission scenario results also reveal that the trends in eto projection uncertainty related to uncertainty of climate variable inputs e g wind speed in fig 6 are observed in the partial std of gcm this suggests the different gcm mechanisms to be the principal cause of eto projection uncertainties 4 3 contribution of uncertainty sources on eto projections fig 7 presents the anova determined uncertainty contributions to eto change projections from the four uncertainty sources emission scenario gcm statistical downscaling approach and vs and their interactions for each gridcell consistent with the results in section 4 2 and related studies shi et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 emission scenario and gcm generally make the greatest contribution to eto projection uncertainties over mainland china 20 60 in most areas while statistical downscaling approach and vs exhibit the lowest uncertainty contributions 10 in most areas the uncertainty contribution of vs is lower than that reported in the literature of shi et al 2020 this may be because the vss employed in the current study are based on the same p m formula ensuring consistency in the calculated eto magnitudes among different schemes note that the uncertainty contribution of the interaction between the different uncertainty sources are also non negligible contributing 30 60 of the uncertainty over some regions such as the mid south tibetan plateau and areas around the north china plain this trend is similar to the uncertainty patterns related to the selection or elimination of wind speed and radiation figs 6 and 7 more specifically selecting high uncertainty variables or eliminating stable variables can directly determine the magnitude of uncertainty propagated to the eto projections fig 8 4 4 roles of the climate variables in eto projection uncertainty our results demonstrate that although vs exhibits a relatively low uncertainty contribution the interactions with gcm still result in a marked eto projection uncertainty in some areas this may be attributed to the different uncertainty levels among emission scenarios and gcms for different climate variables thus the influence of the climate variable projection uncertainties on eto projections still requires further investigation figs 9 and 10 depict the ensemble means and stds of the climate variable projections a comparison of the ensemble means of variable changes in fig 9 and the stds in fig 10 allows us to easily identify the uncertainty level of the climate variables in different areas for example the ensemble means of air temperature changes generally exceeds 1 5 c while the std is below 1 5 c indicating the relatively small uncertainty level of air temperature moreover the overall change in shortwave radiation is 4 8 w m2 in southeast china while its corresponding std is just 4 w m2 also demonstrating the lower uncertainty level of shortwave radiation in contrast wind speed is associated with great uncertainty over some areas including the west north china plain and parts of southwest china although wind speed exhibits an augmented ensemble mean approx 0 2 0 6 m s over these areas the corresponding std is much larger approx 0 6 1 5 m s and even higher revealing the lower reliability of wind speed projections over these areas furthermore these areas correspond to those with high eto projection uncertainties for wind speed related vss figs 6 and 7 further suggesting that the local high eto projection uncertainty is generally a result of the uncertain wind speed projections these areas are generally located around to or near the boundary of the first and second ladder in mainland china with a complex topography fig 1 this may explain the high uncertainty of wind speed in these regions as wind speed simulations are sensitive to complex topography rasmussen et al 2011 thus wind speed should be used with caution for eto projections over these areas the std of projections across emission scenarios and gcms for the diurnal temperature range dtr used to estimate radiation and relative humidity are also larger than the ensemble means of dtr change projections in some areas for example in the mid south tibetan plateau dtr exhibits a high std of approximately 1 0 1 5 c while the ensemble mean of dtr change is generally lower than 1 0 c in the southeast shore of china where dtr shows almost no overall change corresponding std values are determined close to 0 5 c this may be attributed to the higher uncertainty of vss that eliminate radiation compared to the other vss moreover trends in the ensemble mean of dtr and shortwave radiation changes are different and almost opposing over the tibetan plateau fig 9 these findings suggest that replacing the radiation projection by estimations derived from air temperature should be used with caution 5 discussion although the standard fao56 p m formula is recommended for eto calculations allen et al 1998 the requirement of multiple climate variable inputs is usually far from satisfaction in the current study we evaluated the selection and elimination of climate variables by the missing variable estimation approaches which provides the reference in the selection of climate variables for eto projections when not all variables are available and highlights the importance and reliability of the variables in gcm projections to provide references for other areas across the globe we calculated the ensemble mean and std of the raw climate variable projections not downscaled among emission scenarios and gcms from the raw gcm projections fig 11 this can increase the understanding of global application conditions of eto projections based on our results air temperature variables including tmax and tmin are the basic requirement for eto calculations air temperature is also one of the most reliable and readily available gcm projections as the uncertainty level is generally smaller than the overall trend fig 11 tmax and tmin can also provide information related to other climate variables e g shortwave radiation and humidity allen et al 1998 therefore only using the temperature to project eto is focal point of discussion almorox et al 2015 the effectiveness of the temperature only empirical eto formulas represented by the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1982 is also reported by numerous studies almorox et al 2015 kay and davies 2008 peng et al 2017 however these empirical formulas may tend to overestimate the eto under high temperature conditions sheffield et al 2012 the current study also demonstrated the potential of using just air temperature data for eto calculations via the physical p m formula scheme pm t with relatively low uncertainties exhibited among most regions in the case of missing or unreliable climate variables the temperature only p m formula can be a relatively feasible solution over areas where dtr and shortwave radiation exhibit similar trends fig 11 our results suggest that shortwave radiation should be retained for eto projections compared to the other variables this is mainly attributed to the relatively small projection uncertainty vss including radiation as an input generally exhibit a lower uncertainty than those eliminating radiation fig 6 fig 11 also demonstrates that the std of shortwave radiation is generally smaller than the overall trend in most areas around the world moreover in terms of reliability research has identified shortwave radiation as a major factor determining eto trends in many regions of china and the united states hobbins et al 2012 shaw and riha 2011 wang et al 2017c in practice whether selecting or eliminating wind speed depends on local conditions and thus its role in eto projections is complicated when wind speed is unavailable it is typically substituted by a single value or historical climatology allen et al 1998 cook et al 2014 rather than estimated from other climate projections in most land surface areas around the world change in wind speed are minimal and our results demonstrate that the scheme eliminating wind speed pm trh shows little differences in ensemble mean change and uncertainty with the complete set scheme pm all across these areas this suggests that wind speed may be a marginal variable that can be eliminated over these areas however in other areas wind speed is associated with large projection uncertainty with evident ensemble mean variations as well as high stds that reach two times those of the corresponding ensemble mean changes significantly enhancing the uncertainty of eto projections these areas are distributed in or around the north china plain east siberia eastern europe india south of the brazilian highlands north america etc the majority of which exhibit complex terrain thus the selection or elimination of wind speed should be performed with caution over these regions as they are linked with higher uncertainties as well as potentially missing important trends for such cases if there is evidence that wind speed is less likely to be the major driver of local eto change wind speed can be eliminated compared to wind speed the elimination of relative humidity which is replaced by estimations from the tmin projections has a weaker impact on eto projection uncertainties fig 6 although the scheme eliminating relative humidity underestimates the ensemble mean of eto changes in some areas these differences are generally smaller than the local uncertainty level therefore relative humidity can possibly be replaced by tmin estimations note that in some regions outside china e g mid west siberia relative humidity projections exhibit higher stds than the overall change this is not observed in our results across china and thus more caution should be taken for these areas additionally eliminating the relative humidity might be risky for arid or semi arid areas as the difference between tmin and tdew is generally not negligible over these areas allen et al 1998 our study inevitably has some restrictions although cmip5 has provided a large number of gcms it is less likely to assess all gcms and scenarios due to the limited data availability and computational resources for practical studies particularly for modeling chains including downscaling mcsweeney and jones 2016 as a result using a small subset of gcms typically five gcms can be more feasible however previous research has suggested that using just five gcms may underestimate the uncertainty among all cmip5 gcms mcsweeney and jones 2016 therefore the application of different gcms may alter our results in order to increase the representativeness of the results we adopted the five isi mip selected gcms which have been widely employed for the assessment of water resource and agriculture responses to climate change yang et al 2019b blanc 2017 blanc and sultan 2015 qin et al 2020 6 conclusions in the current study we focus on investigating the influence of selecting or eliminating different climate variables on fao56 based eto projections and on evaluating the uncertainty contributions from different sources on eto projections based on gcms the modeling chain of four emission scenarios five gcms four statistical downscaling approaches and five vss were adopted mainland china with its varied terrain and climate types is selected as the study area the key conclusions are described as follows 1 except air temperature priority should be given to shortwave radiation for eto projection among the climate variables this is attributed to its small projection uncertainty and its key role in driving eto change across many global regions wind speed and relative humidity are considered as marginal variables in most areas and can be eliminated in some complex terrain regions wind speed has considerable projection uncertainty and can largely enhance the uncertainty of eto projections thus cautions should be paid for this condition 2 for all vss differences in gcms generally contribute the most uncertainty to eto projections while differences in emission scenarios generally rank second differences in statistical downscaling approaches have a limited contribution to the uncertainty of eto projections 10 in most areas indicating that the selection of statistical downscaling approaches has less impact on all vss in eto projection above all this study shows the applicability of using the missing value estimation approaches for the fao56 p m formula to perform future eto forecasting for the practices with limited gcm data availability this study also pointed out the key and marginal climate variables for eto projection and the relative impacts of uncertainty sources on eto projection when using different climate variables thereby provides practical reference for facilitating reliable eto forecasting applications declaration of competing
