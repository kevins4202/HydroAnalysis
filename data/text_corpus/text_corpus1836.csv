9180,when fertigation is applied fertilizer is often injected into drip irrigation systems according to a single pulse application method spam where a single dose is given either in the early middle or late stage of an irrigation event to improve the consistency of distributions between nutrients and roots and thus promote root nutrient uptake a root distribution based multistage application method rmam was proposed where fertilizer was injected in stages during each irrigation event and proportionally according to the distribution of normalized root length density a case study to verify the potential of rmam and to test it against other fertigation scheduling strategies was conducted in a two year field experiment with drip irrigated cotton under film mulch in xinjiang china results indicated fertilizer application strategies significantly impacted soil nutrient dynamics generally spam caused nutrient accumulation in certain soil layers while uniform multistage application method umam resulted in a more even nutrient profile optimal nutrient profile for root uptake was obtained by rmam where more nutrients were located in the upper soil layers containing more roots compared to late stage spam the best among all the schemes of umam and spam rmam did not influence deep leaching of mineral n and available p but did reduce leachate of available k by an average of 3 5 during the fertigation periods over the two seasons furthermore at the late boll opening stage due to 25 8 35 7 and 35 3 increases of average aboveground accumulation representing root nutrient uptake for n p and k average soil residual respectively decreased 23 8 6 2 and 3 1 and average cotton yield enhanced 5 5 besides root length density crop nutrient uptake is also affected by many other complicated factors such as soil water nutrient dynamics and root uptake activity and thus rmam should be further investigated to consider these factors comprehensively keywords fertigation scheduling normalized root length density nutrient transport root nutrient uptake drip irrigated cotton under film mulch data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions with unavoidable water and salinity stresses crops are often subject to limited soil nutrient availability chen et al 2010 wang et al 2018 sustainable agricultural production in these areas therefore pursues how to improve root zone soil environmental conditions and thus to increase water and fertilizer use efficiencies in the last decades water saving irrigation especially drip irrigation has been developed worldwide with a rapidly increasing application area due to its contribution to saving water and fertilizer mitigating salinization impact and enhancing crop yield film mulched drip irrigation has gained popularity furthermore when it is utilized for nutrient management fertigation its contribution to sustainable agricultural development accentuated ning et al 2021 zong et al 2021 nutrient distribution and root uptake are expected to be functions of the interaction between soil water flow and solute transport in a system in which nutrients are injected into irrigation pipe network and delivered as fertigation products during the fertigating process nutrients are carried by infiltrating water flow and transported downwards rapidly with the downward transport subsequently declining and ultimately ceasing hanson et al 2006 azad et al 2018 consequently the earlier fertilizer is applied during an irrigation event the deeper nutrients are transported formulation of a fertigation protocol including rate and timing of injection and delivery of nutrients is critical for efficient fertilizer use but is closely related to nutrient types soil water flow conditions root distribution and initial soil nutrient status russo 2016 kim et al 2018 chen et al 2019 there has been quite some speculation regarding design of such protocols but there is little data and or mechanism based evidence regarding optimal fertilizer application schemes in fertigation systems silber et al 2003 bar tal et al 2020 due to the simplicity of its operation the single pulse application method spam in which fertilizer is injected and delivered in a single dose alternatively in the early middle or late stage of an irrigation event has been widely adopted cote et al 2003 hou et al 2007 2009 generally spam tends to create zones of nutrient accumulation with the backward adjustment of fertilizer application timing from early to middle and even to late stage nutrient accumulation zone gradually moves up from deeper to upper soil layers azad et al 2018 ma et al 2021 experimental studies indicated that late stage spam was more efficient in enhancing crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency hou et al 2007 however inconsistent experimental results were subsequently found by the same research team with similar or even decreased yield driven by late spam hou et al 2009 contradictory results simulated with the hydrus 2d model simunek et al 1999 were also provided by cote et al 2003 and gärdenäs et al 2005 according to different assumptions and parameters regarding root distribution and uptake as well as other simulation conditions therefore we suggest that optimal and efficient fertigation schemes should be based on the processes and mechanisms affecting nutrient transport and uptake besides the amount of nutrients in root zone root nutrient uptake is also undoubtedly influenced by nutrient distribution relative to roots in cases with constant soil nutrient amount and identical water and salinity conditions consistent distribution patterns implying more nutrients in soil layers with more roots should be beneficial for nutrient uptake due to shorter distance and lower resistance for nutrient transport from soil to roots otherwise if the majority of nutrients are located in soil layers with few roots the longer distance and higher resistance of nutrient transport to roots will complicate uptake goins and russelle 1996 schwab et al 2000 crop roots are typically distributed in shallow soil layers and gradually lessen with soil depth zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 this likely explains why late stage spam has been found more favorable to crop nutrient uptake than early or middle stage spam representing a higher coincidence degree between nutrients and roots hence we hypothesized that enhancing the coincidence degree between nutrients and roots would be an effective way to promote nutrient uptake and thus increase fertilizer use efficiency subsequently the objective of this study was to improve fertigation scheduling by injecting and delivering fertilizer according to root distribution and comparing its performance with the traditional approaches xinjiang is a typical arid region in china with an important agriculturally based economy we took the most popular crop in this region drip irrigated cotton under film mulch as a case study to evaluate and optimize fertigation protocols a two year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of various fertilizer application scenarios on nutrient soil mineral n available p and k transport and uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 improving fertigation protocols based on root distribution crop root density typically demonstrate a decreasing trend from soil surface to rooting depth although root distributions are strongly dependent on the interactive effects of crop species growth stages soil and climate conditions irrigation and fertilization the distributions of normalized root length density nrld can often be described by a generalized function as follows zuo et al 2013 1 l n r d z r p 1 z r p 1 where z r is the normalized soil depth ranging from 0 at soil surface to 1 at rooting depth z r z l r z is the vertical coordinate originating from soil surface and positive downward cm and l r is rooting depth cm l nrd z r is nrld representing the ratio of root length density at z r to the average over root zone p is a fitting parameter representing the nrld at the soil surface mainly dominated by crop s genetic characteristics and independent of other environmental factors and recommended as 1 96 for cotton fig 1 by ning et al 2015 therefore the generalized function established and tested by a large amount of measured nrld data zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 was adopted to propose a root distribution based multistage application method rmam for scheduling fertilizer injection and delivery during the fertigating process to match root distribution different percentages of fertilizer were applied at different relative times during each irrigation event the following steps were universally proposed to optimize fertilizer application according to root distribution 1 divide an irrigation event into n stages evenly from beginning to end and additionally divide the root zone into n layers from rooting depth to soil surface with the i th stage corresponding to the i th layer i 1 2 n 2 calculate the proportion of roots in each soil layer to those in the whole root zone according to the function of nrld 3 set the proportion of roots in the i th layer calculated in step 2 as the proportion of fertilizer applied in the i th stage i 1 2 n and then calculate the amount of fertilizer delivered within each stage theoretically larger n means higher coincidence degree between soil nutrients and roots and infinite n leads to continuous injection from a practical point of view each irrigation process was evenly divided into early middle and late stages n 3 as an example in this study and correspondingly deep intermediate and shallow layers were set in the root zone the nrld profile of cotton fig 1 indicated that the proportions of roots were 11 32 and 57 respectively for the deep intermediate and shallow layers which were then reflected in the relative rates of fertilizer application in the early middle and late stages of each irrigation event 2 2 field experiment the experimental site was located in the cotton breeding base of xinjiang agricultural university 85 40 33 e 44 26 20 n altitude 490 m shawan county xinjiang china liu et al 2022 the station is in a continental temperate arid region with annual values of 6 3 6 9 c mean temperature 170 190 d frost free period 140 350 mm precipitation and 1500 2000 mm evaporation the soil from 0 to 100 cm can be divided into three layers with an average salt content of 4 19 g kg 1 table 1 soil water retention was measured with a pressure membrane plate soil moisture equipment co usa and described with the closed form of van genuchten 1980 field water capacity was determined as the soil water content corresponding to 300 cm soil matric potential for silty loam romano and santini 2002 in order to maintain normal cotton growth in this region supplementary irrigation is essential and irrigation water was therefore taken from a nearby well with a salt content of 0 49 g l 1 a ph value of 7 85 and an electrical conductivity of 932 65 μs cm 1 an automatic agro meteorological station weatherhawk 500 campbell scientific usa was installed to monitor climate data including air temperature relative humidity rainfall solar radiation and wind speed a field experiment was carried out over two years with initial water storages of 214 58 and 196 26 mm in 0 100 cm soil layer cotton gossypium hirsutum l xinnongda 4 was sowed in 12 and 20 independent plots on 21 and 18 april in 2019 and 2020 and harvested on 28 160 days after sowing 160 das and 22 september 157 das respectively each plot 690 cm wide by 750 cm long contained three strips with a planting mode of one film three tapes and six rows fig 2a the interval between plants was 12 cm in each row and the space between emitters 2 4 l h 1 was 30 cm along the drip tape during the two growing seasons irrigation was scheduled according to the local practice in 2019 318 38 mm water was applied over nine events and 330 00 mm was applied in 2020 over 10 events table 2 in each growing season the first irrigation event was designed for germination within several days after sowing without fertilizer application and the remaining irrigation events were synchronized by fertilization irrigation was delayed in case of rain and the total precipitation during the growing seasons was 147 90 mm in 2019 and 63 20 mm in 2020 table 2 the specific amount of fertilizer was determined according to the expected nutrient demand at each growth stage of cotton the fertilizer allocation percentages in seedling budding flowering boll and boll opening stages were set as 3 23 67 and 7 respectively according to the nutrient demand along various growth stages and dry matter accumulation pattern makhdum et al 2007 liu et al 2022 urea monoammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate were applied as n p2o5 k2o at a rate of 187 01 139 65 130 05 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 187 01 97 77 91 03 kg ha 1 in 2020 in 2019 p and k were consistent with the local practice while n in 2019 and all nutrients in 2020 were only 70 of the local application each irrigation process was evenly divided into three stages and four t1 t4 and five t1 t5 fertigation application treatments were evaluated in 2019 and 2020 with three and four replicates respectively fig 2b the treatments of t1 t2 and t3 represented early middle and late stage spam for t4 treatment rmam was applied with the corresponding percentages of 11 32 and 57 respectively a uniform multistage application method umam was referenced as t5 treatment in 2020 delivering fertilizer evenly in the early middle and late stages field management measures such as topping herbicide and insecticide were conducted according to local commercial practices chen et al 2010 zong et al 2021 to investigate the effects of fertilizer application protocols on soil water and nutrient dynamics 3 4 soil sampling events were carried out within a typical fertigation period in the late flowering boll stage with strong demand for water and nutrient in 2019 periodic soil sampling started on 109 das prior to the fertigation event on 110 das and followed by two sampling events on 111 and 116 das before the next fertigation event on 118 das similarly the periodic soil sampling in 2020 started on 89 das before the fertigation event on 90 das and then three sampling events were conducted on 91 93 98 das but the following fertigation event designed on 99 das was actually carried out on 104 das due to rainfall around a cotton seedling randomly chosen from the bilateral strips in each plot an auger 8 cm inner diameter and 20 cm length was used to sample soil at a 10 cm vertical interval from 5 to 95 cm fig 2a and rooting depth was determined when few roots were found in deeper soil in order to investigate the effects of fertilizer application protocols on cotton growth as well as soil water and nutrient reserves three additional crop and soil sampling events were also implemented in the early and late flowering boll stages prior to fertigation and in the late boll opening stage before defoliant spraying and harvest 79 99 and 147 das in 2019 83 103 and 144 das in 2020 for each sampling three plants were randomly selected from the bilateral strips in each plot to obtain the canopies around one of the three plants soil was sampled as the same way mentioned above and rooting depth was also monitored each soil sample was divided into four parts to measure the contents of water mineral n no 3 n and nh 4 n available p and k respectively through the methods as follows tao et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zong et al 2021 the first part was dried to constant weight at 105 c for soil water content the second was extracted with 2 0 mol l 1 kcl as a ratio of 1 5 and mineral n was analyzed by a flow auto analyzer aa3 seal analytical germany the third was air dried and extracted with 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 as a ratio of 1 20 and available p was analyzed by a flow auto analyzer the fourth was also air dried but extracted with 1 0 mol l 1 nh4oac as a ratio of 1 20 and available k was analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer pinaacle 900 t perkinelmer usa the sampled leaves were scanned and then analyzed by the winrhizo pro software package regent instruments inc quebec canada for leaf area dry weight of canopy was obtained by drying to constant weight at 75 c mineralized with h2so4 and h2o2 n and p in aboveground biomass were analyzed by a flow auto analyzer and k was measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer by excluding 1 5 m at both ends of the middle strip a non sampling zone 4 5 2 3 m2 was reserved to measure yield manually 2 3 calculation of indexes fertilizer partial productivity pfp kg kg 1 was estimated as yang et al 2014 liang and shi 2021 2 pfp y f where y was cotton yield kg ha 1 f was the corresponding application rate of n p2o5 or k2o during growth season respectively kg ha 1 during the typical fertigation period soil water flux through the lower boundary of root zone q w mm d 1 was calculated according to darcy s law chen and liu 2002 wang et al 2006 3 q w 10 k h h z 1 where h was the soil matric potential at the lower boundary of root zone cm determined according to the measured soil water content and the soil water retention curve k h was the soil hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 subsequently soil nutrient flux q n kg ha 1 d 1 was estimated as 4 q n 0 01 q w c s where c s was the concentration of nutrient in soil solution mg l 1 to compare the distribution patterns between soil nutrients and roots under each treatment soil nutrient contents measured at a 10 cm interval in root zone during the typical fertigation period were normalized as the function initially proposed for root length density wu et al 1999 5 c n z r c z r 0 1 c z r d z r where c n z r was the normalized soil nutrient content representing the ratio of nutrient content at z r to the average in root zone c z r was soil nutrient content mg kg 1 to quantitatively evaluate the coincidence degree between the normalized profiles of soil nutrient content and root length density three indicators such as correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r 2 and residual sum of squares r ss were adopted 2 4 statistical analysis all experimental data were shown as the averages of replicates and analyzed by microsoft excel 2019 microsoft corporation usa origin software origin lab usa was used to plot figures spss 20 0 software package international business machines corporation usa was applied to conduct the analysis of variance anova a duncan multiple range test at p 0 05 was carried out to determine if significant difference occurred among treatments 3 results 3 1 the effects of fertigation protocols on soil water and nutrient dynamics the field experimental data in 2019 and 2020 indicated that fertilizer application schemes did not significantly affect soil water dynamics for any soil sampling event no significant difference was found among the treatments for the average soil water contents in 0 100 cm p 0 05 and the standard error of soil water contents at each depth was generally less than 0 05 cm3 cm 3 therefore for each sampling event the soil water contents measured at same depth were averaged under all the treatments with 12 replicates in 2019 and 20 replicates in 2020 fig 3 within the typical fertigation periods 2019 109 118 das 2020 89 104 das soil water contents in the bottom zone from 60 to 100 cm were hardly impacted by irrigation and root water uptake and tended to be constant at 0 20 0 05 cm3 cm 3 corresponding to about 90 of field water capacity fig 3 nevertheless in the middle 30 60 cm and especially top 0 30 cm zones soil water contents changed drastically rapidly increasing after irrigation 111 das 2019 and 91 das in 2020 and then gradually decreasing until the next irrigation event rooting depth reached 80 cm at the early flowering boll stage about 80 das and remained unchanged until harvest mainly driven by the gravitational potential gradient the relatively stable soil water contents at 60 100 cm led to deep leaching through the lower boundary of root zone the total leachates during the typical sampling periods of 109 116 das in 2019 and 89 98 das in 2020 were 0 94 and 1 30 mm respectively daily leaching beyond the root zone increased to a maximum on the 3rd day after fertigation e g 0 18 mm d 1 on 93 das in 2020 and subsequently decreased until the next irrigation event fig 4a compared to soil water soil nutrient dynamics was more complicated influenced by fertilizer application schemes and nutrient type figs 4b and 5 the effects in the two growing seasons were fairly consistent and thus only the soil nutrient dynamics during the typical fertigation period in 2020 is presented fig 5 including all the designed fertigation protocols t1 t5 and the considered nutrients soil mineral n available p and k due to the slow decomposition process of urea on the 1st day after fertigation 91 das soil mineral n no 3 n and nh 4 n content at any depth was only a little higher than that prior to fertigation on 89 das while n significantly increased to a maximum content on the 3rd day 93 das thereafter on the 8th day 98 das soil mineral n content in each soil layer fell back to close to initial level before fertigation fig 5a the profiles on 93 das fully demonstrated the differences among treatments especially n accumulation due to spam postponing fertilizer application time from the early stage of an irrigation event t1 to middle t2 or even late stage t3 n accumulation shifted from the bottom to middle or even to top zone whether for the early middle or late stage spam the average soil mineral n content in the accumulation zone about 30 cm in depth reached nearly twice that found in the other soil layers different from t1 and t2 soil mineral n contents under t3 generally decreased with soil depth like the generalized distribution of nrld fig 1 under the t4 treatment rmam soil mineral n contents also gradually decreased with soil depth in a pattern similar to nrld compared to late stage spam rmam led to lower soil mineral n content in the top zone and higher content in the bottom zone fig 5a in comparison to spam and rmam uniform application in the early middle and late stages umam t5 caused a more homogeneous profile of soil mineral n content with no observed accumulation under t2 and especially t1 treatments soil mineral n content was negatively related to nrld table 3 compared to t1 t2 and t5 treatments between the normalized profiles of root length density and soil mineral n content on 93 das higher correlation coefficient r and determination coefficient r 2 and lower residual sum of squares r ss were found under t3 and especially t4 treatments table 3 different from soil mineral n available p and k at almost every depth reached the maximal content on the 1st day after fertigation 91 das and then gradually fell back to the similar level prior to fertigation until the next fertigation event fig 5b and c in general fertilizer application protocols influenced soil available p and k dynamics in similar patterns as soil mineral n but the effects on available k were weaker and even less on available p between the normalized profiles of root length density and soil available p and k contents on 91 das the highest r and r 2 were also observed under t4 and the lowest r ss occurred under t3 or t4 relative to soil mineral n and available k most available p tended to accumulate in the upper soil layers in a similar manner and thus the difference of r r 2 and r ss among the five treatments was smaller fig 5b table 3 however compared to the early middle or late stage spam the multistage application methods rmam and umam resulted in available p distributions more similar to nrld with higher r and r 2 as well as lower r ss with deep leaching of soil water fig 4a nutrient leaching through the lower boundary of the root zone occurred regardless of fertigation protocols fig 4b although the loss of soil available p by leaching was small and nearly negligible it was significant for mineral n and especially available k during the typical fertigation periods for all the treatments the average leachates of mineral n and available p and k were 1 13 0 58 and 42 98 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 1 89 0 34 and 44 96 kg ha 1 in 2020 respectively the leaching loss of available p was not significantly affected by fertilizer application schemes for mineral n or available k leachate loss was always the highest when fertilizer was applied in the early stage t1 and decreased gradually when application was postponed to middle t2 and to late t3 stages compared to late stage spam the deep losses under umam were higher and similar under rmam for mineral n but both lower for available k fig 4b the data in both years measured before fertigation and harvest indicated that the temporary effects of fertilizer application schemes on soil nutrient dynamics fig 5 led to cumulative effects on soil nutrient reserves fig 6 compared to early middle stage spam or umam late stage spam and especially rmam resulted in lower soil nutrient especially mineral n reserves in 0 100 cm especially 60 100 cm 3 2 the effects of fertigation protocols on cotton growth and nutrient uptake compared to 2019 even with identical fertilizer application schemes growth indicators and yield in 2020 were lower with less rainfall and application of p and k fertilizers table 2 cotton under the different fertilizer application treatments maintained a relatively uniform growth pattern in the two growth seasons leaf area decreased slowly after reaching a maximum at the late flowering boll stage about 100 das while aboveground dry weight increased continuously fig 7 however plant growth dynamics were affected following three fertilizer application events with different schemes e g on 83 das in 2020 significant differences in leaf area index and aboveground dry weight were maintained until harvest fig 7 and were finally reflected in cotton yield fig 8a when other conditions were the same for the three treatments of spam changing fertilizer application timing from early stage of an irrigation event t1 to middle t2 and further to later stage t3 led to a general increasing trend for cotton growth indexes such as leaf area index and aboveground dry weight fig 7 as well as yield and nutrient use efficiency fig 8 however the effects were not always obvious and almost all significant increases occurred after the late flowering boll stage compared to t1 and t2 for example significant enhancement in cotton growth under t3 was found after 100 das in both 2019 and 2020 while yield was only significantly affected in 2020 with an increase of 5 7 6 8 resulting from the backward adjustment of fertilizer injection timing the positive effects on cotton growth and production under t3 were supported by more root nutrient uptake fig 9 the experimental results in 2020 showed that compared to umam t5 although late stage spam t3 failed to enhance yield and nutrient use efficiency fig 8 while cotton growth and nutrient uptake figs 7 and 9 were significantly promoted additionally compared to t3 rmam t4 significantly facilitated nutrient uptake and plant growth with an increased range higher than 10 for the corresponding indexes in the late boll opening stage figs 7 and 9 driven by rmam the increase in cotton yield reached 4 9 in 2020 and 6 2 in 2019 leading to an average increase of 5 5 in fertilizer partial productivity fig 8 obviously among the five fertilizer application schemes rmam was the optimal leading to the highest yield and fertilizer use efficiency 4 discussion fertigation scheduling during drip irrigation events did not significantly affect soil water dynamics during both experimental seasons based on the local irrigation experience the profile averaged soil water contents were kept almost higher than 70 of field water capacity for all treatments fig 3 within an optimal soil water range feddes et al 1978 leading to desired growth and yield of cotton at the cost of significant deep leaching losses of water and nutrients fig 4 besides nutrient types nutrient leaching loss was also strongly dependent on fertilizer application schemes fig 4b under the optimal soil water conditions fig 3 fertilizer application schemes significantly influenced soil nutrient dynamics fig 5 by dominating the duration and distance of convection transport of solutes carried by downward soil water flow even for nearly stable soil water contents below 60 cm depth the existing gravitational potential gradient drove soil nutrients to the depth of 60 80 cm or even beyond the rooting depth of 80 cm theoretically the earlier fertilizer is applied during an irrigation event the deeper nutrients will be transported azad et al 2018 and 2020 but this effect is also dependent on solute mobility donagemma et al 2008 brown et al 2017 for mobile ions such as mineral n and available k early middle and late spam readily caused nutrient accumulation in the bottom 60 100 cm middle 30 60 cm and top zone 0 30 cm respectively fig 5 agreeing well with the previous studies ma et al 2021 therefore relative to late spam with identical water leaching fig 4a middle especially early spam resulted in more nutrient leaching loss fig 4b which was proportional to the nutrient concentration in soil solution advected across the lower boundary of the root zone as eq 4 different from mineral n and available k available p is more difficult to mobilize and transport and thus most of the p was concentrated in the upper soil layers for all the three spam treatments however middle and especially early spam relieved the accumulation effect and transported more available p to deeper soil layers fig 5b adjusting pulse application from one spam to three times rmam and umam nutrient accumulation was avoided to some extent for mineral n and available k and for available p it was also significantly mitigated as a result of higher fertilizer application frequency clothier and green 1994 ben gal and dudley 2003 mohammad et al 2004 among the five schemes rmam minimized deep nutrient leaching due to the lowest soil nutrient content at the lower boundary of root zone a smoother and more favorable soil nutrient profile might be expected by increasing fertilizer application frequency or even carrying out a continuous application scheme based on rmam for early stage spam the lowest coincidence degree between the normalized profiles of soil nutrient content and root length density table 3 was related to inconsistent or even opposite distributions figs 1 and 5 which would cause the greatest resistance for root uptake goins and russelle 1996 schwab et al 2000 taking the situation on 93 das the 3rd day after fertigation in 2020 as an example the roots in the shallow layer 0 27 cm of root zone 0 80 cm accounted for 57 fig 1 but were surrounded by only 28 of the total root zone mineral n under the t1 treatment relative to root uptake demand insufficient n supply in this soil layer led to the lowest average soil mineral n content on 98 das 12 5 mg kg 1 among the five treatments fig 5a in contrary for the deep layer 53 80 cm of root zone 11 of roots were supplied by 41 of the total mineral n and thus surplus n exceeding root uptake demand was readily percolated downward fig 4b therefore among the five schemes early stage spam resulted in the lowest nutrient uptake fig 9 and highest leaking loss fig 4b and soil reserve fig 6 as well as the minimum growth indices fig 7 yield and fertilizer use efficiency fig 8 since more nutrients especially available p were accumulated in the shallow layer and less in the middle and deep layers of root zone coinciding better with roots late spam obtained better results than middle and especially early spam in many aspects such as deep leaking soil residual root uptake crop growth and yield figs 4 9 table 3 this finding was generally consistent with previous studies indicating that the widely adopted late spam is generally reasonable hou et al 2007 azad et al 2018 ma et al 2021 in a two year greenhouse experiment conducted by hou et al 2007 compared to early spam late spam increased cotton yield by 12 1 however a field experiment hou et al 2009 showed a slight decrease of cotton yield for late spam under conditions of moderate salinity but no differences were found under low or high salinity conditions the divergence among various researches might be mainly caused by different soil water flow conditions bristow et al 2000 cote et al 2003 gärdenäs et al 2005 superior to late spam rmam obtained the highest coincidence degree between nutrients and roots figs 1 and 5 table 3 indicating the most favorable allocation of nutrients for root uptake on 93 das in 2020 soil mineral n in the shallow intermediate and deep layers of root zone accounted for 42 34 and 24 fig 5a respectively which agreed well with root distribution fig 1 among the five schemes evaluated in the current study the greatest nutrient uptake found under rmam fig 9 resulted in the most significant enhancement in cotton growth fig 7 yield and fertilizer use efficiency fig 8 and thus the least deep losses in leachate fig 4b and lowest soil residuals fig 6 compared to rmam although umam also applied fertilizer through three times its worse performance might be resulted from insufficient nutrient supply to roots in the top zone similar to that under early spam obviously fertigation scheduling affects soil nutrient transport and distribution and further impacts nutrient uptake as well as crop growth and yields haynes 1985 cote et al 2003 li et al 2004 hou et al 2007 to enhance the coincidence degree between soil nutrients and roots timing and rate were optimized for fertilizer injection based on root profile rmam compared to spam t1 t3 or umam t5 rmam t4 achieved the expected target to increase yield and fertilizer use efficiency by creating more advantageous soil nutrient conditions for root uptake validating the feasibility for optimization however significant losses of mineral n and especially available k to deep soils with leachate still occurred in addition relative to soil mineral n and available k available p still showed much lower coincidence degree with roots under rmam table 3 further improvement may be possible through 1 fully considering the effects of soil water and nutrient dynamics root zone soil water and nutrient dynamics are purpose and environment dependent and change with crop growth as well as increasing rooting depth thereupon designed wetting depth and thus fertilizer application scheme should be correspondingly and timely adjusted for example following three designed soil wetting depths of 40 for saving water 60 and 80 cm for leaching salt combined with a definite rooting depth of 60 cm would require different fertigation schedules e g application times timing and rate unfortunately the current rmam has not yet considered the challenges posed by the dynamic relationship between rooting depth and designed soil wetting depth additionally soil nutrient dynamics during fertigating process is affected inevitably by the factors impacting soil water flow e g irrigation frequency irrigation intensity soil properties and initial soil water conditions as well as nutrient types and initial soil nutrient conditions vanderborght and vereecken 2007 sadeghi and jones 2012 wang et al 2017 azad et al 2020 which have also not been considered for example frequency of irrigation events and rainfall are expected to influence not only water and nutrient profiles but also possibly soil oxygen and root distribution patterns wang et al 2006 rank and vishnu 2021 these could additionally explain discrepancies between results from various studies regarding effects of fertigation timing in the present study except the first event for germination irrigation was applied about every 5 10 days at rates of 30 35 mm per event trends of increasing irrigation frequency with drip systems designed to increase both water uptake efficiency segal et al 2006 shao et al 2009 and nutrient use efficiency ben gal and dudley 2003 assouline et al 2006 where theoretically the cotton in this study would receive about 10 mm of water every 2 3 days would likely concentrate roots in shallow soil layers as well as lessen the horizontal transport of solutes we suspect that the combined effects of increased irrigation frequency would not likely change the results or conclusions of this study but it is a topic worthy of further research in order to deal with the mentioned challenges it would be wise to numerically simulate soil water and nutrient dynamics under complicated conditions for screening and optimizing rational fertigation protocols hanson et al 2006 azad et al 2018 specific schemes are also obviously necessary for different nutrient types for instance for available p with poor mobility a higher application percentage might be firstly adopted in the early stage of an irrigation event in comparison to mobile nutrients such as mineral n and available k secondly as shown in fig 5b and table 3 increasing fertilizer application frequencies during a single irrigation event or implementing a continuous variable application method should be feasible to alleviate p accumulation in the upper soil layers clothier and green 1994 ben gal and dudley 2003 silber et al 2003 mohammad et al 2004 ben gal and dudley 2003 in their study of p dynamics found advantage of lower dripper flow rates and continuous fertilizer application throughout irrigation events in increasing p availability and use efficiency as sorption was minimized thirdly other technical measures to enhance p mobility such as applying p activators lombi et al 2005 carter et al 2009 can also be considered 2 exploring an effective index to accurately characterize root uptake activity essentially rmam intends to coordinate the distributions of soil nutrient supply and root uptake activity in fact it is very difficult to accurately characterize root uptake activity pierret et al 2005 shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 water uptake coefficient per unit root length is often assumed as a constant in the root zone indicating a linearly proportional relationship between root water uptake rate and root length density under optimal water conditions feddes et al 1978 wu et al 1999 based on this hypothesis and a large number of available experimental data regarding root length density the generalized quantitative description of nrld as eq 1 zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 was used to represent the distribution of root uptake activity in many previous studies shi et al 2015 2020 2021 as well as in this study however research has shown that not all roots have uptake function and the uptake activities of roots or various parts are different from each other relatively younger roots are much more likely to actively absorb water than older roots slatyer 1960 gao et al 1998 pierret et al 2005 in view of this determining a fertilizer application scheme based on nrld distribution might lead to a deviation between the profiles of soil nutrients and root uptake activity moreover relative to root length some recent studies have demonstrated more significant linearly proportional relationship between root uptake activity and root nitrogen mass shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 therefore as an alternative of nrld distribution normalized root nitrogen mass density distribution might be more reasonably to characterize root nutrient uptake activity and to optimize fertilizer application scheme however corresponding experimental or statistical data are scarce and further studies are needed 5 conclusions under the conditions developed in the current study the fertilizer application schemes significantly influenced the transport of soil nutrients deep leaching residual contents as well as the absorption of soil nutrients crop growth and yield generally spam caused significant nutrient accumulation in certain soil layers depending on application timing and nutrient mobility and umam produced a more uniform nutrient profile nevertheless rmam resulted in an optimal nutrient profile for root uptake where more nutrients were in the upper soil layers with more roots therefore rmam significantly promoted crop nutrient uptake growth and production and reduced leachate loss and soil residue beneficial for environmental protection and sustainable agricultural development however in addition to root length density crop nutrient uptake is also affected by many other complicated purpose and environment dependent factors related with soil water nutrient dynamics and root uptake activity further improvement is necessary for rmam to take soil water nutrient dynamics

9180,when fertigation is applied fertilizer is often injected into drip irrigation systems according to a single pulse application method spam where a single dose is given either in the early middle or late stage of an irrigation event to improve the consistency of distributions between nutrients and roots and thus promote root nutrient uptake a root distribution based multistage application method rmam was proposed where fertilizer was injected in stages during each irrigation event and proportionally according to the distribution of normalized root length density a case study to verify the potential of rmam and to test it against other fertigation scheduling strategies was conducted in a two year field experiment with drip irrigated cotton under film mulch in xinjiang china results indicated fertilizer application strategies significantly impacted soil nutrient dynamics generally spam caused nutrient accumulation in certain soil layers while uniform multistage application method umam resulted in a more even nutrient profile optimal nutrient profile for root uptake was obtained by rmam where more nutrients were located in the upper soil layers containing more roots compared to late stage spam the best among all the schemes of umam and spam rmam did not influence deep leaching of mineral n and available p but did reduce leachate of available k by an average of 3 5 during the fertigation periods over the two seasons furthermore at the late boll opening stage due to 25 8 35 7 and 35 3 increases of average aboveground accumulation representing root nutrient uptake for n p and k average soil residual respectively decreased 23 8 6 2 and 3 1 and average cotton yield enhanced 5 5 besides root length density crop nutrient uptake is also affected by many other complicated factors such as soil water nutrient dynamics and root uptake activity and thus rmam should be further investigated to consider these factors comprehensively keywords fertigation scheduling normalized root length density nutrient transport root nutrient uptake drip irrigated cotton under film mulch data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions with unavoidable water and salinity stresses crops are often subject to limited soil nutrient availability chen et al 2010 wang et al 2018 sustainable agricultural production in these areas therefore pursues how to improve root zone soil environmental conditions and thus to increase water and fertilizer use efficiencies in the last decades water saving irrigation especially drip irrigation has been developed worldwide with a rapidly increasing application area due to its contribution to saving water and fertilizer mitigating salinization impact and enhancing crop yield film mulched drip irrigation has gained popularity furthermore when it is utilized for nutrient management fertigation its contribution to sustainable agricultural development accentuated ning et al 2021 zong et al 2021 nutrient distribution and root uptake are expected to be functions of the interaction between soil water flow and solute transport in a system in which nutrients are injected into irrigation pipe network and delivered as fertigation products during the fertigating process nutrients are carried by infiltrating water flow and transported downwards rapidly with the downward transport subsequently declining and ultimately ceasing hanson et al 2006 azad et al 2018 consequently the earlier fertilizer is applied during an irrigation event the deeper nutrients are transported formulation of a fertigation protocol including rate and timing of injection and delivery of nutrients is critical for efficient fertilizer use but is closely related to nutrient types soil water flow conditions root distribution and initial soil nutrient status russo 2016 kim et al 2018 chen et al 2019 there has been quite some speculation regarding design of such protocols but there is little data and or mechanism based evidence regarding optimal fertilizer application schemes in fertigation systems silber et al 2003 bar tal et al 2020 due to the simplicity of its operation the single pulse application method spam in which fertilizer is injected and delivered in a single dose alternatively in the early middle or late stage of an irrigation event has been widely adopted cote et al 2003 hou et al 2007 2009 generally spam tends to create zones of nutrient accumulation with the backward adjustment of fertilizer application timing from early to middle and even to late stage nutrient accumulation zone gradually moves up from deeper to upper soil layers azad et al 2018 ma et al 2021 experimental studies indicated that late stage spam was more efficient in enhancing crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency hou et al 2007 however inconsistent experimental results were subsequently found by the same research team with similar or even decreased yield driven by late spam hou et al 2009 contradictory results simulated with the hydrus 2d model simunek et al 1999 were also provided by cote et al 2003 and gärdenäs et al 2005 according to different assumptions and parameters regarding root distribution and uptake as well as other simulation conditions therefore we suggest that optimal and efficient fertigation schemes should be based on the processes and mechanisms affecting nutrient transport and uptake besides the amount of nutrients in root zone root nutrient uptake is also undoubtedly influenced by nutrient distribution relative to roots in cases with constant soil nutrient amount and identical water and salinity conditions consistent distribution patterns implying more nutrients in soil layers with more roots should be beneficial for nutrient uptake due to shorter distance and lower resistance for nutrient transport from soil to roots otherwise if the majority of nutrients are located in soil layers with few roots the longer distance and higher resistance of nutrient transport to roots will complicate uptake goins and russelle 1996 schwab et al 2000 crop roots are typically distributed in shallow soil layers and gradually lessen with soil depth zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 this likely explains why late stage spam has been found more favorable to crop nutrient uptake than early or middle stage spam representing a higher coincidence degree between nutrients and roots hence we hypothesized that enhancing the coincidence degree between nutrients and roots would be an effective way to promote nutrient uptake and thus increase fertilizer use efficiency subsequently the objective of this study was to improve fertigation scheduling by injecting and delivering fertilizer according to root distribution and comparing its performance with the traditional approaches xinjiang is a typical arid region in china with an important agriculturally based economy we took the most popular crop in this region drip irrigated cotton under film mulch as a case study to evaluate and optimize fertigation protocols a two year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of various fertilizer application scenarios on nutrient soil mineral n available p and k transport and uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 improving fertigation protocols based on root distribution crop root density typically demonstrate a decreasing trend from soil surface to rooting depth although root distributions are strongly dependent on the interactive effects of crop species growth stages soil and climate conditions irrigation and fertilization the distributions of normalized root length density nrld can often be described by a generalized function as follows zuo et al 2013 1 l n r d z r p 1 z r p 1 where z r is the normalized soil depth ranging from 0 at soil surface to 1 at rooting depth z r z l r z is the vertical coordinate originating from soil surface and positive downward cm and l r is rooting depth cm l nrd z r is nrld representing the ratio of root length density at z r to the average over root zone p is a fitting parameter representing the nrld at the soil surface mainly dominated by crop s genetic characteristics and independent of other environmental factors and recommended as 1 96 for cotton fig 1 by ning et al 2015 therefore the generalized function established and tested by a large amount of measured nrld data zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 was adopted to propose a root distribution based multistage application method rmam for scheduling fertilizer injection and delivery during the fertigating process to match root distribution different percentages of fertilizer were applied at different relative times during each irrigation event the following steps were universally proposed to optimize fertilizer application according to root distribution 1 divide an irrigation event into n stages evenly from beginning to end and additionally divide the root zone into n layers from rooting depth to soil surface with the i th stage corresponding to the i th layer i 1 2 n 2 calculate the proportion of roots in each soil layer to those in the whole root zone according to the function of nrld 3 set the proportion of roots in the i th layer calculated in step 2 as the proportion of fertilizer applied in the i th stage i 1 2 n and then calculate the amount of fertilizer delivered within each stage theoretically larger n means higher coincidence degree between soil nutrients and roots and infinite n leads to continuous injection from a practical point of view each irrigation process was evenly divided into early middle and late stages n 3 as an example in this study and correspondingly deep intermediate and shallow layers were set in the root zone the nrld profile of cotton fig 1 indicated that the proportions of roots were 11 32 and 57 respectively for the deep intermediate and shallow layers which were then reflected in the relative rates of fertilizer application in the early middle and late stages of each irrigation event 2 2 field experiment the experimental site was located in the cotton breeding base of xinjiang agricultural university 85 40 33 e 44 26 20 n altitude 490 m shawan county xinjiang china liu et al 2022 the station is in a continental temperate arid region with annual values of 6 3 6 9 c mean temperature 170 190 d frost free period 140 350 mm precipitation and 1500 2000 mm evaporation the soil from 0 to 100 cm can be divided into three layers with an average salt content of 4 19 g kg 1 table 1 soil water retention was measured with a pressure membrane plate soil moisture equipment co usa and described with the closed form of van genuchten 1980 field water capacity was determined as the soil water content corresponding to 300 cm soil matric potential for silty loam romano and santini 2002 in order to maintain normal cotton growth in this region supplementary irrigation is essential and irrigation water was therefore taken from a nearby well with a salt content of 0 49 g l 1 a ph value of 7 85 and an electrical conductivity of 932 65 μs cm 1 an automatic agro meteorological station weatherhawk 500 campbell scientific usa was installed to monitor climate data including air temperature relative humidity rainfall solar radiation and wind speed a field experiment was carried out over two years with initial water storages of 214 58 and 196 26 mm in 0 100 cm soil layer cotton gossypium hirsutum l xinnongda 4 was sowed in 12 and 20 independent plots on 21 and 18 april in 2019 and 2020 and harvested on 28 160 days after sowing 160 das and 22 september 157 das respectively each plot 690 cm wide by 750 cm long contained three strips with a planting mode of one film three tapes and six rows fig 2a the interval between plants was 12 cm in each row and the space between emitters 2 4 l h 1 was 30 cm along the drip tape during the two growing seasons irrigation was scheduled according to the local practice in 2019 318 38 mm water was applied over nine events and 330 00 mm was applied in 2020 over 10 events table 2 in each growing season the first irrigation event was designed for germination within several days after sowing without fertilizer application and the remaining irrigation events were synchronized by fertilization irrigation was delayed in case of rain and the total precipitation during the growing seasons was 147 90 mm in 2019 and 63 20 mm in 2020 table 2 the specific amount of fertilizer was determined according to the expected nutrient demand at each growth stage of cotton the fertilizer allocation percentages in seedling budding flowering boll and boll opening stages were set as 3 23 67 and 7 respectively according to the nutrient demand along various growth stages and dry matter accumulation pattern makhdum et al 2007 liu et al 2022 urea monoammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate were applied as n p2o5 k2o at a rate of 187

application each irrigation process was evenly divided into three stages and four t1 t4 and five t1 t5 fertigation application treatments were evaluated in 2019 and 2020 with three and four replicates respectively fig 2b the treatments of t1 t2 and t3 represented early middle and late stage spam for t4 treatment rmam was applied with the corresponding percentages of 11 32 and 57 respectively a uniform multistage application method umam was referenced as t5 treatment in 2020 delivering fertilizer evenly in the early middle and late stages field management measures such as topping herbicide and insecticide were conducted according to local commercial practices chen et al 2010 zong et al 2021 to investigate the effects of fertilizer application protocols on soil water and nutrient dynamics 3 4 soil sampling events were carried out within a typical fertigation period in the late flowering boll stage with strong demand for water and nutrient in 2019 periodic soil sampling started on 109 das prior to the fertigation event on 110 das and followed by two sampling events on 111 and 116 das before the next fertigation event on 118 das similarly the periodic soil sampling in 2020 started on 89 das before the fertigation event on 90 das and then three sampling events were conducted on 91 93 98 das but the following fertigation event designed on 99 das was actually carried out on 104 das due to rainfall around a cotton seedling randomly chosen from the bilateral strips in each plot an auger 8 cm inner diameter and 20 cm length was used to sample soil at a 10 cm vertical interval from 5 to 95 cm fig 2a and rooting depth was determined when few roots were found in deeper soil in order to investigate the effects of fertilizer application protocols on cotton growth as well as soil water and nutrient reserves three additional crop and soil sampling events were also implemented in the early and late flowering boll stages prior to fertigation and in the late boll opening stage before defoliant spraying and harvest 79 99 and 147 das in 2019 83 103 and 144 das in 2020 for each sampling three plants were randomly selected from the bilateral strips in each plot to obtain the canopies around one of the three plants soil was sampled as the same way mentioned above and rooting depth was also monitored each soil sample was divided into four parts to measure the contents of water mineral n no 3 n and nh 4 n available p and k respectively through the methods as follows tao et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zong et al 2021 the first part was dried to constant weight at 105 c for soil water content the second was extracted with 2 0 mol l 1 kcl as a ratio of 1 5 and mineral n was analyzed by a flow auto analyzer aa3 seal analytical germany the third was air dried and extracted with 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 as a ratio of 1 20 and available p was analyzed by a flow auto analyzer the fourth was also air dried but extracted with 1 0 mol l 1 nh4oac as a ratio of 1 20 and available k was analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer pinaacle 900 t perkinelmer usa the sampled leaves were scanned and then analyzed by the winrhizo pro software package regent instruments inc quebec canada for leaf area dry weight of canopy was obtained by drying to constant weight at 75 c mineralized with h2so4 and h2o2 n and p in aboveground biomass were analyzed by a flow auto analyzer and k was measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer by excluding 1 5 m at both ends of the middle strip a non sampling zone 4 5 2 3 m2 was reserved to measure yield manually 2 3 calculation of indexes fertilizer partial productivity pfp kg kg 1 was estimated as yang et al 2014 liang and shi 2021 2 pfp y f where y was cotton yield kg ha 1 f was the corresponding application rate of n p2o5 or k2o during growth season respectively kg ha 1 during the typical fertigation period soil water flux through the lower boundary of root zone q w mm d 1 was calculated according to darcy s law chen and liu 2002 wang et al 2006 3 q w 10 k h h z 1 where h was the soil matric potential at the lower boundary of root zone cm determined according to the measured soil water content and the soil water retention curve k h was the soil hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 subsequently soil nutrient flux q n kg ha 1 d 1 was estimated as 4 q n 0 01 q w c s where c s was the concentration of nutrient in soil solution mg l 1 to compare the distribution patterns between soil nutrients and roots under each treatment soil nutrient contents measured at a 10 cm interval in root zone during the typical fertigation period were normalized as the function initially proposed for root length density wu et al 1999 5 c n z r c z r 0 1 c z r d z r where c n z r was the normalized soil nutrient content representing the ratio of nutrient content at z r to the average in root zone c z r was soil nutrient content mg kg 1 to quantitatively evaluate the coincidence degree between the normalized profiles of soil nutrient content and root length density three indicators such as correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r 2 and residual sum of squares r ss were adopted 2 4 statistical analysis all experimental data were shown as the averages of replicates and analyzed by microsoft excel 2019 microsoft corporation usa origin software origin lab usa was used to plot figures spss 20 0 software package international business machines corporation usa was applied to conduct the analysis of variance anova a duncan multiple range test at p 0 05 was carried out to determine if significant difference occurred among treatments 3 results 3 1 the effects of fertigation protocols on soil water and nutrient dynamics the field experimental data in 2019 and 2020 indicated that fertilizer application schemes did not significantly affect soil water dynamics for any soil sampling event no significant difference was found among the treatments for the average soil water contents in 0 100 cm p 0 05 and the standard error of soil water contents at each depth was generally less than 0 05 cm3 cm 3 therefore for each sampling event the soil water contents measured at same depth were averaged under all the treatments with 12 replicates in 2019 and 20 replicates in 2020 fig 3 within the typical fertigation periods 2019 109 118 das 2020 89 104 das soil water contents in the bottom zone from 60 to 100 cm were hardly impacted by irrigation and root water uptake and tended to be constant at 0 20 0 05 cm3 cm 3 corresponding to about 90 of field water capacity fig 3 nevertheless in the middle 30 60 cm and especially top 0 30 cm zones soil water contents changed drastically rapidly increasing after irrigation 111 das 2019 and 91 das in 2020 and then gradually decreasing until the next irrigation event rooting depth reached 80 cm at the early flowering boll stage about 80 das and remained unchanged until harvest mainly driven by the gravitational potential gradient the relatively stable soil water contents at 60 100 cm led to deep leaching through the lower boundary of root zone the total leachates during the typical sampling periods of 109 116 das in 2019 and 89 98 das in 2020 were 0 94 and 1 30 mm respectively daily leaching beyond the root zone increased to a maximum on the 3rd day after fertigation e g 0 18 mm d 1 on 93 das in 2020 and subsequently decreased until the next irrigation event fig 4a compared to soil water soil nutrient dynamics was more complicated influenced by fertilizer application schemes and nutrient type figs 4b and 5 the effects in the two growing seasons were fairly consistent and thus only the soil nutrient dynamics during the typical fertigation period in 2020 is presented fig 5 including all the designed fertigation protocols t1 t5 and the considered nutrients soil mineral n available p and k due to the slow decomposition process of urea on the 1st day after fertigation 91 das soil mineral n no 3 n and nh 4 n content at any depth was only a little higher than that prior to fertigation on 89 das while n significantly increased to a maximum content on the 3rd day 93 das thereafter on the 8th day 98 das soil mineral n content in each soil layer fell back to close to initial level before fertigation fig 5a the profiles on 93 das fully demonstrated the differences among treatments especially n accumulation due to spam postponing fertilizer application time from the early stage of an irrigation event t1 to middle t2 or even late stage t3 n accumulation shifted from the bottom to middle or even to top zone whether for the early middle or late stage spam the average soil mineral n content in the accumulation zone about 30 cm in depth reached nearly twice that found in the other soil layers different from t1 and t2 soil mineral n contents under t3 generally decreased with soil depth like the generalized distribution of nrld fig 1 under the t4 treatment rmam soil mineral n contents also gradually decreased with soil depth in a pattern similar to nrld compared to late stage spam rmam led to lower soil mineral n content in the top zone and higher content in the bottom zone fig 5a in comparison to spam and rmam uniform application in the early middle and late stages umam t5 caused a more homogeneous profile of soil mineral n content with no observed accumulation under t2 and especially t1 treatments soil mineral n content was negatively related to nrld table 3 compared to t1 t2 and t5 treatments between the normalized profiles of root length density and soil mineral n content on 93 das higher correlation coefficient r and determination coefficient r 2 and lower residual sum of squares r ss were found under t3 and especially t4 treatments table 3 different from soil mineral n available p and k at almost every depth reached the maximal content on the 1st day after fertigation 91 das and then gradually fell back to the similar level prior to fertigation until the next fertigation event fig 5b and c in general fertilizer application protocols influenced soil available p and k dynamics in similar patterns as soil mineral n but the effects on available k were weaker and even less on available p between the normalized profiles of root length density and soil available p and k contents on 91 das the highest r and r 2 were also observed under t4 and the lowest r ss occurred under t3 or t4 relative to soil mineral n and available k most available p tended to accumulate in the upper soil layers in a similar manner and thus the difference of r r 2 and r ss among the five treatments was smaller fig 5b table 3 however compared to the early middle or late stage spam the multistage application methods rmam and umam resulted in available p distributions more similar to nrld with higher r and r 2 as well as lower r ss with deep leaching of soil water fig 4a nutrient leaching through the lower boundary of the root zone occurred regardless of fertigation protocols fig 4b although the loss of soil available p by leaching was small and nearly negligible it was significant for mineral n and especially available k during the typical fertigation periods for all the treatments the average leachates of mineral n and available p and k were 1 13 0 58 and 42 98 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 1 89 0 34 and 44 96 kg ha 1 in 2020 respectively the leaching loss of available p was not significantly affected by fertilizer application schemes for mineral n or available k leachate loss was always the highest when fertilizer was applied in the early stage t1 and decreased gradually when application was postponed to middle t2 and to late t3 stages compared to late stage spam the deep losses under umam were higher and similar under rmam for mineral n but both lower for available k fig 4b the data in both years measured before fertigation and harvest indicated that the temporary effects of fertilizer application schemes on soil nutrient dynamics fig 5 led to cumulative effects on soil nutrient reserves fig 6 compared to early middle stage spam or umam late stage spam and especially rmam resulted in lower soil nutrient especially mineral n reserves in 0 100 cm especially 60 100 cm 3 2 the effects of fertigation protocols on cotton growth and nutrient uptake compared to 2019 even with identical fertilizer application schemes growth indicators and yield in 2020 were lower with less rainfall and application of p and k fertilizers table 2 cotton under the different fertilizer application treatments maintained a relatively uniform growth pattern in the two growth seasons leaf area decreased slowly after reaching a maximum at the late flowering boll stage about 100 das while aboveground dry weight increased continuously fig 7 however plant growth dynamics were affected following three fertilizer application events with different schemes e g on 83 das in 2020 significant differences in leaf area index and aboveground dry weight were maintained until harvest fig 7 and were finally reflected in cotton yield fig 8a when other conditions were the same for the three treatments of spam changing fertilizer application timing from early stage of an irrigation event t1 to middle t2 and further to later stage t3 led to a general increasing trend for cotton growth indexes such as leaf area index and aboveground dry weight fig 7 as well as yield and nutrient use efficiency fig 8 however the effects were not always obvious and almost all significant increases occurred after the late flowering boll stage compared to t1 and t2 for example significant enhancement in cotton growth under t3 was found after 100 das in both 2019 and 2020 while yield was only significantly affected in 2020 with an increase of 5 7 6 8 resulting from the backward adjustment of fertilizer injection timing the positive effects on cotton growth and production under t3 were supported by more root nutrient uptake fig 9 the experimental results in 2020 showed that compared to umam t5 although late stage spam t3 failed to enhance yield and nutrient use efficiency fig 8 while cotton growth and nutrient uptake figs 7 and 9 were significantly promoted additionally compared to t3 rmam t4 significantly facilitated nutrient uptake and plant growth with an increased range higher than 10 for the corresponding indexes in the late boll opening stage figs 7 and 9 driven by rmam the increase in cotton yield reached 4 9 in 2020 and 6 2 in 2019 leading to an average increase of 5 5 in fertilizer partial productivity fig 8 obviously among the five fertilizer application schemes rmam was the optimal leading to the highest yield and fertilizer use efficiency 4 discussion fertigation scheduling during drip irrigation events did not significantly affect soil water dynamics during both experimental seasons based on the local irrigation experience the profile averaged soil water contents were kept almost higher than 70 of field water capacity for all treatments fig 3 within an optimal soil water range feddes et al 1978 leading to desired growth and yield of cotton at the cost of significant deep leaching losses of water and nutrients fig 4 besides nutrient types nutrient leaching loss was also strongly dependent on fertilizer application schemes fig 4b under the optimal soil water conditions fig 3 fertilizer application schemes significantly influenced soil nutrient dynamics fig 5 by dominating the duration and distance of convection transport of solutes carried by downward soil water flow even for nearly stable soil water contents below 60 cm depth the existing gravitational potential gradient drove soil nutrients to the depth of 60 80 cm or even beyond the rooting depth of 80 cm theoretically the earlier fertilizer is applied during an irrigation event the deeper nutrients will be transported azad et al 2018 and 2020 but this effect is also dependent on solute mobility donagemma et al 2008 brown et al 2017 for mobile ions such as mineral n and available k early middle and late spam readily caused nutrient accumulation in the bottom 60 100 cm middle 30 60 cm and top zone 0 30 cm respectively fig 5 agreeing well with the previous studies ma et al 2021 therefore relative to late spam with identical water leaching fig 4a middle especially early spam resulted in more nutrient leaching loss fig 4b which was proportional to the nutrient concentration in soil solution advected across the lower boundary of the root zone as eq 4 different from mineral n and available k available p is more difficult to mobilize and transport and thus most of the p was concentrated in the upper soil layers for all the three spam treatments however middle and especially early spam relieved the accumulation effect and transported more available p to deeper soil layers fig 5b adjusting pulse application from one spam to three times rmam and umam nutrient accumulation was avoided to some extent for mineral n and available k and for available p it was also significantly mitigated as a result of higher fertilizer application frequency clothier and green 1994 ben gal and dudley 2003 mohammad et al 2004 among the five schemes rmam minimized deep nutrient leaching due to the lowest soil nutrient content at the lower boundary of root zone a smoother and more favorable soil nutrient profile might be expected by increasing fertilizer application frequency or even carrying out a continuous application scheme based on rmam for early stage spam the lowest coincidence degree between the normalized profiles of soil nutrient content and root length density table 3 was related to inconsistent or even opposite distributions figs 1 and 5 which would cause the greatest resistance for root uptake goins and russelle 1996 schwab et al 2000 taking the situation on 93 das the 3rd day after fertigation in 2020 as an example the roots in the shallow layer 0 27 cm of root zone 0 80 cm accounted for 57 fig 1 but were surrounded by only 28 of the total root zone mineral n under the t1 treatment relative to root uptake demand insufficient n supply in this soil layer led to the lowest average soil mineral n content on 98 das 12 5 mg kg 1 among the five treatments fig 5a in contrary for the deep layer 53 80 cm of root zone 11 of roots were supplied by 41 of the total mineral n and thus surplus n exceeding root uptake demand was readily percolated downward fig 4b therefore among the five schemes early stage spam resulted in the lowest nutrient uptake fig 9 and highest leaking loss fig 4b and soil reserve fig 6 as well as the minimum growth indices fig 7 yield and fertilizer use efficiency fig 8 since more nutrients especially available p were accumulated in the shallow layer and less in the middle and deep layers of root zone coinciding better with roots late spam obtained better results than middle and especially early spam in many aspects such as deep leaking soil residual root uptake crop growth and yield figs 4 9 table 3 this finding was generally consistent with previous studies indicating that the widely adopted late spam is generally reasonable hou et al 2007 azad et al 2018 ma et al 2021 in a two year greenhouse experiment conducted by hou et al 2007 compared to early spam late spam increased cotton yield by 12 1 however a field experiment hou et al 2009 showed a slight decrease of cotton yield for late spam under conditions of moderate salinity but no differences were found under low or high salinity conditions the divergence among various researches might be mainly caused by different soil water flow conditions bristow et al 2000 cote et al 2003 gärdenäs et al 2005 superior to late spam rmam obtained the highest coincidence degree between nutrients and roots figs 1 and 5 table 3 indicating the most favorable allocation of nutrients for root uptake on 93 das in 2020 soil mineral n in the shallow intermediate and deep layers of root zone accounted for 42 34 and 24 fig 5a respectively which agreed well with root distribution fig 1 among the five schemes evaluated in the current study the greatest nutrient uptake found under rmam fig 9 resulted in the most significant enhancement in cotton growth fig 7 yield and fertilizer use efficiency fig 8 and thus the least deep losses in leachate fig 4b and lowest soil residuals fig 6 compared to rmam although umam also applied fertilizer through three times its worse performance might be resulted from insufficient nutrient supply to roots in the top zone similar to that under early spam obviously fertigation scheduling affects soil nutrient transport and distribution and further impacts nutrient uptake as well as crop growth and yields haynes 1985 cote et al 2003 li et al 2004 hou et al 2007 to enhance the coincidence degree between soil nutrients and roots timing and rate were optimized for fertilizer injection based on root profile rmam compared to spam t1 t3 or umam t5 rmam t4 achieved the expected target to increase yield and fertilizer use efficiency by creating more advantageous soil nutrient conditions for root uptake validating the feasibility for optimization however significant losses of mineral n and especially available k to deep soils with leachate still occurred in addition relative to soil mineral n and available k available p still showed much lower coincidence degree with roots under rmam table 3 further improvement may be possible through 1 fully considering the effects of soil water and nutrient dynamics root zone soil water and nutrient dynamics are purpose and environment dependent and change with crop growth as well as increasing rooting depth thereupon designed wetting depth and thus fertilizer application scheme should be correspondingly and timely adjusted for example following three designed soil wetting depths of 40 for saving water 60 and 80 cm for leaching salt combined with a definite rooting depth of 60 cm would require different fertigation schedules e g application times timing and rate unfortunately the current rmam has not yet considered the challenges posed by the dynamic relationship between rooting depth and designed soil wetting depth additionally soil nutrient dynamics during fertigating process is affected inevitably by the factors impacting soil water flow e g irrigation frequency irrigation intensity soil properties and initial soil water conditions as well as nutrient types and initial soil nutrient conditions vanderborght and vereecken 2007 sadeghi and jones 2012 wang et al 2017 azad et al 2020 which have also not been considered for example frequency of irrigation events and rainfall are expected to influence not only water and nutrient profiles but also possibly soil oxygen and root distribution patterns wang et al 2006 rank and vishnu 2021 these could additionally explain discrepancies between results from various studies regarding effects of fertigation timing in the present study except the first event for germination irrigation was applied about every 5 10 days at rates of 30 35 mm per event trends of increasing irrigation frequency with drip systems designed to increase both water uptake efficiency segal et al 2006 shao et al 2009 and nutrient use efficiency ben gal and dudley 2003 assouline et al 2006 where theoretically the cotton in this study would receive about 10 mm of water every 2 3 days would likely concentrate roots in shallow soil layers as well as lessen the horizontal transport of solutes we suspect that the combined effects of increased irrigation frequency would not likely change the results or conclusions of this study but it is a topic worthy of further research in order to deal with the mentioned challenges it would be wise to numerically simulate soil water and nutrient dynamics under complicated conditions for screening and optimizing rational fertigation protocols hanson et al 2006 azad et al 2018 specific schemes are also obviously necessary for different nutrient types for instance for available p with poor mobility a higher application percentage might be firstly adopted in the early stage of an irrigation event in comparison to mobile nutrients such as mineral n and available k secondly as shown in fig 5b and table 3 increasing fertilizer application frequencies during a single irrigation event or implementing a continuous variable application method should be feasible to alleviate p accumulation in the upper soil layers clothier and green 1994 ben gal and dudley 2003 silber et al 2003 mohammad et al 2004 ben gal and dudley 2003 in their study of p dynamics found advantage of lower dripper flow rates and continuous fertilizer application throughout irrigation events in increasing p availability and use efficiency as sorption was minimized thirdly other technical measures to enhance p mobility such as applying p activators lombi et al 2005 carter et al 2009 can also be considered 2 exploring an effective index to accurately characterize root uptake activity essentially rmam intends to coordinate the distributions of soil nutrient supply and root uptake activity in fact it is very difficult to accurately characterize root uptake activity pierret et al 2005 shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 water uptake coefficient per unit root length is often assumed as a constant in the root zone indicating a linearly proportional relationship between root water uptake rate and root length density under optimal water conditions feddes et al 1978 wu et al 1999 based on this hypothesis and a large number of available experimental data regarding root length density the generalized quantitative description of nrld as eq 1 zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 was used to represent the distribution of root uptake activity in many previous studies shi et al 2015 2020 2021 as well as in this study however research has shown that not all roots have uptake function and the uptake activities of roots or various parts are different from each other relatively younger roots are much more likely to actively absorb water than older roots slatyer 1960 gao et al 1998 pierret et al 2005 in view of this determining a fertilizer application scheme based on nrld distribution might lead to a deviation between the profiles of soil nutrients and root uptake activity moreover relative to root length some recent studies have demonstrated more significant linearly proportional relationship between root uptake activity and root nitrogen mass shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 therefore as an alternative of nrld distribution normalized root nitrogen mass density distribution might be more reasonably to characterize root nutrient uptake activity and to optimize fertilizer application scheme however corresponding experimental or statistical data are scarce and further studies are needed 5 conclusions under the conditions developed in the current study the fertilizer application schemes significantly influenced the transport of soil nutrients deep leaching residual contents as well as the absorption of soil nutrients crop growth and yield generally spam caused significant nutrient accumulation in certain soil layers depending on application timing and nutrient mobility and umam produced a more uniform nutrient profile nevertheless rmam resulted in an optimal nutrient profile for root uptake where more nutrients were in the upper soil layers with more roots therefore rmam significantly promoted crop nutrient uptake growth and production and reduced leachate loss and soil residue beneficial for environmental protection and sustainable agricultural development however in addition to root length density crop nutrient uptake is also affected by many other complicated purpose and environment dependent factors related with soil water nutrient dynamics and root uptake activity further improvement is necessary for rmam to take soil water nutrient dynamics

9181,optimization of irrigation scheduling is a widely proposed solution to enhance agricultural water productivity and mitigate water scarcity however there is currently a lack of knowledge about how to most effectively optimize and adapt irrigation decisions under weather and climate uncertainty or about how the benefits of adaptive irrigation scheduling compare to fixed heuristics commonly used by farmers in this article we assess the added value of in season adaptation of irrigation strategies in comparison to a fixed irrigation strategy that maximizes average profits over a range of plausible weather outcomes but is not adjusted year to year to perform this assessment the aquacrop ospy crop water model is used to simulate a case study of irrigated maize production in a water scarce region in the central united states irrigation strategies are defined that maximize mean seasonal profit over a range of historical years this baseline profit is then compared to the case of adaptive strategies where the irrigation strategy is re optimized at multiple stages within each season our analysis finds that fixed irrigation heuristics on average achieve over 90 of potential profits attained with perfect seasonal foresight in season adaptation marginally increased agricultural profitability with greater benefits found when re optimization occurs more frequently or is accompanied by reliable forecasts of weather for the week ahead however the overall magnitude of these additional benefits was small 5 further increase in average profits highlighting that fixed irrigation scheduling rules can be near optimal when making realistic assumptions about farmers potential knowledge of future weather since fixed irrigation strategies are easier to design communicate and implement than data driven adaptive management strategies we suggest that implementing these fixed strategies be prioritized over the development of more complex adaptive strategies keywords irrigation scheduling adaptive irrigation aquacrop ospy aquacrop optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction increasing pressures on global freshwater resources are a concern for policy makers worldwide molden and fao 2020 as irrigation accounts for over 70 of this global freshwater use many regions are exploring ways to reduce agricultural water use in order to mitigate current and future water scarcity and conflicts given the simultaneous need to increase food production to meet needs of growing populations and their changing dietary preferences reducing or stabilizing agricultural water demands requires a focus on improving agricultural water productivity i e generating more crop output per unit of water input or consumption strategies to achieve this goal come in the form of explicit policy restrictions on abstractions such as quotas e g leathes et al 2008 lópez morales and duchin 2011 fao 2020 loch et al 2020 young et al 2021 as well as efforts to incentivize greater water use efficiency and productivity by improving how irrigation is scheduled and applied during the growing season e g adeyemi et al 2017 berbel et al 2019 kukal et al 2019 taghvaeian et al 2020 an extensive body of research exists that focuses on developing optimal irrigation scheduling strategies and rules to enable farmers to maximize profits or water productivity e g schütze et al 2012 kloss et al 2014 linker et al 2016 linker and kisekka 2017 kelly and foster 2021 an issue faced when seeking to develop optimal irrigation management strategies is that optimal rules or decisions must hedge across multiple potential weather scenarios as farmers have at best only partial foresight of weather conditions in the upcoming growing season a common approach in research and practice to address this uncertainty is to optimize a single irrigation management strategy that maximizes the average profit over a range of potential weather outcomes such as observed in a historical record linker and kisekka 2017 kelly et al 2021 alternatively other studies have focused on selecting a single average year from a collection of years e g in terms of total rainfall and optimizing irrigation management rules for that specific average year kloss et al 2014 one potential means of increasing productivity and profitability of agricultural water use would be to identify mechanisms to adapt average irrigation strategies during the season as more information is gained about weather patterns in a specific year in this context several studies have used adaptive simulation optimization frameworks to evaluate potential benefits of using weather forecasts to adapt irrigation schedules intraseasonally concluding that such approaches can generate substantial increases in profits for producers wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 similarly linker 2021 also used an adaptive simulation optimization framework to evaluate benefits of in season re optimization of irrigation decision rules showing that this approach yielded irrigation schedules that were close to those that would be achievable with perfect seasonal weather foresight however a common limitation of these studies is that they do not assess or quantify the benefits of adaptive irrigation strategies in comparison with fixed irrigation heuristics that are commonly used by farmers and have been widely developed by researchers as a result these studies provide insufficient insights about the potential benefits and costs of adaptive irrigation scheduling including potential risks of maladaptation better understanding of these trade offs is critical to support improved agricultural water management decisions in particular given the extensive data requirements and associated costs that adaptive scheduling may entail relative to use of fixed or average irrigation rules for example re optimizing irrigation schedules may require additional knowledge of the current state of the crop e g rooting depth plant height leaf area index which may be costly to collect alongside the time and resources required to setup and implement optimization approaches during the season trout et al 2008 lozoya et al 2016 herrmann et al 2019 in this study we address the abovementioned gaps in understanding about the benefits of adaptive intraseasonal scheduling as a means of improving agricultural water use productivity and profitability under weather and climate uncertainty specifically this article will aim to answer the following questions 1 what is the economic value of adapting irrigation strategies within the season in response to the unfolding weather 2 does this value change depending on adaptation frequency water use restrictions and the presence of perfect short term weather forecasts to answer these questions we develop a simulation optimization approach using the crop water model aquacrop ospy to evaluate the economic benefits of adaptive irrigation scheduling compared with fixed irrigation decision heuristics we focus on a case study of irrigated maize production in the central united states where there are significant pressures to improve crop water productivity in response to aquifer drawdown and streamflow depletion scanlon et al 2012 mcguire 2017 our analysis explores how the value of adapting irrigation scheduling rules within the season varies as a function of factors that have been largely neglected in past studies including different weather scenarios regulatory water abstraction rules adaptation frequency and short term weather forecasts our findings provide guidance to researchers producers and water management stakeholders on how adaptive irrigation scheduling impacts agricultural water use and farm profits this guidance includes the role adaptive scheduling approaches can play in addressing water scarcity challenges in regions experiencing chronic or growing water scarcity pressures 2 method in this section we first describe how we link a crop growth model aquacrop ospy to an optimization algorithm to determine a profit maximizing irrigation strategy over a set of climate years we then discuss how we adapt this approach to allow irrigation strategies to be re optimized within the season to assess the added value of adaptive irrigation scheduling we present our methods in five subsections that describe the choice of crop simulation model section 2 1 approach for identifying profit maximizing irrigation strategies section 2 2 re optimization of these irrigation strategies within the season section 2 3 details of the specific case study chosen e g location crop choice and model parameters section 2 4 and an outline of sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of key model assumptions and production characteristics section 2 5 2 1 crop simulation model crop simulation models are powerful tools that simulate crop growth using biophysical equations jones et al 2003 steduto et al 2009 adeyemi et al 2017 these models can be used to help design and identify strategies to enhance the productivity of water use in crop production at a much lower time and monetary cost than field experiments jiang et al 2016 araya et al 2016 goosheh et al 2018 as well as the ability to compare more combinations of climate management and irrigation scenarios these models can be linked to optimization algorithms to more effectively discover potential scheduling strategies kloss et al 2014 linker et al 2016 linker and kisekka 2017 kelly et al 2021 a wide variety of crop simulation models exist each designed with specific use cases in mind and thus with their own strengths and weaknesses most come in the form of a graphical user interface allowing users to alter crop soil and management parameters and then run simulations for a given weather time series and production environment ragab 2002 jones et al 2003 steduto et al 2009 aquacrop developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations un fao is a water driven model that aims to quantify the response of crops to water stress steduto et al 2009 it contains relatively few parameters compared with other models allowing it to be used in data scarce environments due to its popularity aquacrop has been successfully implemented in matlab octave foster brozović butler et al 2017 r rodriguez and ober 2019 and python kelly and foster 2021 given the flexibility of both the model implementation allowing us to easily integrate the model with optimization libraries and of the python language itself the python version of the model aquacrop ospy was selected for use in this analysis 2 2 identifying optimal non adaptive strategies the goal of optimal irrigation management is to manage the water content in the soil to facilitate maximum crop growth with minimal water application for farmers optimal irrigation management typically involves defining and optimizing one or more thresholds that specify the level of soil moisture to maintain over the season given that crop water requirements vary with growth stage çakir 2004 separate soil moisture thresholds are often defined for each stage aquacrop ospy defines four such soil moisture thresholds corresponding to emergence early season canopy development mid season crop growth and late season canopy senescence the optimal set of thresholds will be those that maximize a particular value e g profits or water productivity for a given production environment e g combination of crop type soil type climate conditions this approach is similar to previous research that found profit maximizing soil moisture thresholds in aquacrop either by optimization or direct search linker et al 2016 young et al 2021 kelly et al 2021 for our analysis the seasonal profit p st resulting from strategy st is calculated at the end of each season via 1 p st m y st c i st f where m is a crop market price per tonne y st is crop yield tonne per ha c is a constant irrigation cost per ha mm i st is total seasonal irrigation applied ha mm and f is fixed production costs per ha the first stage of the analysis is to define the irrigation scheduling strategy st y set of four soil moisture thresholds that maximizes seasonal profit eq 1 for each weather year considered for a given case study this process produces an optimal set of soil moisture thresholds for each year which we will refer to as the potential strategy the resulting profits and water use from the potential strategy provides an estimate of what the farmer could achieve if they knew the weather perfectly in advance in all years and adjusted their irrigation strategy accordingly based on this information these potential profits therefore represent an estimated upper limit for the benefits of adapting irrigation scheduling during the season comparable to prior studies that have optimized irrigation scheduling under perfect weather foresight e g schütze et al 2012 linker et al 2016 in reality farmers do not know the seasons weather with perfect foresight and irrigation scheduling decisions therefore have to be made under climate uncertainty one way to deal with this uncertainty is to define a single strategy i e a set of thresholds that maximizes the average profit across all possible years e g as observed in the historic weather record in the second part of the analysis we identify this single average profit maximizing strategy for our climate years by maximizing the expected i e average value of p over a set of n weather years this average profit maximizing strategy will be referred to as the fixed strategy for the remainder of the article applying this same fixed strategy across all years provides a baseline for the profits that can be achieved without adapting irrigation strategies during the season the difference between the potential profits and fixed profits thus gives an estimated upper bound on the value of adaptive irrigation strategies for both the single fixed strategy and the multi year potential strategy the differential evolution global optimizer within the scipy optimize python package virtanen et al 2020 will be used to find the optimal set of soil moisture thresholds although any algorithm can be used in principle differential evolution was chosen due to its superior performance during initial tests against other optimizers within the scipy optimize package 2 3 re optimizing irrigation strategies within the season the goal of adaptive intraseasonal irrigation scheduling is to close the gap between fixed same strategy used for all years and potential perfect adjustment to each year s weather management strategies to assess the value of adapting irrigation strategies within season we define an adaptive simulation optimization framework fig 1 similar to that used in previous research cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 linker 2021 in this framework the simulation is paused at various points within the season and the irrigation strategy is re optimized from this starting point weather up to the current date is known with certainty as it has already been observed by the farmer and expectations of future weather for the remainder of the season are specified based on the full ensemble of historic weather years we assume that irrigation decisions are re optimized at the start of each growth stage to match the temporal disaggregation of decision heuristics commonly used by farmers and agronomists therefore we first simulate crop development from planting to the end of the first crop growth stage implementing the fixed irrigation strategy for each weather year at the start of the next growth stage a new profit maximizing irrigation strategy is then found for the remainder of the season using the optimization procedure described in section 2 2 the resulting strategy st is implemented over the second growth stage after which the optimization is performed again this process is repeated until the end of the season is reached at which point the final profit is calculated using eq 1 2 4 case study we apply the framework presented above to the case study of center pivot irrigated maize production in nebraska united states nebraska has the largest number of irrigated acres in the united states with maize being the most dominant crop cultivated in the state usda nass 2018 irrigation water in the region primarily comes from the high plains aquifer which has experienced drawdown over recent decades mcguire 2017 associated environmental externalities such as streamflow depletion szilagyi 2000 and damage to freshwater ecosystems palazzo and brozović 2014 perkin et al 2019 along with concerns about long term sustainability of groundwater dependent rural economies foster brozović and butler 2017 deines et al 2020 butler et al 2020 mean improving agricultural water productivity is a key priority for policymakers and water managers these local characteristics make this case study an ideal choice to examine the value of adaptive irrigation decisions as described in section 2 2 we first use the differential evolution optimization algorithm to find the set of soil moisture thresholds that maximize average profit over a set of climate years for this analysis we use 37 years 1982 2018 of historical weather data recorded at a monitoring station in champion southwest nebraska hprcc 2016 the resulting optimal strategy i e a set of thresholds will be referred to as the fixed strategy for each of the 37 years the optimal irrigation strategy for each individual year referred to as potential strategy will also be calculated to provide an upper limit on what profits could be achieved in a given year with perfect seasonal foresight of weather conditions by taking the difference between the profits achieved by the potential and fixed strategy we can evaluate how well the fixed strategy performs in each year as well as the possible increases that can be made by re optimizing within the season to ensure the fixed and potential strategies were as close to the global optimum as possible 50 repetitions of each optimization were performed and we selected the strategy achieving maximum profits across all repeat optimizations table s1 the number of repetitions was selected to balance computational burden with optimization convergence figure s1 during initial tests we found that use of irrigation was never optimal during the final growth stage i e crop senescence for our case study crop and climate to simplify the solution space for the optimization problem this final soil moisture threshold was therefore set to zero for fixed potential and adaptive irrigation strategies as a result only two re optimizations were performed in the season at the start of growth stage two and three when re optimizing on a growth stage basis the adaptation framework fig 1 for each climate year was repeated 25 times to ensure that a single sub optimal optimization did not affect results however we still included the results from all of these adaption repetitions as it captures the reality that a producer will never know ahead of time what the true optimum strategy is aquacrop ospy crop growth parameters for maize are summarized in foster et al 2015 and are re stated in table 1 the soil was chosen to be a clay loam a dominant soil type in the region cropwatch 2018 with soil hydraulic parameters taken from the aquacrop ospy default parameters when calculating profits with eq 1 a constant crop price of 180 per tonne was used based on a 10 year average of us maize grain prices usda 2019 irrigation costs were set at 1 per ha mm 10 28 per acre inch based on estimates from the 2019 nebraska crop budget report cropwatch 2019 this report also provides estimates for non irrigation production costs e g labour materials taxes which allows us to set the fixed production cost in eq 1 to 1728 ha 1 further details on model parameters and code implementation can be found by viewing the full source code available at https github com thomasdkelly adaptive irrigation 2 5 sensitivity analysis the value of adapting irrigation decisions within the growing season may be influenced by several factors first in regions experiencing water scarcity for regulatory restrictions the amount of water farmers are able to extract for irrigation purposes is increasingly being restricted as part of water conservation and sustainability initiatives and policies these restrictions pose issues for producers globally including our case study region for example the upper republican natural resource district where our case study location resides has imposed a five year 2018 2022 groundwater allocation of 65 acre inches per hectare urnrd 2019 these sorts of restrictions could reduce the value of adaptive irrigation strategies as producers will be less able to flexibly react to the unfolding season we therefore repeated the main analysis growth stage adaptation including a cap on the amount of irrigation that can be applied in a given season this cap was applied in all years preventing any further irrigation events if the total application within the current season reached the cap this additional analysis was performed over a range of seasonal caps from 75 to 550 mm ha 1 for each cap new optimal fixed strategies were determined and then these were used to assess the value of adapting the strategies within the season table s2 another factor that may influence the value of adaptive irrigation scheduling is the frequency with which farmers are able to re optimize decisions as stated in section 2 4 there are only three opportunities two when considering no irrigation is allowed in the final stage for our case study system to re optimize the strategy during the season within our growth stage adaptation framework we hypothesize that being able to adapt at more frequent intervals would lead to further increases in profits compared to the few opportunities allowed by our framework we therefore conducted an additional analysis where our simulation optimization framework was adjusted to allow re optimizations to occur every seven days although other frequencies could also be evaluated seven days was chosen to balance the complexity of the strategy with additional computational demand as well as matching previous work that used similar simulation optimization frameworks cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 the first re optimization will therefore occur on day 7 of each season and re optimizations will stop after day 120 resulting in 17 different sets of thresholds being implemented throughout the season note that the choice of day 120 of the season as the final date for re optimization was because this day falls after the start of the final growth stage when irrigation is always zero but this date could be varied to any other value in alternative model case studies or applications finally as noted earlier the ability to effectively update irrigation decisions may also be influenced by the quality of information available to a farmer about weather conditions in the days or weeks ahead in our main analysis re optimization is performed over the same set of weather years used in the fixed strategy producers must therefore hedge the irrigation strategy against all 37 potential weather scenarios for the remainder of the season in reality some of these years will be more probable than others given weather so far and available forecasts the seven day adaptation framework described above was therefore further adjusted to include a seven day perfect forecast beyond those seven days the producer must again hedge across all 37 weather years the seven day lead time for the perfect forecast was chosen to match previous work jamal et al 2019 we hypothesize that including the seven day perfect forecast will increase profits compared to the standard seven day adaptation due to the greater ability to tune irrigation decisions to the weather ahead for a given season 3 results 3 1 differences between fixed and potential strategies the first part of this analysis used the differential evolution optimization algorithm to find a set of soil moisture thresholds that maximized average profits over 37 climate years with the resulting set of thresholds being referred to as the fixed strategy the potential strategies i e profit maximizing strategies for each individual year were also calculated to give an estimated upper limit for what profits could be achieved with perfect seasonal information table s1 a comparison between the average profits achieved by the fixed 426 ha and potential 459 ha strategies finds that the fixed strategy achieved 92 7 of the average potential profit fig 2a in other words having perfect foresight of weather conditions in each year results in a 7 7 increase in farm profits looking more closely at each individual climate year there is only one year 2012 in which the fixed strategy does not achieve at least 80 of the potential profits fig 2a this year was one of extreme drought less than 43 mm of rainfall during the growing season and so appears to be sacrificed by the optimizer in favour of maximizing average profits across all remaining years focusing instead on the other 36 non drought years regression analysis indicates that 40 of the variation in the performance of the fixed strategy can be explained by the total seasonal rainfall fig 2b the fixed strategy performs better in terms of percentage of potential profits in the wetter years than the drier years using the fixed strategy as a starting point the framework described in section 2 3 aims to assess whether adapting the strategy within the season will increase these fixed profits towards the potential profits 3 2 the value of within season adaptation to assess the value of re optimizing irrigation strategies within the season the fixed irrigation strategy set of soil moisture thresholds was re optimized at the start of each growth stage following the re optimization approach described in section 2 3 after running this framework for all 37 climate years the profits from this adaptive strategy can be compared to the fixed profits to determine the added value of this adaptive approach to scheduling on average our analysis found a 4 87 ha 1 increase in profits with adaptation which translates to a 1 increase in average profit compared to the fixed strategy that does not incorporate any adaptation of irrigation management rules during the growing season however we also observe that growth stage adaptation also increased the minimum profits by 106 and decreased the standard deviation in profits by 2 95 the large increase in minimum profits can be attributed to the drought year 2012 where in season adaptation increases the soil moisture thresholds causing additional irrigation events and profit increases by inspecting the irrigation schedule time series for this year we see the impact of this change in soil moisture thresholds on the soil water content and the timing of irrigation events fig 3 changes to the minimum profits and profit variance may have important implications for some farmers in particular where there is a need to minimize risks associated with extremely low yields in individual years as opposed to simply looking to maximize average profits over multiple years these implications will be further discussed later in section 4 1 several factors are important drivers of the value added from in season adaptation of irrigation scheduling rules first we find that the quality of the starting strategy defined as how close the fixed strategy mean profit is to the potential strategy in a given year explains 39 of the variation in adaptation value fig 3a this relationship shows that adaptation value is lower in years where the fixed strategy is already close to the potential optimal for that year in addition by assessing the relationship between seasonal rainfall and adaptation value we find that adaptation value is inversely proportional to the total seasonal rainfall however our analysis indicates that seasonal rainfall only explains 14 of the variation in adaptation value fig 3b as well total rainfall how the rainfall is distributed over the season is also shown to impact optimal irrigation strategies specifically we find that the coefficient of variation cv in daily rainfall i e standard deviation in daily rainfall mean daily rainfall explains 19 of the variation in adaptation value fig 3c both of these relationships indicate that when rainfall is scarce or more variable the value of within season adaptation is greater inspecting irrigation schedule time series for specific individual years also provides additional insights about why in season adaption is beneficial in some years and not in others for example fig 5 compares the irrigation events triggered by the fixed fig 5a potential fig 5b and growth stage adaptation fig 5c strategies during the 1999 growing season simulation where adaptation decreased seasonal profits by 30 ha 1 the largest decrease for any year overall during both the second and third growth stage the adaptive strategy made minor adjustments to the soil moisture threshold towards the potential threshold one would expect that such an adjustment towards the perfect information strategy would increase profits as it does for the year 2012 however this does not occur in the year 1999 this slightly counterintuitive result can likely be attributed to having to optimize decisions under future weather uncertainty as one can never know what the exact optimal set of thresholds are until the entire season has passed changes to the soil moisture thresholds are unable to perfectly replicate irrigation schedules under the potential strategy with perfect foresight with two extra irrigation events being triggered on days 89 and 90 for the adaptive strategy this reduces overall profits for the season demonstrating that without perfect knowledge of the full seasons weather beforehand there will always be the possibility for maladaptive behavior e g the adjustments made in 1999 during some years 3 3 the impact of adaptation frequency and forecast information on adaptation value as described in section 2 5 two further analyses were conducted to test whether adaptation frequency and quality of forecast information impacted the value of re optimization allowing re optimization of irrigation strategies every seven days lead to a 2 25 ha 1 increase in profits compared to growth stage re optimization achieving 93 69 of the potential profits over the 37 climate years fig 6a by including a perfect seven day weather forecast within this seven day re optimization framework average profits were increased by a further 13 4 ha 1 compared to the standard seven day re optimization achieving 97 28 of potential profits these analyses confirmed our hypothesis that re optimizing more frequently in particular when combined with better information about weather conditions in the days ahead increases the benefits that can be derived from in season adaptation as well as changes to average profits we also see changes in profit variance with adaptation switching from the growth stage adaptation to seven day adaptation increases the minimum profits by 15 8 and reduces the standard deviation in profits by 2 56 compared to growth stage adaptation fig 6b adding a perfect seven day weather forecast to the seven day adaptation strategy further increases the minimum profits by 29 2 compared to the seven day adaptation strategy without perfect weekly forecasts an additional notable effect of introducing perfect weekly forecasts to the seven day adaptation strategy is that there are eight years where the seven day adaptation with perfect weekly forecast outperforms the potential strategy this result indicates the limitations of how we have chosen to define the potential strategy which despite having perfect seasonal weather information still only contains one fixed set of thresholds for the season in comparison the seven day adaptation strategy contains 17 sets of thresholds that are calculated as the season progresses the ability to vary soil moisture targets within rather than just between growth stages allows for more complex irrigation management strategies to emerge sometimes resulting in higher profits despite the farmer not having access to perfect information about weather for the entire season to demonstrate an example of when the seven day strategy with perfect weekly forecast outperformed the potential strategy we compare the individual irrigation events triggered by the fixed fig 7a potential fig 7b and seven day adaptation with perfect weekly forecast fig 7c strategies for the climate year 1992 the flexibility enabled by the seven day adaptation period initially allows an increase in the first growth stage threshold fig 7c meaning that irrigation events for the potential and adaptive strategies were identical for the first 45 days fig 7b c after this initial period the two strategies diverge as the adaptive strategy sticks closer to the fixed strategy with the flexibility to adjust as required whereas the potential thresholds diverge massively during the second growth stage in particular although the seven day adaptation strategy with perfect weekly forecast occasionally outperformed the potential strategy there are still a handful of years where it also performed worse than the fixed strategy figure s2 as stated in the previous section this effect is the result of having to optimize irrigation strategies under uncertainty about weather beyond the seven day forecast and is not the result of the optimization approach or choice of strategy however switching from the growth stage adaptation to the seven day adaptation increased does profits in these years this result implies that more complex irrigation strategies that also incorporate more accurate weather information can help reduce the risk of profit losses from these maladaptive events even when knowledge of weather conditions for the remainder of the season remains unknown or uncertain 3 4 the impact of water constraints on adaptation value regulatory or hydrologic restrictions on irrigation water supply are a common consequence of water scarcity and conflict in many regions including our study area in the central united states we therefore explored how the value of adaptation was affected by the introduction of annual caps on total seasonal irrigation that once reached would prevent any further irrigation being applied during the season by introducing a seasonal irrigation cap of 300 mm ha 1 average seasonal profits achieved by the fixed strategy decrease by 82 ha 1 in comparison to the 426 ha 1 achieved when water use was unrestricted as annual water quotas increase profits increase towards the unrestricted fixed profits for the 300 mm ha 1 limit the average value of adaptation was 1 49 ha 1 this value increases linearly with an increasing seasonal water allocation reaching a benefit of 4 87 ha 1 achieved when water use is unrestricted fig 8a these results imply that restrictions on yearly water use actually decrease the value of adaption a possible intuition for this result is that having more water available during the season allows greater flexibility for the re optimization process to adapt within the season for more severe restrictions on water use i e quotas less than 300 mm ha 1 impacts of adaptation begin to vary significantly from year to year as well on average with large benefits in some years and large costs in others fig 8b these results show that while some benefits may still be derived from adaptation under highly restrictive water use limits the variation in outcomes and potential for maladaptive responses is large in contrast to the analyses without water use restrictions presented previously fig 4 we find no relationship between adaptation value and weather conditions under severe water use restrictions specifically the r 2 between adaptation value and total rainfall for the most restrictive caps 75 100 125 mm ha 1 were all found to be less than 0 02 similarly the r 2 between adaptation value and cv in daily rainfall for these caps were also found to be less than 0 02 therefore whether or not adaptation leads to extreme benefits or costs appears to be mostly down to luck for these extreme water use limits 4 discussion optimization of irrigation scheduling including through in season adaptation of scheduling rules based on weather forecasts and other data have been widely proposed as a means of improving agricultural water productivity in water scarce regions globally e g wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 jamal et al 2018 2019 linker 2021 by linking a crop model to our re optimization framework this article aimed to assess the value of adapting irrigation strategies within the season and how this value is affected by typical information constraints e g in season weather and management constraints e g abstraction restrictions commonly faced by farmers but not adequately considered in past research e g wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 for a case study of maize production in a water stressed region of south west nebraska in the united states our analysis demonstrated that a farmer adopting a fixed irrigation strategy i e where rules are the same for each year was able to achieve 92 7 of the average potential profit achievable with perfect seasonal weather foresight in season re optimization of fixed irrigation strategies based on information gained about weather conditions as the seasonal unfolds was able to marginally increase average profits to 93 8 or 94 3 of potential profits depending on how frequently farmers choose or are able to adapt irrigation strategies within the season we demonstrate that value of in season adaptive re optimization of irrigation heuristics is enhanced when farmers have access to perfect weather forecasts for the week ahead for which the producer is able to achieve 97 2 of potential profits adaptive scheduling also universally reduced risks of crop loss or failure events e g during extreme drought years such as 2012 in our study area but with greatest risk reduction benefits found when re optimization is supported by in season forecasts by introducing seasonal water quotas our analysis showed that the variability in adaptation value between years increased dramatically for extremely restrictive water quotas 4 1 implications for research producers and industry our results build upon previous work that aimed to optimize irrigation strategies within crop models using adaptive re optimization during the growing season e g wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 jamal et al 2018 2019 linker 2021 these works did not include an optimized fixed strategy with which to compare the value of adaptive irrigation strategies as a result these studies are likely to have overstated the true potential benefits of adaptive in season irrigation scheduling with our results demonstrating that the majority of potential profits can be achieved with simpler optimal average irrigation heuristics our findings are also consistent with other evidence about the value of adaptive agricultural decision making in the literature for example jones et al 2000 showed that optimization of crop management practices for maize e g planting date crop density nitrogen application based on seasonal climate forecasts increased average seasonal profits by only 16 26 ha 1 3 4 depending on the case study region when compared with fixed management rules based on a range of historic weather years our findings thus highlight the importance of comparing adaptive strategies to similarly optimized fixed strategies which may provide a more efficient means of scheduling irrigation when technological logistical and cognitive costs associated with implementing more complex data driven adaptive scheduling practices are taken into account a key finding of our analysis is that there is likely to be substantial heterogeneity in the economic benefits of adaptive irrigation scheduling across years with some years potentially experiencing declines in profits when strategies are re optimized within the season this type of maladaptation was also found in hejazi et al 2014 and occurs as a result of underlying uncertainty about future weather along with the complex non linear responses of crop growth and yield development to soil moisture patterns during the season unless the entire season s weather is known with a high degree of certainty in advance it is extremely challenging for a farmer to determine which irrigation strategy will reliably lead to the largest profits even if one strategy is superior on average there will be some years where an alternative strategy results in higher profits the season to season variability in profits also highlights that instead of evaluating irrigation strategies on as few as 5 climate years as is common in previous work wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 jamal et al 2018 2019 researchers must use quantities approaching 30 in order to fully capture local weather characteristics and thus accurately evaluate outcomes of adaptive decision making or the value of data e g forecasts our analysis found that some of the year to year variability in benefits from adaptive irrigation scheduling could be explained by the quality of the starting strategy total rainfall during the season and the coefficient of variation of daily rainfall during the season these relationships suggested that in years with less rainfall or where rainfall is unevenly distributed during the season the economic value of adaptive scheduling will be higher this is particularly relevant given climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of weather extremes in many regions ipcc 2022 our analysis also found that adaptive strategies did cause an increase in minimum profits and decrease in profit variance over the 37 years for more risk averse farmers who cannot simply seek to maximize average profits this reduction may provide enough motivation to invest in adaptive strategies however the presence of other safety nets for example crop insurance schemes could decrease the value of adaptive scheduling practices as farmers will be financially protected against some of the consequences in the driest years the strong performance of both fixed and adaptive irrigation strategies relative to theoretical potential profits is in part due to specifying a strategy made up of four soil moisture thresholds one for each major growth stage kelly et al 2021 found that choosing a simpler strategy made up of just one soil moisture threshold for the entire growing season led to a 120 ha 1 decrease in profits compared to the four soil moisture threshold strategy as done in our analysis this decrease is three times larger than the profit difference found between the fixed and potential strategies in our analysis crop models and simulation optimization frameworks such as that used in the present article are vital for designing and optimizing these irrigation strategies which can also be replicated for many crops and production environments over time however these optimal strategies will need to be updated to ensure the historical weather years used to optimize the strategy reflect changes in the likely range of weather scenarios that will occur in the upcoming season for example changes in the variability of expected weather outcomes due to climate change will likely reduce the performance of fixed strategies and enhance benefits of adaptive scheduling if these shifts in climate variability are not accounted for when designing fixed irrigation management rules 4 2 framework limitations and future directions while our analysis provides valuable insights about the potential value of adaptive in season irrigation scheduling for improving agricultural productivity and profitability it is important to highlight several key simplifications in our analysis first an assumption made in our analysis is that the re optimization framework considers the hypothetical farmer to have perfect knowledge of the current state of the soil water balance and crop growth e g yield canopy cover rooting depth however in the real world farmers may not have perfect information about current field conditions or be able to predict with certainty how crop development will be affected by different potential weather scenarios as a result the real world value of within season adaptation is likely to be even lower than found in our analysis as the re optimization of irrigation strategies will be influenced not only by uncertainty in weather conditions for the days and weeks ahead but also by uncertainties in the current status of crop growth and soil moisture these additional uncertainties are likely to increase the potential for maladaptive irrigation scheduling responses to occur in particular where capacity for irrigation water use is limited by regulatory hydrologic or socio economic constraints however further research is needed to quantify the magnitude of this effect as previous research e g kelly et al 2021 has found that perfect knowledge of the field and climate conditions is not required for near optimal irrigation scheduling to balance computational time and resources our analysis focused on a selection of key factors adaptation frequency foresight of near future weather abstraction restrictions that we hypothesized may be important determinants of the value of adaptive irrigation scheduling approaches nonetheless other factors not analysed in the present paper may also influence the value of adaptive scheduling for example if the baseline fixed irrigation strategy is sub optimal or poorly defined kelly et al 2021 there may be greater value in updating this strategy throughout the season the presence of multi year quotas rather than the single year quotas considered in the present article may also affect the value of adaptation as in season decisions have implications for water availability in later years and thus make the optimization process both an intra and inter seasonal problem young et al 2021 furthermore the presence of financial safety nets such as crop insurance usda 2022 suchato et al 2022 may reduce the value of adaptation as outlier drought years in which the largest benefits of adaptation are observed in this study will result in profit losses that are less severe for farmers finally it is important to acknowledge that results presented in this study are dependent on the ability of the underlying crop water model to accurately represent real world crop responses to soil moisture deficits weather conditions and irrigation management practices aquacrop has been shown to adequately capture maize yield responses to water stress within our study area and the united states generally heng et al 2009 sandhu and irmak 2019 further research should extend the analysis presented here to consider how the value of adaptive irrigation scheduling is influenced by the choice of underlying crop model and parameterization including to consider potentially important differences that may exist across different crop varieties e g more less drought tolerant soil types e g higher lower water holding capacity or climatic regimes e g greater lesser rainfall variability 5 conclusions the aim of this manuscript was to assess the potential added value of in season adaptation of irrigation scheduling practices for improving productivity and profitability of agricultural water use under climate uncertainty for a case study of maize production in nebraska our analysis demonstrates the vast majority of the potential profits can be achieved by adopting a fixed irrigation strategy that is optimized pre season to account for expected variability in weather outcomes but which is not adjusted within each year increases in average profit as well as decreases in profit variance are possible by re optimizing this strategy within the season with the size of this increase dependent on the potential frequency of adaptation and foresight of weather for the days ahead however the overall magnitude of these increased returns are small even in the presence of restrictions on total seasonal water use by farmers as a result our findings suggest that farmers and water managers may be better to prioritize the adoption of simpler average irrigation scheduling heuristics that are well optimized to local production conditions and constraints in doing so farmers are likely to achieve the majority of the potential gains in crop yields and water use savings while also

9181,optimization of irrigation scheduling is a widely proposed solution to enhance agricultural water productivity and mitigate water scarcity however there is currently a lack of knowledge about how to most effectively optimize and adapt irrigation decisions under weather and climate uncertainty or about how the benefits of adaptive irrigation scheduling compare to fixed heuristics commonly used by farmers in this article we assess the added value of in season adaptation of irrigation strategies in comparison to a fixed irrigation strategy that maximizes average profits over a range of plausible weather outcomes but is not adjusted year to year to perform this assessment the aquacrop ospy crop water model is used to simulate a case study of irrigated maize production in a water scarce region in the central united states irrigation strategies are defined that maximize mean seasonal profit over a range of historical years this baseline profit is then compared to the case of adaptive strategies where the irrigation strategy is re optimized at multiple stages within each season our analysis finds that fixed irrigation heuristics on average achieve over 90 of potential profits attained with perfect seasonal foresight in season adaptation marginally increased agricultural profitability with greater benefits found when re optimization occurs more frequently or is accompanied by reliable forecasts of weather for the week ahead however the overall magnitude of these additional benefits was small 5 further increase in average profits highlighting that fixed irrigation scheduling rules can be near optimal when making realistic assumptions about farmers potential knowledge of future weather since fixed irrigation strategies are easier to design communicate and implement than data driven adaptive management strategies we suggest that implementing these fixed strategies be prioritized over the development of more complex adaptive strategies keywords irrigation scheduling adaptive irrigation aquacrop ospy aquacrop optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction increasing pressures on global freshwater resources are a concern for policy makers worldwide molden and fao 2020 as irrigation accounts for over 70 of this global freshwater use many regions are exploring ways to reduce agricultural water use in order to mitigate current and future water scarcity and conflicts given the simultaneous need to increase food production to meet needs of growing populations and their changing dietary preferences reducing or stabilizing agricultural water demands requires a focus on improving agricultural water productivity i e generating more crop output per unit of water input or consumption strategies to achieve this goal come in the form of explicit policy restrictions on abstractions such as quotas e g leathes et al 2008 lópez morales and duchin 2011 fao 2020 loch et al 2020 young et al 2021 as well as efforts to incentivize greater water use efficiency and productivity by improving how irrigation is scheduled and applied during the growing season e g adeyemi et al 2017 berbel et al 2019 kukal et al 2019 taghvaeian et al 2020 an extensive body of research exists that focuses on developing optimal irrigation scheduling strategies and rules to enable farmers to maximize profits or water productivity e g schütze et al 2012 kloss et al 2014 linker et al 2016 linker and kisekka 2017 kelly and foster 2021 an issue faced when seeking to develop optimal irrigation management strategies is that optimal rules or decisions must hedge across multiple potential weather scenarios as farmers have at best only partial foresight of weather conditions in the upcoming growing season a common approach in research and practice to address this uncertainty is to optimize a single irrigation management strategy that maximizes the average profit over a range of potential weather outcomes such as observed in a historical record linker and kisekka 2017 kelly et al 2021 alternatively other studies have focused on selecting a single average year from a collection of years e g in terms of total rainfall and optimizing irrigation management rules for that specific average year kloss et al 2014 one potential means of increasing productivity and profitability of agricultural water use would be to identify mechanisms to adapt average irrigation strategies during the season as more information is gained about weather patterns in a specific year in this context several studies have used adaptive simulation optimization frameworks to evaluate potential benefits of using weather forecasts to adapt irrigation schedules intraseasonally concluding that such approaches can generate substantial increases in profits for producers wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 similarly linker 2021 also used an adaptive simulation optimization framework to evaluate benefits of in season re optimization of irrigation decision rules showing that this approach yielded irrigation schedules that were close to those that would be achievable with perfect seasonal weather foresight however a common limitation of these studies is that they do not assess or quantify the benefits of adaptive irrigation strategies in comparison with fixed irrigation heuristics that are commonly used by farmers and have been widely developed by researchers as a result these studies provide insufficient insights about the potential benefits and costs of adaptive irrigation scheduling including potential risks of maladaptation better understanding of these trade offs is critical to support improved agricultural water management decisions in particular given the extensive data requirements and associated costs that adaptive scheduling may entail relative to use of fixed or average irrigation rules for example re optimizing irrigation schedules may require additional knowledge of the current state of the crop e g rooting depth plant height leaf area index which may be costly to collect alongside the time and resources required to setup and implement optimization approaches during the season trout et al 2008 lozoya et al 2016 herrmann et al 2019 in this study we address the abovementioned gaps in understanding about the benefits of adaptive intraseasonal scheduling as a means of improving agricultural water use productivity and profitability under weather and climate uncertainty specifically this article will aim to answer the following questions 1 what is the economic value of adapting irrigation strategies within the season in response to the unfolding weather 2 does this value change depending on adaptation frequency water use restrictions and the presence of perfect short term weather forecasts to answer these questions we develop a simulation optimization approach using the crop water model aquacrop ospy to evaluate the economic benefits of adaptive irrigation scheduling compared with fixed irrigation decision heuristics we focus on a case study of irrigated maize production in the central united states where there are significant pressures to improve crop water productivity in response to aquifer drawdown and streamflow depletion scanlon et al 2012 mcguire 2017 our analysis explores how the value of adapting irrigation scheduling rules within the season varies as a function of factors that have been largely neglected in past studies including different weather scenarios regulatory water abstraction rules adaptation frequency and short term weather forecasts our findings provide guidance to researchers producers and water management stakeholders on how adaptive irrigation scheduling impacts agricultural water use and farm profits this guidance includes the role adaptive scheduling approaches can play in addressing water scarcity challenges in regions experiencing chronic or growing water scarcity pressures 2 method in this section we first describe how we link a crop growth model aquacrop ospy to an optimization algorithm to determine a profit maximizing irrigation strategy over a set of climate years we then discuss how we adapt this approach to allow irrigation strategies to be re optimized within the season to assess the added value of adaptive irrigation scheduling we present our methods in five subsections that describe the choice of crop simulation model section 2 1 approach for identifying profit maximizing irrigation strategies section 2 2 re optimization of these irrigation strategies within the season section 2 3 details of the specific case study chosen e g location crop choice and model parameters section 2 4 and an outline of sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of key model assumptions and production characteristics section 2 5 2 1 crop simulation model crop simulation models are powerful tools that simulate crop growth using biophysical equations jones et al 2003 steduto et al 2009 adeyemi et al 2017 these models can be used to help design and identify strategies to enhance the productivity of water use in crop production at a much lower time and monetary cost than field experiments jiang et al 2016 araya et al 2016 goosheh et al 2018 as well as the ability to compare more combinations of climate management and irrigation scenarios these models can be linked to optimization algorithms to more effectively discover potential scheduling strategies kloss et al 2014 linker et al 2016 linker and kisekka 2017 kelly et al 2021 a wide variety of crop simulation models exist each designed with specific use cases in mind and thus with their own strengths and weaknesses most come in the form of a graphical user interface allowing users to alter crop soil and management parameters and then run simulations for a given weather time series and production environment ragab 2002 jones et al 2003 steduto et al 2009 aquacrop developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations un fao is a water driven model that aims to quantify the response of crops to water stress steduto et al 2009 it contains relatively few parameters compared with other models allowing it to be used in data scarce environments due to its popularity aquacrop has been successfully implemented in matlab octave foster brozović butler et al 2017 r rodriguez and ober 2019 and python kelly and foster 2021 given the flexibility of both the model implementation allowing us to easily integrate the model with optimization libraries and of the python language itself the python version of the model aquacrop ospy was selected for use in this analysis 2 2 identifying optimal non adaptive strategies the goal of optimal irrigation management is to manage the water content in the soil to facilitate maximum crop growth with minimal water application for farmers optimal irrigation management typically involves defining and optimizing one or more thresholds that specify the level of soil moisture to maintain over the season given that crop water requirements vary with growth stage çakir 2004 separate soil moisture thresholds are often defined for each stage aquacrop ospy defines four such soil moisture thresholds corresponding to emergence early season canopy development mid season crop growth and late season canopy senescence the optimal set of thresholds will be those that maximize a particular value e g profits or water productivity for a given production environment e g combination of crop type soil type climate conditions this approach is similar to previous research that found profit maximizing soil moisture thresholds in aquacrop either by optimization or direct search linker et al 2016 young et al 2021 kelly et al 2021 for our analysis the seasonal profit p st resulting from strategy st is calculated at the end of each season via 1 p st m y st c i st f where m is a crop market price per tonne y st is crop yield tonne per ha c is a constant irrigation cost per ha mm i st is total seasonal irrigation applied ha mm and f is fixed production costs per ha the first stage of the analysis is to define the irrigation scheduling strategy st y set of four soil moisture thresholds that maximizes seasonal profit eq 1 for each weather year considered for a given case study this process produces an optimal set of soil moisture thresholds for each year which we will refer to as the potential strategy the resulting profits and water use from the potential strategy provides an estimate of what the farmer could achieve if they knew the weather perfectly in advance in all years and adjusted their irrigation strategy accordingly based on this information these potential profits therefore represent an estimated upper limit for the benefits of adapting irrigation scheduling during the season comparable to prior studies that have optimized irrigation scheduling under perfect weather foresight e g schütze et al 2012 linker et al 2016 in reality farmers do not know the seasons weather with perfect foresight and irrigation scheduling decisions therefore have to be made under climate uncertainty one way to deal with this uncertainty is to define a single strategy i e a set of thresholds that maximizes the average profit across all possible years e g as observed in the historic weather record in the second part of the analysis we identify this single average profit maximizing strategy for our climate years by maximizing the expected i e average value of p over a set of n weather years this average profit maximizing strategy will be referred to as the fixed strategy for the remainder of the article applying this same fixed strategy across all years provides a baseline for the profits that can be achieved without adapting irrigation strategies during the season the difference between the potential profits and fixed profits thus gives an estimated upper bound on the value of adaptive irrigation strategies for both the single fixed strategy and the multi year potential strategy the differential evolution global optimizer within the scipy optimize python package virtanen et al 2020 will be used to find the optimal set of soil moisture thresholds although any algorithm can be used in principle differential evolution was chosen due to its superior performance during initial tests against other optimizers within the scipy optimize package 2 3 re optimizing irrigation strategies within the season the goal of adaptive intraseasonal irrigation scheduling is to close the gap between fixed same strategy used for all years and potential perfect adjustment to each year s weather management strategies to assess the value of adapting irrigation strategies within season we define an adaptive simulation optimization framework fig 1 similar to that used in previous research cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 linker 2021 in this framework the simulation is paused at various points within the season and the irrigation strategy is re optimized from this starting point weather up to the current date is known with certainty as it has already been observed by the farmer and expectations of future weather for the remainder of the season are specified based on the full ensemble of historic weather years we assume that irrigation decisions are re optimized at the start of each growth stage to match the temporal disaggregation of decision heuristics commonly used by farmers and agronomists therefore we first simulate crop development from planting to the end of the first crop growth stage implementing the fixed irrigation strategy for each weather year at the start of the next growth stage a new profit maximizing irrigation strategy is then found for the remainder of the season using the optimization procedure described in section 2 2 the resulting strategy st is implemented over the second growth stage after which the optimization is performed again this process is repeated until the end of the season is reached at which point the final profit is calculated using eq 1 2 4 case study we apply the framework presented above to the case study of center pivot irrigated maize production in nebraska united states nebraska has the largest number of irrigated acres in the united states with maize being the most dominant crop cultivated in the state usda nass 2018 irrigation water in the region primarily comes from the high plains aquifer which has experienced drawdown over recent decades mcguire 2017 associated environmental externalities such as streamflow depletion szilagyi 2000 and damage to freshwater ecosystems palazzo and brozović 2014 perkin et al 2019 along with concerns about long term sustainability of groundwater dependent rural economies foster brozović and butler 2017 deines et al 2020 butler et al 2020 mean improving agricultural water productivity is a key priority for policymakers and water managers these local characteristics make this case study an ideal choice to examine the value of adaptive irrigation decisions as described in section 2 2 we first use the differential evolution optimization algorithm to find the set of soil moisture thresholds that maximize average profit over a set of climate years for this analysis we use 37 years 1982 2018 of historical weather data recorded at a monitoring station in champion southwest nebraska hprcc 2016 the resulting optimal strategy i e a set of thresholds will be referred to as the fixed strategy for each of the 37 years the optimal irrigation strategy for each individual year referred to as potential strategy will also be calculated to provide an upper limit on what profits could be achieved in a given year with perfect seasonal foresight of weather conditions by taking the difference between the profits achieved by the potential and fixed strategy we can evaluate how well the fixed strategy performs in each year as well as the possible increases that can be made by re optimizing within the season to ensure the fixed and potential strategies were as close to the global optimum as possible 50 repetitions of each optimization were performed and we selected the strategy achieving maximum profits across all repeat optimizations table s1 the number of repetitions was selected to balance computational burden with optimization convergence figure s1 during initial tests we found that use of irrigation was never optimal during the final growth stage i e crop senescence for our case study crop and climate to simplify the solution space for the optimization problem this final soil moisture threshold was therefore set to zero for fixed potential and adaptive irrigation strategies as a result only two re optimizations were performed in the season at the start of growth stage two and three when re optimizing on a growth stage basis the adaptation framework fig 1 for each climate year was repeated 25 times to ensure that a single sub optimal optimization did not affect results however we still included the results from all of these adaption repetitions as it captures the reality that a producer will never know ahead of time what the true optimum strategy is aquacrop ospy crop growth parameters for maize are summarized in foster et al 2015 and are re stated in table 1 the soil was chosen to be a clay loam a dominant soil type in the region cropwatch 2018 with soil hydraulic parameters taken from the aquacrop ospy default parameters when calculating profits with eq 1 a constant crop price of 180 per tonne was used based on a 10 year average of us maize grain prices usda 2019 irrigation costs were set at 1 per ha mm 10 28 per acre inch based on estimates from the 2019 nebraska crop budget report cropwatch 2019 this report also provides estimates for non irrigation production costs e g labour materials taxes which allows us to set the fixed production cost in eq 1 to 1728 ha 1 further details on model parameters and code implementation can be found by viewing the full source code available at https github com thomasdkelly adaptive irrigation 2 5 sensitivity analysis the value of adapting irrigation decisions within the growing season may be influenced by several factors first in regions experiencing water scarcity for regulatory restrictions the amount of water farmers are able to extract for irrigation purposes is increasingly being restricted as part of water conservation and sustainability initiatives and policies these restrictions pose issues for producers globally including our case study region for example the upper republican natural resource district where our case study location resides has imposed a five year 2018 2022 groundwater allocation of 65 acre inches per hectare urnrd 2019 these sorts of restrictions could reduce the value of adaptive irrigation strategies as producers will be less able to flexibly react to the unfolding season we therefore repeated the main analysis growth stage adaptation including a cap on the amount of irrigation that can be applied in a given season this cap was applied in all years preventing any further irrigation events if the total application within the current season reached the cap this additional analysis was performed over a range of seasonal caps from 75 to 550 mm ha 1 for each cap new optimal fixed strategies were determined and then these were used to assess the value of adapting the strategies within the season table s2 another factor that may influence the value of adaptive irrigation scheduling is the frequency with which farmers are able to re optimize decisions as stated in section 2 4 there are only three opportunities two when considering no irrigation is allowed in the final stage for our case study system to re optimize the strategy during the season within our growth stage adaptation framework we hypothesize that being able to adapt at more frequent intervals would lead to further increases in profits compared to the few opportunities allowed by our framework we therefore conducted an additional analysis where our simulation optimization framework was adjusted to allow re optimizations to occur every seven days although other frequencies could also be evaluated seven days was chosen to balance the complexity of the strategy with additional computational demand as well as matching previous work that used similar simulation optimization frameworks cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 the first re optimization will therefore occur on day 7 of each season and re optimizations will stop after day 120 resulting in 17 different sets of thresholds being implemented throughout the season note that the choice of day 120 of the season as the final date for re optimization was because this day falls after the start of the final growth stage when irrigation is always zero but this date could be varied to any other value in alternative model case studies or applications finally as noted earlier the ability to effectively update irrigation decisions may also be influenced by the quality of information available to a farmer about weather conditions in the days or weeks ahead in our main analysis re optimization is performed over the same set of weather years used in the fixed strategy producers must therefore hedge the irrigation strategy against all 37 potential weather scenarios for the remainder of the season in reality some of these years will be more probable than others given weather so far and available forecasts the seven day adaptation framework described above was therefore further adjusted to include a seven day perfect forecast beyond those seven days the producer must again hedge across all 37 weather years the seven day lead time for the perfect forecast was chosen to match previous work jamal et al 2019 we hypothesize that including the seven day perfect forecast will increase profits compared to the standard seven day adaptation due to the greater ability to tune irrigation decisions to the weather ahead for a given season 3 results 3 1 differences between fixed and potential strategies the first part of this analysis used the differential evolution optimization algorithm to find a set of soil moisture thresholds that maximized average profits over 37 climate years with the resulting set of thresholds being referred to as the fixed strategy the potential strategies i e profit maximizing strategies for each individual year were also calculated to give an estimated upper limit for what profits could be achieved with perfect seasonal information table s1 a comparison between the average profits achieved by the fixed 426 ha and potential 459 ha strategies finds that the fixed strategy achieved 92 7 of the average potential profit fig 2a in other words having perfect foresight of weather conditions in each year results in a 7 7 increase in farm profits looking more closely at each individual climate year there is only one year 2012 in which the fixed strategy does not achieve at least 80 of the potential profits fig 2a this year was one of extreme drought less than 43 mm of rainfall during the growing season and so appears to be sacrificed by the optimizer in favour of maximizing average profits across all remaining years focusing instead on the other 36 non drought years regression analysis indicates that 40 of the variation in the performance of the fixed strategy can be explained by the total seasonal rainfall fig 2b the fixed strategy performs better in terms of percentage of potential profits in the wetter years than the drier years using the fixed strategy as a starting point the framework described in section 2 3 aims to assess whether adapting the strategy within the season will increase these fixed profits towards the potential profits 3 2 the value of within season adaptation to assess the value of re optimizing irrigation strategies within the season the fixed irrigation strategy set of soil moisture thresholds was re optimized at the start of each growth stage following the re optimization approach described in section 2 3 after running this framework for all 37 climate years the profits from this adaptive strategy can be compared to the fixed profits to determine the added value of this adaptive approach to scheduling on average our analysis found a 4 87 ha 1 increase in profits with adaptation which translates to a 1 increase in average profit compared to the fixed strategy that does not incorporate any adaptation of irrigation management rules during the growing season however we also observe that growth stage adaptation also increased the minimum profits by 106 and decreased the standard deviation in profits by 2 95 the large increase in minimum profits can be attributed to the drought year 2012 where in season adaptation increases the soil moisture thresholds causing additional irrigation events and profit increases by inspecting the irrigation schedule time series for this year we see the impact of this change in soil moisture thresholds on the soil water content and the timing of irrigation events fig 3 changes to the minimum profits and profit variance may have important implications for some farmers in particular where there is a need to minimize risks associated with extremely low yields in individual years as opposed to simply looking to maximize average profits over multiple years these implications will be further discussed later in section 4 1 several factors are important drivers of the value added from in season adaptation of irrigation scheduling rules first we find that the quality of the starting strategy defined as how close the fixed strategy mean profit is to the potential strategy in a given year explains 39 of the variation in adaptation value fig 3a this relationship shows that adaptation value is lower in years where the fixed strategy is already close to the potential optimal for that year in addition by assessing the relationship between seasonal rainfall and adaptation value we find that adaptation value is inversely proportional to the total seasonal rainfall however our analysis indicates that seasonal rainfall only explains 14 of the variation in adaptation value fig 3b as well total rainfall how the rainfall is distributed over the season is also shown to impact optimal irrigation strategies specifically we find that the coefficient of variation cv in daily rainfall i e standard deviation in daily rainfall mean daily rainfall explains 19 of the variation in adaptation value fig 3c both of these relationships indicate that when rainfall is scarce or more variable the value of within season adaptation is greater inspecting irrigation schedule time series for specific individual years also provides additional insights about why in season adaption is beneficial in some years and not in others for example fig 5 compares the irrigation events triggered by the fixed fig 5a potential fig 5b and growth stage adaptation fig 5c strategies during the 1999 growing season simulation where adaptation decreased seasonal profits by 30 ha 1 the largest decrease for any year overall during both the second and third growth stage the adaptive strategy made minor adjustments to the soil moisture threshold towards the potential threshold one would expect that such an adjustment towards the perfect information strategy would increase profits as it does for the year 2012 however this does not occur in the year 1999 this slightly counterintuitive result can likely be attributed to having to optimize decisions under future weather uncertainty as one can never know what the exact optimal set of thresholds are until the entire season has passed changes to the soil moisture thresholds are unable to perfectly replicate irrigation schedules under the potential strategy with perfect foresight with two extra irrigation events being triggered on days 89 and 90 for the adaptive strategy this reduces overall profits for the season demonstrating that without perfect knowledge of the full seasons weather beforehand there will always be the possibility for maladaptive behavior e g the adjustments made in 1999 during some years 3 3 the impact of adaptation frequency and forecast information on adaptation value as described in section 2 5 two further analyses were conducted to test whether adaptation frequency and quality of forecast information impacted the value of re optimization allowing re optimization of irrigation strategies every seven days lead to a 2 25 ha 1 increase in profits compared to growth stage re optimization achieving 93 69 of the potential profits over the 37 climate years fig 6a by including a perfect seven day weather forecast within this seven day re optimization framework average profits were increased by a further 13 4 ha 1 compared to the standard seven day re optimization achieving 97 28 of potential profits these analyses confirmed our hypothesis that re optimizing more frequently in particular when combined with better information about weather conditions in the days ahead increases the benefits that can be derived from in season adaptation as well as changes to average profits we also see changes in profit variance with adaptation switching from the growth stage adaptation to seven day adaptation increases the minimum profits by 15 8 and reduces the standard deviation in profits by 2 56 compared to growth stage adaptation fig 6b adding a perfect seven day weather forecast to the seven day adaptation strategy further increases the minimum profits by 29 2 compared to the seven day adaptation strategy without perfect weekly forecasts an additional notable effect of introducing perfect weekly forecasts to the seven day adaptation strategy is that there are eight years where the seven day adaptation with perfect weekly forecast outperforms the potential strategy this result indicates the limitations of how we have chosen to define the potential strategy which despite having perfect seasonal weather information still only contains one fixed set of thresholds for the season in comparison the seven day adaptation strategy contains 17 sets of thresholds that are calculated as the season progresses the ability to vary soil moisture targets within rather than just between growth stages allows for more complex irrigation management strategies to emerge sometimes resulting in higher profits despite the farmer not having access to perfect information about weather for the entire season to demonstrate an example of when the seven day strategy with perfect weekly forecast outperformed the potential strategy we compare the individual irrigation events triggered by the fixed fig 7a potential fig 7b and seven day adaptation with perfect weekly forecast fig 7c strategies for the climate year 1992 the flexibility enabled by the seven day adaptation period initially allows an increase in the first growth stage threshold fig 7c meaning that irrigation events for the potential and adaptive strategies were identical for the first 45 days fig 7b c after this initial period the two strategies diverge as the adaptive strategy sticks closer to the fixed strategy with the flexibility to adjust as required whereas the potential thresholds diverge massively during the second growth stage in particular although the seven day adaptation strategy with perfect weekly forecast occasionally outperformed the potential strategy there are still a handful of years where it also performed worse than the fixed strategy figure s2 as stated in the previous section this effect is the result of having to optimize irrigation strategies under uncertainty about weather beyond the seven day forecast and is not the result of the optimization approach or choice of strategy however switching from the growth stage adaptation to the seven day adaptation increased does profits in these years this result implies that more complex irrigation strategies that also incorporate more accurate weather information can help reduce the risk of profit losses from these maladaptive events even when knowledge of weather conditions for the remainder of the season remains unknown or uncertain 3 4 the impact of water constraints on adaptation value regulatory or hydrologic restrictions on irrigation water supply are a common consequence of water scarcity and conflict in many regions including our study area in the central united states we therefore explored how the value of adaptation was affected by the introduction of annual caps on total seasonal irrigation that once reached would prevent any further irrigation being applied during the season by introducing a seasonal irrigation cap of 300 mm ha 1 average seasonal profits achieved by the fixed strategy decrease by 82 ha 1 in comparison to the 426 ha 1 achieved when water use was unrestricted as annual water quotas increase profits increase towards the unrestricted fixed profits for the 300 mm ha 1 limit the average value of adaptation was 1 49 ha 1 this value increases linearly with an increasing seasonal water allocation reaching a benefit of 4 87 ha 1 achieved when water use is unrestricted fig 8a these results imply that restrictions on yearly water use actually decrease the value of adaption a possible intuition for this result is that having more water available during the season allows greater flexibility for the re optimization process to adapt within the season for more severe restrictions on water use i e quotas less than 300 mm ha 1 impacts of adaptation begin to vary significantly from year to year as well on average with large benefits in some years and large costs in others fig 8b these results show that while some benefits may still be derived from adaptation under highly restrictive water use limits the variation in outcomes and potential for maladaptive responses is large in contrast to the analyses without water use restrictions presented previously fig 4 we find no relationship between adaptation value and weather conditions under severe water use restrictions specifically the r 2 between adaptation value and total rainfall for the most restrictive caps 75 100 125 mm ha 1 were all found to be less than 0 02 similarly the r 2 between adaptation value and cv in daily rainfall for these caps were also found to be less than 0 02 therefore whether or not adaptation leads to extreme benefits or costs appears to be mostly down to luck for these extreme water use limits 4 discussion optimization of irrigation scheduling including through in season adaptation of scheduling rules based on weather forecasts and other data have been widely proposed as a means of improving agricultural water productivity in water scarce regions globally e g wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 jamal et al 2018 2019 linker 2021 by linking a crop model to our re optimization framework this article aimed to assess the value of adapting irrigation strategies within the season and how this value is affected by typical information constraints e g in season weather and management constraints e g abstraction restrictions commonly faced by farmers but not adequately considered in past research e g wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2019 for a case study of maize production in a water stressed region of south west nebraska in the united states our analysis demonstrated that a farmer adopting a fixed irrigation strategy i e where rules are the same for each year was able to achieve 92 7 of the average potential profit achievable with perfect seasonal weather foresight in season re optimization of fixed irrigation strategies based on information gained about weather conditions as the seasonal unfolds was able to marginally increase average profits to 93 8 or 94 3 of potential profits depending on how frequently farmers choose or are able to adapt irrigation strategies within the season we demonstrate that value of in season adaptive re optimization of irrigation heuristics is enhanced when farmers have access to perfect weather forecasts for the week ahead for which the producer is able to achieve 97 2 of potential profits adaptive scheduling also universally reduced risks of crop loss or failure events e g during extreme drought years such as 2012 in our study area but with greatest risk reduction benefits found when re optimization is supported by in season forecasts by introducing seasonal water quotas our analysis showed that the variability in adaptation value between years increased dramatically for extremely restrictive water quotas 4 1 implications for research producers and industry our results build upon previous work that aimed to optimize irrigation strategies within crop models using adaptive re optimization during the growing season e g wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 jamal et al 2018 2019 linker 2021 these works did not include an optimized fixed strategy with which to compare the value of adaptive irrigation strategies as a result these studies are likely to have overstated the true potential benefits of adaptive in season irrigation scheduling with our results demonstrating that the majority of potential profits can be achieved with simpler optimal average irrigation heuristics our findings are also consistent with other evidence about the value of adaptive agricultural decision making in the literature for example jones et al 2000 showed that optimization of crop management practices for maize e g planting date crop density nitrogen application based on seasonal climate forecasts increased average seasonal profits by only 16 26 ha 1 3 4 depending on the case study region when compared with fixed management rules based on a range of historic weather years our findings thus highlight the importance of comparing adaptive strategies to similarly optimized fixed strategies which may provide a more efficient means of scheduling irrigation when technological logistical and cognitive costs associated with implementing more complex data driven adaptive scheduling practices are taken into account a key finding of our analysis is that there is likely to be substantial heterogeneity in the economic benefits of adaptive irrigation scheduling across years with some years potentially experiencing declines in profits when strategies are re optimized within the season this type of maladaptation was also found in hejazi et al 2014 and occurs as a result of underlying uncertainty about future weather along with the complex non linear responses of crop growth and yield development to soil moisture patterns during the season unless the entire season s weather is known with a high degree of certainty in advance it is extremely challenging for a farmer to determine which irrigation strategy will reliably lead to the largest profits even if one strategy is superior on average there will be some years where an alternative strategy results in higher profits the season to season variability in profits also highlights that instead of evaluating irrigation strategies on as few as 5 climate years as is common in previous work wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 hejazi et al 2014 jamal et al 2018 2019 researchers must use quantities approaching 30 in order to fully capture local weather characteristics and thus accurately evaluate outcomes of adaptive decision making or the value of data e g forecasts our analysis found that some of the year to year variability in benefits from adaptive irrigation scheduling could be explained by the quality of the starting strategy total rainfall during the season and the coefficient of variation of daily rainfall during the season these relationships suggested that in years with less rainfall or where rainfall is unevenly distributed during the season the economic value of adaptive scheduling will be higher this is particularly relevant given climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of weather extremes in many regions ipcc 2022 our analysis also found that adaptive strategies did cause an increase in minimum profits and decrease in profit variance over the 37 years for more risk averse farmers who cannot simply seek to maximize average profits this reduction may provide enough motivation to invest in adaptive strategies however the presence of other safety nets for example crop insurance schemes could decrease the value of adaptive scheduling practices as farmers will be financially protected against some of the consequences in the driest years the strong performance of both fixed and adaptive irrigation strategies relative to theoretical potential profits is in part due to specifying a strategy made up of four soil moisture thresholds one for each major growth stage kelly et al 2021 found that choosing a simpler strategy made up of just one soil moisture threshold for the entire growing season led to a 120 ha 1 decrease in profits compared to the four soil moisture threshold strategy as done in our analysis this decrease is three times larger than the profit difference found between the fixed and potential strategies in our analysis crop models and simulation optimization frameworks such as that used in the present article are vital for designing and optimizing these irrigation strategies which can also be replicated for many crops and production environments over time however these optimal strategies will need to be updated to ensure the historical weather years used to optimize the strategy reflect changes in the likely range of weather scenarios that will occur in the upcoming season for example changes in the variability of expected weather outcomes due to climate change will likely reduce the performance of fixed strategies and enhance benefits of adaptive scheduling if these shifts in climate variability are not accounted for when designing fixed irrigation management rules 4 2 framework limitations and future directions while our analysis provides valuable insights about the potential value of adaptive in season irrigation scheduling for improving agricultural productivity and profitability it is important to highlight several key simplifications in our analysis first an assumption made in our analysis is that the re optimization framework considers the hypothetical farmer to have perfect knowledge of the current state of the soil water balance and crop growth e g yield canopy cover rooting depth however in the real world farmers may not have perfect information about current field conditions or be able to predict with certainty how crop development will be affected by different potential weather scenarios as a result the real world value of within season adaptation is likely to be even lower than found in our analysis as the re optimization of irrigation strategies will be influenced not only by uncertainty in weather conditions for the days and weeks ahead but also by uncertainties in the current status of crop growth and soil moisture these additional uncertainties are likely to increase the potential for maladaptive irrigation scheduling responses to occur in particular where capacity for irrigation water use is limited by regulatory hydrologic or socio economic constraints however further research is needed to quantify the magnitude of this effect as previous research e g kelly et al 2021 has found that perfect knowledge of the field and climate conditions is not required for near optimal irrigation scheduling to balance computational time and resources our analysis focused on a selection of key factors adaptation frequency foresight of near future weather abstraction restrictions that we hypothesized may be important determinants of the value of adaptive irrigation scheduling approaches nonetheless other factors not analysed in the present paper may also influence the value of adaptive scheduling for example if the baseline fixed irrigation strategy is sub optimal or poorly defined kelly et al 2021 there may be greater value in updating this strategy throughout the season the presence of multi year quotas rather than the single year quotas considered in the present article may also affect the value of adaptation as in season decisions have implications for water availability in later years and thus make the optimization process both an intra and inter seasonal problem young et al 2021 furthermore the presence of financial safety nets such as crop insurance usda 2022 suchato et al 2022 may reduce the value of adaptation as outlier drought years in which the largest benefits of adaptation are observed in this study will result in profit losses that are less severe for farmers finally it is important to acknowledge that results presented in this study are dependent on the ability of the underlying crop water model to accurately represent real world crop responses to soil moisture deficits weather conditions and irrigation management practices aquacrop has been shown to adequately capture maize yield responses to water stress within our study area and the united states generally heng et al 2009 sandhu and irmak 2019 further research should extend the analysis presented here to consider how the value of adaptive irrigation scheduling is influenced by the choice of underlying crop model and parameterization including to consider potentially important differences that may exist across different crop varieties e g more less drought tolerant soil types e g higher lower water holding capacity or climatic regimes e g greater lesser rainfall variability 5 conclusions the aim of this manuscript was to assess the potential added value of in season adaptation of irrigation scheduling practices for improving productivity and profitability of agricultural water use under climate uncertainty for a case study of maize production in nebraska our analysis demonstrates the vast majority of the potential profits can be achieved by adopting a fixed irrigation strategy that is optimized pre season to account for expected variability in weather outcomes but which is not adjusted within each year increases in average profit as well as decreases in profit variance are possible by re optimizing this strategy within the season with the size of this increase dependent on the potential frequency of adaptation and foresight of weather for the days ahead however the overall magnitude of these increased returns are small even in the presence of restrictions on total seasonal water use by farmers as a result our findings suggest that farmers and water managers may be better to prioritize the adoption of simpler average irrigation scheduling heuristics that are well optimized to local production conditions and constraints in doing so farmers are likely to achieve the majority of the potential gains in crop yields and water use savings while also

9182,controlled drainage cd is a valuable management practice for reducing drainage volume and nutrient loss but its impact on corn zea mays l production is not completely understood the objectives of this study were to investigate the regional effect of cd on corn grain yield compared to free drainage fd investigate the factors influencing corn yield response to cd provide management recommendations for optimizing corn yield under cd and identify future research needs for corn production on poorly drained soils with subsurface drainage systems this synthesis included data collected from 13 field sites where corn was planted under both fd and cd in six u s midwestern states and north carolina totaling 55 site years of data from 2006 to 2017 on average there was no statistically significant difference in corn grain yield between cd 10 62 mg ha and fd 10 53 mg ha 1 however 42 of the dataset indicated that cd either increased or decreased corn yield by 4 or more compared to fd further analysis was conducted on this subset of data in order to evaluate underlying factors i e weather conditions during the season soil type and drainage system design and management influencing corn yield response to cd results of this analysis showed that cd was effective in alleviating plant stress caused by mild to moderate drought conditions and subsequently increased corn grain yield by 4 14 in 12 site years in contrast cd reduced corn grain yield by 4 10 during wet growing seasons 6 site years variability in growing season precipitation has been identified as a key factor influencing corn grain yield under cd and more active management or cd system automation is recommended general recommendations are provided for managing manually operated

availability the data are included in the transforming drainage database abendroth et al 2022 and are published at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 1 introduction improved drainage is required for crop production on naturally poorly drained soils in humid and sub humid regions including millions of hectares in the u s midwest and southeast fausey 2005 skaggs et al 2012a improved drainage systems have enabled agricultural production on much of the most productive lands in the world castellano et al 2019 without improved drainage providing adequate food supply for the growing world s population would be an unattainable challenge a well designed drainage system provides a multitude of benefits to farmers as it improves trafficable conditions for timely field operations increases soil aeration and reduces waterlogging in low areas increases spring soil temperatures and reduces surface water runoff these benefits lead to improved soil quality and soil structure reduced soil erosion better root development and subsequently higher yields and improved crop quality however agricultural drainage increases nutrient losses to groundwater and surface water bodies skaggs et al 2005 controlled drainage cd is a drainage water management practice that was primarily developed for reducing nitrogen n loss from subsurface drained agricultural fields skaggs et al 2010 it is implemented by artificially raising the outlet elevation of a subsurface drainage system to reduce overall drainage volume and nutrient loss skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 helmers et al 2022 practitioners can set the drainage system outlet at any elevation between the ground surface and the drain depth and thus vary the drainage intensity depending on farming needs the water quality benefits of cd are mainly realized by setting the drain outlets at shallow depths close to the soil surface during the fallow season when drainage is not required extensive research has been conducted since the late 1970 s to investigate the performance of cd for reducing n loss from subsurface drained fields e g gilliam et al 1979 evans et al 1995 youssef et al 2018 liu et al 2019 helmers et al 2022 controlled drainage influences field hydrology as it raises the groundwater table which increases soil wetness in the vadose zone and reduces drainage outflow unlike free drainage fd systems that remove excess water to the designed drain depth whenever a high water table occurs cd conserves water by increasing the retention time of water in the soil profile therefore cd systems can be managed during the growing season to alleviate plant stresses caused by dry conditions potentially resulting in higher crop yields however cd may also have an adverse effect on crop growth and yield during wet growing seasons since cd may delay and or reduce the removal of excess soil water in the root zone exacerbating plant stresses due to wet conditions nash et al 2015 the positive and negative effects of cd on corn yield are dependent upon timing and severity of dry and wet conditions and how the cd system is managed in response to these conditions unlike the water quality benefits of cd the effect of the practice on crop yield has not been extensively investigated among eight published studies conducted on artificially drained soils within a broad geographic extent which compared corn grain yield of cd to fd table 1 five studies showed no significant effect of cd on corn grain yield while three studies showed a modest but positive impact crop yield response to cd is influenced by several interacting factors including weather soil crop drainage system design and management delbecq et al 2012 ghane et al 2012 jaynes 2012 poole et al 2013 weather variability greatly affects rainfed crop production systems on artificially drained soils li et al 2019 precipitation exhibits more inter annual variation compared to other weather parameters that determine evapotranspiration demand particularly temperature and solar radiation inter and intra seasonal variations of precipitation are the main determinant of yield outcomes for a specific growing season at a specific location where there was no supplemental irrigation depending on precipitation amounts growing seasons can be characterized as dry normal or wet national drought mitigation center 2019 it is not uncommon for periods of dry normal or wet conditions to occur during the same growing season the timing and severity of dry and or wet conditions during the growing season significantly affect the yield of a specific crop furthermore different hybrids of a crop e g corn have different levels of tolerance to varying degrees of dry and wet conditions singh and ghildyal 1980 shah et al 2012 zipper et al 2016 the tolerance level of a corn hybrid to wet and dry conditions also changes depending on the crop developmental stage for example corn is more vulnerable to excessively wet conditions during vegetative development while dry conditions have more detrimental effect on the plant during reproductive development kaur et al 2020 precipitation variability can result in excess or deficit water conditions in the root zone which may negatively affect plant growth development and yield results of a study in central and southeast usa showed that these regions are very sensitive to short term precipitation deficit during critical corn development stages zipper et al 2016 the researchers also reported that the relationship between water stress and grain yield were strongly nonlinear resulting in yield losses under both wet and dry conditions in another study using u s county level yield and crop insurance loss data between 1981 and 2016 corn yield losses were comparable for excess rainfall and drought conditions li et al 2019 a temperature deficit water stress interaction was observed due to high relative vapor pressure deficit coupled with heat stress li et al 2019 soil type influences plant vulnerability to precipitation deficit or excess plants grown on coarse textured soils are more vulnerable to precipitation deficit conditions due to low soil water holding capacity in contrast crops grown on fine textured soils are generally more susceptible to precipitation excess soils are assigned to one of seven natural

soil under natural conditions three groups typify soils where artificial drainage may be required to improve plant growth somewhat poorly drained poorly drained and very poorly drained soils without improved drainage these soils are too wet for extended periods during the growing season which may negatively impact crop yields for the first time this paper investigates the effects of cd on corn

for 55 site years across the midwest and north carolina usa 2 investigate the effects of precipitation and drainage system management on corn yield response to cd 3 recommend management strategies for optimizing corn yield response under cd 4 and identify research needs for better water management of corn grown on artificially drained soils in humid and sub humid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of sites this study was conducted using data from 13 sites across the u s midwest in the states of indiana iowa minnesota missouri ohio and south dakota as well as the east coast state of north carolina fig 1 the data are included in the transforming drainage database abendroth et al 2022 published at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 and also archived at iowa state university https drainagedata org a total of 55 site years of data was compiled from plot or field scale experiments located on university operated research sites or privately owned farms for evaluating the effects of cd on corn grain yield none of the sites was irrigated during the years included in the study the numbers of years of data varied among sites fig 1 table 2 five sites with 16 of the site years were in ohio while iowa and missouri both had two sites each with iowa representing 22 and missouri 18 of the site years indiana and minnesota both contributed one site each to the data set with each state accounting for 16 of the site years south dakota and north carolina each contributed one site and accounted for 2 and 5 of the site years respectively collection of key site characteristic data included soil classification soil series soil drainage class and textural class table 2 and drainage system design parameters drain depth and spacing table 3 additionally corn grain yield drainage system management weather and agronomic management data were collected for each site year 2005 2017 of the data set according to the usda soil drainage classification soil survey staff 1999 soils at the sites were classified as somewhat poorly drained 6 soil series poorly drained 10 soil series and very poorly drained 6 soil series soil texture classes were mostly fine textured ranging from silt loams to clays plus one site with fine sandy loam the experimental areas of the fd and cd treatments ranged from less than 0 1 ha to greater than 14 ha and from less than 0 1 ha to greater than 22 ha respectively table 3 all sites were subsurface drained with 100 mm 4 in diameter perforated corrugated tubing the depth of the subsurface drains ranged from 0 61 m to 1 22 m across sites and drain spacing varied from 6 1 m to 36 6 m table 3 the drainage coefficient dc which quantifies the hydraulic capacity of a drainage system skaggs 2017 was generally 10 20 mm d 1 but ranged from 3 3 mm d 1 to 36 9 mm d 1 table 3 2 2 management of drain outlets drain outlets of the fd treatments remained open year round while the cd treatments were managed differently by site and year with typical outlet elevation for each site shown in fig 2 typical management of a cd system involves adjusting drain outlets to different levels during specific periods of the year for example 1 drain outlets are set to a shallow depth below the soil surface e g 30 cm during the fallow season for water quality benefits when drainage is not required 2 drain outlets are set to drain depth i e the system runs in fd mode for specified periods in the spring and fall to provide trafficable conditions for field operations e g tillage planting and harvesting 3 drain outlets are set to depths shallower than the drain depth e g 45 70 cm to enhance water conservation and storage in the soil profile during the crop growing season 2 3 corn management planting and harvest dates are reported as a range for the available site years of data table a 1 with the mean planting and harvest dates shown on the water table management diagram fig 2 all yield data were adjusted to 155 g kg moisture prior to analysis although heterogeneity existed among sites with respect to the hybrid grown and associated traits fertilization tillage and crop protection product management crops at each site were managed based on best management practices and or common farming practices at the time 2 4 weather data precipitation and air temperature were collected using on site measurements or retrieved from nearby weather stations precipitation and temperature data were summarized for both the period of record and the long term mean table a 2 and table a 3 the period of record represented the time interval ranging from one to 11 years when weather data were collected during active experimentation the long term mean was based on data collected from nearby weather stations between 1986 and 2015 the standard deviation of the mean was calculated based on monthly average values 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 statistical comparison of corn yield under controlled drainage and free drainage we considered each site year of corn yield under cd and fd as one data point for this statistical analysis if the drainage treatment was replicated the corn yield under cd and fd was calculated based on the mean values of the individual replicates before conducting the statistical analysis corn yield data were checked for outliers by comparing the yield data to 150 of the interquartile range q0 75 q0 25 based on this criterion the corn yield in 2015 growing season at mo knox1 site 2 53 mg ha 1 for cd and 2 16 mg ha 1 for fd was considered an outlier and excluded from the statistical analysis then we conducted analysis of variance anova using the mixed procedure of sas 9 4 software sas institute inc 2013 we considered the drainage treatment as a fixed effect while both sites and years were considered random effects the constructed anova model considered both the main effects drainage treatment site year and the interactions drainage treatment site drainage treatment year site year 2 5 2 corn yield stability under controlled drainage and free drainage the yield stability analysis determined if cd increased corn yield stability by reducing yield variation compared to fd similar to the statistical analysis described in the previous section each site year represented a single data point and mean yield values were used for sites with replicated drainage treatments environment was considered as a random factor and drainage treatments cd and fd were fixed we used the mixed procedure of sas 9 4 sas institute inc 2013 as described in ghane et al 2012 yield stability was assessed using two models the first model assumes constant variance compound symmetry and no difference in yield stability which is essentially identical to an anova mixed model the second model corresponds to shukla s 1972 stability variance model for drainage water management if the first model is a better fit there is no difference in yield stability between cd and fd both the akaike s information criterion aic and the likelihood ratio test lrt were used to determine the best fit model wolfinger 1996 2 6 factors affecting corn yield response to controlled drainage in addition to the statistical analyses we conducted a quantitative analysis to assess precipitation variability as a contributing factor of corn yield response to cd the effect of the drainage system management on corn yield response to cd was also discussed our approach evaluated the effects of timing duration and severity of wet and dry conditions during the growing season on corn yield response to cd and fd wet and dry conditions were characterized based on the difference between precipitation and crop evapotranspiration which were determined using three day moving average values corn susceptibility to wet and dry conditions during different stages of growth was represented using empirical factors similar to the drainmod model evans et al 1991 skaggs et al 2012b weather parameters utilized for the analysis included daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperatures for this analysis we selected a subset of the 55 site years with change in corn yield under cd that was 4 greater or less than fd the 4 threshold was chosen since it represented a relatively large yield response to cd while capturing a relatively large enough number of site years for the analysis originally 23 site years met this criterion but 5 site years were excluded from the analysis for different reasons mo knox1 2015 was excluded since it was an outlier that was also excluded from the statistical analysis both oh hardin2 2010 and oh auglaize2 2018 were excluded because precipitation was not measured on site during these two site years ia washington 2012 was excluded because of drain outlet management issues while sd clay 2016 was excluded because of hydrologic interaction between the experimental plots under cd and fd based on communication with researchers who managed the sites the analysis was conducted on the remaining eighteen site years which included five at ia washington site four at in randolph and two at each of mo knox1 mn redwood1 and nc washington fig 3 2 6 1 corn evapotranspiration calculation corn evapotranspiration etc was estimated as the product of the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and a single crop coefficient kc that varies with the growing season fig a 1 the reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which requires site latitude and daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and has been shown to provide reasonable estimations of eto hargreaves and allen 2003 weather data required for penman montieth or priestly taylor were not available for all site years 2 6 2 determining normalized crop susceptibility ncs factors the timing and duration of the different stages of development of corn hybrids planted at the 18 site years were estimated based on the accumulated growing degree days gdd table 4 the gdd values were calculated using a minimum temperature of 10 c and a maximum temperature of 30 c abendroth et al 2011 we used ncs factors reported by evans et al 1991 to assign relative susceptibility values of corn to wet and dry conditions during different development stages table 4 these ncs factors are used in the drainmod model to simulate the effect of water related stresses on crop yield skaggs et al 2012b according to these factors corn is more susceptible to wet conditions during establishment and vegetative stages but it is more vulnerable to dry conditions during late vegetative and early reproductive stages table 4 the summation of the ncs values for each stress over the entire growing season is close to unity 1 03 for wet and 0 96 for dry 2 6 3 calculation of numerical stress indices to wet and dry conditions the stress indices si were calculated using 3 day moving averages of daily precipitation crop evapotranspiration and normalized crop susceptibility factors to wet and dry conditions which were identified based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration since water stored in the soil profile following a precipitation event can satisfy et demand for a number of days the 3 day moving average was selected as the basis for the calculations to better represent the antecedent soil moisture conditions the daily si for wet and dry conditions were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 si wet ncs wet p et if p et 2 si dry ncs dry p et if p et where si wet and si dry are the daily stress indices to wet and dry conditions mm d 1 respectively ncs wet and ncs dry are the 3 day moving averages of the daily normalized crop susceptibility factors to wet and dry conditions respectively et and p are the 3 day moving averages of daily evapotranspiration mm d 1 and precipitation mm d 1 respectively according to eqs 1 and 2 si wet is always positive and si dry is always negative the relative stress indices rsi for wet and dry conditions over the entire growing season were calculated in terms of the daily stress indices using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 rsi wet i 1 n si wet i 1 n si wet si dry 4 rsi dry i 1 n si dry i 1 n si wet si dry where rsi wet and rsi dry are the relative stress indices to wet and dry conditions dimensionless over the entire growing season respectively and n is the number of days of the growing season the relative stress indices range from zero to one and characterize the growing season as either relatively wet or dry the summation of rsi wet and rsi dry equals unity such that as one index increases the other decreases for example a close to one value of rsi wet means the excess water conditions are the dominant cause of water related stress on the plant during the growing season conversely a rsi dry greater than 0 5 indicates a relatively dry growing season it should be noted that rsi values indicate the prevalence of a certain stress relative to the other but it does not necessarily quantify the severity of dry or wet stress the summation of the si values eqs 1 and 2 over a specific period of the growing season is a better indicator of the level of severity of a specific stress during that period 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather the amount and timing of precipitation are critical for rainfed agriculture corn production in the u s midwest and southeast is highly sensitive to wet conditions during early vegetative stages of development and drought conditions during the late vegetative stages and the early reproductive stages of development willison et al 2021 corn is also sensitive to temperature extremes during anthesis tasseling and silking abendroth et al 2011 a gradient of increasing annual precipitation and average annual evapotranspiration et occurs from west to east fig 4 table a 2 there was a wide range in mean monthly precipitation for all sites and likewise relatively large standard deviations table a 2 monthly precipitation was below average during the period of study compared to the 30 year means for all but one of the ohio sites the minnesota site and the north carolina site growing season mean precipitation for the period of record was within 10 of the 30 year may september mean for the indiana iowa and missouri sites table a 2 the south dakota site was the only location with above average 30 year may september mean precipitation for the period of record an increasing temperature gradient occurs from north to south across the study region table a 3 the mean monthly air temperature between may and september for all locations exhibited small standard deviations indicating the data were clustered around the mean and thus standard deviations were not reported there is a wide range in mean monthly temperature across all sites minnesota the most northern location had a 30 yr mean growing season temperature of 18 9 c whereas north carolina the most southern location had a 30 yr mean growing season temperature of 24 2 c table a 3 for all locations may was the coldest month of the growing season while july was the warmest month with the exception of nc washington in which august was the warmest 3 2 corn yield variability among site years corn yield exhibited large variation among different site years regardless of the management of the drainage system the maximum corn yield was greater than 14 5 mg ha 1 while the minimum yield was less than 3 0 mg ha 1 table 5 across all site years the standard deviation of the corn yield was nearly 30 of the mean indicating large variation in corn yield among site years the difference in corn yield was statistically significant among sites p 0 0255 but not among years p 0 1368 with a statistically significant site year interaction p 0 0001 corn yield varied considerably among different sites fig 5 among all sites mo knox1 had the lowest average corn yield 6 6 mg ha 1 for fd and 6 8 mg ha 1 for cd and the highest year to year variability in yield which was due to excessive precipitation in some years and exceptional drought conditions in others national drought mitigation center 2019 and the fact that corn produced on claypan soils at the mo knox1 site is sensitive to precipitation extremes the standard deviation of the corn yield for seven years at this site was 3 8 mg ha 1 for both fd and cd which is over 50 of the mean in contrast oh auglaize2 site had the highest average corn yield 13 6 mg ha 1 for fd and 13 8 mg ha 1 for cd and the lowest year to year variability sd 0 9 mg ha 1 for fd and 0 4 mg ha 1 for cd for sites with multi year data corn yield exhibited large inter annual variation for the same site fig 5 among the 13 sites there were four sites with a relatively large number of site years mo knox1 with seven years in randolph with nine years mn redwood1 with nine years and ia washington with 12 years each of the other sites had three years or less there was a stark difference between the corn yield measured at mo knox1 site and the yield measured at the other three sites with relatively large number of data points as previously mentioned the measured corn yield at mo knox1 was low and exhibited high year to year variability corn yields at in randolph mn redwood1 and ia washington were comparable in terms of average yield and year to year variability the average yield varied between 10 0 mg ha 1 for in randolph site and 12 4 mg ha 1 for ia washington site the standard deviation values varied between 1 7 mg ha 1 and 2 3 mg ha 1 which represent about 14 23 of the mean values 3 3 corn yield response to controlled drainage when considering all site years together the difference between corn yield under fd and cd was not statistically significant p 0 2154 also the effects of the drainage mode site and drainage mode year interactions on corn yield were not statistically significant p 0 0817 p 0 2110 respectively the corn yield stability analysis showed no statistically significant difference p 0 341 between cd and fd using either of the two models the summary statistics describing corn yield under both fd and cd are quite similar table 5 overall mean corn grain yield was 1 greater with cd compared to fd but the median was 2 higher for fd the majority of the data points of the scatter diagram comparing corn yield under fd and cd are clustered around the 1 1 line indicating similar yield response to both fd and cd fig 6 despite the overall similarity in corn yield response to managing drain outlets during the growing season 42 of the data set indicated that cd either increased or decreased corn yield by 4 or more compared to fd fig 6 in a few instances the effect of cd on corn yield was even more pronounced for example cd at ia washington reduced corn yield 10 2 in 2009 but increased yield 9 4 in 2017 controlled drainage increased yields 9 7 14 2 at nc washington in 2007 mn redwood1 in 2009 mo knox1 in 2012 and oh hardin2 in 2008 in the next section we investigated the conditions where cd had a relatively large yield response either 4 to better understand the factors influencing corn yield response to drainage water management the insights gained from the analysis can inform a more effective management of cd systems that promotes positive yield responses while minimizing negative yield outcomes 3 4 factors affecting corn yield under controlled drainage 3 4 1 weather the effect of growing season precipitation variability on corn yield response to cd was investigated following the approach described in section 2 6 for 18 site years with a 4 threshold positive or negative corn yield response to cd compared to fd fig 7 shows the relationship between corn yield response to cd compared to fd and corresponding relative dominance of dryness and wetness conditions expressed as the difference between the rsi dry and rsi wet values for each of the 18 growing seasons investigated in this analysis there is a strong correlation r2 0 67 between corn yield response to cd and the overall dry or wet stress experienced by the crop during the growing season out of the seven wet growing seasons characterized by negative values on the horizontal axis of fig 7 cd reduced yield during six seasons compared to fd the only outlier the 2014 growing season at mo knox1 site had no dominant water related stress as indicated by the almost equal values of the rsi to wet and dry conditions rsi wet 0 52 and rsi dry 0 48 for this growing season corn yield with cd was 5 9 greater than fd cd 9 17 mg ha 1 vs fd 8 67 mg ha 1 controlled drainage increased corn yield in all growing seasons dominated by dry conditions among the 18 site years included in the analysis fig 7 as the trend line in fig 7 depicts the relationship between yield increase with cd and the relative dominance of dry conditions is non linear controlled drainage was effective in alleviating stresses on corn caused by mild to moderate dry conditions and subsequently increasing yield for example cd increased corn yield 11 7 for the 2007 growing season at the nc washington site similarly implementing cd at oh hardin2 increased corn yield 14 2 in 2008 the dominance of the dry conditions in these two growing seasons was relatively moderate rsi dry 0 61 vs rsi wet 0 39 for 2007 at nc washington and rsi dry 0 65 vs rsi wet 0 35 for 2008 at oh hardin2 as the relative dominance of dry conditions increases the corresponding increase in corn yield due to cd levels off at 5 7 for example implementing cd at in randolph increased corn yield 5 7 and 5 1 in the 2007 and 2009 growing seasons respectively similarly cd increased corn yield at nc washington by 6 9 in 2011 during these three growing seasons stresses on corn due to dry conditions were strongly dominant compared to stresses due to wet conditions rsi dry 0 89 vs rsi wet 0 11 for 2007 at in randolph rsi dry 0 81 vs rsi wet 0 19 for 2009 at in randolph rsi dry 0 84 vs rsi wet 0 16 for nc washington controlled drainage raises the water table and stores more water in the soil profile compared to fd however the increase in soil water storage due to cd is usually small which is only sufficient for supplying corn evapotranspiration demand for a few days not weeks subsequently cd is more effective in protecting corn against short dry spells rather than long dry periods that occur during the growing season crop protection against long and frequent dry conditions in this region would require supplemental irrigation willison et al 2021 the values of rsi wet eq 3 and rsi dry eq 4 calculated for the entire growing season indicate only the relative dominance of wet and dry conditions during the growing season therefore nearly equal values of rsi wet and rsi dry do not necessarily mean a normal growing season it only means the stresses on the corn plant due to excessively wet and dry conditions are equivalent also an rsi value near one calculated for the entire growing season does not necessarily indicate the level of severity of the wet and dry stresses it only means that one stress is substantially dominant relative to the other on the other hand the values of the si wet eq 1 and si dry eq 2 calculated for the entire growing season represent a quantitative measure of the level of the severity of the wet and dry stresses on the corn plant fig 8 and table a 4 for the 18 site years included in the analysis the stresses on corn due to excessively dry conditions were greater and exhibited less inter seasonal variability compared to stresses on corn due to excessively wet conditions fig 8 the mean and standard deviation values of the si dry and si wet were 53 5 12 8 mm and 37 7 25 4 mm respectively the 2012 growing season at mo knox1 was the most severely dry growing season with the highest si dry value of 88 7 mm and the lowest corn yield among the 18 growing seasons 3 17 mg ha 1 for fd and 3 48 mg ha 1 for cd controlled drainage increased corn yield for this growing season by 9 7 the 2007 and 2012 growing seasons at in randolph were the second and third driest seasons with si dry values of 66 5 mm and 65 5 mm respectively regardless of the drainage water management corn yields during these two growing seasons were the lowest among the nine seasons at in randolph implementing cd during the 2007 and 2012 growing seasons at in randolph increased corn yield by 5 7 6 71 mg ha 1 for cd vs 6 34 mg ha 1 for fd and 5 4 8 21 mg ha 1 for cd vs 7 78 mg ha 1 for fd respectively the inter seasonal variation of the stresses due to wet conditions was greater compared to the stresses due to dry conditions the si wet varied over a wide range for the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis this underscores the challenge of managing the cd systems to avoid or minimize corn yield losses caused by stresses due to wet conditions current cd systems managed based on passive preset management protocols for the drain outlet are expected to exacerbate the corn yield losses with the increase in the inter annual variation of stresses due to wet conditions four growing seasons at ia washington site were the wettest si wet 89 8 mm in 2010 73 9 mm in 2015 71 5 mm in 2009 70 2 mm in 2007 among the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis controlled drainage reduced corn yield during these four growing seasons 4 5 10 2 3 4 2 controlled drainage system management in order to investigate the effect of cd system management on corn yield we examined the dryness and wetness conditions at a monthly temporal scale the rsi values to wet and dry conditions were calculated for the months of may june july and august of each of the 18 site years previously reported fig 9 this analysis revealed important findings that have major consequences on how to effectively manage cd systems during corn growing season in the geographic region covered by this study the month of may was consistently wet for the u s midwest region during the period of analysis fig 9 the rsi wet values for may were greater than 0 99 for 13 of 16 growing seasons two of the 18 growing seasons were excluded from may rsi calculations due to late planting an outlier to this trend was may 2011 at nc washington site which was extremely dry rsi wet 0 08 the month of july was the driest month mean rsi dry 0 84 of the growing season followed by august mean rsi dry 0 76 the relatively low standard deviation values for rsi dry for july 0 14 and august 0 19 indicate the high likelihood of dry conditions during these two months during the 18 growing seasons june represented a transition from overall wet conditions in may to mostly dry conditions in july and august fig 9 mean rsi wet and rsi dry for june were 0 56 and 0 44 respectively unlike the other months of the growing season the water related stresses on corn exhibited greater variability around the average conditions fig 9 sd 0 36 this high variability of the weather factor in june represents a challenge for managing the cd system due to the intermittent nature of wet and dry conditions these findings can guide the development of recommendations for managing cd systems for optimizing corn yield benefits in the previous discussion in this section we focused on the likelihood of occurrence of wet and dry conditions during different months of the corn growing season based on the 18 site years included in the analysis the overall corn yield outcome is influenced by all water related stresses experienced by the crop during the entire growing season these stresses are not only affected by the characteristics of the wet and dry periods i e timing length and severity but also by the drain outlet management during these periods in the remainder of this section we present and discuss both the characteristics of the wet and dry periods and the drain outlet management during these periods and how both factors may affect corn yield outcome wet and dry stresses and the outlet management are shown in figs 10 12 the drainage systems were managed differently for the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis five seasons at ia washington four seasons at in randolph two seasons at each of mn redwood mo knox1 and nc washington one season at ia story2 oh hardin2 and oh henry in four of the five growing seasons at ia washington the drainage system was consistently managed by changing drainage mode from fd 120 cm drain depth to cd 76 cm drain outlet level in late may or early june while in 2010 the drainage system was set in cd mode during the entire growing season with the drain outlet level set at 76 cm deep until the last week of june when it was raised to a shallower depth of 30 cm the month of may was dominated by wet conditions for the five growing seasons at ia washington rsi wet 0 99 the month of june was wet during four seasons 0 81 rsi wet 0 92 and relatively dry in the 5th season rsi dry 0 62 both july and august were mostly dry 0 55 rsi dry 0 97 raising the outlet in late may or early june reduced corn yield in the four growing seasons with wet june by 4 5 10 2 on the other hand cd increased corn yield in the one season with relatively dry june by 9 4 fig 10 the four growing seasons at in randolph represent relatively contrasting conditions to the five growing seasons at ia washington while the month of may was also dominated by wet conditions rsi wet 1 0 june was wet in two growing seasons rsi wet 0 78 0 85 and very dry in the other two growing seasons rsi dry 0 79 1 00 fig 11 also july 0 62 rsi dry 1 00 and august 0 66 rsi dry 1 00 were drier compared to the five seasons at ia washington the drainage system at in randolph was managed differently than the drainage system at ia washington while the management of the drainage system at ia washinton followed a relatively consistent protocol the drainage system at in randolph was managed differently in each of the four growing seasons in 2007 the drainage system was in fd mode drain depth 91 cm during may and the first two weeks of june and was changed to cd on june 19 with a relatively shallow outlet level 40 cm the drainage system was in cd mode during the entire 2009 and 2012 growing seasons in 2009 the growing season started in late may with drain outlet level at 60 cm which was raised at the beginning of june to 40 cm and then was raised again on june 10 to a very shallow depth 10 cm that remained until the end of the season in 2012 the drain outlet level remained at 40 cm for the whole growing season the 2009 growing season started with the drainage system in cd mode at 40 cm drain outlet level in response to persistent wet conditions in may and june the drainage system was changed on may 11 to fd mode and remained until july 7 when it was changed back to cd mode but with a more conservative drain outlet level 60 cm the management of the drainage system during the four growing seasons at this site can generally be described as somewhat risky but responsive to the weather factor managing cd increased corn yield in the three dry growing seasons by 5 1 5 7 and reduced yield by 4 4 during the wet growing season in 2010 the 2008 growing season at oh hardin2 site represents an interesting case for the management of the cd system because it led to the largest increase in crop yield 14 2 among the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis this growing season started late corn was planted on may 29 and exhibited persistent wet conditions until almost mid july followed by persistent dry conditions until the end of the season fig 12 the drainage system remained in fd during the whole wet period in mid july the drainage system was changed to cd mode and remained in cd until the end of the growing season the two sites in minnesota mn redwood1 and north carolina nc washington clearly have contrasting weather conditions tables a 2 a 3 representing the two ends of the spectrum with regards to growing season s temperature and precipitation the 30 year may through august precipitation is 545 mm for nc washington and 378 mm for mn redwood1 with regards to temperature mn redwood has the coldest growing season while nc washington has the warmest growing season based on 30 year values the nc and mn sites have may through august average temperatures of 24 5 c and 19 6 c respectively these stark differences between temperature and precipitation at both sites influence the supply and demand for water during the corn growing season and should be taken into consideration when managing the cd systems at the two sites the 2007 and 2011 growing seasons at nc washington were quite different with regards to water related stresses on corn fig 12 in 2007 may was wet rsi wet 0 99 while june rsi dry 0 68 july rsi dry 0 86 and august rsi dry 0 72 were dry corn was planted on april 30 and the drainage system was changed on may 30 from fd to cd with 50 cm drain outlet level which remained until the end of the growing season this management protocol avoided the wet period of the growing season and conserved water during the drier period which led to an 11 7 increase in corn yield the 2011 growing season was drier than 2007 with dry stresses dominated may rsi dry 0 92 june rsi dry 0 97 and july rsi dry 0 77 however august 2011 was a relatively balanced month with regards to water related stresses rsi dry 0 42 in 2011 corn was planted on april 19 and the setting of the drainage system was changed from fd to cd soon after april 26 the drainage system remained in cd mode with 50 cm drain outlet level until the end of the growing season implementing cd in 2011 increased corn yield by 6 9 compared to fd the 2009 growing season at mn redwood1 followed the general trend of relatively wet may rsi wet 1 0 water balanced june rsi wet 0 54 and dry july rsi dry 0 92 and august rsi dry 0 95 fig 12 in this growing season corn was planted on april 22 and the setting of the drainage system was changed from fd to cd on may 1 with 61 cm drain outlet level that remained until the end of the growing season the implementation of cd in 2009 at this site increased corn yield by 11 4 it should be mentioned that this positive yield outcome occurred despite raising the drain outlet too early at the beginning of may this can be attributed to the mildly wet conditions in may 2009 si wet 5 0 mm in contrast to the 2009 growing season the 2015 season had very wet may si wet 18 9 mm and june si wet 18 1 mm and moderately dry july rsi dry 0 66 and august rsi dry 0 86 the drainage system was set in cd mode with a drain outlet level at 74 cm during the entire growing season the implementation of cd in 2015 at mn redwood1 reduced corn yield by 6 2 3 5 managing controlled drainage for optimizing corn yield in the u s midwest in this section we present recommendations for cd management in the u s midwest region to modulate water related stresses on corn crop and enhance grain yield managing cd for reducing nutrient transport via the drainage system when fields are fallow late fall and winter is outside the scope of this paper we did not include research from the u s southeast when making these recommendations given the limited number of site years included nonetheless the recommendations presented in this section may still be useful for guiding management of cd systems in the u s southeast the management of cd systems involves making decisions regarding 1 when the drainage is switched from fd to cd and vice versa and 2 how high the drain outlet is maintained when the system is in cd mode 3 5 1 timing of changing drainage mode weather is the key determining factor when managing drainage systems between fd and cd modes precipitation determines the need for drainage for timely field operations and aeration of the root zone as a baseline for manually operated cd systems we provide the following recommendations for managing cd during the corn growing season in the midwest beginning of the growing season system is in fd mode corn is planted in the midwest region in late april and early may soils can be near saturation due to snow melt and spring precipitation coupled with low et drainage system management in fd mode results in good trafficable conditions for spring field operations drainage system management during may system is in fd mode our analysis indicated that may was consistently the wettest month of the growing season in the midwest with rsi wet values approaching 1 0 this is due to a combination of relatively high precipitation and low et driven by relatively low temperatures and small emerging vegetation drainage system management during june drainage mode to be changed from fd to cd during the second or third week of june to avoid wet stress based on our findings june exhibited both wet and dry conditions and can be characterized as a transition month with a high degree of precipitation variability and increasing et demand our analysis showed that there was nearly an equal chance of wet and dry stress in june with rsi wet and rsi dry values of 0 56 and 0 44 respectively choice of an actual date for changing the system to cd should be determined locally based on current precipitation conditions drainage system management during july and august system is in cd mode in this study july and august were consistently characterized by water deficit conditions caused by peak et demand during late vegetative and early reproductive stages of corn development coupled with intermittent precipitation and long dry periods the mean rsi dry values for july and august were 0 84 and 0 76 respectively with relatively low standard deviations 0 14 and 0 19 indicating that the likelihood of dry stress during these two months was high drainage system management during september drainage mode to be changed from cd back to fd corn is harvested in the midwest region in early october the crop matures while the drainage system is in cd mode and then continues to dry down to harvest ready moisture when it is in fd mode fall precipitation can begin to rewet the soil profile given low et and cooling temperatures managing the drainage system in fd mode results in trafficable conditions for fall field operations 3 5 2 drain outlet management depth during the growing season the management depth of the cd system is mainly a function of the integrated effect of the soil properties and drainage system design which can be expressed quantitatively using the drainage intensity di of the system skaggs et al 2006 the field microtopography and the anticipated zone of influence of cd should be taken into consideration while determining the drain outlet management depth we recommend 45 70 cm drainage system outlet management depths for cd depending on soil properties and drainage system design while this paper did not provide a rigorous analysis that supports this recommendation the analysis presented in section 3 4 2 provides clear evidence of the effect of cd system outlet management on corn yield response the recommended range of 45 70 cm below the average surface elevation within the area of the field being controlled is expected to maintain a well aerated root zone while enhancing plant water supply via capillary rise we recommend a 70 cm drain outlet management depth for sites that are more susceptible to wet conditions due to low di s a shallower management depth of 45 cm is recommended for sites with high di s which are more vulnerable to dry conditions we believe that the recommended range strikes a balance between enhancing soil water storage for plant use during dry conditions and minimizing the risk of increasing excessive wet conditions in the root zone which could have a negative effect on crop yield 3 6 managing controlled drainage for increasing corn yield challenges and opportunities our research demonstrated the long term effect of cd on corn grain yield is not statistically significant when compared to fd across the u s midwest and in the state of north carolina as currently managed despite the overall lack of difference between corn yield under both cd and fd there were several site years with relatively large positive or negative differences between cd and fd the corn yield response to drainage water management was largely dependent on the amount and timing of precipitation controlled drainage consistently increased corn yields during dry growing seasons and reduced yield in seasons dominated by wet conditions over the long term the increase in yield during dry growing seasons was offset by the decrease in yield during wet growing seasons leading to an overall non significant corn yield response to cd the corn yield response to cd synthesized in this paper is largely affected by the management protocols of cd which are based on recommendations similar to the one proposed in section 3 5 of this paper these recommendations were developed for average temporal conditions over a specific region the potential yield benefit of managing cd based on average conditions diminishes as the variability of growing season precipitation increases a more responsive management of drain outlets is necessary for adjusting the drainage intensity during the growing season depending on timing and amount of precipitation and subsequently optimizing yield benefits of cd however frequent adjustments of the drainage control structures during the growing season are not practical for large farms unless the management process is automated the concept of automation of cd and subirrigation systems has been proposed in the 1980 s and 1990 s fouss 1985 fouss and rogers 1998 however the available technologies at that time limited the advancement of the idea with the recent advances in sensor technologies weather forecast data acquisition transmission and analytics the automation of drainage water management is becoming more feasible recent research at north carolina state university developed and tested real time water management systems for increasing crop production resilience to weather uncertainties bagheri 2022 as presented in this paper the decisions of when and how to change the drain outlet levels depend on several interacting factors and conditions including soil type surface and subsurface drainage characteristics antecedent conditions soil moisture in the root zone and groundwater table depth from soil surface at the onset of a precipitation event weather conditions and plant development stage that determine plant water demand additionally the likelihood of precipitation during the next three to seven days after a current precipitation event should theoretically affect drain outlet management decisions the high uncertainty in precipitation forecasting especially during the summer months adds to the complexity of identifying optimum drainage system outlet levels research is needed to develop a new generation of drainage control structures and decision support tools for active management of cd during the growing season to optimize water conservation of the practice during the dry periods of the growing season while minimizing or avoiding waterlogging conditions during wet periods until the technologies for automation of cd systems are fully developed and become commercially available existing cd systems can be carefully managed for ameliorating stresses on plants during dry periods of the growing season while minimizing plant stresses caused by excess water during wet periods of the growing season however negative impacts of managing existing cd systems on corn yield during growing seasons with intermittent wet conditions occurring over a large portion of the growing season are unavoidable the geographic location soil type and characteristics of the existing drainage systems e g drain depth and spacing and surface storage must be considered when developing the management protocol for the cd system to optimize yield benefits under dry conditions and minimize yield losses under wet conditions 4 conclusions the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 controlled drainage cd did not have a statistically significant effect on corn yield when averaged over a long record of site years therefore reduction of nutrients and sediment losses from subsurface drained agricultural fields remains the primary benefit of cd as shown by others skaggs et al 2012a youssef et al 2018 helmers et al 2022 2 variability in growing season precipitation is the key factor influencing corn yield response to cd the results of this study clearly demonstrate that cd can increase corn yield during dry growing seasons while it can reduce yield during wet growing seasons for the entire data set however the increase in corn yield during dry growing seasons was offset by the yield reduction during the wet growing seasons resulting in an overall non significant yield effect 3 controlled drainage has the potential to positively influence corn yield if the drainage control structures are managed to increase water storage in the soil profile while minimizing excess water conditions in the plant root zone during the wet periods of the growing season the current practice of manual management of cd outlets based on recommendations developed for average conditions makes it extremely difficult to optimize corn yield during dry conditions while avoiding plant stresses under wet conditions 4 research is needed to develop sensor based data driven water management systems for crop production on poorly drained soils with frequently shallow water tables these systems which are applicable to both cd and subirrigation enable customizing water management to specific field conditions e g weather soil type drainage system and crop rather than following regional recommendations that are based on average conditions as a result soil water in the root zone can be maintained at or near optimum levels which is expected to have a substantial positive effect on corn

9182,controlled drainage cd is a valuable management practice for reducing drainage volume and nutrient loss but its impact on corn zea mays l production is not completely understood the objectives of this study were to investigate the regional effect of cd on corn grain yield compared to free drainage fd investigate the factors influencing corn yield response to cd provide management recommendations for optimizing corn yield under cd and identify future research needs for corn production on poorly drained soils with subsurface drainage systems this synthesis included data collected from 13 field sites where corn was planted under both fd and cd in six u s midwestern states and north carolina totaling 55 site years of data from 2006 to 2017 on average there was no statistically significant difference in corn grain yield between cd 10 62 mg ha and fd 10 53 mg ha 1 however 42 of the dataset indicated that cd either increased or decreased corn yield by 4 or more compared to fd further analysis was conducted on this subset of data in order to evaluate underlying factors i e weather conditions during the season soil type and drainage system design and management influencing corn yield response to cd results of this analysis showed that cd was effective in alleviating plant stress caused by mild to moderate drought conditions and subsequently increased corn grain yield by 4 14 in 12 site years in contrast cd reduced corn grain yield by 4 10 during wet growing seasons 6 site years variability in growing season precipitation has been identified as a key factor influencing corn grain yield under cd and more active management or cd system automation is recommended general recommendations are provided for managing manually operated cd systems in the u s midwest to improve growing season water management and corn yield additional research to develop technologically advanced water management systems for crop production on poorly drained soils is needed in order to adapt to changing weather patterns keywords dry stress wet stress tile drainage drainage water management precipitation deficit precipitation excess data availability the data are included in the transforming drainage database abendroth et al 2022 and are published at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 1 introduction improved drainage is required for crop production on naturally poorly drained soils in humid and sub humid regions including millions of hectares in the u s midwest and southeast fausey 2005 skaggs et al 2012a improved drainage systems have enabled agricultural production on much of the most productive lands in the world castellano et al 2019 without improved drainage providing adequate food supply for the growing world s population would be an unattainable challenge a well designed drainage system provides a multitude of benefits to farmers as it improves trafficable conditions for timely field operations increases soil aeration and reduces waterlogging in low areas increases spring soil temperatures and reduces surface water runoff these benefits lead to improved soil quality and soil structure reduced soil erosion better root development and subsequently higher yields and improved crop quality however agricultural drainage increases nutrient losses to groundwater and surface water bodies skaggs et al 2005 controlled drainage cd is a drainage water management practice that was primarily developed for reducing nitrogen n loss from subsurface drained agricultural fields skaggs et al 2010 it is implemented by artificially raising the outlet elevation of a subsurface drainage system to reduce overall drainage volume and nutrient loss skaggs et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 helmers et al 2022 practitioners can set the drainage system outlet at any elevation between the ground surface and the drain depth and thus vary the drainage intensity depending on farming needs the water quality benefits of cd are mainly realized by setting the drain outlets at shallow depths close to the soil surface during the fallow season when drainage is not required extensive research has been conducted since the late 1970 s to investigate the performance of cd for reducing n loss from subsurface drained fields e g gilliam et al 1979 evans et al 1995 youssef et al 2018 liu et al 2019 helmers et al 2022 controlled drainage influences field hydrology as it raises the groundwater table which increases soil wetness in the vadose zone and reduces drainage outflow unlike free drainage fd systems that remove excess water to the designed drain depth whenever a high water table occurs cd conserves water by increasing the retention time of water in the soil profile therefore cd systems can be managed during the growing season to alleviate plant stresses caused by dry conditions potentially resulting in higher crop yields however cd may also have an adverse effect on crop growth and yield during wet growing seasons since cd may delay and or reduce the removal of excess soil water in the root zone exacerbating plant stresses due to wet conditions nash et al 2015 the positive and negative effects of cd on corn yield are dependent upon timing and severity of dry and wet conditions and how the cd system is managed in response to these conditions unlike the water quality benefits of cd the effect of the practice on crop yield has not been extensively investigated among eight published studies conducted on artificially drained soils within a broad geographic extent which compared corn grain yield of cd to fd table 1 five studies showed no significant effect of cd on corn grain yield while three studies showed a modest but positive impact crop yield response to cd is influenced by several interacting factors including weather soil crop drainage system design and management delbecq et al 2012 ghane et al 2012 jaynes 2012 poole et al 2013 weather variability greatly affects rainfed crop production systems on artificially drained soils li et al 2019 precipitation exhibits more inter annual variation compared to other weather parameters that determine evapotranspiration demand particularly temperature and solar radiation inter and intra seasonal variations of precipitation are the main determinant of yield outcomes for a specific growing season at a specific location where there was no supplemental irrigation depending on precipitation amounts growing seasons can be characterized as dry normal or wet national drought mitigation center 2019 it is not uncommon for periods of dry normal or wet conditions to occur during the same growing season the timing and severity of dry and or wet conditions during the growing season significantly affect the yield of a specific crop furthermore different hybrids of a crop e g corn have different levels of tolerance to varying degrees of dry and wet conditions singh and ghildyal 1980 shah et al 2012 zipper et al 2016 the tolerance level of a corn hybrid to wet and dry conditions also changes depending on the crop developmental stage for example corn is more vulnerable to excessively wet conditions during vegetative development while dry conditions have more detrimental effect on the plant during reproductive development kaur et al 2020 precipitation variability can result in excess or deficit water conditions in the root zone which may negatively affect plant growth development and yield results of a study in central and southeast usa showed that these regions are very sensitive to short term precipitation deficit during critical corn development stages zipper et al 2016 the researchers also reported that the relationship between water stress and grain yield were strongly nonlinear resulting in yield losses under both wet and dry conditions in another study using u s county level yield and crop insurance loss data between 1981 and 2016 corn yield losses were comparable for excess rainfall and drought conditions li et al 2019 a temperature deficit water stress interaction was observed due to high relative vapor pressure deficit coupled with heat stress li et al 2019 soil type influences plant vulnerability to precipitation deficit or excess plants grown on coarse textured soils are more vulnerable to precipitation deficit conditions due to low soil water holding capacity in contrast crops grown on fine textured soils are generally more susceptible to precipitation excess soils are assigned to one of seven natural drainage classes by the usda united states department of agriculture natural resource conservation service according to the frequency and duration of periods of saturation or partial saturation in the soil under natural conditions three groups typify soils where artificial drainage may be required to improve plant growth somewhat poorly drained poorly drained and very poorly drained soils without improved drainage these soils are too wet for extended periods during the growing season which may negatively impact crop yields for the first time this paper investigates the effects of cd on corn grain yield using an extensive data set comprising multiple sites and years in major corn production areas in the usa specific objectives of the paper are to 1 compare corn grain yield under cd and fd for 55 site years across the midwest and north carolina usa 2 investigate the effects of precipitation and drainage system management on corn yield response to cd 3 recommend management strategies for optimizing corn yield response under cd 4 and identify research needs for better water management of corn grown on artificially drained soils in humid and sub humid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of sites this study was conducted using data from 13 sites across the u s midwest in the states of indiana iowa minnesota missouri ohio and south dakota as well as the east coast state of north carolina fig 1 the data are included in the transforming drainage database abendroth et al 2022 published at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 and also archived at iowa state university https drainagedata org a total of 55 site years of data was compiled from plot or field scale experiments located on university operated research sites or privately owned farms for evaluating the effects of cd on corn grain yield none of the sites was irrigated during the years included in the study the numbers of years of data varied among sites fig 1 table 2 five sites with 16 of the site years were in ohio while iowa and missouri both had two sites each with iowa representing 22 and missouri 18 of the site years indiana and minnesota both contributed one site each to the data set with each state accounting for 16 of the site years south dakota and north carolina each contributed one site and accounted for 2 and 5 of the site years respectively collection of key site characteristic data included soil classification soil series soil drainage class and textural class table 2 and drainage system design parameters drain depth and spacing table 3 additionally corn grain yield drainage system management weather and agronomic management data were collected for each site year 2005 2017 of the data set according to the usda soil drainage classification soil survey staff 1999 soils at the sites were classified as somewhat poorly drained 6 soil series poorly drained 10 soil series and very poorly drained 6 soil series soil texture classes were mostly fine textured ranging from silt loams to clays plus one site with fine sandy loam the experimental areas of the fd and cd treatments ranged from less than 0 1 ha to greater than 14 ha and from less than 0 1 ha to greater than 22 ha respectively table 3 all sites were subsurface drained with 100 mm 4 in diameter perforated corrugated tubing the depth of the subsurface drains ranged from 0 61 m to 1 22 m across sites and drain spacing varied from 6 1 m to 36 6 m table 3 the drainage coefficient dc which quantifies the hydraulic capacity of a drainage system skaggs 2017 was generally 10 20 mm d 1 but ranged from 3 3 mm d 1 to 36 9 mm d 1 table 3 2 2 management of drain outlets drain outlets of the fd treatments remained open year round while the cd treatments were managed differently by site and year with typical outlet elevation for each site shown in fig 2 typical management of a cd system involves adjusting drain outlets to different levels during specific periods of the year for example 1 drain outlets are set to a shallow depth below the soil surface e g 30 cm during the fallow season for water quality benefits when drainage is not required 2 drain outlets are set to drain depth i e the system runs in fd mode for specified periods in the spring and fall to provide trafficable conditions for field operations e g tillage planting and harvesting 3 drain outlets are set to depths shallower than the drain depth e g 45 70 cm to enhance water conservation and storage in the soil profile during the crop growing season 2 3 corn management planting and harvest dates are reported as a range for the available site years of data table a 1 with the mean planting and harvest dates shown on the water table management diagram fig 2 all yield data were adjusted to 155 g kg moisture prior to analysis although heterogeneity existed among sites with respect to the hybrid grown and associated traits fertilization tillage and crop protection product management crops at each site were managed based on best management practices and or common farming practices at the time 2 4 weather data precipitation and air temperature were collected using on site measurements or retrieved from nearby weather stations precipitation and temperature data were summarized for both the period of record and the long term mean table a 2 and table a 3 the period of record represented the time interval ranging from one to 11 years when weather data were collected during active experimentation the long term mean was based on data collected from nearby weather stations between 1986 and 2015 the standard deviation of the mean was calculated based on monthly average values 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 statistical comparison of corn yield under controlled drainage and free drainage we considered each site year of corn yield under cd and fd as one data point for this statistical analysis if the drainage treatment was replicated the corn yield under cd and fd was calculated based on the mean values of the individual replicates before conducting the statistical analysis corn yield data were checked for outliers by comparing the yield data to 150 of the interquartile range q0 75 q0 25 based on this criterion the corn yield in 2015 growing season at mo knox1 site 2 53 mg ha 1 for cd and 2 16 mg ha 1 for fd was considered an outlier and excluded from the statistical analysis then we conducted analysis of variance anova using the mixed procedure of sas 9 4 software sas institute inc 2013 we considered the drainage treatment as a fixed effect while both sites and years were considered random effects the constructed anova model considered both the main effects drainage treatment site year and the interactions drainage treatment site drainage treatment year site year 2 5 2 corn yield stability under controlled drainage and free drainage the yield stability analysis determined if cd increased corn yield stability by reducing yield variation compared to fd similar to the statistical analysis described in the previous section each site year represented a single data point and mean yield values were used for sites with replicated drainage treatments environment was considered as a random factor and drainage treatments cd and fd were fixed we used the mixed procedure of sas 9 4 sas institute inc 2013 as described in ghane et al 2012 yield stability was assessed using two models the first model assumes constant variance compound symmetry and no difference in yield stability which is essentially identical to an anova mixed model the second model corresponds to shukla s 1972 stability variance model for drainage water management if the first model is a better fit there is no difference in yield stability between cd and fd both the akaike s information criterion aic and the likelihood ratio test lrt were used to determine the best fit model wolfinger 1996 2 6 factors affecting corn yield response to controlled drainage in addition to the statistical analyses we conducted a quantitative analysis to assess precipitation variability as a contributing factor of corn yield response to cd the effect of the drainage system management on corn yield response to cd was also discussed our approach evaluated the effects of timing duration and severity of wet and dry conditions during the growing season on corn yield response to cd and fd wet and dry conditions were characterized based on the difference between precipitation and crop evapotranspiration which were determined using three day moving average values corn susceptibility to wet and dry conditions during different stages of growth was represented using empirical factors similar to the drainmod model evans et al 1991 skaggs et al 2012b weather parameters utilized for the analysis included daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperatures for this analysis we selected a subset of the 55 site years with change in corn yield under cd that was 4 greater or less than fd the 4 threshold was chosen since it represented a relatively large yield response to cd while capturing a relatively large enough number of site years for the analysis originally 23 site years met this criterion but 5 site years were excluded from the analysis for different reasons mo knox1 2015 was excluded since it was an outlier that was also excluded from the statistical analysis both oh hardin2 2010 and oh auglaize2 2018 were excluded because precipitation was not measured on site during these two site years ia washington 2012 was excluded because of drain outlet management issues while sd clay 2016 was excluded because of hydrologic interaction between the experimental plots under cd and fd based on communication with researchers who managed the sites the analysis was conducted on the remaining eighteen site years which included five at ia washington site four at in randolph and two at each of mo knox1 mn redwood1 and nc washington fig 3 2 6 1 corn evapotranspiration calculation corn evapotranspiration etc was estimated as the product of the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and a single crop coefficient kc that varies with the growing season fig a 1 the reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which requires site latitude and daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and has been shown to provide reasonable estimations of eto hargreaves and allen 2003 weather data required for penman montieth or priestly taylor were not available for all site years 2 6 2 determining normalized crop susceptibility ncs factors the timing and duration of the different stages of development of corn hybrids planted at the 18 site years were estimated based on the accumulated growing degree days gdd table 4 the gdd values were calculated using a minimum temperature of 10 c and a maximum temperature of 30 c abendroth et al 2011 we used ncs factors reported by evans et al 1991 to assign relative susceptibility values of corn to wet and dry conditions during different development stages table 4 these ncs factors are used in the drainmod model to simulate the effect of water related stresses on crop yield skaggs et al 2012b according to these factors corn is more susceptible to wet conditions during establishment and vegetative stages but it is more vulnerable to dry conditions during late vegetative and early reproductive stages table 4 the summation of the ncs values for each stress over the entire growing season is close to unity 1 03 for wet and 0 96 for dry 2 6 3 calculation of numerical stress indices to wet and dry conditions the stress indices si were calculated using 3 day moving averages of daily precipitation crop evapotranspiration and normalized crop susceptibility factors to wet and dry conditions which were identified based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration since water stored in the soil profile following a precipitation event can satisfy et demand for a number of days the 3 day moving average was selected as the basis for the calculations to better represent the antecedent soil moisture conditions the daily si for wet and dry conditions were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 si wet ncs wet p et if p et 2 si dry ncs dry p et if p et where si wet and si dry are the daily stress indices to wet and dry conditions mm d 1 respectively ncs wet and ncs dry are the 3 day moving averages of the daily normalized crop susceptibility factors to wet and dry conditions respectively et and p are the 3 day moving averages of daily evapotranspiration mm d 1 and precipitation mm d 1 respectively according to eqs 1 and 2 si wet is always positive and si dry is always negative the relative stress indices rsi for wet and dry conditions over the entire growing season were calculated in terms of the daily stress indices using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 rsi wet i 1 n si wet i 1 n si wet si dry 4 rsi dry i 1 n si dry i 1 n si wet si dry where rsi wet and rsi dry are the relative stress indices to wet and dry conditions dimensionless over the entire growing season respectively and n is the number of days of the growing season the relative stress indices range from zero to one and characterize the growing season as either relatively wet or dry the summation of rsi wet and rsi dry equals unity such that as one index increases the other decreases for example a close to one value of rsi wet means the excess water conditions are the dominant cause of water related stress on the plant during the growing season conversely a rsi dry greater than 0 5 indicates a relatively dry growing season it should be noted that rsi values indicate the prevalence of a certain stress relative to the other but it does not necessarily quantify the severity of dry or wet stress the summation of the si values eqs 1 and 2 over a specific period of the growing season is a better indicator of the level of severity of a specific stress during that period 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather the amount and timing of precipitation are critical for rainfed agriculture corn production in the u s midwest and southeast is highly sensitive to wet conditions during early vegetative stages of development and drought conditions during the late vegetative stages and the early reproductive stages of development willison et al 2021 corn is also sensitive to temperature extremes during anthesis tasseling and silking abendroth et al 2011 a gradient of increasing annual precipitation and average annual evapotranspiration et occurs from west to east fig 4 table a 2 there was a wide range in mean monthly precipitation for all sites and likewise relatively large standard deviations table a 2 monthly precipitation was below average during the period of study compared to the 30 year means for all but one of the ohio sites the minnesota site and the north carolina site growing season mean precipitation for the period of record was within 10 of the 30 year may september mean for the indiana iowa and missouri sites table a 2 the south dakota site was the only location with above average 30 year may september mean precipitation for the period of record an increasing temperature gradient occurs from north to south across the study region table a 3 the mean monthly air temperature between may and september for all locations exhibited small standard deviations indicating the data were clustered around the mean and thus standard deviations were not reported there is a wide range in mean monthly temperature across all sites minnesota the most northern location had a 30 yr mean growing season temperature of 18 9 c whereas north carolina the most southern location had a 30 yr mean growing season temperature of 24 2 c table a 3 for all locations may was the coldest month of the growing season while july was the warmest month with the exception of nc washington in which august was the warmest 3 2 corn yield variability among site years corn yield exhibited large variation among different site years regardless of the management of the drainage system the maximum corn yield was greater than 14 5 mg ha 1 while the minimum yield was less than 3 0 mg ha 1 table 5 across all site years the standard deviation of the corn yield was nearly 30 of the mean indicating large variation in corn yield among site years the difference in corn yield was statistically significant among sites p 0 0255 but not among years p 0 1368 with a statistically significant site year interaction p 0 0001 corn yield varied considerably among different sites fig 5 among all sites mo knox1 had the lowest average corn yield 6 6 mg ha 1 for fd and 6 8 mg ha 1 for cd and the highest year to year variability in yield which was due to excessive precipitation in some years and exceptional drought conditions in others national drought mitigation center 2019 and the fact that corn produced on claypan soils at the mo knox1 site is sensitive to precipitation extremes the standard deviation of the corn yield for seven years at this site was 3 8 mg ha 1 for both fd and cd which is over 50 of the mean in contrast oh auglaize2 site had the highest average corn yield 13 6 mg ha 1 for fd and 13 8 mg ha 1 for cd and the lowest year to year variability sd 0 9 mg ha 1 for fd and 0 4 mg ha 1 for cd for sites with multi year data corn yield exhibited large inter annual variation for the same site fig 5 among the 13 sites there were four sites with a relatively large number of site years mo knox1 with seven years in randolph with nine years mn redwood1 with nine years and ia washington with 12 years each of the other sites had three years or less there was a stark difference between the corn yield measured at mo knox1 site and the yield measured at the other three sites with relatively large number of data points as previously mentioned the measured corn yield at mo knox1 was low and exhibited high year to year variability corn yields at in randolph mn redwood1 and ia washington were comparable in terms of average yield and year to year variability the average yield varied between 10 0 mg ha 1 for in randolph site and 12 4 mg ha 1 for ia washington site the standard deviation values varied between 1 7 mg ha 1 and 2 3 mg ha 1 which represent about 14 23 of the mean values 3 3 corn yield response to controlled drainage when considering all site years together the difference between corn yield under fd and cd was not statistically significant p 0 2154 also the effects of the drainage mode site and drainage mode year interactions on corn yield were not statistically significant p 0 0817 p 0 2110 respectively the corn yield stability analysis showed no statistically significant difference p 0 341 between cd and fd using either of the two models the summary statistics describing corn yield under both fd and cd are quite similar table 5 overall mean corn grain yield was 1 greater with cd compared to fd but the median was 2 higher for fd the majority of the data points of the scatter diagram comparing corn yield under fd and cd are clustered around the 1 1 line indicating similar yield response to both fd and cd fig 6 despite the overall similarity in corn yield response to managing drain outlets during the growing season 42 of the data set indicated that cd either increased or decreased corn yield by 4 or more compared to fd fig 6 in a few instances the effect of cd on corn yield was even more pronounced for example cd at ia washington reduced corn yield 10 2 in 2009 but increased yield 9 4 in 2017 controlled drainage increased yields 9 7 14 2 at nc washington in 2007 mn redwood1 in 2009 mo knox1 in 2012 and oh hardin2 in 2008 in the next section we investigated the conditions where cd had a relatively large yield response either 4 to better understand the factors influencing corn yield response to drainage water management the insights gained from the analysis can inform a more effective management of cd systems that promotes positive yield responses while minimizing negative yield outcomes 3 4 factors affecting corn yield under controlled drainage 3 4 1 weather the effect of growing season precipitation variability on corn yield response to cd was investigated following the approach described in section 2 6 for 18 site years with a 4 threshold positive or negative corn yield response to cd compared to fd fig 7 shows the relationship between corn yield response to cd compared to fd and corresponding relative dominance of dryness and wetness conditions expressed as the difference between the rsi dry and rsi wet values for each of the 18 growing seasons investigated in this analysis there is a strong correlation r2 0 67 between corn yield response to cd and the overall dry or wet stress experienced by the crop during the growing season out of the seven wet growing seasons characterized by negative values on the horizontal axis of fig 7 cd reduced yield during six seasons compared to fd the only outlier the 2014 growing season at mo knox1 site had no dominant water related stress as indicated by the almost equal values of the rsi to wet and dry conditions rsi wet 0 52 and rsi dry 0 48 for this growing season corn yield with cd was 5 9 greater than fd cd 9 17 mg ha 1 vs fd 8 67 mg ha 1 controlled drainage increased corn yield in all growing seasons dominated by dry conditions among the 18 site years included in the analysis fig 7 as the trend line in fig 7 depicts the relationship between yield increase with cd and the relative dominance of dry conditions is non linear controlled drainage was effective in alleviating stresses on corn caused by mild to moderate dry conditions and subsequently increasing yield for example cd increased corn yield 11 7 for the 2007 growing season at the nc washington site similarly implementing cd at oh hardin2 increased corn yield 14 2 in 2008 the dominance of the dry conditions in these two growing seasons was relatively moderate rsi dry 0 61 vs rsi wet 0 39 for 2007 at nc washington and rsi dry 0 65 vs rsi wet 0 35 for 2008 at oh hardin2 as the relative dominance of dry conditions increases the corresponding increase in corn yield due to cd levels off at 5 7 for example implementing cd at in randolph increased corn yield 5 7 and 5 1 in the 2007 and 2009 growing seasons respectively similarly cd increased corn yield at nc washington by 6 9 in 2011 during these three growing seasons stresses on corn due to dry conditions were strongly dominant compared to stresses due to wet conditions rsi dry 0 89 vs rsi wet 0 11 for 2007 at in randolph rsi dry 0 81 vs rsi wet 0 19 for 2009 at in randolph rsi dry 0 84 vs rsi wet 0 16 for nc washington controlled drainage raises the water table and stores more water in the soil profile compared to fd however the increase in soil water storage due to cd is usually small which is only sufficient for supplying corn evapotranspiration demand for a few days not weeks subsequently cd is more effective in protecting corn against short dry spells rather than long dry periods that occur during the growing season crop protection against long and frequent dry conditions in this region would require supplemental irrigation willison et al 2021 the values of rsi wet eq 3 and rsi dry eq 4 calculated for the entire growing season indicate only the relative dominance of wet and dry conditions during the growing season therefore nearly equal values of rsi wet and rsi dry do not necessarily mean a normal growing season it only means the stresses on the corn plant due to excessively wet and dry conditions are equivalent also an rsi value near one calculated for the entire growing season does not necessarily indicate the level of severity of the wet and dry stresses it only means that one stress is substantially dominant relative to the other on the other hand the values of the si wet eq 1 and si dry eq 2 calculated for the entire growing season represent a quantitative measure of the level of the severity of the wet and dry stresses on the corn plant fig 8 and table a 4 for the 18 site years included in the analysis the stresses on corn due to excessively dry conditions were greater and exhibited less inter seasonal variability compared to stresses on corn due to excessively wet conditions fig 8 the mean and standard deviation values of the si dry and si wet were 53 5 12 8 mm and 37 7 25 4 mm respectively the 2012 growing season at mo knox1 was the most severely dry growing season with the highest si dry value of 88 7 mm and the lowest corn yield among the 18 growing seasons 3 17 mg ha 1 for fd and 3 48 mg ha 1 for cd controlled drainage increased corn yield for this growing season by 9 7 the 2007 and 2012 growing seasons at in randolph were the second and third driest seasons with si dry values of 66 5 mm and 65 5 mm respectively regardless of the drainage water management corn yields during these two growing seasons were the lowest among the nine seasons at in randolph implementing cd during the 2007 and 2012 growing seasons at in randolph increased corn yield by 5 7 6 71 mg ha 1 for cd vs 6 34 mg ha 1 for fd and 5 4 8 21 mg ha 1 for cd vs 7 78 mg ha 1 for fd respectively the inter seasonal variation of the stresses due to wet conditions was greater compared to the stresses due to dry conditions the si wet varied over a wide range for the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis this underscores the challenge of managing the cd systems to avoid or minimize corn yield losses caused by stresses due to wet conditions current cd systems managed based on passive preset management protocols for the drain outlet are expected to exacerbate the corn yield losses with the increase in the inter annual variation of stresses due to wet conditions four growing seasons at ia washington site were the wettest si wet 89 8 mm in 2010 73 9 mm in 2015 71 5 mm in 2009 70 2 mm in 2007 among the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis controlled drainage reduced corn yield during these four growing seasons 4 5 10 2 3 4 2 controlled drainage system management in order to investigate the effect of cd system management on corn yield we examined the dryness and wetness conditions at a monthly temporal scale the rsi values to wet and dry conditions were calculated for the months of may june july and august of each of the 18 site years previously reported fig 9 this analysis revealed important findings that have major consequences on how to effectively manage cd systems during corn growing season in the geographic region covered by this study the month of may was consistently wet for the u s midwest region during the period of analysis fig 9 the rsi wet values for may were greater than 0 99 for 13 of 16 growing seasons two of the 18 growing seasons were excluded from may rsi calculations due to late planting an outlier to this trend was may 2011 at nc washington site which was extremely dry rsi wet 0 08 the month of july was the driest month mean rsi dry 0 84 of the growing season followed by august mean rsi dry 0 76 the relatively low standard deviation values for rsi dry for july 0 14 and august 0 19 indicate the high likelihood of dry conditions during these two months during the 18 growing seasons june represented a transition from overall wet conditions in may to mostly dry conditions in july and august fig 9 mean rsi wet and rsi dry for june were 0 56 and 0 44 respectively unlike the other months of the growing season the water related stresses on corn exhibited greater variability around the average conditions fig 9 sd 0 36 this high variability of the weather factor in june represents a challenge for managing the cd system due to the intermittent nature of wet and dry conditions these findings can guide the development of recommendations for managing cd systems for optimizing corn yield benefits in the previous discussion in this section we focused on the likelihood of occurrence of wet and dry conditions during different months of the corn growing season based on the 18 site years included in the analysis the overall corn yield outcome is influenced by all water related stresses experienced by the crop during the entire growing season these stresses are not only affected by the characteristics of the wet and dry periods i e timing length and severity but also by the drain outlet management during these periods in the remainder of this section we present and discuss both the characteristics of the wet and dry periods and the drain outlet management during these periods and how both factors may affect corn yield outcome wet and dry stresses and the outlet management are shown in figs 10 12 the drainage systems were managed differently for the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis five seasons at ia washington four seasons at in randolph two seasons at each of mn redwood mo knox1 and nc washington one season at ia story2 oh hardin2 and oh henry in four of the five growing seasons at ia washington the drainage system was consistently managed by changing drainage mode from fd 120 cm drain depth to cd 76 cm drain outlet level in late may or early june while in 2010 the drainage system was set in cd mode during the entire growing season with the drain outlet level set at 76 cm deep until the last week of june when it was raised to a shallower depth of 30 cm the month of may was dominated by wet conditions for the five growing seasons at ia washington rsi wet 0 99 the month of june was wet during four seasons 0 81 rsi wet 0 92 and relatively dry in the 5th season rsi dry 0 62 both july and august were mostly dry 0 55 rsi dry 0 97 raising the outlet in late may or early june reduced corn yield in the four growing seasons with wet june by 4 5 10 2 on the other hand cd increased corn yield in the one season with relatively dry june by 9 4 fig 10 the four growing seasons at in randolph represent relatively contrasting conditions to the five growing seasons at ia washington while the month of may was also dominated by wet conditions rsi wet 1 0 june was wet in two growing seasons rsi wet 0 78 0 85 and very dry in the other two growing seasons rsi dry 0 79 1 00 fig 11 also july 0 62 rsi dry 1 00 and august 0 66 rsi dry 1 00 were drier compared to the five seasons at ia washington the drainage system at in randolph was managed differently than the drainage system at ia washington while the management of the drainage system at ia washinton followed a relatively consistent protocol the drainage system at in randolph was managed differently in each of the four growing seasons in 2007 the drainage system was in fd mode drain depth 91 cm during may and the first two weeks of june and was changed to cd on june 19 with a relatively shallow outlet level 40 cm the drainage system was in cd mode during the entire 2009 and 2012 growing seasons in 2009 the growing season started in late may with drain outlet level at 60 cm which was raised at the beginning of june to 40 cm and then was raised again on june 10 to a very shallow depth 10 cm that remained until the end of the season in 2012 the drain outlet level remained at 40 cm for the whole growing season the 2009 growing season started with the drainage system in cd mode at 40 cm drain outlet level in response to persistent wet conditions in may and june the drainage system was changed on may 11 to fd mode and remained until july 7 when it was changed back to cd mode but with a more conservative drain outlet level 60 cm the management of the drainage system during the four growing seasons at this site can generally be described as somewhat risky but responsive to the weather factor managing cd increased corn yield in the three dry growing seasons by 5 1 5 7 and reduced yield by 4 4 during the wet growing season in 2010 the 2008 growing season at oh hardin2 site represents an interesting case for the management of the cd system because it led to the largest increase in crop yield 14 2 among the 18 growing seasons included in the analysis this growing season started late corn was planted on may 29 and exhibited persistent wet conditions until almost mid july followed by persistent dry conditions until the end of the season fig 12 the drainage system remained in fd during the whole wet period in mid july the drainage system was changed to cd mode and remained in cd until the end of the growing season the two sites in minnesota mn redwood1 and north carolina nc washington clearly have contrasting weather conditions tables a 2 a 3 representing the two ends of the spectrum with regards to growing season s temperature and precipitation the 30 year may through august precipitation is 545 mm for nc washington and 378 mm for mn redwood1 with regards to temperature mn redwood has the coldest growing season while nc washington has the warmest growing season based on 30 year values the nc and mn sites have may through august average temperatures of 24 5 c and 19 6 c respectively these stark differences between temperature and precipitation at both sites influence the supply and demand for water during the corn growing season and should be taken into consideration when managing the cd systems at the two sites the 2007 and 2011 growing seasons at nc washington were quite different with regards to water related stresses on corn fig 12 in 2007 may was wet rsi wet 0 99 while june rsi dry 0 68 july rsi dry 0 86 and august rsi dry 0 72 were dry corn was planted on april 30 and the drainage system was changed on may 30 from fd to cd with 50 cm drain outlet level which remained until the end of the growing season this management protocol avoided the wet period of the growing season and conserved water during the drier period which led to an 11 7 increase in corn yield the 2011 growing season was drier than 2007 with dry stresses dominated may rsi dry 0 92 june rsi dry 0 97 and july rsi dry 0 77 however august 2011 was a relatively balanced month with regards to water related stresses rsi dry 0 42 in 2011 corn was planted on april 19 and the setting of the drainage system was changed from fd to cd soon after april 26 the drainage system remained in cd mode with 50 cm drain outlet level until the end of the growing season implementing cd in 2011 increased corn yield by 6 9 compared to fd the 2009 growing season at mn redwood1 followed the general trend of relatively wet may rsi wet 1 0 water balanced june rsi wet 0 54 and dry july rsi dry 0 92 and august rsi dry 0 95 fig 12 in this growing season corn was planted on april 22 and the setting of the drainage system was changed from fd to cd on may 1 with 61 cm drain outlet level that remained until the end of the growing season the implementation of cd in 2009 at this site increased corn yield by 11 4 it should be mentioned that this positive yield outcome occurred despite raising the drain outlet too early at the beginning of may this can be attributed to the mildly wet conditions in may 2009 si wet 5 0 mm in contrast to the 2009 growing season the 2015 season had very wet may si wet 18 9 mm and june si wet 18 1 mm and moderately dry july rsi dry 0 66 and august rsi dry 0 86 the drainage system was set in cd mode with a drain outlet level at 74 cm during the entire growing season the implementation of cd in 2015 at mn redwood1 reduced corn yield by 6 2 3 5 managing controlled drainage for optimizing corn yield in the u s midwest in this section we present recommendations for cd management in the u s midwest region to modulate water related stresses on corn crop and enhance grain yield managing cd for reducing nutrient transport via the drainage system when fields are fallow late fall and winter is outside the scope of this paper we did not include research from the u s southeast when making these recommendations given the limited number of site years included nonetheless the recommendations presented in this section may still be useful for guiding management of cd systems in the u s southeast the management of cd systems involves making decisions regarding 1 when the drainage is switched from fd to cd and vice versa and 2 how high the drain outlet is maintained when the system is in cd mode 3 5 1 timing of changing drainage mode weather is the key determining factor when managing drainage systems between fd and cd modes precipitation determines the need for drainage for timely field operations and aeration of the root zone as a baseline for manually operated cd systems we provide the following recommendations for managing cd during the corn growing season in the midwest beginning of the growing season system is in fd mode corn is planted in the midwest region in late april and early may soils can be near saturation due to snow melt and spring precipitation coupled with low et drainage system management in fd mode results in good trafficable conditions for spring field operations drainage system management during may system is in fd mode our analysis indicated that may was consistently the wettest month of the growing season in the midwest with rsi wet values approaching 1 0 this is due to a combination of relatively high precipitation and low et driven by relatively low temperatures and small emerging vegetation drainage system management during june drainage mode to be changed from fd to cd during the second or third week of june to avoid wet stress based on our findings june exhibited both wet and dry conditions and can be characterized as a transition month with a high degree of precipitation variability and increasing et demand our analysis showed that there was nearly an equal chance of wet and dry stress in june with rsi wet and rsi dry values of 0 56 and 0 44 respectively choice of an actual date for changing the system to cd should be determined locally based on current precipitation conditions drainage system management during july and august system is in cd mode in this study july and august were consistently characterized by water deficit conditions caused by peak et demand during late vegetative and early reproductive stages of corn development coupled with intermittent precipitation and long dry periods the mean rsi dry values for july and august were 0 84 and 0 76 respectively with relatively low standard deviations 0 14 and 0 19 indicating that the likelihood of dry stress during these two months was high drainage system management during september drainage mode to be changed from cd back to fd corn is harvested in the midwest region in early october the crop matures while the drainage system is in cd mode and then continues to dry down to harvest ready moisture when it is in fd mode fall precipitation can begin to rewet the soil profile given low et and cooling temperatures managing the drainage system in fd mode results in trafficable conditions for fall field operations 3 5 2 drain outlet management depth during the growing season the management depth of the cd system is mainly a function of the integrated effect of the soil properties and drainage system design which can be expressed quantitatively using the drainage intensity di of the system skaggs et al 2006 the field microtopography and the anticipated zone of influence of cd should be taken into consideration while determining the drain outlet management depth we recommend 45 70 cm drainage system outlet management depths for cd depending on soil properties and drainage system design while this paper did not provide a rigorous analysis that supports this recommendation the analysis presented in section 3 4 2 provides clear evidence of the effect of cd system outlet management on corn yield response the recommended range of 45 70 cm below the average surface elevation within the area of the field being controlled is expected to maintain a well aerated root zone while enhancing plant water supply via capillary rise we recommend a 70 cm drain outlet management depth for sites that are more susceptible to wet conditions due to low di s a shallower management depth of 45 cm is recommended for sites with high di s which are more vulnerable to dry conditions we believe that the recommended range strikes a balance between enhancing soil water storage for plant use during dry conditions and minimizing the risk of increasing excessive wet conditions in the root zone which could have a negative effect on crop yield 3 6 managing controlled drainage for increasing corn yield challenges and opportunities our research demonstrated the long term effect of cd on corn grain yield is not statistically significant when compared to fd across the u s midwest and in the state of north carolina as currently managed despite the overall lack of difference between corn yield under both cd and fd there were several site years with relatively large positive or negative differences between cd and fd the corn yield response to drainage water management was largely dependent on the amount and timing of precipitation controlled drainage consistently increased corn yields during dry growing seasons and reduced yield in seasons dominated by wet conditions over the long term the increase in yield during dry growing seasons was offset by the decrease in yield during wet growing seasons leading to an overall non significant corn yield response to cd the corn yield response to cd synthesized in this paper is largely affected by the management protocols of cd which are based on recommendations similar to the one proposed in section 3 5 of this paper these recommendations were developed for average temporal conditions over a specific region the potential yield benefit of managing cd based on average conditions diminishes as the variability of growing season precipitation increases a more responsive management of drain outlets is necessary for adjusting the drainage intensity during the growing season depending on timing and amount of precipitation and subsequently optimizing yield benefits of cd however frequent adjustments of the drainage control structures during the growing season are not practical for large farms unless the management process is automated the concept of automation of cd and subirrigation systems has been proposed in the 1980 s and 1990 s fouss 1985 fouss and rogers 1998 however the available technologies at that time limited the advancement of the idea with the recent advances in sensor technologies weather forecast data acquisition transmission and analytics the automation of drainage water management is becoming more feasible recent research at north carolina state university developed and tested real time water management systems for increasing crop production resilience to weather uncertainties bagheri 2022 as presented in this paper the decisions of when and how to change the drain outlet levels depend on several interacting factors and conditions including soil type surface and subsurface drainage characteristics antecedent conditions soil moisture in the root zone and groundwater table depth from soil surface at the onset of a precipitation event weather conditions and plant development stage that determine plant water demand additionally the likelihood of precipitation during the next three to seven days after a current precipitation event should theoretically affect drain outlet management decisions the high uncertainty in precipitation forecasting especially during the summer months adds to the complexity of identifying optimum drainage system outlet levels research is needed to develop a new generation of drainage control structures and decision support tools for active management of cd during the growing season to optimize water conservation of the practice during the dry periods of the growing season while minimizing or avoiding waterlogging conditions during wet periods until the technologies for automation of cd systems are fully developed and become commercially available existing cd systems can be carefully managed for ameliorating stresses on plants during dry periods of the growing season while minimizing plant stresses caused by excess water during wet periods of the growing season however negative impacts of managing existing cd systems on corn yield during growing seasons with intermittent wet conditions occurring over a large portion of the growing season are unavoidable the geographic location soil type and characteristics of the existing drainage systems e g drain depth and spacing and surface storage must be considered when developing the management protocol for the cd system to optimize yield benefits under dry conditions and minimize yield losses under wet conditions 4 conclusions the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 controlled drainage cd did not have a statistically significant effect on corn yield when averaged over a long record of site years therefore reduction of nutrients and sediment losses from subsurface drained agricultural fields remains the primary benefit of cd as shown by others skaggs et al 2012a youssef et al 2018 helmers et al 2022 2 variability in growing season precipitation is the key factor influencing corn yield response to cd the results of this study clearly demonstrate that cd can increase corn yield during dry growing seasons while it can reduce yield during wet growing seasons for the entire data set however the increase in corn yield during dry growing seasons was offset by the yield reduction during the wet growing seasons resulting in an overall non significant yield effect 3 controlled drainage has the potential to positively influence corn yield if the drainage control structures are managed to increase water storage in the soil profile while minimizing excess water conditions in the plant root zone during the wet periods of the growing season the current practice of manual management of cd outlets based on recommendations developed for average conditions makes it extremely difficult to optimize corn yield during dry conditions while avoiding plant stresses under wet conditions 4 research is needed to develop sensor based data driven water management systems for crop production on poorly drained soils with frequently shallow water tables these systems which are applicable to both cd and subirrigation enable customizing water management to specific field conditions e g weather soil type drainage system and crop rather than following regional recommendations that are based on average conditions as a result soil water in the root zone can be maintained at or near optimum levels which is expected to have a substantial positive effect on corn yield in drained agricultural landscapes 5 understanding the effect of weather soil crop and drainage system characteristics is key for successful cd management during the growing season in this paper

9183,the use of biodegradable film has been increasingly recommended as an alternative to conventional plastic films several studies have evaluated the applicability of biodegradable film mulching brm however the large scale effects of brm on the spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration et and crop yields remain unclear furthermore existing dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer models cannot accurately represent crop yields as they fail to account for the impact of the disintegration rates of biodegradable films dr on air temperature t a compensation which represents the effect of soil temperature changes in mulched conditions on crop growth in the form of air temperature changes therefore this study proposed an improved dssat model under brm bdssat by considering the impact of dr on t a compensation and the performance of the model was compared with those of the dssat and modified dssat mdssat these models were validated using observed data from nine typical experimental sites in inner mongolia from 2015 to 2018 moreover 96 meteorological stations and soil textures were selected to evaluate the effect of brm on soil water storage sws the amount of water stored in a given soil body mm et and crop yields of the primary cultivated crops sunflower potato corn our findings demonstrated that the bdssat model could accurately simulate the sws et and crop yield under brm the normalized root mean square error nrmse of et simulated by the bdssat model was 49 4 and 66 3 lower than that of the mdssat and dssat models respectively an apparent spatial difference in sws et and crop yield was found in different regions due to the differences in soil texture meteorological data and agricultural management strategy the spatial distributions of et and crop yield of sunflower potato and corn in different regions were largely consistent with the spatial distribution of sws furthermore the et and crop yield of sunflower and potato crops in different regions increased with time 2015 2018 due to an increase in rainfall however these effects were not observed in corn yields in the eastern region additionally the dr in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 55 73 and 90 respectively to ensure high field production crop yield was higher than the historic average crop yields in different regions increased in response to future climate change as the average t a was projected to increase by 0 8 c from 2019 to 2050 except for sunflower yields in the western region keywords biodegradable film mulching crop yield field water consumption inner mongolia dssat model climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction inner mongolia is an autonomous region located in the north of china which is an important global production hub for grain and oil plants this region has a cultivated land area of 11 5 million hectares accounting for 9 0 of the total cultivated land area in china china statistical yearbook 2021 the latest statistical data reported that the total yield of grain and oil plants reached 36 6 and 2 2 million tons in inner mongolia respectively inner mongolia statistical yearbook 2021 however the uneven spatiotemporal distribution and severe deficit of water resources have threatened the long term agricultural development of this region plastic film mulching pm can effectively decrease soil evaporation e s zribi et al 2015 and increases soil moisture and crop yield thidar et al 2020 mendonça et al 2021 therefore this technology has been widely applied worldwide bandopadhyay et al 2020 chen et al 2022a zribi et al 2015 by 2020 the usage and mulched area of plastic film in inner mongolia reached 83 thousand tons and 143 thousand hectares respectively china rural statistical yearbook 2021 with the primary cultivated crops under pm being corn potato and sunflower bai et al 2015 however plastic film is mainly made of polyethylene which hardly disintegrates in natural conditions due to its stable molecular structure espí et al 2006 long term use of plastic film has resulted in widespread plastic residue accumulation in soil which seriously affects agriculture ecosystem environments and crop growth liu et al 2014 biodegradable films have been increasingly recommended in agricultural production as a promising alternative to conventional plastic films brodhagen et al 2017 goldberger et al 2013 sintim et al 2019 biodegradable films can degrade into co2 and h2o through oxidation and microbial activity bandopadhyay et al 2020 mari et al 2020 thus effectively reducing the levels of residual plastic film in the soil previous literature involving the effects of biodegradable film mulching brm on agriculture ecosystem environments has mainly focused on soil moisture soil solute and crop yields at the field scale chen et al 2019 sintim et al 2019 giordano et al 2020 for example saglam et al 2017 reported that soil moisture for brm was close to that of pm and can significantly increase the crop water productivity wp of corn compared to no film mulching zhang 2017 compared the effects of brms and pm on sunflower yield and demonstrated that sunflower yields under brm decreased by 6 1 compared with that of pm due to the low water preservation capacity of biodegradable film during the middle crop growth stage similarly chen et al 2021a found that et and e s et under brm increased by 15 6 and 59 2 compared with pm respectively whereas corn yield under brm decreased by 9 9 compared with pm this occurred because mulching area of biodegradable film was significantly lower than that of plastic film during the middle and late crop growth stages due its higher disintegration rate which promoted water vapor transport from the soil surface to the atmosphere and led to decreases in soil moisture and crop yield under brm in contrast gao et al 2021 reported that et and potato yield under brm and pm were not significantly different because the degradation of biodegradable films at late crop growth stages has a limited effect on et when there is a high degree of crop coverage and potato yields under brm were only 2 3 lower than under pm from 2018 to 2019 although previous studies have reported on the responses of water consumption and crop yield to the soil water deficit caused by an increase in the disintegration area of biodegradable film these observations have only been made at the field scale chen et al 2021b gu et al 2020 morra et al 2016 the unique climate conditions hydrology and soil texture in different regions will inevitably result in variations in the distribution of field water consumption and crop yields under brm however no previous studies have explored these variations and the responses of crop yield and wp to the potential disintegration rate of biodegradable film and climate change remain uncharacterized pure field experiments would be highly time consuming and costly moreover the results of this approach cannot be easily applied to improve regional productivity the use of mathematical methods combined with field experiments enables researchers to easily estimate crop yields on a regional scale currently the mainstream models of crop growth include the agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 and aquacrop raes et al 2009 among these models dssat has been widely used to simulate crop yields on a regional scale due to its friendly user interface and high simulation accuracy tooley et al 2021 however the model is mainly used to study fields without mulching because it does not consider the effects of mulching on water consumption and crop yields garibay et al 2019 woli et al 2019 roy et al 2019 in recent years the simulation of crop yields under pm using dssat can be achieved via the accumulated temperature compensation method however the simulation of crop yield under brm remains lacking particularly for the effects of brm on et and crop yield in large areas li et al 2019 although shen et al 2021 considered the effects of the disintegrated area of plastic film on water vapor in the soil air interface using a modified dssat mdssat the impacts of the disintegrated area on soil temperature t a and crop yield were not be considered particularly the mdssat model did not consider the effect of soil temperature fluctuation after the disintegration of biodegradable film on crop growth the estimation of et and crop yield primarily depend on t a rainfall and solar radiation sr in dssat thus it is of great significance to propose an improved dssat model by considering the effects of the disintegration area of biodegradable film on t a and crop yield moreover the responses of crop yield and wp to the potential disintegration rate of biodegradable film and climate change need to be further explored using the improved dssat model therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to propose an improved dssat model bdssat by considering the effect of the disintegration area of biodegradable film on t a 2 to validate and compare the simulated accuracy among the bdssat mdssat and dssat models using the observation data from multiple years and sites 3 to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution of sws et and crop yield of primary cultivated crops sunflower potato corn under brm in different regions of inner mongolia 4 to identify the optimal disintegration rate of biodegradable film for different regions and 5 to quantify the effects of future climate change on crop yield wp under brm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and data sources a total of 96 meteorological stations and soil textures were selected to evaluate the effect of brm on sws et and crop yield in the eastern middle and western regions of inner mongolia the western middle and eastern regions fall within the warm temperature moderate temperature and cold temperature climate zones respectively the average annual precipitation in the western middle and eastern regions during the study period was 212 2 204 7 and 302 6 mm respectively the main soil type of the western region is classified as sandy loam soil whereas the middle and eastern regions primarily exhibit loam soil in the field experiment the soil type of dengkou linhe and urad front was sandy loam soil based on the soil triangle of usda whereas the soil type of huade and tongliao was loam soil moreover linhe urad front and huade exhibited plaggept soil based on the usda classification system and the soil types of dengkou and tongliao were orthid and argiborolls respectively table 1 provides additional details on the soil textures bulk density and the proportion of sand clay and silt soil organic carbon total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium at soil depths of 0 10 10 30 and 30 100 cm in the western middle and eastern regions in general the meteorological variation from west to east in inner mongolia shows an increase in rainfall improvement in soil fertility a decrease in t a and a reduction in sr additionally nine representative experimental sites were chosen to conduct a field experiment the typical sites in the western region are dengkou linhe and urad front the middle region includes siziwang chahar right front and huade the eastern region includes kharchin jalaid and tongliao fig 1 the experimental data involving dengkou linhe urad front huade and tongliao were determined through a field experiment from 2015 to 2018 moreover four years of the experimental data from siziwang chahar right front kharchin and jalaid were obtained from a public literature database zhang and liu 2020 2 2 experimental designs and management the main crops in the western the middle and eastern regions of inner mongolia are sunflower potato and corn respectively feng 2021 li 2017 yang et al 2021 local recommendation seeding dates for nine representative experimental sites were adopted in this study sunflower seeds were sown on may 21 26 during 2015 2018 potato seeds were sown on may 10 19 during 2015 2018 corn seeds were sown on may 1 8 during 2015 2018 respectively sunflower and potato were harvested at the end of september whereas corn was harvested in mid october a complete biodegradable film 80 cm width 0 008 mm thick made of polybutyl hexanoate corn starch polycaprolactone and masterbatch at a 30 65 5 ratio was laid flat on the surface soil using an automatic machine which can completely disintegrate into co2 and h2o through microbial activity the percentages of breaking elongation maximum loads and tensile strengths of the biodegradable film were 149 0 0 58 n and 14 5 mpa respectively the irrigation depths of sunflower potato and corn were 22 5 40 and 30 mm respectively from 2015 2018 the sunflower potato and corn crops were irrigated a total of 5 7 9 12 and 7 11 times respectively the fertilizer application strategy adopted in this experiment was based on the recommendations from local farmers before sowing 375 kg ha 1 of diammonium phosphate 600 kg ha 1 of formulated fertilizer and 450 kg ha 1 of controlled release fertilizers were applied in the field of sunflower potato and corn as basal fertilizers respectively the field management strategy planting density planting depth row spacing irrigation depth fertilization application amount and fertilization depth of nine representative experimental sites was identical to the local strategy table 2 the seeding date and field management strategy in other sites was similar to that of the representative experimental sites in the same region therefore to reduce the workload this study assumed that the seeding date and field management strategy in other sites i e non experimental site were completely consistent with those of representative experimental sites in the same region moreover the heterogeneity of soil texture and meteorology at the same county level may affect the simulation results at the regional scale therefore the soil texture and meteorology of sites located in the same county were also assumed to be homogeneous 2 3 field monitoring methods historical meteorological data of ninety six stations in inner mongolia from 1956 to 2018 were downloaded from the china

model the dssat model consisted of weather soil crop and field management modules among which the crop module included over 18 different csm crop models hoogenboom et al 2019 the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen were simulated by the principle of soil water and nitrogen balance in the dssat model additionally crop growth and development were estimated by the ceres cropgro cropsim and substor modules in this study three process based crop models in the dssat families ceres maize substor potato and oilcrop sunflower were used to evaluate the response of the development of sunflower potato and corn on soil water dynamics under biodegradable film mulching crop yields were determined by multiplying the harvest index and dry matter 11 cropyield h i d m where hi is the harvest index and dm is the dry matter kg ha 1 3 2 modified dssat model mdssat in the mdssat model the soil evaporation module was improved by introducing the evaporation ratio under pm e s was divided into two stages stage i the constant rate stage and stage ii the falling rate stage shen et al 2021 in stage i e s was not affected by the variation in swc and e s in this stage was computed using the following equation 12 e si e s0 where e si is the cumulative soil evaporation mm d 1 and e s0 is the actual soil evaporation on day i in stage ii e s depends on the water vapor flux through the shallow soil layer which was computed using the following equation 13 e si α t where α is the soil hydraulic characteristic parameter mm d 0 5 and t is the evaporation time d given that soil water vapor would be transported into the atmosphere through the small holes caused by maize stalks e s was related to the mulching fraction of plastic film thus e s was determined using the following equations shen et al 2021 14 e si e s f f m 15 f f m a h a t 16 a h 2 π r 2 where f fm is the mulching fraction a h is the area of small holes at the root zone cm2 and r is the radius of the small holes cm the effects of soil temperature under pm on crop growth were determined using the temperature compensation coefficient method zhang et al 2003 3 3 the proposed dssat model considering brm bdssat although the effect of the disintegrated area on water vapor in the soil air interface has been previously determined using the mdssat model shen et al 2021 the impacts of the disintegrated area on soil temperature t a and crop growth were not be considered especially for the effect of soil temperature fluctuation after the disintegration of biodegradable film on crop growth thus an improved air temperature compensation method was deduced by considering the effect of the disintegration area of biodegradable film on temperature in the dssat model bdssat the compensation coefficient c was determined using the following equation 17 c t cum a s t cum a f t cum s f t cum s s where t cum a s is the effective air accumulated temperature under no film mulching c t cum a f is the effective air accumulated temperature under biodegradable film mulching c t cum s s is the soil accumulated temperature under no film mulching c and t cum s f is the effective soil accumulated temperature under biodegradable film mulching c the effective accumulated temperature was calculated by the following equation 18 t cum i 1 n t ai t b where t ai is the average air temperature on day i and t b is the biological lower limit base point temperature of maize 8 c t a under biodegradable film mulching was compensated based on air temperature under no film mulching by the following equation zhang et al 2003 19 δ t a c δ t s t a t b t s t b where t a is the air temperature difference between biodegradable film mulching and no film mulching c t s is the soil temperature difference between biodegradable film mulching and no film mulching c and t s is the daily soil temperature under no film mulching c t s was obtained using the following equation chen et al 2021b 20 δ t s d h c

highest soil temperature after mulching d f is the film thickness mm t cf is the thermal conductivity of film j m 1 s 1 c 1 t av is the daily average air temperature c t max is the daily maximum air temperature c and β is the empirical constant which can be determined based on the local t a sr and soil texture c was determined by calculating the ratio of soil volume heat capacity and soil wet density 23 c c v ρ 1 where c v is soil volume heat capacity and ρ 1 is soil wet density which was determined using the following equation 24 c v ρ s c s ρ w c w θ 25 ρ 1 ρ s θ ρ w where ρ s is soil dry density g cm 3 θ is soil water content cm 3cm 3 ρ w is water density g cm 3 c s is the specific heat of soil minerals j cm 3 c 1 and c w is the specific heat of water j cm 3 c 1 the mulched region changed in response to increases in the disintegrated area of biodegradable film therefore m is a variable that was obtained using the following equation 26 m ρ 1 z f a t 1 dr 1000 therefore the maximum air temperature t max f and minimum air temperature t min f after compensation under biodegradable film mulching were calculated using the following equations 27 t max f t max δ t a 28 t min f t min δ t a et is typically estimated by the pt model associated with sr tmax and tmin in dssat therefore the potential evapotranspiration et p and et c under brm can be obtained by the following

sdpro and the remaining one is related to oil content sdlip to obtain precise model parameters an algorithm based and manual joint calibration method was adopted firstly crop genetic parameters were calibrated using the genetic coefficient calculator gencalc package in dssat next the corresponding parameters were further calibrated by manually comparing simulated and observed values 3 5 larswg weather generator and correction method the larswg weather generator was developed by lausanne laboratory to promote the development of a crop growth model and hydrological model dixit and telleria 2015 pozdniakov et al 2020 which includes fifteen gcms climate scenarios based on ipcc4 the larswg weather generator can generate a series of meteorological data for a certain period in the future based on historical meteorological data and geographical data such as rainfall sr tmax and tmin fig 2 the generator has been widely applied in the projections of crop yield soil erosion and extreme environmental events the correction method aims to obtain multiple weather series with the same monthly mean and standard deviation as the original series the weather series after correction can be obtained using the following equation 32 g c i σ c j g n i μ c j where gc i is the weather series after correction μc j and σc j are mean and standard deviation respectively and gn i is the normalized weather series 33 μ c j μ c j o 1 δ μ j 34 σ c j σ c j o 1 δ σ j where μ j and σ j are the relative change of mean and standard deviation respectively 35 δ μ j μ j o μ j g μ j g 36 δ σ j σ j o σ j g σ

respectively the normalized weather series can be determined as follows 37 g n i g i μ j g σ j g 3 6 evaluation of model performance the model performance was evaluated using percentage bias pbias the determination coefficient r 2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse these statistical indicators have widely used in previous studies and applications gong et al 2019 qiu et al 2021 rosa et al

different experimental sites in 2015 and were validated using corresponding data from 2016 to 2018 our findings demonstrated that the bdssat model could precisely capture the dynamics of sws et and crop yields table 4 in the calibration period 2015 the average pbias r 2 and nrmse of sws in different experimental sites were 6 8 0 86 and 9 3 respectively and 7 0 0 89 and 6 9 for et the average pbias of crop yield in different sites was only 8 1 in the verification period 2016 2018 the average pbias r 2 and nrmse of sws in different sites were 9 0 0 83 and 11 0 respectively and 6 4 0 86 and 9 0 for et the average pbias of crop yield in different sites was 8 6 compared with the bdssat model et and crop yield simulated by the mdssat model were overestimated by 15 3 and 13 8 respectively as the mdssat model did not consider the effect of reduction of soil temperature after the disintegration of biodegradable film on the field water cycle and crop growth furthermore sws simulated by the mdssat model was underestimated by 16 1 additionally the dssat model did not account for the effect of increased soil temperature under brm on crop growth which resulted in an underestimation of et and crop yield the average et and crop yield in sunflower potato and corn fields were underestimated by 25 5 and 19 5 in the dssat model respectively whereas sws was overestimated by 25 3 in general the bdssat model exhibited a better simulation accuracy compared with the mdssat and dssat models e g the nrmse of et simulated by the bdssat model was 49 4 and 66 3 lower than that of the mdssat and dssat models therefore the bdssat model could be applied to accurately simulate the water cycle and crop growth under brm 4 2 spatiotemporal distribution of soil water storage under biodegradable film mulching in different regions an apparent spatial difference in sws under brm was found in different regions in the western region the distribution of sws under brm showed an increasing trend from west to east the highest sws was observed in the hohhot baotou ordos region whereas the lowest value occurred in the alxa right banner fig 3 the average maximum difference of sws between the hohhot baotou ordos region and the alxa right banner reached 63 7 mm in four years in the middle region the distribution of sws was high in the north and south and low in the middle the highest sws occurred in the duolun region and the lowest value occurred in the sonid left banner the average maximum difference of sws in two places reached 175 mm in four years however in the eastern region the spatial distribution of sws exhibited an increasing trend from south to north fig 3 the highest sws occurred in jalaid whereas the lowest value occurred in linxi with the average maximum difference between these two locations reaching 162 5 mm in four years additionally an apparent temporal difference in sws under brm was identified in 2015 2018 the highest sws in the western region occurred in 2018 with 135 6 mm which increased by 24 8 14 9 and 41 1 compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively however the highest sws in the middle and eastern regions occurred in 2016 the average sws in the middle region in 2016 was 180 3 mm which was 9 5 22 6 and 8 0 higher than that in 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively moreover the average sws in the eastern region in 2016 was 150 7 mm which increased by 19 7 20 1 and 22 7 compared with 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively 4 3 spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration under biodegradable film mulching in different regions the spatiotemporal distribution of et in different regions was similar to that of sws fig 4 in the western region the highest et of sunflower fields occurred in the ordos whereas the lowest et occurred in the alxa left banner the average maximum difference in et in the two locations reached 195 mm in four years in the middle region the highest et of potato fields occurred in the duolun whereas the lowest et occurred in the sonid left banner fig 4 the average maximum difference in et in the two places reached 245 mm in four years however et and sws exhibited opposite trends in the eastern region the spatial distribution of et in the eastern region showed a decreasing trend from south to north as t a in the north was lower than in the south the highest et of corn fields occurred in the aohan region whereas the lowest et occurred in the xin barag right banner with an average maximum difference between the two places reaching 150 mm in four years an apparent temporal difference in et was found in different seasons in general the highest et occurred in 2018 for different regions except for the eastern region the average et in the western region in 2018 was 316 2 mm which represented an increase of 19 1 9 1 and 14 6 compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the average et in the middle region in 2018 was 376 7 mm which was 9 5 22 6 and 8 0 higher than that in 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 4 furthermore the average et in the eastern region in 2018 was 391 7 mm which constituted an increase of 5 1 and 6 8 compared with 2017 and 2018 respectively but a decrease of 3 8 compared with 2015 4 4 spatiotemporal distribution of crop yield of sunflower potato and corn under biodegradable film mulching in different regions there is an obvious spatiotemporal difference in crop yield under brm in different regions from 2015 to 2018 in terms of spatial distribution the distribution of sunflower yields in the western region was high in the east and low in the west fig 5 the highest sunflower yield occurred in the hohhot baotou ordos region with an average yield of 4 8 103 kg ha 1 in four years whereas the lowest yield occurred in the alxa right banner with an average yield of 2 2 103 kg ha 1 the highest wp of sunflower fields in the western region reached 3 0 kg m 3 in the middle region duolun exhibited the highest average potato yield of 43 6 103 kg ha 1 in contrast the lowest potato yield occurred in the sonid left banner with an average yield of 16 0 103 kg ha 1 the highest wp of potato fields in the middle region reached 10 1 kg m 3 in the eastern region the highest and lowest yield of corn occurred in jalaid with an average yield of 11 3 103 kg ha 1 and mohe 4 4 103 kg ha 1 respectively the highest wp of corn in the eastern region was 4 3 kg m 3 fig 5 an apparent difference in crop yields was observed in different regions in terms of temporal distribution the highest sunflower and potato yields occurred in 2018 the average sunflower yield in the western region in 2018 was 4 3 103 kg ha 1 which represented an 11 2 7 2 and 17 9 increase compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively moreover the average potato yield in the middle region in 2018 was 33 3 103 kg ha 1 which increased by 33 0 14 7 and 18 6 compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively furthermore the highest corn yield in the eastern region occurred in 2015 with an average of 7 6 103 kg ha 1 which was 12 1 3 3 and 2 1 higher than in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 4 5 effects of the disintegration rate of biodegradable film on crop yield and crop water productivity to further evaluate the effects of the disintegration rate of biodegradable film dr on crop yield and wp of sunflower potato and corn in different regions six drs were evaluated in this study 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the simulated results showed that the sunflower potato and corn average yields decreased by 6 6 3 5 and 7 2 in response to an increase in dr of 10 respectively fig 6 moreover the average wp of the sunflower potato and corn decreased by 9 7 6 4 and 13 0 respectively to maintain high productivity rates i e the crop yields did not fall below the historic average the dr in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 55 73 and 90 respectively moreover the dr in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 62 53 and 41 when wp was above the historic average 4 6 variation in crop yields and crop water productivity under climate change conditions meteorological data from 2000 to 2050 were predicted based on the larswg5 weather generator to evaluate the effects of climate change on crop yield and wp briefly meteorological data from 1956 to 2000 were used as basal data and the corresponding values from 2000 to 2018 were used as validation data fig 2 the validation results showed that the meteorological data forecasted using the larswg5 weather generator were highly accurate with r 2 values ranging from 0 72 to 0 94 pbias ranging from 12 8 7 2 and nrmse ranging from 7 6 to 13 5 fig s2 in general the crop yields of potato and corn in different regions increased in response to future climate change as the average t a markedly increased by 0 8 c from 2019 to 2050 fig 2 and s2 except for sunflower yield in the western region for example potato yields in the middle region increased annually by 1 7 whereas wp annually decreased by 1 9 from 2019 to 2050 corn yields and wp in the eastern region increased annually by 2 8 and 2 6 from 2019 to 2050 respectively fig 7 however sunflower yield and wp in the western region decreased annually by 7 5 and 6 7 from 2019 to 2050 respectively this was likely because the rainfall in the western region was projected to decrease by 3 5 in the future 2019 2050 fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 disintegration rate of biodegradable film in different regions the disintegration process of the biodegradable film mainly includes two sub processes oxidation and biodegradation reddy et al 2009 martínez romo et al 2015 wiles and scott 2006 first the macromolecular materials of the biodegradable film are disintegrated into smaller molecules via oxidation in natural conditions moreover small molecule polymers are further degraded into co2 h2o and microbial biomass via microbial decomposition bonifer et al 2019 kim et al 2017 the dr primarily depended on external environmental factors such as wind speed temperature and microorganism species stroganov et al 2014 seligra et al 2016 sameshima yamashita et al 2016 dr typically increased in response to an increase in wind speed since the oxidation rate was improved by increasing the contact area between the biodegradable film and the atmosphere similarly high soil temperature promoted dr by stimulating microbial activity and decreasing the tension of the film additionally microorganism species are the main factor that contributes to the disintegration of biodegradable films for instance meyer cifuentes et al 2020 reported that the actinomycetes and bacteroides genera were more abundant in the free community than in the membrane community whereas members of the genus bacillus were more abundant in the membrane community in general the differences in dr in the different examined regions were caused by external factors for example the high dr in the western region was attributed to the high wind speed and temperature in this area in contrast dr decreased as wind speed and temperature decreased from west to east in inner mongolia fig s1 the average dr in the middle and eastern regions was 52 and 37 respectively moreover microbial activity decreased as the soil temperature decreased from the western region to the eastern region which further limited dr a similar result was found in the previous studies for example chen et al 2021a demonstrated that dr reached 60 in the western region feng 2021 found that dr was only 40 at the end of the crop growing season in the eastern region however a different phenomenon was observed in previous experimental studies for example li et al 2020 found that biodegradable film reached a fragmentation period i e the disintegration rate was approximately 80 at the end of the crop growing season these effects were likely due to the composition of the biodegradable film a biodegradable film with a high disintegration rate was adopted in the study of li et al 2020 therefore although low temperature limited the disintegration rate of biodegradable film its disintegration rate was still higher than that of other biodegradable films e g the biodegradable films with medium and low disintegration rates 5 2 spatial difference in soil water storage evapotranspiration and crop yield in sunflower potato and corn fields in different regions spatial differences in sws and et were caused by multiple factors such as soil texture meteorological data and agricultural management strategy bosmans et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2014 in general sws in a sandy field was apparently lower than that of loam and clay fields as sandy soil has larger porosity and poor water retention the corresponding et in a sandy field was lower than that of other soil textures due to its low transpiration for example razzaghi et al 2012 reported that the maximum transpiration in a sandy field was 2 5 mm d 1 and it decreased by 17 compared with that of sandy loam fields a similar result was found in the present study e g the lowest sws and et occurred in the alxa right banner in the western region which featured sandy soil fig 3 however the impact of soil texture on sws and et may be negligible in the eastern region the spatial difference in meteorological data may be the main factor that affected the spatial distribution of sws and et in the eastern region the north of the eastern region is located in a high latitude area therefore t a in this area remains low due to the high atmospheric pressure the average air temperature in the north of the eastern region was far below the optimal temperature for corn growth i e 20 24 c yan and tu 2003 thus the t a difference between the north and south in the eastern region resulted in a high in the south and low in the north distribution for sws and et figs 3 and 4 the spatial distribution of crop yields in different regions was consistent with the spatial distribution of et for instance the distribution of sunflower yields in the western region showed a high in the east and low in the west trend the potato yield in the middle region showed a high in the south central region and low in the north trend the corn yield in the eastern region showed a high in the south and low in the north trend fig 5 li et al 2022 reported that the potato yield in the south of the middle region increased by 41 7 compared with that of the north and the corn yield in the south of the eastern region was approximately 71 4 higher than in the north nevertheless there is an apparent difference in terms of the size of the crop yields in this study and a previous study li et al 2022 indicated that the yields of sunflower potato and corn in the western middle and eastern regions were approximately 700 2500 and 3300 kg ha 1 which far lower than the corresponding crop yields determined in this study these differences may be attributed to different agricultural management strategies li et al 2022 mainly adopted rainfed irrigation under no mulching whereas the present study adopted a drip irrigation technology under brm this approach has significant advantages compared to rainfed irrigation under no mulching such as decreasing e s improving the soil temperature and increasing crop yield saglam et al 2017 gu et al 2020 in general brm not only effectively increases crop yield and wp of sunflower potato and corn but also reduces plastic residue pollution and promotes the development of sustainable agriculture however it is worth nothing that the seeding date and field management strategy in the same region was assumed to be completely homogeneous in this study moreover the soil texture and meteorology of the study sites located in the same county were also assumed to be equal the above assumption may cause some discrepancies between the modeling and measurement results moreover the data collected for this study was not sufficient to evaluate the long term effects of biodegradable film mulching on et and crop yield however the modeling results of this study can still provide a valuable reference for areas with similar experimental and environmental conditions 5 3 temporal differences in evapotranspiration and crop yield in sunflower potato and corn fields in different regions apparent temporal differences in et and crop yields of sunflower potato and corn were observed in different regions under brm for instance the highest et and crop yield in the western and middle regions occurred in 2018 whereas the highest values of these indicators occurred in 2016 in the eastern region this phenomenon may be attributed to seasonal differences in meteorological factors over the course of the observation period i e 2015 2018 in general the key meteorological factors affecting crop yield include t a rainfall and co2 concentration brown and rosenberg 1997 soureshjani et al 2019 wakjira et al 2021 in the western region the inter annual fluctuation of rainfall was the main reason for the temporal difference in et and crop yield for example rainfall in the western region in 2018 increased by 50 7 compared with 2015 fig 2 and the corresponding et and sunflower yields in 2018 was 19 1 and 11 2 higher than in 2015 respectively figs 3 and 4 the cause of the inter annual difference in et and potato yields in the middle region during the 2015 2018 period was similar to that of sunflower yield in the western region however the main meteorological factor affecting corn yield in the eastern region was t a as this region receives fewer daylight hours et and corn yields in the eastern region in 2018 decreased by 3 8 and 2 1 compared with 2015 figs 3 and 4 respectively as t a in 2018 decreased by 1 3 relative to 2015 fig 2 additionally the inter annual fluctuation of co2 concentration may be an important driver of crop yield differences from 2015 to 2018 in recent years co2 concentration in inner mongolia continuously increased due to the impact of human activities which increased the t a in the ground layer since co2 concentration promoted the atmospheric absorption of long wave radiation karlén w 2001 moreover these high co2 concentrations further promoted plant growth and development by improving leaf photosynthesis natali et al 2009 thus increases in co2 concentration may enhance crop yields of sunflower potato and corn in inner mongolia 6 conclusions the bdssat model could more accurately simulate the sws et and crop yields of sunflower potato and corn under brm compared with the mdssat and dssat models an apparent spatial difference in sws et and crop yield was found in different regions due to the differences in soil texture meteorological data and agricultural management strategies the distribution of sws showed a trend of low in the west and high in the east high in the north and south and low in the middle and low in the south and high in the north in the western middle and eastern regions respectively the spatial distribution of et and crop yields in different regions was largely consistent with the spatial distribution of sws furthermore there was an apparent temporal difference in et and crop yield from 2015 to 2018 collectively our findings indicated that et and crop yields in sunflower and potato fields in different regions increased with time except for corn fields in the eastern region additionally the disintegration rates of biodegradable film in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 55 73 and 90 respectively to ensure high field production the crop yields of potato and corn in different regions increased in response to future climate change except for sunflower yield in the western region the finding of this study can effectively promote the application

9183,the use of biodegradable film has been increasingly recommended as an alternative to conventional plastic films several studies have evaluated the applicability of biodegradable film mulching brm however the large scale effects of brm on the spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration et and crop yields remain unclear furthermore existing dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer models cannot accurately represent crop yields as they fail to account for the impact of the disintegration rates of biodegradable films dr on air temperature t a compensation which represents the effect of soil temperature changes in mulched conditions on crop growth in the form of air temperature changes therefore this study proposed an improved dssat model under brm bdssat by considering the impact of dr on t a compensation and the performance of the model was compared with those of the dssat and modified dssat mdssat these models were validated using observed data from nine typical experimental sites in inner mongolia from 2015 to 2018 moreover 96 meteorological stations and soil textures were selected to evaluate the effect of brm on soil water storage sws the amount of water stored in a given soil body mm et and crop yields of the primary cultivated crops sunflower potato corn our findings demonstrated that the bdssat model could accurately simulate the sws et and crop yield under brm the normalized root mean square error nrmse of et simulated by the bdssat model was 49 4 and 66 3 lower than that of the mdssat and dssat models respectively an apparent spatial difference in sws et and crop yield was found in different regions due to the differences in soil texture meteorological data and agricultural management strategy the spatial distributions of et and crop yield of sunflower potato and corn in different regions were largely consistent with the spatial distribution of sws furthermore the et and crop yield of sunflower and potato crops in different regions increased with time 2015 2018 due to an increase in rainfall however these effects were not observed in corn yields in the eastern region additionally the dr in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 55 73 and 90 respectively to ensure high field production crop yield was higher than the historic average crop yields in different regions increased in response to future climate change as the average t a was projected to increase by 0 8 c from 2019 to 2050 except for sunflower yields in the western region keywords biodegradable film

accumulation in soil which seriously affects agriculture ecosystem environments and crop growth liu et al 2014 biodegradable films have been increasingly recommended in agricultural production as a promising alternative to conventional plastic films brodhagen et al 2017 goldberger et al 2013 sintim et al 2019 biodegradable films can degrade into co2 and h2o through oxidation and microbial activity bandopadhyay et al 2020 mari et al 2020 thus effectively reducing the levels of residual plastic film in the soil previous literature involving the effects of biodegradable film mulching brm on agriculture ecosystem environments has mainly focused on soil moisture soil solute and crop yields at the field scale chen et al 2019 sintim et al 2019 giordano et al 2020 for example saglam et al 2017 reported that soil moisture for brm was close to that of pm and can significantly increase the crop water productivity wp of corn compared to no film mulching zhang 2017 compared the effects of brms and pm on sunflower yield and demonstrated that sunflower yields under brm decreased by 6 1 compared with that of pm due to the low water preservation capacity of biodegradable film during the middle crop growth stage similarly chen et al 2021a found that et and e s et under brm increased by 15 6 and 59 2 compared with pm respectively whereas corn yield under brm decreased by 9 9 compared with pm this occurred because mulching area of biodegradable film was significantly lower than that of plastic film during the middle and late crop growth stages due its higher disintegration rate which promoted water vapor transport from the soil surface to the atmosphere and led to decreases in soil moisture and crop yield under brm in contrast gao et al 2021 reported that et and potato yield under brm and pm were not significantly different because the degradation of biodegradable films at late crop growth stages has a limited effect on et when there is a high degree of crop coverage and potato yields under brm were only 2 3 lower than under pm from 2018 to 2019 although previous studies have reported on the responses of water consumption and crop yield to the soil water deficit caused by an increase in the disintegration area of biodegradable film these observations have only been made at the field scale chen et al 2021b gu et al 2020 morra et al 2016 the unique climate conditions hydrology and soil texture in different regions will inevitably result in variations in the distribution of field water consumption and crop yields under brm however no previous studies have explored these variations and the responses of crop yield and wp to the potential disintegration rate of biodegradable film and climate change remain uncharacterized pure field experiments would be highly time consuming and costly moreover the results of this approach cannot be easily applied to improve regional productivity the use of mathematical methods combined with field experiments enables researchers to easily estimate crop yields on a regional scale currently the mainstream models of crop growth include the agricultural production systems simulator apsim keating et al 2003 dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 and aquacrop raes et al 2009 among these models dssat has been widely used to simulate crop yields on a regional scale due to its friendly user interface and high simulation accuracy tooley et al 2021 however the model is mainly used to study fields without mulching because it does not consider the effects of mulching on water consumption and crop yields garibay et al 2019 woli et al 2019 roy et al 2019 in recent years the simulation of crop yields under pm using dssat can be achieved via the accumulated temperature compensation method however the simulation of crop yield under brm remains lacking particularly for the effects of brm on et and crop yield in large areas li et al 2019 although shen et al 2021 considered the effects of the disintegrated area of plastic film on water vapor in the soil air interface using a modified dssat mdssat the impacts of the disintegrated area on soil temperature t a and crop yield were not be considered particularly the mdssat model did not consider the effect of soil temperature fluctuation after the disintegration of biodegradable film on crop growth the estimation of et and crop yield primarily depend on t a rainfall and solar radiation sr in dssat thus it is of great significance to propose an improved dssat model by considering the effects of the disintegration area of biodegradable film on t a and crop yield moreover the responses of crop yield and wp to the potential disintegration rate of biodegradable film and climate change need to be further explored using the improved dssat model therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to propose an improved dssat model bdssat by considering the effect of the disintegration area of biodegradable film on t a 2 to validate and compare the simulated accuracy among the bdssat mdssat and dssat models using the observation data from multiple years and sites 3 to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution of sws et and crop yield of primary cultivated crops sunflower potato corn under brm in different regions of inner mongolia 4 to identify the optimal disintegration rate of biodegradable film for different regions and 5 to quantify the effects of future climate change on crop yield wp under brm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and data sources a total of 96 meteorological stations and soil textures were selected to evaluate the effect of brm on sws et and crop yield in the eastern middle and western regions of inner mongolia the western middle and eastern regions fall within the warm temperature moderate temperature and cold temperature climate zones respectively the average annual precipitation in the western middle and eastern regions during the study period was 212 2 204 7 and 302 6 mm respectively the main soil type of the western region is classified as sandy loam soil whereas the middle and eastern regions primarily exhibit loam soil in the field experiment the soil type of dengkou linhe and urad front was sandy loam soil based on the soil triangle of usda whereas the soil type of huade and tongliao was loam soil moreover linhe urad front and huade exhibited plaggept soil based on the usda classification system and the soil types of dengkou and tongliao were orthid and argiborolls respectively table 1 provides additional details on the soil textures bulk density and the proportion of sand clay and silt soil organic carbon total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium at soil depths of 0 10 10 30 and 30 100 cm in the western middle and eastern regions in general the meteorological variation from west to east in inner mongolia shows an increase in rainfall improvement in soil fertility a decrease in t a and a reduction in sr additionally nine representative experimental sites were chosen to conduct a field experiment the typical sites in the western region are dengkou linhe and urad front the middle region includes siziwang chahar right front and huade the eastern region includes kharchin jalaid and tongliao fig 1 the experimental data involving dengkou linhe urad front huade and tongliao were determined through a field experiment from 2015 to 2018 moreover four years of the experimental data from siziwang chahar right front kharchin and jalaid were obtained from a public literature database zhang and liu 2020 2 2 experimental designs and management the main crops in the western the middle and eastern regions of inner mongolia are sunflower potato and corn respectively feng 2021 li 2017 yang et al 2021 local recommendation seeding dates for nine representative experimental sites were adopted in this study sunflower seeds were sown on may 21 26 during 2015 2018 potato seeds were sown on may 10 19 during 2015 2018 corn seeds were sown on may 1 8 during 2015 2018 respectively sunflower and potato were harvested at the end of september whereas corn was harvested in mid october a complete biodegradable film 80 cm width 0 008 mm thick made of polybutyl hexanoate corn starch polycaprolactone and masterbatch at a 30 65 5 ratio was laid flat on the surface soil using an automatic machine which can completely disintegrate into co2 and h2o through microbial activity the percentages of breaking elongation maximum loads and tensile strengths of the biodegradable film were 149 0 0 58 n and 14 5 mpa respectively the irrigation depths of sunflower potato and corn were 22 5 40 and 30 mm respectively from 2015 2018 the sunflower potato and corn crops were irrigated a total of 5 7 9 12 and 7 11 times respectively the fertilizer application strategy adopted in this experiment was based on the recommendations from local farmers before sowing 375 kg ha 1 of diammonium phosphate 600 kg ha 1 of formulated fertilizer and 450 kg ha 1 of controlled release fertilizers were applied in the field of sunflower potato and corn as basal fertilizers respectively the field management strategy planting density planting depth row spacing irrigation depth fertilization application amount and fertilization depth of nine representative experimental sites was identical to the local strategy table 2 the seeding date and field management strategy in other sites was similar to that of the representative experimental sites in the same region therefore to reduce the workload this study assumed that the seeding date and field management strategy in other sites i e non experimental site were completely consistent with those of representative experimental sites in the same region moreover the heterogeneity of soil texture and meteorology at the same county level may affect the simulation results at the regional scale therefore the soil texture and meteorology of sites located in the same county were also assumed to be homogeneous 2 3 field monitoring methods historical meteorological data of ninety six stations in inner mongolia from 1956 to 2018 were downloaded from the china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn including daily rainfall maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin and sunshine hours fig 2 moreover sunshine hours were used to

in this study due to the negligible flow rate flat experimental site and weak rainfall eq 1 was simplified as follows 8 e t c p i d δ w when sunflower potato and corn reached physiological maturity ten plants from a harvesting area of 20 m2 were collected to determine the crop yield of sunflower potato and corn wp kg m 3 was calculated using the following equation fernández et al 2020 9 w p cropyield e t c the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film in sunflower dengkou linhe and urad front potato huade and corn tongliao fields were photographed using a digital camera canon eos rebel t3 japan from a distance of approximately 25 cm above the surface of the biodegradable film once every 20 days from 2015 to 2018 chen et al 2022b images were geometrically corrected and background subtraction was conducted using adobe photoshop software the disintegrated area was calculated using the imagej software the disintegration rate of the biodegradable film dr was calculated using the following equation fig s1 10 dr a d a t 100 where a d is the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film cm2 and a t is the total area of film mulching cm2 3 modeling description 3 1 dssat model the dssat model consisted of weather soil crop and field management modules among which the crop module included over 18 different csm crop models hoogenboom et al 2019 the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen were simulated by the principle of soil water and nitrogen balance in the dssat model additionally crop growth and development were estimated by the ceres cropgro cropsim and substor modules in this study three process based crop models in the dssat families ceres maize substor potato and oilcrop sunflower were used to evaluate the response of the development of sunflower potato and corn on soil water dynamics under biodegradable film mulching crop yields were determined by multiplying the harvest index and dry matter 11 cropyield h i d m where hi is the harvest index and dm is the dry matter kg ha 1 3 2 modified dssat model mdssat in the mdssat model the soil evaporation module was improved by introducing the evaporation ratio under pm e s was divided into two stages stage i the constant rate stage and stage ii the falling rate stage shen et al 2021 in stage i e s was not affected by the variation in swc and e s in this stage was computed using the following equation 12 e si e s0 where e si is the cumulative soil evaporation mm d 1 and e s0 is the actual soil evaporation on day i in stage ii e s depends on the water vapor flux through the shallow soil layer which was computed using the following equation 13 e si α t where α is the soil hydraulic characteristic parameter mm d 0 5 and t is the evaporation time d given that soil water vapor would be transported into the atmosphere through the small holes caused by maize stalks e s was related to the mulching fraction of plastic film thus e s was determined using the following equations shen et al 2021 14 e si e s f f m 15 f f m a h a t 16 a h 2 π r 2 where f fm is the mulching fraction a h is the area of small holes at the root zone cm2 and r is the radius of the small holes cm the effects of soil temperature under pm on crop growth were determined using the temperature compensation coefficient method zhang et al 2003 3 3 the proposed dssat model considering brm bdssat although the effect of the disintegrated area on water vapor in the soil air interface has been previously determined using the mdssat model shen et al 2021 the impacts of the disintegrated area on soil temperature t a and crop growth were not be considered especially for the effect of soil temperature fluctuation after the disintegration of biodegradable film on crop growth thus an improved air temperature compensation method was deduced by considering the effect of the disintegration area of biodegradable film on temperature in the dssat model bdssat the compensation coefficient c was determined using the following equation 17 c t cum a s t cum a f t cum s f t cum s s where t cum a s is the effective air accumulated temperature under no film mulching c t cum a f is the effective air accumulated temperature under biodegradable film mulching c t cum s s is the soil accumulated temperature under no film mulching c and t cum s f is the effective soil accumulated

i and t b is the biological lower limit base point temperature of maize 8 c t a under biodegradable film mulching was compensated based on air temperature under no film mulching by the following equation zhang et al 2003 19 δ t a c δ t s t a t b t s t b where t a is the air temperature difference between biodegradable film mulching and no film mulching c t s is the soil temperature difference between biodegradable film mulching and no film mulching c and t s is the daily soil temperature under no film mulching c t s was obtained using the following equation chen et al 2021b 20 δ t s d h c

temperature c and β is the empirical constant which can be determined based on the local t a sr and soil texture c was determined by calculating the ratio of soil volume heat capacity and soil wet density 23 c c v ρ 1 where c v is soil volume heat capacity and ρ 1 is soil wet density which was determined using the following equation 24 c v ρ s c s ρ w c w θ 25 ρ 1 ρ s θ ρ w where ρ s is soil dry density g cm 3 θ is soil water content cm 3cm 3 ρ w is water density g cm 3 c s is the specific heat of soil minerals j cm 3 c 1 and c w is the specific heat of water j cm 3 c 1 the mulched region changed in response to increases in the disintegrated area of biodegradable film therefore m is a variable that was obtained using the following equation 26 m ρ 1 z f a t 1 dr 1000 therefore the maximum air temperature t max f and minimum air temperature t min f after compensation under biodegradable film mulching were calculated using the following equations 27 t max f t max δ t a 28 t min f t min δ t a et is typically estimated by the pt model associated with sr tmax and tmin in dssat therefore the potential evapotranspiration et p and et c under brm can be obtained by the following

of sunflower seven of them are related to crop growth and development em fl fl sh fl sd sd pm fl lf sfdur podur four are related to crop yield xfrt wtpsd sdpdv thrsh one is related to protein content sdpro and the remaining one is related to oil content sdlip to obtain precise model parameters an algorithm based and manual joint calibration method was adopted firstly crop genetic parameters were calibrated using the genetic coefficient calculator gencalc package in dssat next the corresponding parameters were further calibrated by manually comparing simulated and observed values 3 5 larswg weather generator and correction method the larswg weather generator was developed by lausanne laboratory to promote the development of a crop growth model and hydrological model dixit and telleria 2015 pozdniakov et al 2020 which includes fifteen gcms climate scenarios based on ipcc4 the larswg weather generator can generate a series of meteorological data for a certain period in the future based on historical meteorological data and geographical data such as rainfall sr tmax and tmin fig 2 the generator has been widely applied in the projections of crop yield soil erosion and extreme environmental events the correction method aims to obtain multiple weather series with the same monthly mean and standard deviation as the original series the weather series after correction can be obtained using the following equation 32 g c i σ c j g n i μ c j where gc i is the weather series after correction μc j and σc j are mean and standard deviation respectively and gn i is the normalized weather series 33 μ c j μ c j o 1 δ μ j 34 σ c j σ c j o 1 δ σ j where μ j and σ j are the relative change of mean and standard deviation respectively 35 δ μ j μ j o μ j g μ j g 36 δ σ j σ j o σ j g σ

respectively the normalized weather series can be determined as follows 37 g n i g i μ j g σ j g 3 6 evaluation of model performance the model performance was evaluated using percentage bias pbias the

different experimental sites in 2015 and were validated using corresponding data from 2016 to 2018 our findings demonstrated that the bdssat model could precisely capture the dynamics of sws et and crop yields table 4 in the calibration period 2015 the average pbias r 2 and nrmse of sws in different experimental sites were 6 8 0 86 and 9 3 respectively and 7 0 0 89 and 6 9 for et the average pbias of crop yield in different sites was only 8 1 in the verification period 2016 2018 the average pbias r 2 and nrmse of sws in different sites were 9 0 0 83 and 11 0 respectively and 6 4 0 86 and 9 0 for et the average pbias of crop yield in different sites was 8 6 compared with the bdssat model et and crop yield simulated by the mdssat model were overestimated by 15 3 and 13 8 respectively as the mdssat model did not consider the effect of reduction of soil temperature after the disintegration of biodegradable film on the field water cycle and crop growth furthermore sws simulated by the mdssat model was underestimated by 16 1 additionally the dssat model did not account for the effect of increased soil temperature under brm on crop growth which resulted in an underestimation of et and crop yield the average et and crop yield in sunflower potato and corn fields were underestimated by 25 5 and 19 5 in the dssat model respectively whereas sws was overestimated by 25 3 in general the bdssat model exhibited a better simulation accuracy compared with the mdssat and dssat models e g the nrmse of et simulated by the bdssat model was 49 4 and 66 3 lower than that of the mdssat and dssat models therefore the bdssat model could be applied to accurately simulate the water cycle and crop growth under brm 4 2 spatiotemporal distribution of soil water storage under biodegradable film mulching in different regions an apparent spatial difference in sws under brm was found in different regions in the western region the distribution of sws under brm showed an increasing trend from west to east the highest sws was observed in the hohhot baotou ordos region whereas the lowest value occurred in the alxa right banner fig 3 the average maximum difference of sws between the hohhot baotou ordos region and the alxa right banner reached 63 7 mm in four years in the middle region the distribution of sws was high in the north and south and low in the middle the highest sws occurred in the duolun region and the lowest value occurred in the sonid left banner the average maximum difference of sws in two places reached 175 mm in four years however in the eastern region the spatial distribution of sws exhibited an increasing trend from south to north fig 3 the highest sws occurred in jalaid whereas the lowest value occurred in linxi with the average maximum difference between these two locations reaching 162 5 mm in four years additionally an apparent temporal difference in sws under brm was identified in 2015 2018 the highest sws in the western region occurred in 2018 with 135 6 mm which increased by 24 8 14 9 and 41 1 compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively however the highest sws in the middle and eastern regions occurred in 2016 the average sws in the middle region in 2016 was 180 3 mm which was 9 5 22 6 and 8 0 higher than that in 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively moreover the average sws in the eastern region in 2016 was 150 7 mm which increased by 19 7 20 1 and 22 7 compared with 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively 4 3 spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration under biodegradable film mulching in different regions the spatiotemporal distribution of et in different regions was similar to that of sws fig 4 in the western region the highest et of sunflower fields occurred in the ordos whereas the lowest et occurred in the alxa left banner the average maximum difference in et in the two locations reached 195 mm in four years in the middle region the highest et of potato fields occurred in the duolun whereas the lowest et occurred in the sonid left banner fig 4 the average maximum difference in et in the two places reached 245 mm in four years however et and sws exhibited opposite trends in the eastern region the spatial distribution of et in the eastern region showed a decreasing trend from south to north as t a in the north was lower than in the south the highest et of corn fields occurred in the aohan region whereas the lowest et occurred in the xin barag right banner with an average maximum difference between the two places reaching 150 mm in four years an apparent temporal difference in et was found in different seasons in general the highest et occurred in 2018 for different regions except for the eastern region the average et in the western region in 2018 was 316 2 mm which represented an increase of 19 1 9 1 and 14 6 compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the average et in the middle region in 2018 was 376 7 mm which was 9 5 22 6 and 8 0 higher than that in 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 4 furthermore the average et in the eastern region in 2018 was 391 7 mm which constituted an increase of 5 1 and 6 8 compared with 2017 and 2018 respectively but a decrease of 3 8 compared with 2015 4 4 spatiotemporal distribution of crop yield of sunflower potato and corn under biodegradable film mulching in different regions there is an obvious spatiotemporal difference in crop yield under brm in different regions from 2015 to 2018 in terms of spatial distribution the distribution of sunflower yields in the western region was high in the east and low in the west fig 5 the highest sunflower yield occurred in the hohhot baotou ordos region with an average yield of 4 8 103 kg ha 1 in four years whereas the lowest yield occurred in the alxa right banner with an average yield of 2 2 103 kg ha 1 the highest wp of sunflower fields in the western region reached 3 0 kg m 3 in the middle region duolun exhibited the highest average potato yield of 43 6 103 kg ha 1 in contrast the lowest potato yield occurred in the sonid left banner with an average yield of 16 0 103 kg ha 1 the highest wp of potato fields in the middle region reached 10 1 kg m 3 in the eastern region the highest and lowest yield of corn occurred in jalaid with an average yield of 11 3 103 kg ha 1 and mohe 4 4 103 kg ha 1 respectively the highest wp of corn in the eastern region was 4 3 kg m 3 fig 5 an apparent difference in crop yields was observed in different regions in terms of temporal distribution the highest sunflower and potato yields occurred in 2018 the average sunflower yield in the western region in 2018 was 4 3 103 kg ha 1 which represented an 11 2 7 2 and 17 9 increase compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively moreover the average potato yield in the middle region in 2018 was 33 3 103 kg ha 1 which increased by 33 0 14 7 and 18 6 compared with 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively furthermore the highest corn yield in the eastern region occurred in 2015 with an average of 7 6 103 kg ha 1 which was 12 1 3 3 and 2 1 higher than in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 4 5 effects of the disintegration rate of biodegradable film on crop yield and crop water productivity to further evaluate the effects of the disintegration rate of biodegradable film dr on crop yield and wp of sunflower potato and corn in different regions six drs were evaluated in this study 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the simulated results showed that the sunflower potato and corn average yields decreased by 6 6 3 5 and 7 2 in response to an increase in dr of 10 respectively fig 6 moreover the average wp of the sunflower potato and corn decreased by 9 7 6 4 and 13 0 respectively to maintain high productivity rates i e the crop yields did not fall below the historic average the dr in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 55 73 and 90 respectively moreover the dr in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 62 53 and 41 when wp was above the historic average 4 6 variation in crop yields and crop water productivity under climate change conditions meteorological data from 2000 to 2050 were predicted based on the larswg5 weather generator to evaluate the effects of climate change on crop yield and wp briefly meteorological data from 1956 to 2000 were used as basal data and the corresponding values from 2000 to 2018 were used as validation data fig 2 the validation results showed that the meteorological data forecasted using the larswg5 weather generator were highly accurate with r 2 values ranging from 0 72 to 0 94 pbias ranging from 12 8 7 2 and nrmse ranging from 7 6 to 13 5 fig s2 in general the crop yields of potato and corn in different regions increased in response to future climate change as the average t a markedly increased by 0 8 c from 2019 to 2050 fig 2 and s2 except for sunflower yield in the western region for example potato yields in the middle region increased annually by 1 7 whereas wp annually decreased by 1 9 from 2019 to 2050 corn yields and wp in the eastern region increased annually by 2 8 and 2 6 from 2019 to 2050 respectively fig 7 however sunflower yield and wp in the western region decreased annually by 7 5 and 6 7 from 2019 to 2050 respectively this was likely because the rainfall in the western region was projected to decrease by 3 5 in the future 2019 2050 fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 disintegration rate of biodegradable film in different regions the disintegration process of the biodegradable film mainly includes two sub processes oxidation and biodegradation reddy et al 2009 martínez romo et al 2015 wiles and scott 2006 first the macromolecular materials of the biodegradable film are disintegrated into smaller molecules via oxidation in natural conditions moreover small molecule polymers are further degraded into co2 h2o and microbial biomass via microbial decomposition bonifer et al 2019 kim et al 2017 the dr primarily depended on external environmental factors such as wind speed temperature and microorganism species stroganov et al 2014 seligra et al 2016 sameshima yamashita et al 2016 dr typically increased in response to an increase in wind speed since the oxidation rate was improved by increasing the contact area between the biodegradable film and the atmosphere similarly high soil temperature promoted dr by stimulating microbial activity and decreasing the tension of the film additionally microorganism species are the main factor that contributes to the disintegration of biodegradable films for instance meyer cifuentes et al 2020 reported that the actinomycetes and bacteroides genera were more abundant in the free community than in the membrane community whereas members of the genus bacillus were more abundant in the membrane community in general the differences in dr in the different examined regions were caused by external factors for example the high dr in the western region was attributed to the high wind speed and temperature in this area in contrast dr decreased as wind speed and temperature decreased from west to east in inner mongolia fig s1 the average dr in the middle and eastern regions was 52 and 37 respectively moreover microbial activity decreased as the soil temperature decreased from the western region to the eastern region which further limited dr a similar result was found in the previous studies for example chen et al 2021a demonstrated that dr reached 60 in the western region feng 2021 found that dr was only 40 at the end of the crop growing season in the eastern region however a different phenomenon was observed in previous experimental studies for example li et al 2020 found that biodegradable film reached a fragmentation period i e the disintegration rate was approximately 80 at the end of the crop growing season these effects were likely due to the composition of the biodegradable film a biodegradable film with a high disintegration rate was adopted in the study of li et al 2020 therefore although low temperature limited the disintegration rate of biodegradable film its disintegration rate was still higher than that of other biodegradable films e g the biodegradable films with medium and low disintegration rates 5 2 spatial difference in soil water storage evapotranspiration and crop yield in sunflower potato and corn fields in different regions spatial differences in sws and et were caused by multiple factors such as soil texture meteorological data and agricultural management strategy bosmans et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2014 in general sws in a sandy field was apparently lower than that of loam and clay fields as sandy soil has larger porosity and poor water retention the corresponding et in a sandy field was lower than that of other soil textures due to its low transpiration for example razzaghi et al 2012 reported that the maximum transpiration in a sandy field was 2 5 mm d 1 and it decreased by 17 compared with that of sandy loam fields a similar result was found in the present study e g the lowest sws and et occurred in the alxa right banner in the western region which featured sandy soil fig 3 however the impact of soil texture on sws and et may be negligible in the eastern region the spatial difference in meteorological data may be the main factor that affected the spatial distribution of sws and et in the eastern region the north of the eastern region is located in a high latitude area therefore t a in this area remains low due to the high atmospheric pressure the average air temperature in the north of the eastern region was far below the optimal temperature for corn growth i e 20 24 c yan and tu 2003 thus the t a difference between the north and south in the eastern region resulted in a high in the south and low in the north distribution for sws and et figs 3 and 4 the spatial distribution of crop yields in different regions was consistent with the spatial distribution of et for instance the distribution of sunflower yields in the western region showed a high in the east and low in the west trend the potato yield in the middle region showed a high in the south central region and low in the north trend the corn yield in the eastern region showed a high in the south and low in the north trend fig 5 li et al 2022 reported that the potato yield in the south of the middle region increased by 41 7 compared with that of the north and the corn yield in the south of the eastern region was approximately 71 4 higher than in the north nevertheless there is an apparent difference in terms of the size of the crop yields in this study and a previous study li et al 2022 indicated that the yields of sunflower potato and corn in the western middle and eastern regions were approximately 700 2500 and 3300 kg ha 1 which far lower than the corresponding crop yields determined in this study these differences may be attributed to different agricultural management strategies li et al 2022 mainly adopted rainfed irrigation under no mulching whereas the present study adopted a drip irrigation technology under brm this approach has significant advantages compared to rainfed irrigation under no mulching such as decreasing e s improving the soil temperature and increasing crop yield saglam et al 2017 gu et al 2020 in general brm not only effectively increases crop yield and wp of sunflower potato and corn but also reduces plastic residue pollution and promotes the development of sustainable agriculture however it is worth nothing that the seeding date and field management strategy in the same region was assumed to be completely homogeneous in this study moreover the soil texture and meteorology of the study sites located in the same county were also assumed to be equal the above assumption may cause some discrepancies between the modeling and measurement results moreover the data collected for this study was not sufficient to evaluate the long term effects of biodegradable film mulching on et and crop yield however the modeling results of this study can still provide a valuable reference for areas with similar experimental and environmental conditions 5 3 temporal differences in evapotranspiration and crop yield in sunflower potato and corn fields in different regions apparent temporal differences in et and crop yields of sunflower potato and corn were observed in different regions under brm for instance the highest et and crop yield in the western and middle regions occurred in 2018 whereas the highest values of these indicators occurred in 2016 in the eastern region this phenomenon may be attributed to seasonal differences in meteorological factors over the course of the observation period i e 2015 2018 in general the key meteorological factors affecting crop yield include t a rainfall and co2 concentration brown and rosenberg 1997 soureshjani et al 2019 wakjira et al 2021 in the western region the inter annual fluctuation of rainfall was the main reason for the temporal difference in et and crop yield for example rainfall in the western region in 2018 increased by 50 7 compared with 2015 fig 2 and the corresponding et and sunflower yields in 2018 was 19 1 and 11 2 higher than in 2015 respectively figs 3 and 4 the cause of the inter annual difference in et and potato yields in the middle region during the 2015 2018 period was similar to that of sunflower yield in the western region however the main meteorological factor affecting corn yield in the eastern region was t a as this region receives fewer daylight hours et and corn yields in the eastern region in 2018 decreased by 3 8 and 2 1 compared with 2015 figs 3 and 4 respectively as t a in 2018 decreased by 1 3 relative to 2015 fig 2 additionally the inter annual fluctuation of co2 concentration may be an important driver of crop yield differences from 2015 to 2018 in recent years co2 concentration in inner mongolia continuously increased due to the impact of human activities which increased the t a in the ground layer since co2 concentration promoted the atmospheric absorption of long wave radiation karlén w 2001 moreover these high co2 concentrations further promoted plant growth and development by improving leaf photosynthesis natali et al 2009 thus increases in co2 concentration may enhance crop yields of sunflower potato and corn in inner mongolia 6 conclusions the bdssat model could more accurately simulate the sws et and crop yields of sunflower potato and corn under brm compared with the mdssat and dssat models an apparent spatial difference in sws et and crop yield was found in different regions due to the differences in soil texture meteorological data and agricultural management strategies the distribution of sws showed a trend of low in the west and high in the east high in the north and south and low in the middle and low in the south and high in the north in the western middle and eastern regions respectively the spatial distribution of et and crop yields in different regions was largely consistent with the spatial distribution of sws furthermore there was an apparent temporal difference in et and crop yield from 2015 to 2018 collectively our findings indicated that et and crop yields in sunflower and potato fields in different regions increased with time except for corn fields in the eastern region additionally the disintegration rates of biodegradable film in the western middle and eastern regions should not exceed 55 73 and 90 respectively to ensure high field production the crop yields of potato and corn in different regions increased in response to future climate change except for sunflower yield in the western region the finding of this study can effectively promote the application

9184,the installation of covers over ponds for agricultural irrigation is a feasible alternative to reduce evaporative water losses however the installation of these systems continues to be very limited understanding the factors that influence the behaviour of farmers towards this type of installation is fundamental because they are the individuals making the final decision this article analyses the perceptions and behaviours of farmers towards the installation of covers in agricultural irrigation ponds in southeastern spain a cluster analysis characterized four groups of farmers related to this practice the results show that these clusters present different perceptions towards the installation of covers their possible advantages and the different incentives that can be established to promote their implementation technical and agronomic aspects play an important role in installation decisions while economic and environmental aspects are considered secondary based on these results actionable recommendations are proposed for policy makers the findings of this study can be very useful in those regions in which it is desired to promote the installation of covers over ponds for agricultural irrigation keywords water management sustainability intensive agriculture farmer attitudes cluster analysis data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the use of ponds for agricultural purposes has been a common practice for centuries as it facilitates managing irrigation water lópez felices et al 2020 these systems are particularly important in areas with limited water resources because they can increase and stabilize crop yields mushtaq et al 2009 ponds have proven to be a viable alternative to combat prolonged droughts in addition to diversifying production chander et al 2019 wisser et al 2010 determined that the construction of small ponds could increase the production of cereals worldwide by 35 these data are of great relevance since it is expected that global food production will experience a 70 increase by 2050 to meet the needs of a growing population un 2012 it is estimated that there are 277 400 000 ponds less than 1 hectare in size and 24 120 000 water bodies between 1 and 10 ha which represent 90 of the stagnant water bodies of the world céréghino et al 2013 in addition since the 1960 s the construction of ponds has increased by up to 50 davidson and finlayson 2018 one of the main problems posed by ponds is evaporation losses maestre valero et al 2011 specifically between 30 and 50 of the pond capacity is lost due to evaporation abdallah et al 2021 in addition althoff et al 2020 estimated that the evaporation of small ponds will increase between 7 3 and 18 4 by 2100 as a result of climate change pond function will then be negatively impacted causing a decrease in the efficiency of water use at a global scale wurbs and ayala 2014 estimate that the evaporated water in texas reservoirs could meet 61 of the total water demand for agricultural use craig et al 2005 determined that the annual loss of water to evaporation in the agricultural holdings of queensland could reach 40 with this volume being sufficient to irrigate some 125 000 ha of crop maestre valero et al 2013 show that the evaporated water in the agricultural water reservoirs located in the segura river basin spain can represent up to 11 7 of the water available for irrigation in the basin addressing this problem is of great relevance since one of the main obstacles facing agriculture is the growing scarcity of water resources velasco muñoz et al 2019 therefore different methods have been developed to reduce the evaporation of ponds which can be classified as biological methods organic residues aquatic plants wind breakers chemical methods chemical covers and physical methods suspended covers and floating covers craig et al 2005 abdallah et al 2021 several studies have analysed the effectiveness of these methods to reduce evaporation varying between 13 and 90 martínez álvarez et al 2010 benzaghta et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 saggaï and bachi 2018 the most promising methods seem to be the physical ones since they have the highest efficiency rates abdallah et al 2021 martínez espinosa 2021 in addition to reducing evaporation covering the ponds can have further advantages covering ponds improves water quality due to two main reasons maestre valero et al 2011 martínez espinosa 2021 i preventing the growth of algae and vegetation in the water by minimizing solar radiation and ii reducing the amount of dust and waste transported by the wind that enters the pond this is especially relevant in agricultural systems in which drip irrigation is used since it is composed of narrow conduits and a large number of drip emitters with small openings that can be easily clogged by physical chemical and or biological compounds found in water maestre valero et al 2011 the increase in suspended particles in the water and clogged drip emitters can affect the distribution and uniformity of irrigation which impact on water consumption and crop yield bonachela et al 2013 therefore farmers can maintain the optimal performance of the irrigation system by cleaning the filters frequently on the other hand covering the ponds can lead to savings in various operating costs such as water consumption or pond maintenance traditionally two practices have been carried out to keep the pond clean and preserve the irrigation water quality dredging the pond is usually carried out at the end of the agricultural season to control excess vegetation and sediments the other practise is applying biocides to prevent algal growth there are also studies that suggest the economic viability of these types of installations martínez álvarez et al 2009 maestre valero et al 2013 han et al 2019 despite these advantages the use of covers in ponds is still not a widespread practice abdallah et al 2021 in this context understanding the factors that influence the behaviour of farmers towards this type of practice is fundamental because they make the final decision about adopting it in this way approaches and tools that encourage their implementation can be formulated and applied allowing for the more efficient management of water resources liu et al 2018 this is even more relevant in arid and semiarid areas where water availability can act as a limiting factor for agricultural production abdallah et al 2021 however to date no research has analysed the perceptions and behaviours of farmers towards this type of installation the objective of this work is to fill this knowledge gap by studying the attitudes and behaviours of farmers towards the installation of covers in ponds aiming to improve the management of water resources to achieve this a study was carried out in southeastern spain where an intensive agricultural model based on the use of greenhouses was developed aznar sánchez et al 2011 the specific objectives of this study include 1 determining the existing profiles of farmers in relation to the installation of covers in the ponds 2 knowing their perception towards adopting this practice and 3 examining the degree of acceptance of the different measures intended to promote their installation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this research was developed in the region of campo de dalías located in almería southeastern spain fig 1 almería has 32 554 ha of greenhouses of which 67 7 are located in campo de dalías junta de andalucía 2020 this area has a mediterranean climate characterized by mild temperatures in winter with an average of 18 c and low rainfall averaging 220 mm annually mendoza fernández et al 2021 in addition the high solar radiation with more than 3000 h of sun per year leads to high evaporation and evapotranspiration rates sánchez et al 2015 production has been specialized in a range of eight fruit and vegetable crops pepper cucumber zucchini tomato eggplant green bean melon and watermelon water consumption for agricultural irrigation in the region amounts to 168 3 hm3 per year garcía caparrós et al 2017 the scarcity of surface water resources has necessitated groundwater based agricultural development of this region leading to the overexploitation of aquifers caparrós martínez et al 2020 the horticultural water exploitation index of the region is 1 1 garcía caparrós et al 2017 therefore technologies have been implemented to improve water use efficiency such as drip irrigation and the use of tensiometers desalinated water has also been incorporated as an alternative source for agricultural irrigation with 7 5 hm3 coming from the campo de dalías desalination plant mendoza fernández et al 2021 in addition in recent years the percentage of holdings that harvest rainwater has increased to 50 garcía garcía et al 2016 however the savings generated by these technologies and the use of other alternative sources of water are not enough to meet the high demand of the region so it is necessary to continue improving water use efficiency water resources for agricultural irrigation in this region are managed through irrigation communities which provide water to member farmers at an average price of 0 30 m3 caparrós martínez et al 2020 however the increases in the cost of electrical energy mean that irrigation communities have higher water prices reaching as high as 0 50 m3 almería has more than 10 000 ponds for agricultural purposes casas et al 2011 in campo de dalías 80 of the holdings have an irrigation pond to store water and flow regulation purposes junta de andalucía 2015 to cover the ponds of the study area physical methods are used specifically concrete covers or suspended covers of shade cloth carvajal et al 2016 determined that covering agricultural ponds in almería with shade cloth could reduce evaporation losses by up to 83 in addition it is estimated that the evaporation losses of the campo de dalías ponds account for approximately 15 of the total water destined for agricultural use mendoza fernández et al 2021 despite these significant figures in this region only approximately 40 of the ponds are covered garcía garcía et al 2016 for this reason campo de dalías is an ideal laboratory to carry out this research 2 2 questionnaire development the collection of information for preparing the questionnaire was carried out through interviews with experts and a focus group the presidents of two of the most important irrigation communities in the region were interviewed as well as the president of an agricultural cooperative and two farmers with extensive experience by conducting these interviews the most relevant information was obtained in relation to the practice of covering the ponds in the study area to validate the information obtained a focus group was developed with six farmers in the region of which three had their pond covered and another three did not once the questionnaire was completed a pilot survey was carried out to test it with a group of eight farmers four of them had their pond covered and another four did not finally the questionnaire was divided into four sections 1 characteristics of farmers and their holdings this section had four groups of questions related to a traits of farmers age experience as a farmer and educational level b characterization of the holding type of soil and greenhouse size year of construction climate conditioning systems irrigation systems tensiometers computerized irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems c characterization of the irrigation pond capacity type shape volume at which it is maintained methods to keep it clean and type of cover and d data on crops and inputs number of crop cycles organic production monoculture income expenses trading channel number of total workers and family members electrical conductivity level methods to deal with pests percentage of phytosanitary treatments and biological control methods used for pollination and type of technical advice 2 environmental attitude in this section of the questionnaire farmers had to indicate the frequency with which they performed six behaviours in their daily life using a five point likert scale 1 never 2 rarely 3 sometimes 4 often 5 always the selection of the items was based on previous studies paço and lavrador 2017 karasmanaki et al 2021 musova et al 2021 the items included in our study were recycling turning off the faucet while brushing teeth limiting showering time using energy saving light bulbs using energy efficient appliances and turning off lights and electrical appliances when not in use 3 perceptions of installing covers in the ponds this section of the questionnaire had two parts in the first part the farmers had to assess the importance of a series of aspects in their decision to install or not install covers on the ponds using a 5 point likert scale 1 not important 2 less important 3 moderately important 4 very important 5 extremely important in the case of the farmers with the covered pond they had to establish the relevance of the following reasons for doing so algae and vegetation growth prevention aquatic animals prevention dust and waste reduction evaporation prevention cost reduction aquifer conservation affordable installation cost and use of space covering the pond can prevent the growth of algae and vegetation and the presence of aquatic animals by preventing solar radiation as well as the entry of dust and waste which can positively impact water quality by minimizing the evaporation of water the aquifer can be conserved since less groundwater needs to be extracted the reduction of costs can be derived from water savings and the reduction of the maintenance costs of the pond if the farmers feel that the installation cost is acceptable this can incentivize covers being installed on the ponds finally in the case of covering using concrete the surface of the pond can be used for other purposes such as building a warehouse for the irrigation system those farmers who did not have covered ponds had to assess the following reasons for not doing so installation cost difficulty algae improves water quality ecosystem services loss and biodiversity loss the difficulty in installing the covers may be due for example to the fact that the necessary infrastructure is not available around the pond or that the ponds are large and require the installation of beams in the centre this can increase the cost if a roof needs to be constructed on the other hand the presence of algae can lead to better water quality by generating an ecosystem that allows controlling various water parameters thus if it remains uncovered the pond can provide ecosystem services by allowing various animals to use them therefore covering it can lead to a loss of biodiversity in the area in the second part both farmers with covered ponds and uncovered ponds had to select from a series of options the advantages and disadvantages about covering the ponds the advantages included the following evaporation reduction water quality improvement reduces the need for filtering and risk of clogging of the irrigation system reduces the use of additional methods to keep the pond clean cost reduction use of space and aquifer conservation and recovery by improving the quality of the water and reducing the presence of solids the filtration of the irrigation system is minimized and the chances of its clogging are reduced in addition by keeping the water cleaner it is necessary to use fewer additional methods of pond management such as dredging or biocide treatment on the other hand the disadvantages considered were prevents vegetation growth prevents animals from using the pond biodiversity loss installation cost and difficulty of installation 4 measures to promote the installation of covers on the ponds in the last section of the questionnaire farmers were asked about four possible measures to encourage the installation of covers in the ponds training sessions further information available aid to cover the cost of installation and regulatory measures the training sessions include training courses in which the possibilities offered by covering the pond are shown and holdings that already have this installation can be visited as a demonstration the availability of more information refers to the possibility that farmers can access data on the possible advantages and disadvantages of covering the pond as well as that the technicians advise them on this practice with the item of aid to cover the cost of installation we want to determine the opinion of farmers regarding the need to establish economic aid in addition through the item of regulatory measures it is intended to know if farmers consider it appropriate to establish a regulation that requires covering the ponds in the region the scoring of these measures was performed with a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 2 disagree 3 neither agree nor disagree 4 agree 5 strongly agree 2 3 sample size and selection the following formula was used to determine the sample size n z α 2 p 1 p n e α 2 n 1 z α 2 p 1 p where n sample size n population α confidence level zα statistical parameter that depends on the confidence level e g 1 96 for 95 confidence level eα maximum accepted estimation error p probability of occurrence of the event under study a confidence level of 95 and a maximum error of 5 were established the study area has an area of 22 054 ha of greenhouses junta de andalucía 2020 so it was necessary to survey a minimum of 378 ha finally 182 farmers with a total of 395 ha were surveyed taking these data into account the margin of error is approximately 4 89 to select the sample simple random sampling without replacement was carried out as all individuals had the same probability of being chosen in each of the extractions farmers were contacted with the collaboration of different irrigation communities in the area the surveys were conducted in person and lasted between 15 and 20 min from august to november 2021 2 4 data analysis spss software version 27 was used to perform the data analysis first descriptive statistics were obtained the interoperative relationships of the variables were studied and the outliers and data distribution were observed subsequently a cluster analysis was carried out with the objective of determining the characteristics of the different groups of farmers in relation to the installation of covers in the ponds of the study area it is an exploratory technique that allows the classification of observations with similar properties through a multivariate statistical procedure hennig et al 2015 in our case a hierarchical cluster analysis was developed in which the clustering of clusters was performed using the ward or minimum variance method the application of this method allows obtaining homogeneous clusters in an objective way hennig et al 2015 the homogeneity of the clusters is measured by the sum of the squared distances of each element with respect to the centroid or vector of means murtagh and contreras 2017 to prevent possible problems derived from obtaining the data using different scales or units we standardized the data set and the squared euclidean distance was used as a measure finally the analysis of variance of a factor anova was used which carries out a generalization of the contrast of equal means for independent samples cardinal and aitken 2013 this analysis frequently used to establish experimental designs allows studying the clusters and determining the behaviour of the groups within the same variable of interest tabachnick and fidell 2007 with the use of this type of analysis the means of each population group are obtained and their variances intragroup variance are studied with respect to the average variance within each group between group variance cardinal and aitken 2013 if it is taken into account that the groups have been obtained from the same population universe both the mean and the variances should be equal 3 results this section presents the main results of this research firstly the farmers profile and main characteristics are shown then the perceptions of different groups in relation to the installation of covers on the ponds are presented finally the farmers assessment of the different measures to promote the adoption of this practice is reported the descriptive statistics of the variables studied in this research are shown in table 1 3 1 profile of farmers through the application of cluster analysis the 182 farmers who participated in this research were classified into four homogeneous groups of the 40 variables studied 32 have been found to be relevant to establish this classification table 2 next the main characteristics of these groups are shown taking into account the average values obtained in these variables table 3 cluster 1 space optimizers n 54 30 these are younger farmers than those of the rest of the clusters who have less experience in the agricultural field they have a medium level of education their holdings are newer with a medium size and grow mainly in sloping roof greenhouses using sanding eighty seven percent of their holdings have an irrigation programmer and 67 use tensiometers although both systems are automatically connected in only 19 of holdings they collect rainwater from the surface of the greenhouse and from other elements of the holding directing the harvested water to a reservoir in which water from different sources or a filter well is stored the ponds of this cluster have an average capacity of 1850 m3 and are made of concrete the main method used to keep the pond clean is to cover it with a concrete cover although it is also drained it is the cluster that carries out the greatest number of crop cycles per season twenty six percent of the holdings in this cluster grow organically they obtain an average income of 8 22 m2 while the average cost is 4 68 m2 the main trading channels for the harvest are cooperatives or sat from which they also receive technical advice they have an average of 7 workers per year of which 7 are family members biological control is mainly used to deal with pests 65 this cluster presents high average values in environmental awareness cluster 2 irrigation optimizers using physical methods n 54 30 farmers in this cluster have extensive experience in the agricultural sector and low medium education levels they have the holdings with the largest average size of all clusters they use sloping roof greenhouses and sanding for cultivation it is the cluster with the largest number of irrigation programmers 96 and 69 of cases also use tensiometers they collect rainwater from the surface of the greenhouse and from other elements of the holding with the destination of the harvested water being a pond in which water from different sources or a filter well is stored their ponds have the greatest storage capacity which are concrete or polyethylene lined all ponds in this cluster were covered using shade cloth dredging is also used as an additional method of cleaning the pond a high number of these holdings cultivate organically 41 and mostly use biological control to deal with pests 76 this cluster has the highest expenses and the largest number of workers per year they have the lowest level of electrical conductivity of water of all clusters they sell the harvest and receive advice from the cooperative or sat they reach values higher than 4 points in all items related to environmental awareness except for limiting showering time cluster 3 irrigation optimizers by natural methods n 22 12 this group has extensive experience as farmers and have a basic level of education holdings have an average size of 1 87 ha and greenhouse type is the sloping roof seventy seven percent of their holdings have an irrigation programmer this is the cluster that most uses tensiometers 86 and as well as fully computerized irrigation system through the use of tensiometers 36 they collect rainwater both from the surface of the greenhouse and from other elements and the destination of the water harvested in all cases is the pond they have concrete and polyethylene lined ponds with an average capacity of 1324 m3 they use dredging as the only method of cleaning the pond all farmers in this cluster grow organically they have the highest average income and lowest expenses of the cluster set the trading channel used for their harvest is the cooperative and they receive technical advice through this same route the average number of workers per year is six they have the highest average water conductivity of all clusters it is the cluster that uses biological control the most to deal with pests 78 and it is the one uses additional methods for pollination the least 18 this cluster reaches the highest values of all clusters in relation to environmental awareness cluster 4 reluctant to adopt n 52 28 it is made up of older farmers with more experience in the sector and a low educational level their holdings are the oldest and have the smallest average size their greenhouses are sloping roof and flat top and they cultivate both in sanded and in local soil only 69 of their holdings have an irrigation programmer and 54 use tensiometers this cluster does not harvest rainwater their ponds have the lowest storage capacity of all the clusters and are all made of concrete the methods used to keep the pond clean are dredging and biocide treatment it is the cluster with the lowest organic cultivation 17 they gain a lower average income than the rest of the clusters the main trading channels for their harvest are exchanges and private distributors they receive technical advice from the exchanges and the companies that provide them with supplies they have the lowest average number of workers in all clusters and the highest percentage of family workers 16 it is the cluster that uses a greater proportion of phytosanitary products to deal with pests and a greater percentage of methods for pollination it is the one that presents the lowest average values in environmental awareness 3 2 perceptions of the installation of covers in the ponds the two clusters that covered the ponds had similar assessments for their reasons for installing them fig 2 the most notable difference is in relation to the use of the space occupied by the pond which for cluster 1 is the main reason to cover it while for cluster 2 it is not relevant the reasons related to the prevention of algae animals and waste in the pond are slightly more important for cluster 2 as well as the fact that the investment necessary to install the cover is affordable and there is the possibility of reducing costs on the other hand preventing evaporation and conserving the aquifer are two reasons with little relevance in the decision to install covers in the ponds for both clusters the two clusters that do not cover the ponds decided on this for different reasons fig 3 in the case of cluster 3 the reasons related to the presence of algae improving water quality as well as the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services as a result of covering it are of great importance however for cluster 4 these reasons are not relevant with the difficulty and cost of installation being the main reasons for not covering it fig 4 shows the percentage of farmers in each cluster who selected each of the advantages of covering the proposed ponds in general clusters 1 and 2 better appreciate the advantages of installing covers on the ponds for these two clusters the improvement of water quality reduced filtering and risk of clogging the irrigation systems and the use of additional methods to keep the pond clean are especially noteworthy likewise cluster 1 also highly values the possibility of using the surface of the pond for other purposes while the rest of the clusters do not view this as such a prominent advantage the least relevant advantages for clusters 1 and 2 are cost reductions and recovery and conservation of the aquifer in the case of cluster 3 the main advantages they see for covering the ponds are reducing evaporation and the conservation and recovery of the aquifer however the farmers of this cluster do not consider that covering the ponds improves water quality cluster 4 mainly values reducing filtering and the risk of clogging the irrigation systems and improving water quality while the recovery and conservation of the aquifer is the advantaged they least select the percentage of farmers in each cluster that selected each of the disadvantages is shown in fig 5 for clusters 1 and 2 the disadvantages of covering the ponds are not considered very relevant with the most prominent being the cost of installation in the case of cluster 3 the main disadvantages are the inhibition of algae and the loss of biodiversity that occurs when covering it on the other hand for cluster 4 the difficulty of installing the system and the cost necessary to do so are particularly relevant 3 3 measures to promote the installation of covers on ponds fig 6 shows the level of agreement of the different clusters with the measures to promote the installation of covers on the ponds all clusters disagree with the training sessions clusters 3 and 4 also disagree with establishing a regulation that requires covering the ponds while clusters 1 and 2 are indifferent to this measure cluster 4 feels that financial aid to meet the cost of installation is absolutely necessary finally all clusters except cluster 4 consider that the availability of more information on this practice is important 4 discussion the results of the cluster analysis show that farmers can be grouped into four clusters related to the installation of pond covers the space optimizers cluster 1 decide to install concrete covers in their ponds with the objective of taking advantage of the space that this occupies to make a warehouse for the irrigation system or other tools as well as for other purposes such as parking for vehicles the optimizers of irrigation by physical methods cluster 2 install suspended shade covers with the aim of preventing the growth of algae and vegetation and reducing the amount of dust and waste entering the pond the optimizers of irrigation by natural methods cluster 3 opt for not covering their ponds because they feel that ecological management favours biodiversity and allows improving the quality of irrigation water finally the reluctant to adopt group cluster 4 is formed by older farmers with traditional behaviours who are not willing to make the necessary investment to cover the pond because they are not clear about the benefits that this practice can generate the installation of covers in ponds can increase the efficiency of water use in agriculture since it considerably reduces evaporation martínez álvarez et al 2009 despite this the results of this research show that farmers decide not to cover the ponds to prevent evaporation and in addition consider this aspect as a secondary advantage the farmers of cluster 1 install concrete covers in their ponds to take advantage of the surface because in the study area space is limited to due the high concentration of greenhouses so taking advantage of the space of the pond allows them to expand the area dedicated to cultivation for their part the farmers of cluster 2 install suspended shade covers with the main objective of preserving the quality of water for agricultural irrigation traditional practices used to keep the pond clean such as dredging and applying biocides are not effective in improving water quality for irrigation juan et al 2012 however farmers continue to use them particularly dredging most farmers especially those in clusters 1 and 2 believe that covering the pond is the best way to maintain water conditions and avoid uniformity problems with irrigation however the farmers of cluster 3 consider that what truly improves water quality is to manage it in an ecological way by developing an aquatic ecosystem which includes algae in this sense different studies indicate that the development of algae positively impacts water quality for drip irrigation since it reduces the concentrations of planktonic chlorophyll and total suspended solids bonachela et al 2013 juan et al 2013 in addition uncovered ponds can provide ecosystem services for example allowing their use by birds the decrease in evaporation reduces the need to use external water sources and therefore can reduce the cost of water resources although evaporation depends on various factors such as the surface area of the pond or climatic conditions it is estimated that covering the ponds in the area could save between 400 m3 and 800 m3 per season according to the covering method carvajal et al 2016 taking into account that the price of water ranges from 0 30 to 0 50 m3 savings could amount to 120 400 euros per season the water needs of the crops in the area range between 6000 m3 ha and 8000 m3 ha per season so that around 6 13 of the irrigation water could be covered with evaporated water in addition the average water costs per hectare amount approximately to 1800 euros with the savings achieved by reducing evaporation through the cover installation which represents from 6 to 22 of this amount the experts commented that covering the ponds in the study area can range from 7 m2 to 14 m2 if it is done with shade cloth and up to 60 m2 if it is done with concrete for a typical 200 m2 pond in the case of covering with shade cloth it would be necessary to save from 2800 m3 to 5000 m3 water to cover the investment cost while in the case of covering with concrete it would be necessary to save up to 40 000 m3 water thus in the case of covering the pond with concrete this space can be used for other purposes such as building a warehouse for the irrigation system without the need to invest in the extension of the farm which has a high cost as the land is valued at 24 euros m2 taking this into account the water amount to be saved to cover the investment would be 24 000 m3 furthermore it should be borne in mind that covering the ponds can lead to cost savings derived from further aspects such as the following the need to use additional methods to keep the pond clean is reduced its average annual cost is estimated at 100 euros for dredging and 141 euros for biocide treatments juan et al 2012 in fact in our study 88 of farmers who do not cover the pond use an additional method for managing it while this percentage is 41 for those who do cover it as well maintenance needs of the irrigation system can be reduced martínez álvarez et al 2009 determined that by covering the pond the amount of water and electricity needed to clean the filtering systems was reduced by 90 despite this in our study cost reduction is not one of the main reasons for installing covers and it is not one of the most prominent advantages for all farmers several studies have established that the environmental awareness of farmers promotes implementing better management practices liu et al 2018 prokopy et al 2019 in our research although farmers generally have a positive environmental attitude the conservation and recovery of the aquifer is not one of the main reasons to opt for installing covers on the ponds this may be because farmers believe installing covers does not save a large amount of water due to the small average size of the ponds and therefore will not significantly reduce the amount of water extracted from underground sources for this same reason the farmers of cluster 3 who are the ones with the greatest environmental awareness feel that favouring biodiversity leads to greater benefits however the widespread extension of pond covers can have a positive impact on the recharge of groundwater bodies as evaporation losses account for 15 out of the total irrigation water in the area and 80 of irrigation water comes from groundwater sources furthermore the covering has no negative effects on the environment in this sense casas et al 2012 concluded that the ponds in the area cannot perform the same function as natural wetlands farmers are therefore not aware of the actual amount of water that can be saved with covers as well as the further cover benefits one of the main disadvantages considered by the group of farmers regarding the practice of covering the ponds is the cost of installation this aspect is especially relevant for farmers in cluster 4 who indicate this as the main reason for not covering it in addition these farmers also mention the difficulty of covering it which in turn impacts the cost of doing so some of the aspects discussed in relation to this issue are the unavailability of the necessary infrastructure around the pond to properly anchor the cloth requiring beams in the centre of the pond or the incidence of strong winds other studies have also indicated that these aspects make the investment necessary to install the ponds more expensive craig et al 2005 martínez álvarez et al 2010 martínez álvarez et al 2009 determined that the installation of covers was not economically viable in the segura river basin murcia spain considering a water price of 0 3 m3 however in our study area with an equivalent average water price 59 of the ponds are covered because this practice presents additional benefits for farmers this perception shows that the aspects related to the investment are considered secondary when deciding to install covers in the ponds of the study area this differs from that indicated in other studies on the incorporation or use of better water resource management practices abdulai and huffman 2014 bogdan and kulshreshtha 2021 the assessment of the measures to promote the installation of covers on the ponds indicates that farmers require more information about this practice however this information should be based on research conducted in the study area that demonstrates the effectiveness of this practice both to reduce evaporation and to improve water quality once conclusive scientific results are obtained they should be disseminated among farmers in this particular context training sessions do not seem the most appropriate way to convey information about this practice this may be because the installation of the cover is carried out by a specialized company and in addition does not imply changes in the method of managing irrigation juan et al 2012 these results differ from those obtained in other studies in which training and demonstration sessions are presented as one of the most effective methods to encourage farmers to incorporate sustainable practices into their management of water resources adamsone fiskovica and grivins 2021 aznar sánchez et al 2021 one way for this information to reach farmers can be through the field technicians who advise them or through the cooperatives or irrigation communities of which the farmers are members galdeano gómez et al 2017 point out that farmers associations in almería play a key role in resource management and in promoting more environmentally friendly production systems the literature indicates that regulation could be an ideal measure to encourage the adoption of practices that positively impact sustainability aubert et al 2012 aznar sánchez et al 2020 however in our study the two clusters that do not have covered ponds disagree with regulatory measures that make it mandatory although their reasons are different therefore regulations in this regard must take into account the attitude of the different profiles of farmers to avoid rejection or noncompliance regarding economic aid most farmers agree with its effectiveness in encouraging the implementation of this practice in fact farmers in the study area who belong to a producer organization cooperative or sat can receive aid from operational funds for the installation of covers on the ponds however the farmers of cluster 4 who are the most in need of such aid cannot access them because they do not belong to these organizations the results obtained in this research are of great relevance for stakeholders especially for researchers and policy makers as has been demonstrated the existing disparity in research on the best way to maintain and or improve water quality for irrigation can be confusing among farmers who end up making decisions based on their own experience therefore it is necessary to expand the research in the study area in relation to the management methods of the ponds to determine which is most beneficial taking into account both the economic and environmental aspects in this sense considering the results of this research the cover of the ponds is a beneficial alternative as it improves efficiency in water management resources by reducing evaporation intermediate solutions could also be considered such as the installation of partial covers or the use of materials that allow solar radiation and prevent dirt from entering into the pond abdallah et al 2021 the public administration should promote the implementation of this practice by expanding research on it developing information dissemination programs and incentives adapted to the farmers needs 5 conclusions through the application of the cluster analysis four groups of farmers were characterized in relation to the installation of covers in the irrigation ponds the space optimizers opt to cover the concrete pond to use its surface for other purposes while the irrigation optimizers by physical methods seek to maintain water quality to ensure irrigation uniformity those farmers who do not cover the pond do so for conflicting reasons the optimizers of irrigation by natural methods feel that biodiversity improves the quality of water for irrigation while the reluctant to adopt feel that covering the pond does not provide them a sufficient benefit to make such investment in general farmers who do not have their ponds covered are not opposed to implementing this practice but it is necessary to incorporate the proposed measures to promote such introduction in this sense the need to make information on this practice more available among farmers is key due to the fact that there are opposing forms of pond management that have the same purpose on the other hand economic incentives to cover the installation cost the system should be promoted especially among farmers who do not belong to a producer organization future lines of research on this practice in the study area should focus on demonstrating the efficiency of this system to guarantee and or improve water quality for agricultural irrigation as well as to reduce evaporation and the demand for additional water resources on the other hand it would be necessary to determine the financial viability of the installation of the covers taking into account all the benefits that this provides to be able to design the necessary economic measures to incentivize their implementation finally it must be taken into account that the characteristics of the study area can influence the perceptions of farmers about the implementation of this practice despite this the results obtained in this study can be extrapolated to those areas with small and medium sized farms with greenhouses similar climatic conditions and problems related to water availability especially those in the mediterranean basin as it is highly vulnerable to climate change on the other hand these results may also be useful in other countries such as mexico egypt or china where large areas of greenhouse vegetable production take place funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing

9184,the installation of covers over ponds for agricultural irrigation is a feasible alternative to reduce evaporative water losses however the installation of these systems continues to be very limited understanding the factors that influence the behaviour of farmers towards this type of installation is fundamental because they are the individuals making the final decision this article analyses the perceptions and behaviours of farmers towards the installation of covers in agricultural irrigation ponds in southeastern spain a cluster analysis characterized four groups of farmers related to this practice the results show that these clusters present different perceptions towards the installation of covers their possible advantages and the different incentives that can be established to promote their implementation technical and agronomic aspects play an important role in installation decisions while economic and environmental aspects are considered secondary based on these results actionable recommendations are proposed for policy makers the findings of this study can be very useful in those regions in which it is desired to promote the installation of covers over ponds for agricultural irrigation keywords water management sustainability intensive agriculture farmer attitudes cluster analysis data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the use of ponds for agricultural purposes has been a common practice for centuries as it facilitates managing irrigation water lópez felices et al 2020 these systems are particularly important in areas with limited water resources because they can increase and stabilize crop yields mushtaq et al 2009 ponds have proven to be a viable alternative to combat prolonged droughts in addition to diversifying production chander et al 2019 wisser et al 2010 determined that the construction of small ponds could increase the production of cereals worldwide by 35 these data are of great relevance since it is expected that global food production will experience a 70 increase by 2050 to meet the needs of a growing population un 2012 it is estimated that there are 277 400 000 ponds less than 1 hectare in size and 24 120 000 water bodies between 1 and 10 ha which represent 90 of the stagnant water bodies of the world céréghino et al 2013 in addition since the 1960 s the construction of ponds has increased by up to 50 davidson and finlayson 2018 one of the main problems posed by ponds is evaporation losses maestre valero et al 2011 specifically between 30 and 50 of the pond capacity is lost due to evaporation abdallah et al 2021 in addition althoff et al 2020 estimated that the evaporation of small ponds will increase between 7 3 and 18 4 by 2100 as a result of climate change pond function will then be negatively impacted causing a decrease in the efficiency of water use at a global scale wurbs and ayala 2014 estimate that the evaporated water in texas reservoirs could meet 61 of the total water demand for agricultural use craig et al 2005 determined that the annual loss of water to evaporation in the agricultural holdings of queensland could reach 40 with this volume being sufficient to irrigate some 125 000 ha of crop maestre valero et al 2013 show that the evaporated water in the agricultural water reservoirs located in the segura river basin spain can represent up to 11 7 of the water available for irrigation in the basin addressing this problem is of great relevance since one of the main obstacles facing agriculture is the growing scarcity of water resources velasco muñoz et al 2019 therefore different methods have been developed to reduce the evaporation of ponds which can be classified as biological methods organic residues aquatic plants wind breakers chemical methods chemical covers and physical methods suspended covers and floating covers craig et al 2005 abdallah et al 2021 several studies have analysed the effectiveness of these methods to reduce evaporation varying between 13 and 90 martínez álvarez et al 2010 benzaghta et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 saggaï and bachi 2018 the most promising methods seem to be the physical ones since they have the highest efficiency rates abdallah et al 2021 martínez espinosa 2021 in addition to reducing evaporation covering the ponds can have further advantages covering ponds improves water quality due to two main reasons maestre valero et al 2011 martínez espinosa 2021 i preventing the growth of algae and vegetation in the water by minimizing solar radiation and ii reducing the amount of dust and waste transported by the wind that enters the pond this is especially relevant in agricultural systems in which drip irrigation is used since it is composed of narrow conduits and a large number of drip emitters with small openings that can be easily clogged by physical chemical and or biological compounds found in water maestre valero et al 2011 the increase in suspended particles in the water and clogged drip emitters can affect the distribution and uniformity of irrigation which impact on water consumption and crop yield bonachela et al 2013 therefore farmers can maintain the optimal performance of the irrigation system by cleaning the filters frequently on the other hand covering the ponds can lead to savings in various operating costs such as water consumption or pond maintenance traditionally two practices have been carried out to keep the pond clean and preserve the irrigation water quality dredging the pond is usually carried out at the end of the agricultural season to control excess vegetation and sediments the other practise is applying biocides to prevent algal growth there are also studies that suggest the economic viability of these types of installations martínez álvarez et al 2009 maestre valero et al 2013 han et al 2019 despite these advantages the use of covers in ponds is still not a widespread practice abdallah et al 2021 in this context understanding the factors that influence the behaviour of farmers towards this type of practice is fundamental because they make the final decision about adopting it in this way approaches and tools that encourage their implementation can be formulated and applied allowing for the more efficient management of water resources liu et al 2018 this is even more relevant in arid and semiarid areas where water availability can act as a limiting factor for agricultural production abdallah et al 2021 however to date no research has analysed the perceptions and behaviours of farmers towards this type of installation the objective of this work is to fill this knowledge gap by studying the attitudes and behaviours of farmers towards the installation of covers in ponds aiming to improve the management of water resources to achieve this a study was carried out in southeastern spain where an intensive agricultural model based on the use of greenhouses was developed aznar sánchez et al 2011 the specific objectives of this study include 1 determining the existing profiles of farmers in relation to the installation of covers in the ponds 2 knowing their perception towards adopting this practice and 3 examining the degree of acceptance of the different measures intended to promote their installation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this research was developed in the region of campo de dalías located in almería southeastern spain fig 1 almería has 32 554 ha of greenhouses of which 67 7 are located in campo de dalías junta de andalucía 2020 this area has a mediterranean climate characterized by mild temperatures in winter with an average of 18 c and low rainfall averaging 220 mm annually mendoza fernández et al 2021 in addition the high solar radiation with more than 3000 h of sun per year leads to high evaporation and evapotranspiration rates sánchez et al 2015 production has been specialized in a range of eight fruit and vegetable crops pepper cucumber zucchini tomato eggplant green bean melon and watermelon water consumption for agricultural irrigation in the region amounts to 168 3 hm3 per year garcía caparrós et al 2017 the scarcity of surface water resources has necessitated groundwater based agricultural development of this region leading to the overexploitation of aquifers caparrós martínez et al 2020 the horticultural water exploitation index of the region is 1 1 garcía caparrós et al 2017 therefore technologies have been implemented to improve water use efficiency such as drip irrigation and the use of tensiometers desalinated water has also been incorporated as an alternative source for agricultural irrigation with 7 5 hm3 coming from the campo de dalías desalination plant mendoza fernández et al 2021 in addition in recent years the percentage of holdings that harvest rainwater has increased to 50 garcía garcía et al 2016 however the savings generated by these technologies and the use of other alternative sources of water are not enough to meet the high demand of the region so it is necessary to continue improving water use efficiency water resources for agricultural irrigation in this region are managed through irrigation communities which provide water to member farmers at an average price of 0 30 m3 caparrós martínez et al 2020 however the increases in the cost of electrical energy mean that irrigation communities have higher water prices reaching as high as 0 50 m3 almería has more than 10 000 ponds for agricultural purposes casas et al 2011 in campo de dalías 80 of the holdings have an irrigation pond to store water and flow regulation purposes junta de andalucía 2015 to cover the ponds of the study area physical methods are used specifically concrete covers or suspended covers of shade cloth carvajal et al 2016 determined that covering agricultural ponds in almería with shade cloth could reduce evaporation losses by up to 83 in addition it is estimated that the evaporation losses of the campo de dalías ponds account for approximately 15 of the total water destined for agricultural use mendoza fernández et al 2021 despite these significant figures in this region only approximately 40 of the ponds are covered garcía garcía et al 2016 for this reason campo de dalías is an ideal laboratory to carry out this research 2 2 questionnaire development the collection of information for preparing the questionnaire was carried out through interviews with experts and a focus group the presidents of two of the most important irrigation communities in the region were interviewed as well as the president of an agricultural cooperative and two farmers with extensive experience by conducting these interviews the most relevant information was obtained in relation to the practice of covering the ponds in the study area to validate the information obtained a focus group was developed with six farmers in the region of which three had their pond covered and another three did not once the questionnaire was completed a pilot survey was carried out to test it with a group of eight farmers four of them had their pond covered and another four did not finally the questionnaire was divided into four sections 1 characteristics of farmers and their holdings this section had four groups of questions related to a traits of farmers age experience as a farmer and educational level b characterization of the holding type of soil and greenhouse size year of construction climate conditioning systems irrigation systems tensiometers computerized irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems c characterization of the irrigation pond capacity type shape volume at which it is maintained methods to keep it clean and type of cover and d data on crops and inputs number of crop cycles organic production monoculture income expenses trading channel number of total workers and family members electrical conductivity level methods to deal with pests percentage of phytosanitary treatments and biological control methods used for pollination and type of technical advice 2 environmental attitude in this section of the questionnaire farmers had to indicate the frequency with which they performed six behaviours in their daily life using a five point likert scale 1 never 2 rarely 3 sometimes 4 often 5 always the selection of the items was based on previous studies paço and lavrador 2017 karasmanaki et al 2021 musova et al 2021 the items included in our study were recycling turning off the faucet while brushing teeth limiting showering time using energy saving light bulbs using energy efficient appliances and turning off lights and electrical appliances when not in use 3 perceptions of installing covers in the ponds this section of the questionnaire had two parts in the first part the farmers had to assess the importance of a series of aspects in their decision to install or not install covers on the ponds using a 5 point likert scale 1 not important 2 less important 3 moderately important 4 very important 5 extremely important in the case of the farmers with the covered pond they had to establish the relevance of the following reasons for doing so algae and vegetation growth prevention aquatic animals prevention dust and waste reduction evaporation prevention cost reduction aquifer conservation affordable installation cost and use of space covering the pond can prevent the growth of algae and vegetation and the presence of aquatic animals by preventing solar radiation as well as the entry of dust and waste which can positively impact water quality by minimizing the evaporation of water the aquifer can be conserved since less groundwater needs to be extracted the reduction of costs can be derived from water savings and the reduction of the maintenance costs of the pond if the farmers feel that the installation cost is acceptable this can incentivize covers being installed on the ponds finally in the case of covering using concrete the surface of the pond can be used for other purposes such as building a warehouse for the irrigation system those farmers who did not have covered ponds had to assess the following reasons for not doing so installation cost difficulty algae improves water quality ecosystem services loss and biodiversity loss the difficulty in installing the covers may be due for example to the fact that the necessary infrastructure is not available around the pond or that the ponds are large and require the installation of beams in the centre this can increase the cost if a roof needs to be constructed on the other hand the presence of algae can lead to better water quality by generating an ecosystem that allows controlling various water parameters thus if it remains uncovered the pond can provide ecosystem services by allowing various animals to use them therefore covering it can lead to a loss of biodiversity in the area in the second part both farmers with covered ponds and uncovered ponds had to select from a series of options the advantages and disadvantages about covering the ponds the advantages included the following evaporation reduction water quality improvement reduces the need for filtering and risk of clogging of the irrigation system reduces the use of additional methods to keep the pond clean cost reduction use of space and aquifer conservation and recovery by improving the quality of the water and reducing the presence of solids the filtration of the irrigation system is minimized and the chances of its clogging are reduced in addition by keeping the water cleaner it is necessary to use fewer additional methods of pond management such as dredging or biocide treatment on the other hand the disadvantages considered were prevents vegetation growth prevents animals from using the pond biodiversity loss installation cost and difficulty of installation 4 measures to promote the installation of covers on the ponds in the last section of the questionnaire farmers were asked about four possible measures to encourage the installation of covers in the ponds training sessions further information available aid to cover the cost of installation and regulatory measures the training sessions include training courses in which the possibilities offered by covering the pond are shown and holdings that already have this installation can be visited as a demonstration the availability of more information refers to the possibility that farmers can access data on the possible advantages and disadvantages of covering the pond as well as that the technicians advise them on this practice with the item of aid to cover the cost of installation we want to determine the opinion of farmers regarding the need to establish economic aid in addition through the item of regulatory measures it is intended to know if farmers consider it appropriate to establish a regulation that requires covering the ponds in the region the scoring of these measures was performed with a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 2 disagree 3 neither agree nor disagree 4 agree 5 strongly agree 2 3 sample size and selection the following formula was used to determine the sample size n z α 2 p 1 p n e α 2 n 1 z α 2 p 1 p where n sample size n population α confidence level zα statistical parameter that depends on the confidence level e g 1 96 for 95 confidence level eα maximum accepted estimation error p probability of occurrence of the event under study a confidence level of 95 and a maximum error of 5 were established the study area has an area of 22 054 ha of greenhouses junta de andalucía 2020 so it was necessary to survey a minimum of 378 ha finally 182 farmers with a total of 395 ha were surveyed taking these data into account the margin of error is approximately 4 89 to select the sample simple random sampling without replacement was carried out as all individuals had the same probability of being chosen in each of the extractions farmers were contacted with the collaboration of different irrigation communities in the area the surveys were conducted in person and lasted between 15 and 20 min from august to november 2021 2 4 data analysis spss software version 27 was used to perform the data analysis first descriptive statistics were obtained the interoperative relationships of the variables were studied and the outliers and data distribution were observed subsequently a cluster analysis was carried out with the objective of determining the characteristics of the different groups of farmers in relation to the installation of covers in the ponds of the study area it is an exploratory technique that allows the classification of observations with similar properties through a multivariate statistical procedure hennig et al 2015 in our case a hierarchical cluster analysis was developed in which the clustering of clusters was performed using the ward or minimum variance method the application of this method allows obtaining homogeneous clusters in an objective way hennig et al 2015 the homogeneity of the clusters is measured by the sum of the squared distances of each element with respect to the centroid or vector of means murtagh and contreras 2017 to prevent possible problems derived from obtaining the data using different scales or units we standardized the data set and the squared euclidean distance was used as a measure finally the analysis of variance of a factor anova was used which carries out a generalization of the contrast of equal means for independent samples cardinal and aitken 2013 this analysis frequently used to establish experimental designs allows studying the clusters and determining the behaviour of the groups within the same variable of interest tabachnick and fidell 2007 with the use of this type of analysis the means of each population group are obtained and their variances intragroup variance are studied with respect to the average variance within each group between group variance cardinal and aitken 2013 if it is taken into account that the groups have been obtained from the same population universe both the mean and the variances should be equal 3 results this section presents the main results of this research firstly the farmers profile and main characteristics are shown then the perceptions of different groups in relation to the installation of covers on the ponds are presented finally the farmers assessment of the different measures to promote the adoption of this practice is reported the descriptive statistics of the variables studied in this research are shown in table 1 3 1 profile of farmers through the application of cluster analysis the 182 farmers who participated in this research were classified into four homogeneous groups of the 40 variables studied 32 have been found to be relevant to establish this classification table 2 next the main characteristics of these groups are shown taking into account the average values obtained in these variables table 3 cluster 1 space optimizers n 54 30 these are younger farmers than those of the rest of the clusters who have less experience in the agricultural field they have a medium level of education their holdings are newer with a medium size and grow mainly in sloping roof greenhouses using sanding eighty seven percent of their holdings have an irrigation programmer and 67 use tensiometers although both systems are automatically connected in only 19 of holdings they collect rainwater from the surface of the greenhouse and from other elements of the holding directing the harvested water to a reservoir in which water from different sources or a filter well is stored the ponds of this cluster have an average capacity of 1850 m3 and are made of concrete the main method used to keep the pond clean is to cover it with a concrete cover although it is also drained it is the cluster that carries out the greatest number of crop cycles per season twenty six percent of the holdings in this cluster grow organically they obtain an average income of 8 22 m2 while the average cost is 4 68 m2 the main trading channels for the harvest are cooperatives or sat from which they also receive technical advice they have an average of 7 workers per year of which 7 are family members biological control is mainly used to deal with pests 65 this cluster presents high average values in environmental awareness cluster 2 irrigation optimizers using physical methods n 54 30 farmers in this cluster have extensive experience in the agricultural sector and low medium education levels they have the holdings with the largest average size of all clusters they use sloping roof greenhouses and sanding for cultivation it is the cluster with the largest number of irrigation programmers 96 and 69 of cases also use tensiometers they collect rainwater from the surface of the greenhouse and from other elements of the holding with the destination of the harvested water being a pond in which water from different sources or a filter well is stored their ponds have the greatest storage capacity which are concrete or polyethylene lined all ponds in this cluster were covered using shade cloth dredging is also used as an additional method of cleaning the pond a high number of these holdings cultivate organically 41 and mostly use biological control to deal with pests 76 this cluster has the highest expenses and the largest number of workers per year they have the lowest level of electrical conductivity of water of all clusters they sell the harvest and receive advice from the cooperative or sat they reach values higher than 4 points in all items related to environmental awareness except for limiting showering time cluster 3 irrigation optimizers by natural methods n 22 12 this group has extensive experience as farmers and have a basic level of education holdings have an average size of 1 87 ha and greenhouse type is the sloping roof seventy seven percent of their holdings have an irrigation programmer this is the cluster that most uses tensiometers 86 and as well as fully computerized irrigation system through the use of tensiometers 36 they collect rainwater both from the surface of the greenhouse and from other elements and the destination of the water harvested in all cases is the pond they have concrete and polyethylene lined ponds with an average capacity of 1324 m3 they use dredging as the only method of cleaning the pond all farmers in this cluster grow organically they have the highest average income and lowest expenses of the cluster set the trading channel used for their harvest is the cooperative and they receive technical advice through this same route the average number of workers per year is six they have the highest average water conductivity of all clusters it is the cluster that uses biological control the most to deal with pests 78 and it is the one uses additional methods for pollination the least 18 this cluster reaches the highest values of all clusters in relation to environmental awareness cluster 4 reluctant to adopt n 52 28 it is made up of older farmers with more experience in the sector and a low educational level their holdings are the oldest and have the smallest average size their greenhouses are sloping roof and flat top and they cultivate both in sanded and in local soil only 69 of their holdings have an irrigation programmer and 54 use tensiometers this cluster does not harvest rainwater their ponds have the lowest storage capacity of all the clusters and are all made of concrete the methods used to keep the pond clean are dredging and biocide treatment it is the cluster with the lowest organic cultivation 17 they gain a lower average income than the rest of the clusters the main trading channels for their harvest are exchanges and private distributors they receive technical advice from the exchanges and the companies that provide them with supplies they have the lowest average number of workers in all clusters and the highest percentage of family workers 16 it is the cluster that uses a greater proportion of phytosanitary products to deal with pests and a greater percentage of methods for pollination it is the one that presents the lowest average values in environmental awareness 3 2 perceptions of the installation of covers in the ponds the two clusters that covered the ponds had similar assessments for their reasons for installing them fig 2 the most notable difference is in relation to the use of the space occupied by the pond which for cluster 1 is the main reason to cover it while for cluster 2 it is not relevant the reasons related to the prevention of algae animals and waste in the pond are slightly more important for cluster 2 as well as the fact that the investment necessary to install the cover is affordable and there is the possibility of reducing costs on the other hand preventing evaporation and conserving the aquifer are two reasons with little relevance in the decision to install covers in the ponds for both clusters the two clusters that do not cover the ponds decided on this for different reasons fig 3 in the case of cluster 3 the reasons related to the presence of algae improving water quality as well as the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services as a result of covering it are of great importance however for cluster 4 these reasons are not relevant with the difficulty and cost of installation being the main reasons for not covering it fig 4 shows the percentage of farmers in each cluster who selected each of the advantages of covering the proposed ponds in general clusters 1 and 2 better appreciate the advantages of installing covers on the ponds for these two clusters the improvement of water quality reduced filtering and risk of clogging the irrigation systems and the use of additional methods to keep the pond clean are especially noteworthy likewise cluster 1 also highly values the possibility of using the surface of the pond for other purposes while the rest of the clusters do not view this as such a prominent advantage the least relevant advantages for clusters 1 and 2 are cost reductions and recovery and conservation of the aquifer in the case of cluster 3 the main advantages they see for covering the ponds are reducing evaporation and the conservation and recovery of the aquifer however the farmers of this cluster do not consider that covering the ponds improves water quality cluster 4 mainly values reducing filtering and the risk of clogging the irrigation systems and improving water quality while the recovery and conservation of the aquifer is the advantaged they least select the percentage of farmers in each cluster that selected each of the disadvantages is shown in fig 5 for clusters 1 and 2 the disadvantages of covering the ponds are not considered very relevant with the most prominent being the cost of installation in the case of cluster 3 the main disadvantages are the inhibition of algae and the loss of biodiversity that occurs when covering it on the other hand for cluster 4 the difficulty of installing the system and the cost necessary to do so are particularly relevant 3 3 measures to promote the installation of covers on ponds fig 6 shows the level of agreement of the different clusters with the measures to promote the installation of covers on the ponds all clusters disagree with the training sessions clusters 3 and 4 also disagree with establishing a regulation that requires covering the ponds while clusters 1 and 2 are indifferent to this measure cluster 4 feels that financial aid to meet the cost of installation is absolutely necessary finally all clusters except cluster 4 consider that the availability of more information on this practice is important 4 discussion the results of the cluster analysis show that farmers can be grouped into four clusters related to the installation of pond covers the space optimizers cluster 1 decide to install concrete covers in their ponds with the objective of taking advantage of the space that this occupies to make a warehouse for the irrigation system or other tools as well as for other purposes such as parking for vehicles the optimizers of irrigation by physical methods cluster 2 install suspended shade covers with the aim of preventing the growth of algae and vegetation and reducing the amount of dust and waste entering the pond the optimizers of irrigation by natural methods cluster 3 opt for not covering their ponds because they feel that ecological management favours biodiversity and allows improving the quality of irrigation water finally the reluctant to adopt group cluster 4 is formed by older farmers with traditional behaviours who are not willing to make the necessary investment to cover the pond because they are not clear about the benefits that this practice can generate the installation of covers in ponds can increase the efficiency of water use in agriculture since it considerably reduces evaporation martínez álvarez et al 2009 despite this the results of this research show that farmers decide not to cover the ponds to prevent evaporation and in addition consider this aspect as a secondary advantage the farmers of cluster 1 install concrete covers in their ponds to take advantage of the surface because in the study area space is limited to due the high concentration of greenhouses so taking advantage of the space of the pond allows them to expand the area dedicated to cultivation for their part the farmers of cluster 2 install suspended shade covers with the main objective of preserving the quality of water for agricultural irrigation traditional practices used to keep the pond clean such as dredging and applying biocides are not effective in improving water quality for irrigation juan et al 2012 however farmers continue to use them particularly dredging most farmers especially those in clusters 1 and 2 believe that covering the pond is the best way to maintain water conditions and avoid uniformity problems with irrigation however the farmers of cluster 3 consider that what truly improves water quality is to manage it in an ecological way by developing an aquatic ecosystem which includes algae in this sense different studies indicate that the development of algae positively impacts water quality for drip irrigation since it reduces the concentrations of planktonic chlorophyll and total suspended solids bonachela et al 2013 juan et al 2013 in addition uncovered ponds can provide ecosystem services for example allowing their use by birds the decrease in evaporation reduces the need to use external water sources and therefore can reduce the cost of water resources although evaporation depends on various factors such as the surface area of the pond or climatic conditions it is estimated that covering the ponds in the area could save between 400 m3 and 800 m3 per season according to the covering method carvajal et al 2016 taking into account that the price of water ranges from 0 30 to 0 50 m3 savings could amount to 120 400 euros per season the water needs of the crops in the area range between 6000 m3 ha and 8000 m3 ha per season so that around 6 13 of the irrigation water could be covered with evaporated water in addition the average water costs per hectare amount approximately to 1800 euros with the savings achieved by reducing evaporation through the cover installation which represents from 6 to 22 of this amount the experts commented that covering the ponds in the study area can range from 7 m2 to 14 m2 if it is done with shade cloth and up to 60 m2 if it is done with concrete for a typical 200 m2 pond in the case of covering with shade cloth it would be necessary to save from 2800 m3 to 5000 m3 water to cover the investment cost while in the case of covering with concrete it would be necessary to save up to 40 000 m3 water thus in the case of covering the pond with concrete this space can be used for other purposes such as building a warehouse for the irrigation system without the need to invest in the extension of the farm which has a high cost as the land is valued at 24 euros m2 taking this into account the water amount to be saved to cover the investment would be 24 000 m3 furthermore it should be borne in mind that covering the ponds can lead to cost savings derived from further aspects such as the following the need to use additional methods to keep the pond clean is reduced its average annual cost is estimated at 100 euros for dredging and 141 euros for biocide treatments juan et al 2012 in fact in our study 88 of farmers who do not cover the pond use an additional method for managing it while this percentage is 41 for those who do cover it as well maintenance needs of the irrigation system can be reduced martínez álvarez et al 2009 determined that by covering the pond the amount of water and electricity needed to clean the filtering systems was reduced by 90 despite this in our study cost reduction is not one of the main reasons for installing covers and it is not one of the most prominent advantages for all farmers several studies have established that the environmental awareness of farmers promotes implementing better management practices liu et al 2018 prokopy et al 2019 in our research although farmers generally have a positive environmental attitude the conservation and recovery of the aquifer is not one of the main reasons to opt for installing covers on the ponds this may be because farmers believe installing covers does not save a large amount of water due to the small average size of the ponds and therefore will not significantly reduce the amount of water extracted from underground sources for this same reason the farmers of cluster 3 who are the ones with the greatest environmental awareness feel that favouring biodiversity leads to greater benefits however the widespread extension of pond covers can have a positive impact on the recharge of groundwater bodies as evaporation losses account for 15 out of the total irrigation water in the area and 80 of irrigation water comes from groundwater sources furthermore the covering has no negative effects on the environment in this sense casas et al 2012 concluded that the ponds in the area cannot perform the same function as natural wetlands farmers are therefore not aware of the actual amount of water that can be saved with covers as well as the further cover benefits one of the main disadvantages considered by the group of farmers regarding the practice of covering the ponds is the cost of installation this aspect is especially relevant for farmers in cluster 4 who indicate this as the main reason for not covering it in addition these farmers also mention the difficulty of covering it which in turn impacts the cost of doing so some of the aspects discussed in relation to this issue are the unavailability of the necessary infrastructure around the pond to properly anchor the cloth requiring beams in the centre of the pond or the incidence of strong winds other studies have also indicated that these aspects make the investment necessary to install the ponds more expensive craig et al 2005 martínez álvarez et al 2010 martínez álvarez et al 2009 determined that the installation of covers was not economically viable in the segura river basin murcia spain considering a water price of 0 3 m3 however in our study area with an equivalent average water price 59 of the ponds are covered because this practice presents additional benefits for farmers this perception shows that the aspects related to the investment are considered secondary when deciding to install covers in the ponds of the study area this differs from that indicated in other studies on the incorporation or use of better water resource management practices abdulai and huffman 2014 bogdan and kulshreshtha 2021 the assessment of the measures to promote the installation of covers on the ponds indicates that farmers require more information about this practice however this information should be based on research conducted in the study area that demonstrates the effectiveness of this practice both to reduce evaporation and to improve water quality once conclusive scientific results are obtained they should be disseminated among farmers in this particular context training sessions do not seem the most appropriate way to convey information about this practice this may be because the installation of the cover is carried out by a specialized company and in addition does not imply changes in the method of managing irrigation juan et al 2012 these results differ from those obtained in other studies in which training and demonstration sessions are presented as one of the most effective methods to encourage farmers to incorporate sustainable practices into their management of water resources adamsone fiskovica and grivins 2021 aznar sánchez et al 2021 one way for this information to reach farmers can be through the field technicians who advise them or through the cooperatives or irrigation communities of which the farmers are members galdeano gómez et al 2017 point out that farmers associations in almería play a key role in resource management and in promoting more environmentally friendly production systems the literature indicates that regulation could be an ideal measure to encourage the adoption of practices that positively impact sustainability aubert et al 2012 aznar sánchez et al 2020 however in our study the two clusters that do not have covered ponds disagree with regulatory measures that make it mandatory although their reasons are different therefore regulations in this regard must take into account the attitude of the different profiles of farmers to avoid rejection or noncompliance regarding economic aid most farmers agree with its effectiveness in encouraging the implementation of this practice in fact farmers in the study area who belong to a producer organization cooperative or sat can receive aid from operational funds for the installation of covers on the ponds however the farmers of cluster 4 who are the most in need of such aid cannot access them because they do not belong to these organizations the results obtained in this research are of great relevance for stakeholders especially for researchers and policy makers as has been demonstrated the existing disparity in research on the best way to maintain and or improve water quality for irrigation can be confusing among farmers who end up making decisions based on their own experience therefore it is necessary to expand the research in the study area in relation to the management methods of the ponds to determine which is most beneficial taking into account both the economic and environmental aspects in this sense considering the results of this research the cover of the ponds is a beneficial alternative as it improves efficiency in water management resources by reducing evaporation intermediate solutions could also be considered such as the installation of partial covers or the use of materials that allow solar radiation and prevent dirt from entering into the pond abdallah et al 2021 the public administration should promote the implementation of this practice by expanding research on it developing information dissemination programs and incentives adapted to the farmers needs 5 conclusions through the application of the cluster analysis four groups of farmers were characterized in relation to the installation of covers in the irrigation ponds the space optimizers opt to cover the concrete pond to use its surface for other purposes while the irrigation optimizers by physical methods seek to maintain water quality to ensure irrigation uniformity those farmers who do not cover the pond do so for conflicting reasons the optimizers of irrigation by natural methods feel that biodiversity improves the quality of water for irrigation while the reluctant to adopt feel that covering the pond does not provide them a sufficient benefit to make such investment in general farmers who do not have their ponds covered are not opposed to implementing this practice but it is necessary to incorporate the proposed measures to promote such introduction in this sense the need to make information on this practice more available among farmers is key due to the fact that there are opposing forms of pond management that have the same purpose on the other hand economic incentives to cover the installation cost the system should be promoted especially among farmers who do not belong to a producer organization future lines of research on this practice in the study area should focus on demonstrating the efficiency of this system to guarantee and or improve water quality for agricultural irrigation as well as to reduce evaporation and the demand for additional water resources on the other hand it would be necessary to determine the financial viability of the installation of the covers taking into account all the benefits that this provides to be able to design the necessary economic measures to incentivize their implementation finally it must be taken into account that the characteristics of the study area can influence the perceptions of farmers about the implementation of this practice despite this the results obtained in this study can be extrapolated to those areas with small and medium sized farms with greenhouses similar climatic conditions and problems related to water availability especially those in the mediterranean basin as it is highly vulnerable to climate change on the other hand these results may also be useful in other countries such as mexico egypt or china where large areas of greenhouse vegetable production take place funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing
