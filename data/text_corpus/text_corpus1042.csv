5210,the undeniable fact of climate change and dam construction alters the hydrological systems and threatens aquatic ecosystems of rivers around the world quantifying the impact of climate change and dam construction on flow regime is essential for water resources management and environmental protection however previous studies have rarely separated the effects of two factors on flow regimes and the individual impact of each remains insufficient to date moreover the existing methods have not fully captured the characteristics and temporal changes of flow regimes in this study we propose a new framework that integrates a streamflow reconstruction technique indicators of hydrologic alteration iha indicators of intra annual flow variations a revised range of variability approach to assessing the climate change and dam induced impacts on the flow regime the upper yellow river basin uyrb was selected as the study area the results show that climate change significantly reduces the monthly flow extreme water conditions and the intra annual indicators and advances the julian date of annual maximum flow dam construction delays the julian date of annual maximum flow that opposes climate change impact reduces the monthly flow in the flood season and the annual maximum flow but increases the monthly flow in the dry season and annual minimum flow changes in flow regimes in the uyrb are found to be mainly due to climate change albeit there exists a cascade of dams based on the range of variability approach rva fifteen of forty indicators are moderately changed while the number increases to thirty seven when considering the temporal order alteration of flow regime the case study demonstrates that the developed framework can serve as a useful tool to evaluate the impact of climate change and dam construction on flow regimes keywords flow regime alterations climate change dam construction upper yellow river basin impact assessment 1 introduction natural flow regime plays a vital role in maintaining river biodiversity and ecosystem integrity and services poff et al 1997 arthington et al 2006 however the flow regime of many rivers in the world have changed dramatically in the past few decades which has caused severe degradation of river ecosystems nilsson et al 2005 döll and zhang 2010 puig et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 gierszewski et al 2020 dam construction is one prevalent kind of human activities and is considered to be the most prominent factor in changing the flow regime vörösmarty et al 2010 to date more than 847 000 large and small dams have been constructed in the last century and have affected 60 of rivers in the world rosenberg et al 2000 richter and thomas 2007 lehner et al 2011 other reports indicate that by 2025 dam controlled rivers are expected to reach 70 postel 1998 in addition to dam construction climate change is another major cause of changes in flow regime kim et al 2011 ashraf et al 2016 papadaki et al 2016 also current conditions and potential climate change will modulate the impact patterns of dam regulation schneider et al 2013 therefore to ensure a holistic understanding of hydrological changes for the sustainable development and protection of rivers it is necessary to understand not only the overall changes in the flow conditions but also the separated changes caused by dams and potential climate change to date various indicators have been developed and introduced to describe different aspects of the river regime richter et al 1996 clausen and biggs 2000 vogel et al 2007 jovanovic et al 2017 one of the most robust and widely used methods is the iha which reflects the flow regime from five characteristics namely magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change to quantify the degree of change in flow regime richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva based on the iha metrics since then many studies have analyzed the flow regime alterations due to dam construction and climate change by iha and rva yang et al 2008 lee et al 2014 sellamiet al 2016 tian et al 2019 however although widely applicable this method owes several limitations first iha mainly defines the characteristics of the inter annual regimes but does not reflect the features of the intra annual regimes haghighi and kløve 2013 haghighi et al 2014 previous studies have indicated that the change of intra annual regimes can also damage the riverine ecosystems lin et al 2017 next the rva only considers the change of the hydrological parameter frequency and ignores the temporal order change of each parameter to overcome this shortcoming yang et al 2014 developed a revised rva to explain changes in iha parameters by comparing the periodic time of the pre period and post period parameters however the modified rva may not yet explicitly describe the variance of hydrological alterations for several subjective components e g different periodic weights therefore the rva method needs to be further improved to accurately measure actual hydrological changes the yellow river the second largest river in china supports 30 of the total population and 13 of the cultivated area of china and is one of the most highly regulated basins in the world huang et al 2009 chen et al 2013 cuo et al 2013 the upper yellow river basin uyrb known as the cistern of yellow river accounts for more than 38 of the annual runoff and plays a vital role in maintaining the hydrological cycle of the entire yellow river basin wang et al 2012 cui et al 2018 at the same time this region is one of the important alpine biodiversity hotspots providing habitat for rare and endangered aquatic organisms vilmi et al 2020 since 1960 quite a few dams have been built including qingtongxia liujiaxia longyangxia etc for water supply hydropower and flood control which have caused dramatic changes in the aquatic biodiversity of rivers tian et al 2019 previous study has investigated the hydrologic conditions before and after the construction of dams in the uyrb and climatological conditions between the pre period and post period were expressed unchanged zhang et al 2018 however significant changes in temperature and precipitation in the area have been reported fu et al 2004 zhao et al 2008 hu et al 2011 therefore it is important to distinguish the effects of the dam from climate change on the flow regime and previous studies have failed to quantify changes in river regimes in detail because they ignore the impacts of climate change on the flow regimes the purpose of this study is to estimate changes in the flow regime and distinguish between attributions of flow regime changes due to dam construction and climate change to this end we developed a framework to quantify the impacts of changes in climatic conditions and river regulation on the flow regimes in which both inter and intra annual regimes were analyzed and a revised rva considering the temporal nature of hydrological indicators was proposed the uyrb was selected as a case study area the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data as well as the proposed framework used for this study section 3 provides details on the results of the flow regime alteration and the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime section 4 presents the discussion on the advantages of the framework and the potential ecological implications finally the conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data this study involves the uyrb above the lanzhou hydrometrical station fig 1 the river basin has an area of about 220 000 km2 and an altitude range of 1514 m to 6253 m the annual average precipitation is about 500 mm and the annual average temperature is 0 7 c the annual mean runoff is 316 85 108 m3 as per the records of lanzhou station from 1935 to 2014 the streamflow shows a notable seasonal variation with the main flow between may to october due to high rainfall in this period also uyrb is considered to be one of the important hotspots of alpine biodiversity the area is home to 23 fish species and 50 benthic macroinvertebrates many dams have been built in the uyrb for various purposes the largest reservoir is longyangxia with a capacity of 24 6 109 m3 which was completed in 1986 contributing to 77 of the total storage capacity of all the existing reservoirs in the uyrb previous studies have shown that the construction and operation of the longyangxia dam has significant effects on the ecological environment of the river yu et al 2010 therefore this paper focused on the impact of the longyangxia dam on the natural flow regime in the uyrb daily streamflow data from 1968 to 2004 in lanzhou station were collated the span from 1968 to 1986 before dam construction was chosen as the pre impact period and from 1987 to 2004 after dam construction was chosen as the post impact period the daily streamflow data of the same period at tangnaihai station located in the upstream of longyangxia dam was also obtained the flow measured at tangnaihai station is not affected by large dams and can represent the natural flow regime caused by climate change only also the precipitation data 1960 2004 from ten stations in the basin were collected from the china meteorological administration cma 2 2 framework for evaluating the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regimes climate change could significantly affect natural flow regime for example raised temperatures can accelerate the hydrological circulation and increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events thereby changing the average flow and increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events therefore the impact of climate change should be considered when quantifying the effects of dam construction on hydrological changes especially in alpine regions such as the qinghai tibet plateau which is sensitive to climate change to address this issue we proposed a framework for the comprehensive assessment of changes in flow regimes and separate the hydrological impacts of dam regulation and climate change it can be summarized as follows see fig 2 prepare long term daily streamflow data and identify the pre and post impact periods the time of dam construction or the breakpoint of streamflow detected by change point detection techniques can be regarded as the impact year in this study the impoundment time of the longyangxia was considered as the impact year reconstruct the flow series during the post impact period the unregulated streamflow series in the post impact period should be reconstructed in order to compare with dam regulated streamflow in this study an ann based daily streamflow extension model was adopted and the daily river discharge of tangnaihai station and ten rainfall data between the tangnaihai station and lanzhou station were used as input to the model to reconstruct the streamflow time series at lanzhou station establish hydrological metrics and assessment method to describe flow regime changes hydrological metrics should include basic characteristics and can reflect the features of the inter and intra annual regime in this study iha and eight annual flow indicators were adopted and a revised rva was proposed to integrate temporal order changes estimate the flow alteration due to climate change and dam construction differences between observed pre and post impact indicators value can be considered as the overall impacts including climate change and dam construction while differences between pre and post impact simulations value step 2 are caused solely by climate change then the effects of climate change and dam construction on the flow regime can be separated 2 2 1 the unregulated daily streamflow reconstruction method the daily streamflow data from 1987 to 2004 have been reconstructed to analyze the variation in flow regimes due to climate change distributed hydrological models are state of the art tools for simulating hydrological processes still they are not easily applicable in this kind of work because they require large amounts of data shiau and hsu 2016 proposed two algorithms in artificial neural networks anns to extend daily streamflow records compared with hydrological modelling approach this method requires less data and is easier to implement therefore we adopted feed forward back propagation ffbp algorithm of ann to simulate the unregulated streamflow ffbp consists of three layers namely the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer fig 3 detailed information on ffbp can be found in shiau and hsu 2016 or khan et al 2019 which is not described here for simplicity this study used the daily streamflow data at tangnaihai station and rainfall data from ten stations in the basin as an input layer to extend the daily streamflow record at lanzhou station the data from 1968 to 1980 and from 1981 to 1986 were used for training and validation respectively and then data from 1987 to 2004 was reconstructed the commonly used log sigmoidal transfer function was adopted to model the nonlinear relationship and the enumeration technique was applied to determine the optimum number of hidden layers neurons the performance of the ann model was evaluated statistically based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse 2 2 2 flow regime indicators 1 indicators of hydrologic alterations to characterize inter annual variability iha developed by richter et al 1996 was used in this study table 1 the method contains 33 hydrological parameters that can be divided into five groups including the magnitude of monthly flow 12 parameters extreme water conditions 12 parameters the timing of extreme water conditions 2 parameters high low pulses 4 parameters and changes in water condition 3 parameters note that since zero flow was not observed zero flow days were excluded from the analysis the iha7 software package version 7 1 supported by the nature conservancy was used to calculate the hydrological parameters 2 intra annual flow indicators to reflect the characteristics of intra annual flow regime alteration the five commonly used indicators namely non uniformity coefficient c n complete accommodation coefficient c c concentration degree c d relative variation range c r and absolute variation range c a were examined in this paper in addition the richards baker flashiness index r b index proposed by baker et al 2004 was calculated because flashiness is important in flow regime and change in flashiness can damage aquatic life meanwhile c n and r b index are used on a daily and monthly scale the formulas of those indicators are given below 1 c n 1 m t 1 m q t q 2 q 2 c c t 1 m q t q 2 q i t 0 if q t q 1 i f q t q where q t represents the monthly daily flow q represents the mean of the monthly daily flow t represents the month day m represents the number of months 12 or days 365 or 366 the high value of c n and c c means the more uneven distribution of streamflow 3 c d q xy t 1 m q t 4 q x t 1 m q t cosî t q y t 1 m q t sinî t q xy q x 2 q y 2 where q x and q y are the two resultant vectors of q t that are decomposed in the x and y directions respectively q xy represents the module of vector and θ t 2 π t 12 5 c r q max q min 6 c a q max q min where q max and q min represent the maximum and minimum annual flows respectively 7 r b index i 1 m q t q t 1 i 1 m q t overall this work used forty indices including thirty two inter annual regime indices and eight intra annual regime indices 2 2 3 comprehensive assessment of flow regime alteration 1 range of variability approach rva the rva method is used to assess the degree of alteration for flow regime indices the method divides all the pre impact data of each parameter into three categories low middle and high the degree of change of the hydrological indicator d n is defined as 8 d n n obn n exn n exn 100 where n obn and n exn represent the observed and expected frequency respectively within its rva target range i e between the 75th and 25th percentiles for the natural daily flows in the post impact period and n represents the n th hydrological indicator 2 the revised rva accounting for the alteration of frequency and time series the flow regime indicators are calculated using streamflow series so it can be considered as a kind of hydrological time series changes in the time series of hydrological indicators will degrade river ecosystems rva only considers the frequency of each hydrological indicator and ignores the equally important temporal order of these indicators which leads to an underestimation of the flow regime alteration therefore a new method that takes into account the frequency and time series of hydrological indicators was proposed the alteration of the time series of hydrological indicators can be represented as the similarity between the pre and the post impact set the higher the similarity between the two sets the lower the degree of change according to existing studies many methods can be used to calculate the similarity of two time series such as euclidean minkowskiy and jaccard however these methods consider only one aspect quantitative and binary of sequential data and cannot accurately reflect the alteration of time series todeschini et al 2007 developed a new sequential data similarity measurement method which has proven to be an effective method to identify changes in sequential data this study used this method to identify time series changes in hydrological indicators the description of the method and the revised rva are detailed in the supplementary material part the main procedure of the new method is as follows 1 divide the pre and post impact periods and then use the conventional rva to calculate the frequency alteration of each indicator between the pre and post impact periods 2 calculate the change of the time series using the similarity measurement method 3 combining frequency alteration and time series alteration to quantify the overall flow alteration oa 3 results 3 1 the performance of the ann model in simulating streamflow the unregulated daily streamflow at lanzhou station was reconstructed by ann using upstream gauging data first cross correlation coefficients between different time lags 0 10 of tangnaihai and lanzhou streamflow of the entire period were analyzed to determine the optimal temporal lags tangnaihai s 3 day time lag showed a maximum cross correlation coefficients value of 0 82 indicating a strong relationship so it was selected as an input parameter for ann therefore the three day time lag data of tangnaihai station and ten rainfall stations 11 input nodes was used to extend lanzhou s daily flow record meanwhile 13 hidden nodes of the ffbp network were selected based on trial and error procedure observed and simulated daily streamflow in lanzhou during calibration 1968 1980 and the validation period 1981 1986 are shown in fig 4 performance criteria including rmse and nse were calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the ann method during the calibration and validation periods the rmse values are 281 m3 s and 329 m3 s and nse values are 0 80 and 0 84 respectively indicating that the model performance is reasonably good this suggests that the ann model effectively captures the temporal variation of streamflow and can be used to reconstruct the streamflow in the uyrb 3 2 climate change and dam construction effects on inter annual streamflow regime the changes of each iha parameter in the pre 1968 1986 and the post impact period 1987 2004 are calculated and summarized in table 2 compared with the pre impact period a downward trend is dominant in the monthly flows in the post impact period especially from july to october ranges between 278 m3 s to 528 m3 s corresponding to relative change from 24 28 to 35 88 there is a slight increase in april 0 64 may 1 36 november 5 82 and december 1 28 as a result the month of peak discharge moves from july to may while the minimum flow moves from february to march rva analysis shows that in the past 40 years the frequency of march may august september and november has changed moderately while it has changed less in the remaining months fig 5 for time series the degree of alteration is shown in the range of 0 22 0 41 overall most monthly flow indicators show moderate changes even reaching the highest degree of alteration in may and august 0 77 and 0 8 respectively in addition as shown in table 2 the decreases in january february july september and october streamflow from 28 m3 s to 357 m3 s is mainly caused by climate change the decrease in june and august and the increase in april to may and november to december are more prominent from dam construction aspect this can be due to the fact that the longyangxia dam releases water during the dry season and stores water during the flood season which has an opposite effect on monthly flow for the extreme flow conditions the average values of the minimum and maximum streamflow show different change patterns fig 6 during the post impact period the maximum flow rates of 1 3 7 30 and 90 day dropped consistently by more than 40 this trend also applies to minimum flows of 7 30 and 90 day with a decrease of fluctuation about 10 but the minimum flows of 1 and 3 day slightly increase as a result the frequency of maximum flow changed significantly and the rva of these flows exceeded to 0 67 while the minimum flow did not show any significant change unsurprisingly the temporal order of maximum indicators shows a moderate change with values from 0 34 to 0 4 note that this phenomenon is also found in the minimum indicators the maximum flow shows a high degree of change and the minimum flow shows a moderate change considering the changes in frequency and time series at the same time climate change is the main driving force for reducing maximum and minimum flow of 7 30 and 90 day the increase of 1 3 day minimum flow may be attributed to the release of water from the dam as shown in fig 7 from 1987 to 2004 the date of julian s annual maximum shifts by 52 days and the rva tsa and oa values is 0 33 0 35 and 0 57 respectively this may be due to premature water storing by dam which is equivalent to 32 days and the climate induced change is 20 days the dates of the annual minimum tend to be slightly affected 1 day backwards while the frequency and time series change significantly with rva tsa and oa of 0 33 0 4 and 0 6 respectively both the frequency and duration of low and high pulse flows are reduced during the post impact period fig 8 this low and high pulse counts are reduced by 20 and 12 5 respectively and by 41 67 and 50 for low and high pulse duration respectively only the frequency of the low pulse duration shows a moderate degree of alteration and all parameters show a moderate degree of alteration for time series changes leading to moderate or high changes not surprisingly these parameters are strongly influenced by the construction of the longyangxia dam for instance during a low pulse duration the change caused by the dam is 4 25 the phenomenon could be explained that store or release of water can result in a reduction of high and low flow duration on the other hand climate change has caused an increase in low pulse events and high pulse count and a decrease in high pulse duration taking into account changes in water conditions a decrease of 13 to 12 for rise and fall rate respectively and an increase of 14 84 for the number of reversals are detected in terms of hydrological changes these indicators have undergone significant changes such as the rva tsa and oa of the number of reversals are 1 0 27 and 1 analyzing attributions climate change and dam construction show a similar trend but the latter contributes at a much higher extent 3 3 climate change and dam construction effects on intra annual streamflow regime table 3 and fig 9 shows the results of eight indicators that affect the intra annual variation in the uyrb between the pre and post impact periods it can be seen that except for the daily richards baker flashiness index there is a distinct decrease for the intra annual indices i e the monthly and daily non uniformity coefficients 23 57 and 26 48 respectively complete accommodation coefficient 23 73 concentration degree 27 06 relative and absolute variation range 36 40 and 22 05 respectively and monthly richards baker flashiness index 29 41 these changes indicate that the streamflow tend to be uniform throughout the year after 1987 according to the rva only a moderate degree of change in the daily richards baker flashiness index is observed the rva value is 0 56 and the relative change is small in contrast most metrics of streamflow show a moderate classification of time series changes with fluctuations of about 0 35 the overall change of intra annual indices is at a moderate level with the values of oa ranging from 0 38 to 0 58 in addition it is worth noting that in the uyrb intra annual changes of flow regime are mainly affected by climate change while the impact of dam construction is not substantial and cannot offset the changes by climate change for example the value of c n and c r are reduced by 0 1 m3 s and 411 m3 s respectively the climate induced change is 0 13 m3 s and 530 m3 s of which the changes caused by dam corresponded to 0 03 m3 s and 118 m3 s 4 discussions 4 1 impact of climate change and dam construction on flow regime the results obtained from this study show that climate change and dam construction in the uyrb have a great impact on flow regimes especially the monthly flow during the flood season july to october the maximum streamflow the julian date of annual maximum flow the duration of the flow pulse and the intra annual metrics for example as shown in table 2 compared with the pre impact period 1987 2004 the annual maximum flow has decreased by more than 40 in the post impact period 1968 1986 in parallel this study also shows that the two factors have different effects on various flow regime indices in the basin climate change has reduced the monthly flow in the dry season and annual minimum flow advanced the julian date of annual maximum flow and prolonged high pulse duration whereas the dam construction has opposite effects on those indicators this is due to the fact that the decrease in precipitation and temperature increases in the uyrb directly affect the inflow regime and the dam attempt to store water during flood season and release water to generate hydro electricity and supply water during the dry season moreover the relative magnitude of the two impacts on flow regime are also different for instance the contributions of climate change and dam construction accounted for 128 and 28 to changes in streamflow in september and 43 and 143 to 1 day annual minimum flow respectively overall it seems that the main reason for the change in flow regime in the uyrb is climate change and dams have adapted to change by changing operating rules this finding is consistent with the previous studies by tang et al 2008 cuo et al 2013 and wang et al 2018 who found that climate change is the dominant reason for the change of runoff in the uyrb 4 2 advantages of the new framework in river regime impact assessment the benefits of the framework can be summarized as follows first the framework separates the flow regime due to climate change and dam regulation the traditional approach to evaluate the impact of the dam on flow regime is by quantifying the relative changes of observed flow regime metrics between pre and post dam periods which requires fewer data and is easier to implement however the approach does not take into account the effect of climate change but instead attributes changes in the flow regime to the effects of dam operation climate changes can dramatically change hydrological regimes especially for mountain rivers in this study we demonstrated that in the uyrb the influence of climate change is greater than that of dam construction therefore to assess the impact of dams on flow regime the potential impact of climate change cannot be ignored second it combines iha and the intra annual indicators descriptions of various aspects of the streamflow are the basic steps to understand the alteration of river ecosystems iha indicators can capture most of the flow regime with less redundancy and are used to provide comprehensive statistical characteristics of flow regime changes in many basins olden and poff 2003 however iha does not account for the characteristics of the intra annual regime which is also known to affect river ecosystems in this study we found that the intra annual flow regime in the uyrb has undergone significant changes for example c n has been reduced by more than 20 since 1987 therefore the proposed framework provides a wider spectrum of metrics by combining iha and intra annual indices to depict flow regime third a revised rva was proposed which takes into account the changes in frequency and temporal order of each hydrological indicator the temporal order of indicators is significant for the ecosystem and its change can cause serious environmental degradation of rivers in this study time series similarity measures were adopted to define changes in the temporal order to verify the rationality to revise the rva we focused on the changes in three hydrological indicators namely the march streamflow 7 day minimum flow and c c according to the rva the frequency of march streamflow changed moderately 0 44 referring to fig 5 a it can be seen that due to the reduction of the rva target range between the 75th and 25th percentiles for the natural daily flows the value slips from the peak value to the low value part and returns to the peak value during the post impact period indicating that time series has changed a lot at the same time for 7 day minimum flow and c c the frequency changes observed during the post impact period are small or unchanged because the number of years declines within the rva boundary has not changed or changed very little fig 10 in fact these two parameters have also changed in the pre impact period the rva target range with 7 day minimum flow showed a clear periodicity but all target ranges occurred in the 1996 2004 after the disturbance c c was distributed at a high value exceed 75 or median value 25 75 in the pre impact period and dropped sharply to a low value below 25 during the post impact period the above analysis shows that the time series characteristics of most indicators have also changed in this study considering changes in time series the overall changes in march streamflow 7 day minimum flow and high pulse duration is 0 67 0 33 and 0 5 respectively overall 14 of the 32 ihas and 1 of the 8 intra annual metrics have a moderate degree of change by traditional rva in contrast 29 out of iha and all the intra annual metrics flow alteration have moderately changed by the revised rva this shows that the traditional rva underestimates the changes in the degree of flow regime and only considers that the frequency of hydrological parameters falls within the target range in contrast the revised rva can overcome the weakness of traditional rva and can more comprehensively evaluate the hydrological changes caused by climate change and dam construction 4 3 the potential impacts of flow regime change on alpine mountain river ecosystems changes in flow regime can lead to adverse effects on natural biota bunn and arthington 2002 poff et al 2007 based the results obtained the possible impact of hydrological changes on the ecology of uyrb can be discussed as follows the magnitude reduction and time series change of monthly flows especially in summer may lead to decrease in aquatic habitats rising water temperature and a decrease in the dissolved oxygen of water thereby accelerating the microbial breakdown of organic matter and reducing food supplies for fish and invertebrates pradhanang et al 2013 aquatic macroinvertebrates communities play a key role in the ecosystem and these species in the uyrb are particularly sensitive to sediment concentrations perry and perry 1986 robinson et al 2004 pan et al 2013 however decrease in streamflow accompanied by an increase in sediment concentration may damage macroinvertebrate communities and thereby reduce density and diversity of fish that rely on macroinvertebrate as food another major change in the flow regime is the reduction in extreme maximum discharge and the moderate alteration of time series in these parameters as a result it is expected that the hydrological connectivity between the river channels and floodplains and the exchange of nutrients and organic matter between the river ecosystems and floodplains will be significantly reduced resulting in a shortage of food supplies and seriously affecting the growth of aquatic organisms stefanidis et al 2016 in addition the existing studies report that fish in the uyrb spawn from april to august depending on the rise and peak time of the flood there is no doubt that a shift in the timing of the annual maximum flow approximately 52 days forward can disrupt fish spawning finally the change of low pulse counts duration high pulse duration and intra annual indicators can all influence aquatic organisms for instance a 50 reduction and the periodic changes in the high pulse duration may not be effective in providing nutritional subsidies it may not alleviate adverse conditions caused by low flows such as higher water temperatures or low oxygen chen 2012 as little work has been done in the uyrb the direct relationship between the effects of streamflow changes and aquatic organisms is unclear however many studies have pointed out that the river s ecosystems in the region are threatened by the indisputable fact of the change of magnitude and time series i e periodicity and trend of hydrologic indices sparks 1995 datry 2012 lin et al 2016 thus more research including the exact interaction between flow regimes and river species should be carried out in the future to understand the flow regimes ecological significance 4 4 limitations and uncertainty in this study a limitation of this study is that the influences of other human activities such as land use change irrigation water withdrawal and urbanization on flow regimes were not addressed previous analysis based on observations and modeling has indicated that land cover change altered hydrological processes and affected the flow regime of the uyrb chen and liu 2007 in qinghai province about 70 of the total water supply came from rivers and streams in addition to the longyangxia dam other dams such as qingtongxia dam and liujiaxia dam also altered the streamflow regime thus the result of this study was not able to accurately estimate the impacts of climate change and the longyangxia dam on flow regimes more analysis is required as more data become available to fully understand the effects of climate change and human actions on the flow regimes in future research in addition though the overall model performance was considered acceptable according to the evaluation metrics the ann model also had limited performance in simulating the streamflow as shown in fig 4 the simulation based on the ann model tends to underestimate the high flow and overestimate the low flow consequently some indicators such as the low and high pulse were not accurately assessed and the assessment results seemed to contain large uncertainties the input data quality the model structure and parameter values are all sources of model uncertainty at the same time the complexity of hydrological processes in the uyrb such as the sophisticated runoff sources i e precipitation and snowmelt increases the uncertainty of the model therefore the uncertainties from the ann model together with the uncertainty from multiple influencing factors post a great challenge on the precise assessment of flow regime alteration 5 conclusions this study aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of changes in the flow regimes and to separate the impacts from dam regulation and climate change a new framework was proposed and applied to the upper yellow river basin uyrb the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the proposed framework that integrates a simplified streamflow reconstruction model iha and intra annual indicators and a revised rva can be easily utilized to study the effect of climate change and dam construction on the flow regimes 2 in the upper yellow river basin this study shows that the monthly flow during the flood season july to october the maximum streamflow the duration of the flow pulse and the intra annual metrics have been severely decreased and the julian date of annual maximum flow have been advanced based on the revised rva 29 ihas and all the intra annual metrics has undergone moderate alteration 3 for the attribution of flow regime change in the upper yellow river basin climate change reduces the monthly flows extreme water conditions and intra annual regime and advances the julian date of annual maximum daily flow the dam regulation decreases the monthly flow in the flood season and annual maximum flow and increases the monthly flow in the dry season and annual minimum flow overall the flow alteration in the uyrb can be mainly attributed to climate change credit authorship

dam construction on flow regime is essential for water resources management and environmental protection however previous studies have rarely separated the effects of two factors on flow regimes and the individual impact of each remains insufficient to date moreover the existing methods have not fully captured the characteristics and temporal changes of flow regimes in this study we propose a new framework that integrates a streamflow reconstruction technique indicators of hydrologic alteration iha indicators of intra annual flow variations a revised range of variability approach to assessing the climate change and dam induced impacts on the flow regime the upper yellow river basin uyrb was selected as the study area the results show that climate change significantly reduces the monthly flow extreme water conditions and the intra annual indicators and advances the julian date of annual maximum flow dam construction delays the julian date of annual maximum flow that opposes climate change impact reduces the monthly flow in the flood season and the annual maximum flow but increases the monthly flow in the dry season and annual minimum flow changes in flow regimes in the uyrb are found to be mainly due to climate change albeit there exists a cascade of dams based on the range of variability approach rva fifteen of forty indicators are moderately changed while the number increases to thirty seven when considering the temporal order alteration of flow regime the case study demonstrates that the developed framework can serve as a useful tool to evaluate the impact of climate change and dam construction on flow regimes keywords flow regime alterations climate change dam construction upper yellow river basin impact assessment 1 introduction natural flow regime plays a vital role in maintaining river biodiversity and ecosystem integrity and services poff et al 1997 arthington et al 2006 however the flow regime of many rivers in the world have changed dramatically in the past few decades which has caused severe degradation of river ecosystems nilsson et al 2005 döll and zhang 2010 puig et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 gierszewski et al 2020 dam construction is one prevalent kind of human activities and is considered to be the most prominent factor in changing the flow regime vörösmarty et al 2010 to date more than 847 000 large and small dams have been constructed in the last century and have affected 60 of rivers in the world rosenberg et al 2000 richter and thomas 2007 lehner et al 2011 other reports indicate that by 2025 dam controlled rivers are expected to reach 70 postel 1998 in addition to dam construction climate change is another major cause of changes in flow regime kim et al 2011 ashraf et al 2016 papadaki et al 2016 also current conditions and potential climate change will modulate the impact patterns of dam regulation schneider et al 2013 therefore to ensure a holistic understanding of hydrological changes for the sustainable development and protection of rivers it is necessary to understand not only the overall changes in the flow conditions but also the separated changes caused by dams and potential climate change to date various indicators have been developed and introduced to describe different aspects of the river regime richter et al 1996 clausen and biggs 2000 vogel et al 2007 jovanovic et al 2017 one of the most robust and widely used methods is the iha which reflects the flow regime from five characteristics namely magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change to quantify the degree of change in flow regime richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva based on the iha metrics since then many studies have analyzed the flow regime alterations due to dam construction and climate change by iha and rva yang et al 2008 lee et al 2014 sellamiet al 2016 tian et al 2019 however although widely applicable this method owes several limitations first iha mainly defines the characteristics of the inter annual regimes but does not reflect the features of the intra annual regimes haghighi and kløve 2013 haghighi et al 2014 previous studies have indicated that the change of intra annual regimes can also damage the riverine ecosystems lin et al 2017 next the rva only considers the change of the hydrological parameter frequency and ignores the temporal order change of each parameter to overcome this shortcoming yang et al 2014 developed a revised rva to explain changes in iha parameters by comparing the periodic time of the pre period and post period parameters however the modified rva may not yet explicitly describe the variance of hydrological alterations for several subjective components e g different periodic weights therefore the rva method needs to be further improved to accurately measure actual hydrological changes the yellow river the second largest river in china supports 30 of the total population and 13 of the cultivated area of china and is one of the most highly regulated basins in the world huang et al 2009 chen et al 2013 cuo et al 2013 the upper yellow river basin uyrb known as the cistern of yellow river accounts for more than 38 of the annual runoff and plays a vital role in maintaining the hydrological cycle of the entire yellow river basin wang et al 2012 cui et al 2018 at the same time this region is one of the important alpine biodiversity hotspots providing habitat for rare and endangered aquatic organisms vilmi et al 2020 since 1960 quite a few dams have been built including qingtongxia liujiaxia longyangxia etc for water supply hydropower and flood control which have caused dramatic changes in the aquatic biodiversity of rivers tian et al 2019 previous study has investigated the hydrologic conditions before and after the construction of dams in the uyrb and climatological conditions between the pre period and post period were expressed unchanged zhang et al 2018 however significant changes in temperature and precipitation in the area have been reported fu et al 2004 zhao et al 2008 hu et al 2011 therefore it is important to distinguish the effects of the dam from climate change on the flow regime and previous studies have failed to quantify changes in river regimes in detail because they ignore the impacts of climate change on the flow regimes the purpose of this study is to estimate changes in the flow regime and distinguish between attributions of flow regime changes due to dam construction and climate change to this end we developed a framework to quantify the impacts of changes in climatic conditions and river regulation on the flow regimes in which both inter and intra annual regimes were analyzed and a revised rva considering the temporal nature of hydrological indicators was proposed the uyrb was selected as a case study area the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data as well as the proposed framework used for this study section 3 provides details on the results of the flow regime alteration and the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime section 4 presents the discussion on the advantages of the framework and the potential ecological implications finally the conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data this study involves the uyrb above the lanzhou hydrometrical station fig 1 the river basin has an area of about 220 000 km2 and an altitude range of 1514 m to 6253 m the annual average precipitation is about 500 mm and the annual average temperature is 0 7 c the annual mean runoff is 316 85 108 m3 as per the records of lanzhou station from 1935 to 2014 the streamflow shows a notable seasonal variation with the main flow between may to october due to high rainfall in this period also uyrb is considered to be one of the important hotspots of alpine biodiversity the area is home to 23 fish species and 50 benthic macroinvertebrates many dams have been built in the uyrb for various purposes the largest reservoir is longyangxia with a capacity of 24 6 109 m3 which was completed in 1986 contributing to 77 of the total storage capacity of all the existing reservoirs in the uyrb previous studies have shown that the construction and operation of the longyangxia dam has significant effects on the ecological environment of the river yu et al 2010 therefore this paper focused on the impact of the longyangxia dam on the natural flow regime in the uyrb daily streamflow data from 1968 to 2004 in lanzhou station were collated the span from 1968 to 1986 before dam construction was chosen as the pre impact period and from 1987 to 2004 after dam construction was chosen as the post impact period the daily streamflow data of the same period at tangnaihai station located in the upstream of longyangxia dam was also obtained the flow measured at tangnaihai station is not affected by large dams and can represent the natural flow regime caused by climate change only also the precipitation data 1960 2004 from ten stations in the basin were collected from the china meteorological administration cma 2 2 framework for evaluating the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regimes climate change could significantly affect natural flow regime for example raised temperatures can accelerate the hydrological circulation and increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events thereby changing the average flow and increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events therefore the impact of climate change should be considered when quantifying the effects of dam construction on hydrological changes especially in alpine regions such as the qinghai tibet plateau which is sensitive to climate change to address this issue we proposed a framework for the comprehensive assessment of changes in flow regimes and separate the hydrological impacts of dam regulation and climate change it can be summarized as follows see fig 2 prepare long term daily streamflow data and identify the pre and post impact periods the time of dam construction or the breakpoint of streamflow detected by change point detection techniques can be regarded as the impact year in this study the impoundment time of the longyangxia was considered as the impact year reconstruct the flow series during the post impact period the unregulated streamflow series in the post impact period should be reconstructed in order to compare with dam regulated streamflow in this study an ann based daily streamflow extension model was adopted and the daily river discharge of tangnaihai station and ten rainfall data between the tangnaihai station and lanzhou station were used as input to the model to reconstruct the streamflow time series at lanzhou station establish hydrological metrics and assessment method to describe flow regime changes hydrological metrics should include basic characteristics and can reflect the features of the inter and intra annual regime in this study iha and eight annual flow indicators were adopted and a revised rva was proposed to integrate temporal order changes estimate the flow alteration due to climate change and dam construction differences between observed pre and post impact indicators value can be considered as the overall impacts including climate change and dam construction while differences between pre and post impact simulations value step 2 are caused solely by climate change then the effects of climate change and dam construction on the flow regime can be separated 2 2 1 the unregulated daily streamflow reconstruction method the daily streamflow data from 1987 to 2004 have been reconstructed to analyze the variation in flow regimes due to climate change distributed hydrological models are state of the art tools for simulating hydrological processes still they are not easily applicable in this kind of work because they require large amounts of data shiau and hsu 2016 proposed two algorithms in artificial neural networks anns to extend daily streamflow records compared with hydrological modelling approach this method requires less data and is easier to implement therefore we adopted feed forward back propagation ffbp algorithm of ann to simulate the unregulated streamflow ffbp consists of three layers namely the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer fig 3 detailed information on ffbp can be found in shiau and hsu 2016 or khan et al 2019 which is not described here for simplicity this study used the daily streamflow data at tangnaihai station and rainfall data from ten stations in the basin as an input layer to extend the daily streamflow record at lanzhou station the data from 1968 to 1980 and from 1981 to 1986 were used for training and validation respectively and then data from 1987 to 2004 was reconstructed the commonly used log sigmoidal transfer function was adopted to model the nonlinear relationship and the enumeration technique was applied to determine the optimum number of hidden layers neurons the performance of the ann model was evaluated statistically based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse 2 2 2 flow regime indicators 1 indicators of hydrologic alterations to characterize inter annual variability iha developed by richter et al 1996 was used in this study table 1 the method contains 33 hydrological parameters that can be divided into five groups including the magnitude of monthly flow 12 parameters extreme water conditions 12 parameters the timing of extreme water conditions 2 parameters high low pulses 4 parameters and changes in water condition 3 parameters note that since zero flow was not observed zero flow days were excluded from the analysis the iha7 software package version 7 1 supported by the nature conservancy was used to calculate the hydrological parameters 2 intra annual flow indicators to reflect the characteristics of intra annual flow regime alteration the five commonly used indicators namely non uniformity coefficient c n complete accommodation coefficient c c concentration degree c d relative variation range c r and absolute variation range c a were examined in this paper in addition the richards baker flashiness index r b index proposed by baker et al 2004 was calculated because flashiness is important in flow regime and change in flashiness can damage aquatic life meanwhile c n and r b index are used on a daily and monthly scale the formulas of those indicators are given below 1 c n 1 m t 1 m q t q 2 q 2 c c t 1 m q t q 2 q i t 0 if q t q 1 i f q t q where q t represents the monthly daily flow q represents the mean of the monthly daily flow t represents the month day m represents the number of months 12 or days 365 or 366 the high value of c n and c c means the more uneven distribution of streamflow 3 c d q xy t 1 m q t 4 q x t 1 m q t cosî t q y t 1 m q t sinî t q xy q x 2 q y 2 where q x and q y are the two resultant vectors of q t that are decomposed in the x and y directions respectively q xy represents the module of vector and θ t 2 π t 12 5 c r q max q min 6 c a q max q min where q max and q min represent the maximum and minimum annual flows respectively 7 r b index i 1 m q t q t 1 i 1 m q t overall this work used forty indices including thirty two inter annual regime indices and eight intra annual regime indices 2 2 3 comprehensive assessment of flow regime alteration 1 range of variability approach rva the rva method is used to assess the degree of alteration for flow regime indices the method divides all the pre impact data of each parameter into three categories low middle and high the degree of change of the hydrological indicator d n is defined as 8 d n n obn n exn n exn 100 where n obn and n exn represent the observed and expected frequency respectively within its rva target range i e between the 75th and 25th percentiles for the natural daily flows in the post impact period and n represents the n th hydrological indicator 2 the revised rva accounting for the alteration of frequency and time series the flow regime indicators are calculated using streamflow series so it can be considered as a kind of hydrological time series changes in the time series of hydrological indicators will degrade river ecosystems rva only considers the frequency of each hydrological indicator and ignores the equally important temporal order of these indicators which leads to an underestimation of the flow regime alteration therefore a new method that takes into account the frequency and time series of hydrological indicators was proposed the alteration of the time series of hydrological indicators can be represented as the similarity between the pre and the post impact set the higher the similarity between the two sets the lower the degree of change according to existing studies many methods can be used to calculate the similarity of two time series such as euclidean minkowskiy and jaccard however these methods consider only one aspect quantitative and binary of sequential data and cannot accurately reflect the alteration of time series todeschini et al 2007 developed a new sequential data similarity measurement method which has proven to be an effective method to identify changes in sequential data this study used this method to identify time series changes in hydrological indicators the description of the method and the revised rva are detailed in the supplementary material part the main procedure of the new method is as follows 1 divide the pre and post impact periods and then use the conventional rva to calculate the frequency alteration of each indicator between the pre and post impact periods 2 calculate the change of the time series using the similarity measurement method 3 combining frequency alteration and time series alteration to quantify the overall flow alteration oa 3 results 3 1 the performance of the ann model in simulating streamflow the unregulated daily streamflow at lanzhou station was reconstructed by ann using upstream gauging data first cross correlation coefficients between different time lags 0 10 of tangnaihai and lanzhou streamflow of the entire period were analyzed to determine the optimal temporal lags tangnaihai s 3 day time lag showed a maximum cross correlation coefficients value of 0 82 indicating a strong relationship so it was selected as an input parameter for ann therefore the three day time lag data of tangnaihai station and ten rainfall stations 11 input nodes was used to extend lanzhou s daily flow record meanwhile 13 hidden nodes of the ffbp network were selected based on trial and error procedure observed and simulated daily streamflow in lanzhou during calibration 1968 1980 and the validation period 1981 1986 are shown in fig 4 performance criteria including rmse and nse were calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the ann method during the calibration and validation periods the rmse values are 281 m3 s and 329 m3 s and nse values are 0 80 and 0 84 respectively indicating that the model performance is reasonably good this suggests that the ann model effectively captures the temporal variation of streamflow and can be used to reconstruct the streamflow in the uyrb 3 2 climate change and dam construction effects on inter annual streamflow regime the changes of each iha parameter in the pre 1968 1986 and the post impact period 1987 2004 are calculated and summarized in table 2 compared with the pre impact period a downward trend is dominant in the monthly flows in the post impact period especially from july to october ranges between 278 m3 s to 528 m3 s corresponding to relative change from 24 28 to 35 88 there is a slight increase in april 0 64 may 1 36 november 5 82 and december 1 28 as a result the month of peak discharge moves from july to may while the minimum flow moves from february to march rva analysis shows that in the past 40 years the frequency of march may august september and november has changed moderately while it has changed less in the remaining months fig 5 for time series the degree of alteration is shown in the range of 0 22 0 41 overall most monthly flow indicators show moderate changes even reaching the highest degree of alteration in may and august 0 77 and 0 8 respectively in addition as shown in table 2 the decreases in january february july september and october streamflow from 28 m3 s to 357 m3 s is mainly caused by climate change the decrease in june and august and the increase in april to may and november to december are more prominent from dam construction aspect this can be due to the fact that the longyangxia dam releases water during the dry season and stores water during the flood season which has an opposite effect on monthly flow for the extreme flow conditions the average values of the minimum and maximum streamflow show different change patterns fig 6 during the post impact period the maximum flow rates of 1 3 7 30 and 90 day dropped consistently by more than 40 this trend also applies to minimum flows of 7 30 and 90 day with a decrease of fluctuation about 10 but the minimum flows of 1 and 3 day slightly increase as a result the frequency of maximum flow changed significantly and the rva of these flows exceeded to 0 67 while the minimum flow did not show any significant change unsurprisingly the temporal order of maximum indicators shows a moderate change with values from 0 34 to 0 4 note that this phenomenon is also found in the minimum indicators the maximum flow shows a high degree of change and the minimum flow shows a moderate change considering the changes in frequency and time series at the same time climate change is the main driving force for reducing maximum and minimum flow of 7 30 and 90 day the increase of 1 3 day minimum flow may be attributed to the release of water from the dam as shown in fig 7 from 1987 to 2004 the date of julian s annual maximum shifts by 52 days and the rva tsa and oa values is 0 33 0 35 and 0 57 respectively this may be due to premature water storing by dam which is equivalent to 32 days and the climate induced change is 20 days the dates of the annual minimum tend to be slightly affected 1 day backwards while the frequency and time series change significantly with rva tsa and oa of 0 33 0 4 and 0 6 respectively both the frequency and duration of low and high pulse flows are reduced during the post impact period fig 8 this low and high pulse counts are reduced by 20 and 12 5 respectively and by 41 67 and 50 for low and high pulse duration respectively only the frequency of the low pulse duration shows a moderate degree of alteration and all parameters show a moderate degree of alteration for time series changes leading to moderate or high changes not surprisingly these parameters are strongly influenced by the construction of the longyangxia dam for instance during a low pulse duration the change caused by the dam is 4 25 the phenomenon could be explained that store or release of water can result in a reduction of high and low flow duration on the other hand climate change has caused an increase in low pulse events and high pulse count and a decrease in high pulse duration taking into account changes in water conditions a decrease of 13 to 12 for rise and fall rate respectively and an increase of 14 84 for the number of reversals are detected in terms of hydrological changes these indicators have undergone significant changes such as the rva tsa and oa of the number of reversals are 1 0 27 and 1 analyzing attributions climate change and dam construction show a similar trend but the latter contributes at a much higher extent 3 3 climate change and dam construction effects on intra annual streamflow regime table 3 and fig 9 shows the results of eight indicators that affect the intra annual variation in the uyrb between the pre and post impact periods it can be seen that except for the daily richards baker flashiness index there is a distinct decrease for the intra annual indices i e the monthly and daily non uniformity coefficients 23 57 and 26 48 respectively complete accommodation coefficient 23 73 concentration degree 27 06 relative and absolute variation range 36 40 and 22 05 respectively and monthly richards baker flashiness index 29 41 these changes indicate that the streamflow tend to be uniform throughout the year after 1987 according to the rva only a moderate degree of change in the daily richards baker flashiness index is observed the rva value is 0 56 and the relative change is small in contrast most metrics of streamflow show a moderate classification of time series changes with fluctuations of about 0 35 the overall change of intra annual indices is at a moderate level with the values of oa ranging from 0 38 to 0 58 in addition it is worth noting that in the uyrb intra annual changes of flow regime are mainly affected by climate change while the impact of dam construction is not substantial and cannot offset the changes by climate change for example the value of c n and c r are reduced by 0 1 m3 s and 411 m3 s respectively the climate induced change is 0 13 m3 s and 530 m3 s of which the changes caused by dam corresponded to 0 03 m3 s and 118 m3 s 4 discussions 4 1 impact of climate change and dam construction on flow regime the results obtained from this study show that climate change and dam construction in the uyrb have a great impact on flow regimes especially the monthly flow during the flood season july to october the maximum streamflow the julian date of annual maximum flow the duration of the flow pulse and the intra annual metrics for example as shown in table 2 compared with the pre impact period 1987 2004 the annual maximum flow has decreased by more than 40 in the post impact period 1968 1986 in parallel this study also shows that the two factors have different effects on various flow regime indices in the basin climate change has reduced the monthly flow in the dry season and annual minimum flow advanced the julian date of annual maximum flow and prolonged high pulse duration whereas the dam construction has opposite effects on those indicators this is due to the fact that the decrease in precipitation and temperature increases in the uyrb directly affect the inflow regime and the dam attempt to store water during flood season and release water to generate hydro electricity and supply water during the dry season moreover the relative magnitude of the two impacts on flow regime are also different for instance the contributions of climate change and dam construction accounted for 128 and 28 to changes in streamflow in september and 43 and 143 to 1 day annual minimum flow respectively overall it seems that the main reason for the change in flow regime in the uyrb is climate change and dams have adapted to change by changing operating rules this finding is consistent with the previous studies by tang et al 2008 cuo et al 2013 and wang et al 2018 who found that climate change is the dominant reason for the change of runoff in the uyrb 4 2 advantages of the new framework in river regime impact assessment the benefits of the framework can be summarized as follows first the framework separates the flow regime due to climate change and dam regulation the traditional approach to evaluate the impact of the dam on flow regime is by quantifying the relative changes of observed flow regime metrics between pre and post dam periods which requires fewer data and is easier to implement however the approach does not take into account the effect of climate change but instead attributes changes in the flow regime to the effects of dam operation climate changes can dramatically change hydrological regimes especially for mountain rivers in this study we demonstrated that in the uyrb the influence of climate change is greater than that of dam construction therefore to assess the impact of dams on flow regime the potential impact of climate change cannot be ignored second it combines iha and the intra annual indicators descriptions of various aspects of the streamflow are the basic steps to understand the alteration of river ecosystems iha indicators can capture most of the flow regime with less redundancy and are used to provide comprehensive statistical characteristics of flow regime changes in many basins olden and poff 2003 however iha does not account for the characteristics of the intra annual regime which is also known to affect river ecosystems in this study we found that the intra annual flow regime in the uyrb has undergone significant changes for example c n has been reduced by more than 20 since 1987 therefore the proposed framework provides a wider spectrum of metrics by combining iha and intra annual indices to depict flow regime third a revised rva was proposed which takes into account the changes in frequency and temporal order of each hydrological indicator the temporal order of indicators is significant for the ecosystem and its change can cause serious environmental degradation of rivers in this study time series similarity measures were adopted to define changes in the temporal order to verify the rationality to revise the rva we focused on the changes in three hydrological indicators namely the march streamflow 7 day minimum flow and c c according to the rva the frequency of march streamflow changed moderately 0 44 referring to fig 5 a it can be seen that due to the reduction of the rva target range between the 75th and 25th percentiles for the natural daily flows the value slips from the peak value to the low value part and returns to the peak value during the post impact period indicating that time series has changed a lot at the same time for 7 day minimum flow and c c the frequency changes observed during the post impact period are small or unchanged because the number of years declines within the rva boundary has not changed or changed very little fig 10 in fact these two parameters have also changed in the pre impact period the rva target range with 7 day minimum flow showed a clear periodicity but all target ranges occurred in the 1996 2004 after the disturbance c c was distributed at a high value exceed 75 or median value 25 75 in the pre impact period and dropped sharply to a low value below 25 during the post impact period the above analysis shows that the time series characteristics of most indicators have also changed in this study considering changes in time series the overall changes in march streamflow 7 day minimum flow and high pulse duration is 0 67 0 33 and 0 5 respectively overall 14 of the 32 ihas and 1 of the 8 intra annual metrics have a moderate degree of change by traditional rva in contrast 29 out of iha and all the intra annual metrics flow alteration have moderately changed by the revised rva this shows that the traditional rva underestimates the changes in the degree of flow regime and only considers that the frequency of hydrological parameters falls within the target range in contrast the revised rva can overcome the weakness of traditional rva and can more comprehensively evaluate the hydrological changes caused by climate change and dam construction 4 3 the potential impacts of flow regime change on alpine mountain river ecosystems changes in flow regime can lead to adverse effects on natural biota bunn and arthington 2002 poff et al 2007 based the results obtained the possible impact of hydrological changes on the ecology of uyrb can be discussed as follows the magnitude reduction and time series change of monthly flows especially in summer may lead to decrease in aquatic habitats rising water temperature and a decrease in the dissolved oxygen of water thereby accelerating the microbial breakdown of organic matter and reducing food supplies for fish and invertebrates pradhanang et al 2013 aquatic macroinvertebrates communities play a key role in the ecosystem and these species in the uyrb are particularly sensitive to sediment concentrations perry and perry 1986 robinson et al 2004 pan et al 2013 however decrease in streamflow accompanied by an increase in sediment concentration may damage macroinvertebrate communities and thereby reduce density and diversity of fish that rely on macroinvertebrate as food another major change in the flow regime is the reduction in extreme maximum discharge and the moderate alteration of time series in these parameters as a result it is expected that the hydrological connectivity between the river channels and floodplains and the exchange of nutrients and organic matter between the river ecosystems and floodplains will be significantly reduced resulting in a shortage of food supplies and seriously affecting the growth of aquatic organisms stefanidis et al 2016 in addition the existing studies report that fish in the uyrb spawn from april to august depending on the rise and peak time of the flood there is no doubt that a shift in the timing of the annual maximum flow approximately 52 days forward can disrupt fish spawning finally the change of low pulse counts duration high pulse duration and intra annual indicators can all influence aquatic organisms for instance a 50 reduction and the periodic changes in the high pulse duration may not be effective in providing nutritional subsidies it may not alleviate adverse conditions caused by low flows such as higher water temperatures or low oxygen chen 2012 as little work has been done in the uyrb the direct relationship between the effects of streamflow changes and aquatic organisms is unclear however many studies have pointed out that the river s ecosystems in the region are threatened by the indisputable fact of the change of magnitude and time series i e periodicity and trend of hydrologic indices sparks 1995 datry 2012 lin et al 2016 thus more research including the exact interaction between flow regimes and river species should be carried out in the future to understand the flow regimes ecological significance 4 4 limitations and uncertainty in this study a limitation of this study is that the influences of other human activities such as land use change irrigation water withdrawal and urbanization on flow regimes were not addressed previous analysis based on observations and modeling has indicated that land cover change altered hydrological processes and affected the flow regime of the uyrb chen and liu 2007 in qinghai province about 70 of the total water supply came from rivers and streams in addition to the longyangxia dam other dams such as qingtongxia dam and liujiaxia dam also altered the streamflow regime thus the result of this study was not able to accurately estimate the impacts of climate change and the longyangxia dam on flow regimes more analysis is required as more data become available to fully understand the effects of climate change and human actions on the flow regimes in future research in addition though the overall model performance was considered acceptable according to the evaluation metrics the ann model also had limited performance in simulating the streamflow as shown in fig 4 the simulation based on the ann model tends to underestimate the high flow and overestimate the low flow consequently some indicators such as the low and high pulse were not accurately assessed and the assessment results seemed to contain large uncertainties the input data quality the model structure and parameter values are all sources of model uncertainty at the same time the complexity of hydrological processes in the uyrb such as the sophisticated runoff sources i e precipitation and snowmelt increases the uncertainty of the model therefore the uncertainties from the ann model together with the uncertainty from multiple influencing factors post a great challenge on the precise assessment of flow regime alteration 5 conclusions this study aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of changes in the flow regimes and to separate the impacts from dam regulation and climate change a new framework was proposed and applied to the upper yellow river basin uyrb the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the proposed framework that integrates a simplified streamflow reconstruction model iha and intra annual indicators and a revised rva can be easily utilized to study the effect of climate change and dam construction on the flow regimes 2 in the upper yellow river basin this study shows that the monthly flow during the flood season july to october the maximum streamflow the duration of the flow pulse and the intra annual metrics have been severely decreased and the julian date of annual maximum flow have been advanced based on the revised rva 29 ihas and all the intra annual metrics has undergone moderate alteration 3 for the attribution of flow regime change in the upper yellow river basin climate change reduces the monthly flows extreme water conditions and intra annual regime and advances the julian date of annual maximum daily flow the dam regulation decreases the monthly flow in the flood season and annual maximum flow and increases the monthly flow in the dry season and annual minimum flow overall the flow alteration in the uyrb can be mainly attributed to climate change credit authorship

contemporary challenge here we explore the process of channel infilling and the evolution of tidal characteristics after significant dredging activities in the shenzhen river szr based on field observed data in order to reveal feedback mechanisms between tidal dynamic and morphology the results found that the szr experienced rapid sediment accretion on interannual and seasonal scales since the channel was remarkably deepened before 2008 in a very short timeframe the excavated part of channel was almost filled in 2012 and after that the szr performed switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season indicating a dynamic equilibrium state was obtained the tidal skewness of three primary combinations of tidal constituents m2 m4 m2 s2 ms4 and k1 o1 m2 was calculated from the tidal level of 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 at szhk river mouth and lh upstream stations during the period of 1998 and 2012 the total tidal skewness significantly rose by 109 25 and 31 26 at szhk and lh respectively while it remained roughly constant from 2012 to 2016 which is concurrent well with the temporal variation of channel deposition similarly tidal range amplification between lh and szhk trlh trszhk decreased by 9 0 from 1998 and 2012 while much less decline rate was found after 2012 indicating that the tidal attenuation was probably induced by the channel infilling furthermore the impact of tidal characteristics evolution on suspended sediment transport was discussed eventually unraveling the feedback mechanism between morphology tidal regime sediment transport and trapping in the heavily trained szr keywords morphological change tidal asymmetry sediment trapping river trainings 1 introduction tidal rivers are a vital nexus between fluvial and estuarine systems hoitink and jay 2016 which hosted by delta plain where tides and freshwater discharge interact the interplay between riverine and marine physical forcings is highly intertwined with morphology modification implying deltas are potentially fragile systems zhang et al 2018b in general fluvial and wave dominated estuary systems are relatively unstable while tidal dominated ones have the potential to stabilize estuarine morphology since the reciprocating tidal propagation contributes to balancing sediment import and export hoitink et al 2017 however interferences triggered by climate change and human activities probably impact the morphodynamic trajectory leading the original configuration to be in a state of transition and ultimately to a new equilibrium state bolla pittaluga et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 therefore understanding feedback mechanisms especially the nonlinear interactions between hydrodynamics sediment advection and morphology are essential in assessing evolution pattern in a tidal dominated system man induced interventions especially substantive channel deepening worldwide for shipping can destabilize the equilibrium state of tidal river system in a direct way familkhalili and talke 2016 he et al 2019 winterwerp and wang 2013 proposed a positive feedback between suspended sediment concentration effective hydraulic drag and tidal deformation mostly induced by dredging operations in the loire and the ems river channel deepening sets in motion a process in which flood dominant condition is more prevailing fine sediments are consecutively pumped upstream and brings the tidal river into a hyper turbid regime winterwerp 2011 the hydraulic drag thus becomes increasingly lower which in turn favors tidal deformation and pumping effect similarly a dynamic link between tidal amplification turbidity maximum zone and bottom roughness is also presented in the garonne tidal river jalón rojas et al 2018 due to river discharge decline and gravel extraction the tidal range and asymmetry direction in the garonne obviously enhance which likely favors the intensification of turbidity and its upstream shifts this in turn contributes to lower bottom roughness and therefore stronger tidal pumping notwithstanding these recent advances there is still progress to be made in understanding the nonlinear interactions and feedbacks between different terrestrial and marine processes in tidal rivers zhang et al 2018b a key challenge is to explain the morphological evolution of tidal river after the implement of dredging activities and its interaction with tidal dynamics cai et al 2012 it has been well documented that positive feedback between tidal prism and sediment import contributes to the hyper turbid state after river trainings van maren et al 2015 which inevitably promotes sediment trapping and channel accretion ralston and geyer 2017 2019 the channel resilience and its morphodynamic responses can eventually drive the tidal river system toward a new configuration on decadal to centennial timescales or in a very short timeframe bolla pittaluga et al 2015 we believe that the identification and quantification of complex feedbacks between channel morphology hydrodynamics and sediment transport is critical in order to understand the fate of tidal rivers and even deltas after heavily anthropogenic interferences yet very little work has been done in this regard and without a systematic approach the general objective of this work is to unravel the interannual and seasonal feedback between channel morphology and tidal dynamics coupling with sediment transport and intra annual variation of hydrology in the shenzhen river szr the shenzhen estuary and its tributaries on the border between hong kong special administrative region sar and shenzhen special economic zone are indeed a clear example of a heavily trained tidal river with multiple pressures interplaying huang et al 2012 during the last two decades intensive regulation projects align widen and deepen have been launched for flood prevention water environment enhancement and navigation improvement chan and lee 2010 model simulations have illustrated that river trainings mainly dredging activities lead to about 50 tidal current decrease correspondingly tidal regime shifts from a damped tidal oscillation to a more standing wave with less amplitude damping chan and lee 2010 it remains a challenging task to assess the formation mechanism of sediment deposition zhang and mao 2015 and feedback between morphology and estuarine hydrodynamics additionally substantive hydrographic and bathymetry surveys have been regularly conducted since the 1990s thereby offering excellent opportunity for exploring the morphodynamic response of a tidal dominated system to intensive river trainings the specific aim of this work is to detect how river training can reverberate across the entire tidal river system and whether there is relation between tidal characteristic evolution sediment transport and morphological changes firstly we will detect the process of channel infilling on interannual and seasonal scales based on the analysis of continuous pre flood and post flood bathymetry surveys furthermore the tidal regime shifts i e the tidal amplification tidal distortion and asymmetry direction are evaluated and its implication on the balance of sediment import and export is then discussed which in turn is highly intertwined with morphological process this provides further insight into prospective morphological configuration relating with equilibrium state of tidal river system which is critical for future river restoration and management projects 2 study area the szr is an urbanized tidal river located at the southern china its mainstream as the border of shenzhen and hong kong sar connects to the pearl river estuary via the shenzhen bay szb the catchment covers a drainage area of 312 5 km2 60 area in shenzhen and hosts several main tributaries such as futian buji and shawan river fig 1 nowadays the szr brings a daily discharge about 4 m3 s while occasional floods can reach more than 100 m3 s during the wet season tides at the mouth are irregular semidiurnal with a mean tidal range about 1 4 m zhang and mao 2015 as the tidal wave propagates upstream from szhk to lh the tidal amplitude is amplified with shorter flood duration further upstream the tidal dynamic significantly damps due to overwhelming frictional effects the limit of tidal influence near pyhk is about 13 5 km extending from the river mouth table 1 since the rapidly economic development in the past several decades the process of drastic industrialization and urbanization in shenzhen substantially transforms the agricultural area into urbanized area ng et al 2011 indicating much less riverine soil erosion however the semi enclosed szb hosts extensive tidal flats in the inner bay which introduces sufficient sediment source for river deposition the median sizes of suspended sediment and surficial sediment are 8 μm and 10 μm respectively both of which are characterized by cohesive silt and clay in the estuarine region the szr was shallow and meandering before 1995 and it was only capable of conveying a flood of 2 5 years return periods therefore urban area usually suffered significant flood hazard triggered by heavy rainstorms chan and lee 2010 for the purpose of flood prevention a series of river trainings mainly including dredging activities have been implemented since 1995 the regulation projects which was divided into three stages downstream the pyhk fig 1 table 2 significantly deepened the channel to the design bed level about 4 5 m the trained river is designed to meet the demand of flood prevention standard of 50 year return period zhang and mao 2015 unexpectedly remarkable sediment accretion emerged after the regulation project additional dredging activities were conducted in 2004 and 2006 2007 with about 0 42 and 0 49 million m3 sediment excavated respectively the river trainings have successfully prevented the city from flood disasters without overflowing of the banks in the last two decades 3 field observed data and methods 3 1 data source observational data were collected from long term monitoring stations maintained by the municipal shenzhen river regulation office of shenzhen msrro including hydrological surveys and bathymetry surveys summary of survey data are displayed in table 3 hydrological surveys were mostly performed from 2006 monthly precipitation runoff and suspended sediment concentration ssc were obtained at bjh and pyhk gauging stations both of which were situated upstream the tidal limit moreover hourly tidal level and ssc were recorded from szhk river mouth and lh upstream stations the tidal level was measured with a pressure type automatic water level recorder the ssc recorded by the turbidity sensors were deployed about 0 5 m below water surface due to technical restrictions which was calibrated by water samples collected during spring and neap tides every month considering the data availability and the process of channel infilling tidal level time series were selected at 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 after the completion of stage 3 regulation project in 2006 and dredging activities in 2007 continuous bathymetry measurements were collected in the mainstream of szr including scattered bathymetric data and cross sectional bathymetric profiles the sampling spacing is about 5 10 m for the scattered data measurement in the transection bathymetry survey the bed level elevation was recorded in fixed transects 100 m apart with 5 10 m sampling spacing at each transect bathymetry surveys were implemented twice a year before and after the wet season mostly in april and october respectively additionally bed level elevation was collected in 2002 in the downstream and midstream reaches which is the most recent year in bathymetry surveys 3 2 analysis procedure 3 2 1 trend analysis the trends of hydrological variables derived from upstream stations pyhk and bjh can illustrate the changing riverine sediment and fluvial impacts on tidal dynamics therefore the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was applied here to identify the potential tendency in hydrological time series in combination with sen s approach sen 1968 for the estimation of magnitudes the nonparametric mk test is capable of detecting trends without assuming any special form for lost data and is more powerful than other similar trend tests yue et al 2002 which has been commonly applied in trend analysis in previous studies for further information about the method the reader is referred to hirsch et al 1982 3 2 2 tidal analysis the amplification of tidal range tr and tidal asymmetry were selected to characterize the tidal dynamics in this work the tidal amplification trlh trszhk was calculated as the ratio of the tidal range at lh trlh upper part of estuary and trszhk the tidal range at the river mouth the parameter of tidal amplification identifies the evolution of tidal propagation intrinsic to the tidal river but not of ocean origin jalón rojas et al 2018 considering that the tidal regime at the szr are characterized by irregular semi diurnal character in range and time both semi diurnal and diurnal constituents play a key role on the overall tidal asymmetry therefore the tidal skewness is employed to quantify tidal asymmetry instead of the amplitude ratio and relative phase friedrichs and aubrey 1988 since it can consider different combinations of tidal constituents the tidal skewness captures the amplitude and phase information of tidal constituents in one metric nidzieko 2010 song et al 2011 the skewness created by combination of two or three constituents is defined as 1 γ 2 3 4 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 ω 2 sin 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 3 2 for pairs or 2 γ 2 3 2 a 1 ω 1 a 2 ω 2 a 3 ω 3 sin ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 3 2 for triads where a and φ is the tidal amplitude and phase respectively and ω is the frequency of tidal constituent the contribution to total tidal skewness by different pairs or triad combinations of tidal constituents is defined as 3 β 2 γ 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for pairs and 4 β 3 γ 3 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for triplets the total tidal skewness γ n is defined as 5 γ n β 2 β 3 generally the falling tide duration is longer than the rising tide for γ n 0 and the rising tide is longer for γ n 0 due to the nonstationarity of tidal signal ns tide is applied to calculate the amplitude and phase of tidal constituents which can deal with the nonlinear interaction between tide and river flow matte et al 2014 in this work 1 year tidal signal of 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 was analyzed in order to remove the sub annual impact of changes in channel geometries zhang et al 2018a detail information about the ns tide won t be introduced here readers can refer to matte et al 2013 4 results 4 1 temporal variations of sediment volume although the regulation projects of stage 1 2 finished in 1999 additional dredging activities in downstream and midstream channel were found in 2004 and 2007 moreover the regulation project of stage 3 upstream was completed in 2006 then its bathymetry surveys were carried out given barely anthropogenic interferences after 2007 and the data availability the temporal variations of sediment volume above the design bed level were analyzed from 2007 to 2017 in order to detect the morphological processes fig 2 as the result of intensive river trainings the szr experienced significant channel infilling after 2007 fig 2 all the three reaches performed consecutive siltation from february 2008 to march 2012 both the sediment volumes of lower and middle reaches increased by 0 38 million m3 accounting for 30 of the whole sediment volume above the design bed level although the sediment deposited in upstream reach also amounted 0 37 million m3 it suffered much more remarkable accretion intensity owning to narrower channel since the channel was dredged to the design bed level by the regulation project of stage 3 in 2006 the sediment volume of upstream reach increased by more than 150 from 2008 to 2012 fig 2a actually significant sediment accumulation also occurred in the downstream and midstream reaches before 2007 the sediment volumes are only 0 99 and 1 17 million m3 in the downstream and midstream reaches in june 2002 respectively during the period of 2012 to 2017 the morphological processes experienced slightly intra annual fluctuation but no trend in annual sediment volume variations indicating that the channel switched from successive accumulation to an equilibrium state after 2012 based on the consecutive bathymetry surveys at pre flood and post flood season after 2007 the seasonal variability of sediment volume was calculated in fig 3 both wet and dry seasons from 2008 to 2012 performed significant channel deposition fig 3a the sediment accumulation in downstream reach at dry season is about 2 fold compared to wet season which reveals stronger sediment trapping ability at dry season for lower channel for the midstream and upstream reaches similar magnitude of channel deposition emerged at both wet and dry seasons with about 4 0 104 m3 sediment volume increment at average after 2012 the sediment volume displayed increasing trend at dry season while it obviously experienced erosion during the wet season in the lower and middle channel fig 3b the morphological process switched between erosion and accumulation at different seasons implying episodic sediment trapping and flushing however the upstream reach was subjected to slight deposition at wet season which was primarily induced by the river borne sediment 4 2 profile evolution profile evolution illustrates the bed level change of the szr in greater details fig 4 between 2002 and 2007 the siltation zone primarily concentrated in the lower segment where the regulation project of stage 2 locates the bed level persistently elevated from 2007 to 2012 with a total deposition exceeding 0 5 m for the downstream and midstream reaches the upstream reach however was subjected to much more intensive channel infilling since the regulation project of stage 3 shortly finished in 2006 the thalweg elevation in 2007 close to the longitudinal profile of design bed level significantly increased by about 2 5 m leading the channel thread to be shallower and flatter fig 4b during the period of 2012 2017 the longitudinal profile of lower and middle segment presents moderate oscillations while the bed level of upper segment maintains a relatively equilibrium state with barely net sediment volume variation three cross sections in lower middle and upper segments located at 3 km 6 km and 11 km from river mouth respectively were selected fig 5 the layout of these sections was presented in fig 4 with the red lines notable and continuous sedimentation occurred at the right bank in cross section 1 cs1 from 2002 to 2012 with the average elevations of the river bed increasing by about 1 m the left bank in the shenzhen however experienced little sediment accumulation during 2012 and 2016 the bed level was generally maintained indicating the formation of a relatively stable v shape cross section which probably associated with the curvature of tidal river similarly cs2 also displayed relatively stable v shape section after 2012 as sediment accretion in the left bank in the period 2007 2012 shoal area was widened and extended with more than 0 5 m bed level elevated at average cs3 located at 11 km from the river mouth was subjected to significant channel infilling from 2007 to 2012 the whole section vertically elevated about 2 m with about 40 cm y sedimentation rate after 2012 the depositing trend almost disappeared due to the dynamic equilibrium of upper reach 4 3 channel hydrology hydrological series mostly between 2006 and 2017 including monthly precipitation discharge and ssc at pyhk and bjh in non tidal reach were analyzed to explore the fluvial regime results of trend analysis based on mann kendall and sen s slope estimator statistical tests were displayed in table 4 precipitation as the most representative hydrological signal of climate factors showed no significant temporal variations for the 95 confidence level at both pyhk and bjh during the study period precipitation pattern was thus considered stable in the szr basin actually for the whole pearl river delta zhang et al 2009 reported that precipitation barely changed after 1951 based on long term time series from more than 40 rain gauge stations furthermore a downward trend by 0 28 m3 s in river flow was detected at bjh at the 1 significance level while the discharge time series in pyhk showed significant positive trend with slight increment of 0 062 m3 s per year which is possibly an outcome of distinct land use practices relating with surface runoff generation in different sub basins ng et al 2011 since the trend analysis of the two tributaries of the szr seems to be contradictory and their changing magnitudes are low the river flow during the study period thus can be concluded relatively steady considering the stable precipitation pattern and the most completion of urbanization abrupt changes in river flow also shouldn t be expected in the near future for the ssc time series during the study period significantly decreasing trends with 0 0074 kg m3 and 0 022 kg m3 per year were explored at pyhk and bjh respectively which is accordant with the results of zhang and mao 2015 table 4 zhang and mao 2015 indicated a decreasing trend by 5 38 103 kg m3 year in ssc time series ranging from 1998 to 2009 at pyhk additionally the annual suspended sediment load at pyhk and bjh sharply decreased from above 0 1 mt to less than 0 04 mt fig 6 due to the uneven intra annual distribution of discharge large proportion of sediment was delivered at wet season which also suffered drastic decline sediment load at dry season generally less than 0 01 mt maintains low level with no obvious trend detected during the study period in the past several decades shenzhen has experienced rapid urbanization from 1998 to 2008 urban built up area in shenzhen substantially increased from 22 71 km2 to 140 10 km2 correspondingly cultivation land was occupied which was expected to result in the decline of soil loss and sediment yields zhang and huang 2015 4 4 tidal dynamics to advance our understanding of tidal properties in response to morphology the tidal range amplification trlh trszhk and tidal asymmetry at the szhk and lh stations are explored at 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 only a 1 year tidal series was applied to remove the impacts of interannual morphological evolution the year 1998 was selected because the regulation project of stage 1 2 was just finished with minimum deposited sediment and is the most earlies year counting with tidal level data at the szr furthermore in order to isolate the influence of morphology contributions due to river flow were eliminated by filtering out large possible discharge values the temporal variations of tidal range amplification and tidal skewness are calculated for a narrow range of streamflow 1 m3 s q 5 m3 s at pyhk which is representative of all study years actually the occurrence probability of daily streamflow in the selected range accounts for more than 90 percentage according to the historical discharge record at pyhk the median tidal range at szhk trszhk close to the river mouth was amplified by a factor of 1 13 in 1998 fig 7 while the amplification factor stepwise decreased by 5 89 and 3 25 during the period of 1998 2007 and 2007 2012 respectively table 5 then between 2012 and 2016 tidal range was barely amplified from szhk to lh with the amplification factor approximately equal to 1 fig 7 the tidal skewness of three primary combinations of tidal constituents m2 m4 m2 s2 ms4 and k1 o1 m2 are employed to detect the tidal asymmetry in the szr the total tidal skewness has a positive value at both szhk and lh indicating a shorter duration of the rising tide than the falling tide the tidal skewness varies over the szr with lower values in the downstream channel szhk and larger values upstream lh probably due to the enhanced impact of bottom friction and streamflow fig 8 the total tidal skewness experienced a progressive increase between 1998 and 2012 the values significantly rose by 109 25 and 31 26 at szhk and lh respectively table 5 during the period of 2012 2016 the total tidal skewness remained roughly constant the interaction between m2 and m4 contributing most to the tidal skewness also followed similar trend over the investigated years which displayed stepwise increase in the course of 1998 2007 and 2007 2012 the k1 o1 m2 triad with a negative value are characterized by ebb dominance consecutive decrease in tidal skewness of k1 o1 m2 occurred during the study period indicating that the ebb dominant tidal asymmetry was undermined additionally the m2 s2 ms4 asymmetry plays a tertiary role in contributing to the total tidal skewness which generally showed similar trend with the m2 m4 pairs in flood dominant regime fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 impact of channel resilience on the tidal dynamics morphological changes of tidal river often lead to the modification of hydrodynamic tidal regimes including the amplification damping and asymmetry of tidal wave jalón rojas et al 2018 due to the highly economic development in estuarine regions anthropogenic intervention has been a dominant agent in controlling estuary morphology such as dredging activities for improving and maintaining the ships navigability reclamations for shoreline management and land demand wang et al 2015 active widening and deepening of tidal river channels especially in the lower reaches generally result in intensifying the tidal pumping de jonge et al 2014 van rijn et al 2018 winterwerp 2011 land reclamation by suppressing intertidal zones however has most likely led to an attenuation of the actual tidal patterns picado et al 2010 the previous study has revealed that the szr was suffered progressive channel infilling before 2012 while equilibrium state was achieved with seasonal sediment trapping and flushing after 2012 tidal dynamics characterized by tidal range amplification and vertical tidal asymmetry seem to evolve temporally with the influence of morphology modifications in the szr due to significant channel widening and deepening with the implement of dredging activities in the early study period the tidal pumping effect has the potential to be intensified along with tidal range amplification and flood dominant tidal asymmetry ralston et al 2019 as the consecutive channel infilling after 1998 tides were thus expected to be more distorted especially during the period of 2007 2012 the tidal skewness at szhk and lh significantly increased by 88 42 and 23 98 respectively fig 8 table 5 the sharp increase in tidal skewness was concurrent well with the process of sediment volume increase after 2012 the szr experienced relatively steady tidal regime in response to barely net annual sediment accretion figs 2 and 8 therefore the tidal dynamics modification can be primarily attributed to the impact of channel infilling existence of shallow river probably reinforces the bottom friction then improves the energy dissipation and accelerates tidal attenuation along the szr gong et al 2016 guo et al 2016 just like tidal asymmetry the tidal range amplification was subjected to similar changing pattern induced by the morphological changes of the szr fig 7 as a consequence of the navigation and flood release demand dredging activities are launched in numerous tidal rivers worldwide dijkstra et al 2019 ralston and geyer 2019 which can generally exert significant impacts on the tidal regime for example gravel extraction in the gironde estuary amplified tidal range and asymmetry direction by up to 17 and 10 respectively concurrent with natural morphological changes between 1956 and 1994 indicating an intensification of flood dominant condition with time jalón rojas et al 2018 since large scale dredging and sand mining emerged in the pearl river delta the tidal duration asymmetry has exhibited a decrease of the positive tendency in the past decades zhang et al 2018a in the ems estuary due to continuous channel deepening the flood dominance in terms of 2 ϕ m 2 ϕ m 4 increases by up to 18 in upstream reach from 1980 to 2005 with drastic tidal amplification chernetsky et al 2010 van maren et al 2015 such a quantitative analysis on the tidal pattern modification pre and post dredging activities is not possible in the szr due to the scarcity of tidal signal data before the implement of regulation projects the reduction of intertidal flats triggered by channelization contributes to the promotion of flood dominance in tidal rivers due to the lack of intertidal storage and the lag effects of tidal drainage caused by friction pritchard and green 2017 the channel infilling in the szr with the progradation of intertidal flats in turn causes the tidal attenuation generally the effects of fluvial flow also play a dominant role on tidal pattern fluvial flow attenuates tidal energy improves tidal distortion thus creating low and high frequency harmonics decaying tidal amplitude and altering tidal duration cai et al 2014 godin 1985 guo et al 2015 jalón rojas et al 2018 jalón rojas et al 2018 encompassed the effects of morphology and hydrology on the evolution of tidal propagation according to in site measurement the impacts of streamflow on tidal damping was quantified and distinguished from the geomorphologic modifications furthermore for a fluvial dominated system like the gironde river the decreasing river flow is responsible for enhancing the tidal range and asymmetry direction nevertheless the tidal dominated szr with stable and low fluvial flow is occasionally subjected to high discharge episodes during the wet season which has been filtered out to eliminate the influence of river flow on the tidal pattern therefore the river flow can be regarded as a marginal effect in the szr apart from the river tide interaction the alteration of tidal dynamics in the szr is also sensitive to the hydrodynamic and geometrical configuration of the szb which is a semi enclosed embayment connecting the szr and open water in the past several decades the szb has suffered from intensive anthropogenic interferences especially before 2007 large scale land reclamation was conducted in the middle part which is highly linked to tidal regime variations moreover a cascade of oyster farming was built for aquaculture purpose at the hong kong side which has the potential to facilitate flow dissipation and sediment settling sally et al 2018 to advance our knowledge of the relative role of the szb the tidal asymmetry at ljz station located at the bay mouth fig 1 were explored it is roughly representative of the asymmetry of astronomical tides driven by the morphological changes of the szb rather than the progradation process of the szr which can be incorporated to detect the influence of the szb the tidal skewness at ljz moderately decreased from 0 04 to 0 06 between 2007 and 2012 indicating the ebb dominant tides slightly became more asymmetric considering the obvious tidal skewness increase in the szr during the period of 2007 2012 the szb seems to exert minor impacts on the tidal regime of the szr since much fewer human activities were found with barely additional land reclamation after 2007 nevertheless the impacts of the szb on the tidal asymmetry can t be ignored before 2007 when tremendous reclamation projects were implemented to cater for demand of land and highly economic development unfortunately the year 2007 is the most earlies year counting with tidal level data at the ljz so quantifying the tidal signal variations at the bay mouth before 2007 is unavailable due to the scarcity of data bay area narrowing and tidal flat loss with land reclaimed is generally conductive to ebb dominant tidal asymmetry as the disappearance of mudflats facilitates flood duration friedrichs and aubrey 1988 he et al 2019 which can be a key indicator of variable tidal dynamics in the szr this should be incorporated with the process of channel infilling for further investigation 5 2 implication of estuarine hydrodynamics change in tidally energetic systems the intensification of tidal amplification and asymmetry driven by channel dredging generally favor the upstream net transport of fine sediment increasing import of marine sediment in turn has the potential to lower the hydraulic drag as the result of the deepening and topping off of riverbed and the decreasing intratidal area with hydrophyte burchard et al 2018 winterwerp and wang 2013 which further intensify the tidal pumping associated with sediment transport up estuary jalón rojas et al 2018 the tidal river therefore shifts from a relatively low concentration regime to hyper turbid one indicating an alternative steady state winterwerp 2011 due to active deepening of tidal channel for navigation purpose the ssc in the lower reaches of ems river increased an average of 2 to 3 fold during the period of 1954 2005 in response to internal tidal asymmetry and flocculation process asymmetry triggered by remarkable asymmetry in velocity the larger peak flood velocity with longer duration of high water slack contributes to net landward sediment transport and settling wu et al 2018 this flood dominated asymmetry yields an efficient mechanism in importing large amounts of fine sediment and expelling turbidity maximum zone up river de jonge et al 2014 another highly modified estuary the hudson river estuary presents similar regime change after channel dredging as the tidal amplitude has more than doubled in the upper reaches in conjunction with the decline of friction effect the hydrodynamic regime shifts from hyposynchronous tide decaying to hypersynchronous tide amplifying ralston et al 2019 which probably strengthens sediment import and trapping efficiency chant et al 2011 increased sediment imports and trapping efficiency inevitably lead to the enhancement of sediment accumulation in the dredged tidal river burchard et al 2018 although the timescale necessary for this deposition process can be long years to decades ralston and geyer 2017 we have demonstrated that the szr experiences progressive channel infilling after the regulation project thereby undermining the tidal amplification and the flood duration correspondingly decreased tidal pumping effect then might reduce the landward suspended sediment transport in order to verify this hypothesis the annual variations of ssc are calculated during the flood and ebb periods in fig 9 the comparison of ssc between the flood and ebb tide implies the net sediment transport relating with channel accretion and erosion since the import and export of tidal volume is nearly equivalent considering the negligible fluvial discharge at most time before 2012 the ssc during the flood tide was obviously higher than the ebb at both szhk and lh implicating net sediment transport up river which is well in line with the result of channel infilling between 2008 and 2012 fig 2 with sustained sediment accretion in conjunction with the attenuation of tidal pumping effect figs 7 and 8 the ssc difference between the flood and ebb almost disappeared after 2012 the transport regime of fine sediment even shifts from import to export due to higher ebb tide ssc after 2014 in szhk fig 9a additionally the ssc substantially lowered after 2012 while the tidal river system was characterized by more hyper turbid in the early phase which was primarily attributed to the intensification of tidal dissipation and was also potentially associated with the decline of fluvial sediment fig 6 furthermore the upstream ssc in lh was roughly higher than that in the mouth region szhk in the process of channel infilling however sscs between lower and upper reaches presented barely difference after 2012 since the ssc in lh suffered larger decrement 5 3 implication of episodic sediment trapping and flushing having related the process of channel infilling with tidal dynamic alteration in conjunction with annual residual suspended sediment transport pattern in the upfront section now we focus on the implication of morphological changes on a seasonal scale we recall that the morphological process of the middle and lower reaches of szr performs switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season after 2012 fig 3 maintaining a relatively dynamic equilibrium state the episodic sediment trapping and flushing probably associates with the intra annual variation of hydrodynamic regime as a result of the uneven allocation of fluvial discharge at different seasons pritchard and green 2017 river flow generally enhances tidal distortion then attenuates the flood dominated asymmetry which steers the sediment import and export relating with bed level alteration in a tidal energy system based on observational tidal signal in the north sea gräwe et al 2014 documented that the upslope transport of suspended sediment is highly associated with the seasonality of m2 and m4 tidal components since the tidal pumping term mostly affected by the phase relation of m2 and m4 is the dominating term in residual sediment transport becherer et al 2016 in the szr although the fluvial discharge is nearly negligible compared with the tidal prism there still exists a significantly uneven intra annual distribution of river flow the average discharge at wet season is about 0 13 billion m3 far overweighting the dry season less than 0 08 billion m3 such an intra annual distribution in streamflow generally introduces the seasonal variation in tidal propagation in a tidal river providing a conceivable hint for alternate channel erosion and accretion at wet and dry seasons hoitink et al 2017 hence the tidal skewness and tidal amplification are calculated at different seasons at szhk and lh according to the consecutively measured water level from 2012 to 2016 fig 10 it is clear that the tidal skewness at wet season is significantly larger than the dry season the tidal skewness at szhk and lh is 0 11 and 0 23 during the dry season respectively tides become more asymmetric at wet season the tidal skewness is amplified by factors of about 2 and more than 3 at lh and szhk respectively indicating an obvious variation in tidal asymmetry along the river upper reach with stronger fluvial impact induces more pronounced tidal decay additionally high water discharge undermines the tidal propagation so lowers the tidal amplification lh szhk similar seasonal variability of tidal amplification has only been previously mentioned in gionde and guadalquivir river jalón rojas et al 2018 interpreted the tidal wave amplification with seasonal variation of bottom roughness in gironde river since alternate presence of mud could affect the effective hydraulic drag as well as the tidal range during high and low water periods wang et al 2014 documented a similar seasonal variability of tidal range amplification in the guadalquivir river while it increased with the suspended sediment concentration introduced by high river flows contrary to the guadalquivir the seasonality of tidal dominated regime in the szr is closely intertwined with the marine sediment transport considering sufficient sediment source from large tidal flat of the szb zhang and mao 2015 the flood dominated asymmetry with larger tidal amplification at dry season should be responsible for sediment import which accounts for the sediment trapping and deposition at the lower and middle reaches nevertheless the enhancement of fluvial flow at wet season hampers the landward sediment transport then lowers the marine sediment import in comparison with the dry season high discharges especially the presence of episodic flood events contribute to the expelling of mobile mud jalón rojas et al 2015 most of which is probably imported during the latest dry season the trapping and expelling of seasonal mobile mud driven by intra annual variation of hydrodynamics thus accounts for the alternate channel erosion and accretion from 2012 to 2016 with barely anthropogenic interferences during this period the continuous process of progradation and degradation in a roughly equivalent magnitude provides an interesting hint of equilibrium state in tidal river system 5 4 feedback mechanisms in a tidal river system in summary as the implement of regulation projects for the purpose of flood prevention the mainstream of the szr is significantly dredged enhancing not only the tidal prism but also the residual sediment import the upstream sediment transport in the flood tide induced by stronger tidal pumping effect is obviously larger than the sediment export during the ebb period indicating pronounced sediment trapping and silting after the river training fig 9 the tidal river is thus subjected to consecutively deposited which in turn leads the tidal amplification to be undermined correspondingly the gap of sediment concentration between the flood and ebb tide is mostly bridged and therefore the tidal river attains a relatively equilibrium state on an interannual scale however on a seasonal scale the morphological process in the lower and middle reaches of the szr exhibits switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season as a result of the intra annual variation of tidal amplification and tidal asymmetry induced by the uneven allocation of fluvial discharge the sediment import during low flows generally balances the sediment export during high flow over a seasonal cycle which proves the feedback between the morphology and hydrodynamics such a seasonal offset in sediment import and export after 2012 indicates the szr achieves a near dynamic morphological equilibrium generally tidal deltas are fragile systems whose morphology can be readily altered by diverse natural and anthropogenic process which disrupts the morphological equilibrium over a long enough time span and even induces permanent morphological changes hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 however the szr performs rapid channel resilience after intensive and frequent river trainings our preliminary analysis involving tidal regime alteration in conjunction with sediment advection has revealed significant channel infilling the channel evolves towards a near equilibrium morphology in 2012 after dredging activities in a part of middle reach and regulation projects in the upper reach respectively implemented in 2006 and 2007 which implicates pronounced channel resilience within about 5 years feedback mechanisms in this work are particularly crucial for conducting river management strategy in the future intensive river trainings should be ruled out since it causes a sediment sink although the riverine sediment is subjected to remarkable decline due to urbanization and soil conservation fig 6 sufficient sediment source from the bay area is readily imported in a tidal dominated system zhang and mao 2015 which rapidly mitigates the magnitude of sediment starvation further river trainings are thus expected to suffer significant sediment progradation despite the szr has attained a dynamic morphological equilibrium the entire system has the potential to shift toward a new configuration at the decadal timescale zhang et al 2018b on one hand although the annual discharges at bjh and pyhk displayed contradictory trend with small magnitudes in discharge variations table 4 the accumulative effect can directly modulate the tidal range and asymmetry direction from the long term perspective more research and monitoring in discharge are thus needed in the szr on the other hand given that the mean sea level is projected to increase as in other estuaries worldwide kirwan and megonigal 2013 lovelock et al 2015 the capacity of sediment export is potentially reduced since sea level rise undermines the peak current asymmetry and slack water asymmetry guo et al 2018 the intensification of flood dominance driven by sea level rise can modify the sediment balance in tidal river systems and consequently alter morphology indicating a new feedback mechanism which can determine whether the szr and estuarine system will keep pace or drown in the near future passeri et al 2015 6 conclusions this study has unraveled possible feedback mechanisms between morphology tidal dynamic and residual sediment transport after drastic dredging activities in the tidal river system of the szr the channel deepening generally enhances not only tidal pumping effect but also upstream sediment transport the in site measurement of ssc shows that the suspended sediment transport during the flood tide is obviously larger than the ebb tide indicating sediment import and trapping after the implement of river trainings which accounts for the continuous sediment accretion from 2008 to 2012 the process of channel infilling in turn stepwise modified the tidal amplification and the tidal skewness leading to the gap between sediment import and export to be bridged the tidal river was therefore achieved a near equilibrium state after 2012 with barely bathymetry variations on an interannual scale however on a seasonal scale the middle and lower reaches experience switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season tidal motion modified by the uneven intra annual allocation of fluvial flow plays a dominant role on stabilizing the morphology of the tidal river system as the sediment expelling during high flows mostly balances the sediment import during low flows although the fluvial sediment load is subjected to significant decreasing trend large scale tidal flat in the bay area readily provides sufficient fine sediment source once sediment starvation emerges in the szr feedback between channel resilience tidal dynamic and sediment transport promotes the tidal river system to evolve towards an equilibrium state in a short timeframe implying that intensive river trainings should be ruled out in the further river management strategy even so given the impact of accumulative river flow variation and sea level rise the entire system has the potential to shift toward a new configuration in the future credit authorship contribution statement yao wu conceptualization methodology writing original draft

5211,tidal rivers are a complex fluvial estuarine nexus where intensively anthropogenic interferences emerge understanding the morphodynamic response to river training in tidal river systems is a contemporary challenge here we explore the process of channel infilling and the evolution of tidal characteristics after significant dredging activities in the shenzhen river szr based on field observed data in order to reveal feedback mechanisms between tidal dynamic and morphology the results found that the szr experienced rapid sediment accretion on interannual and seasonal scales since the channel was remarkably deepened before 2008 in a very short timeframe the excavated part of channel was almost filled in 2012 and after that the szr performed switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season indicating a dynamic equilibrium state was obtained the tidal skewness of three primary combinations of tidal constituents m2 m4 m2 s2 ms4 and k1 o1 m2 was calculated from the tidal level of 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 at szhk river mouth and lh upstream stations during the period of 1998 and 2012 the total tidal skewness significantly rose by 109 25 and 31 26 at szhk and lh respectively while it remained roughly constant from 2012 to 2016 which is concurrent well with the temporal variation of channel deposition similarly tidal range amplification between lh and szhk trlh trszhk decreased by 9 0 from 1998 and 2012 while much less decline rate was found after 2012 indicating that the tidal attenuation was probably induced by the channel infilling furthermore the impact of tidal characteristics evolution on suspended sediment transport was discussed eventually unraveling the feedback mechanism between morphology tidal regime sediment transport and trapping in the heavily trained szr keywords morphological change tidal asymmetry sediment trapping river trainings 1 introduction tidal rivers are a vital nexus between fluvial and estuarine systems hoitink and jay 2016 which hosted by delta plain where tides and freshwater discharge interact the interplay between riverine and marine physical forcings is highly intertwined with morphology modification implying deltas are potentially fragile systems zhang et al 2018b in general fluvial and wave dominated estuary systems are relatively unstable while tidal dominated ones have the potential to stabilize estuarine morphology since the reciprocating tidal propagation contributes to balancing sediment import and export hoitink et al 2017 however interferences triggered by climate change and human activities probably impact the morphodynamic trajectory leading the original configuration to be in a state of transition and ultimately to a new equilibrium state bolla pittaluga et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 therefore understanding feedback mechanisms especially the nonlinear interactions between hydrodynamics sediment advection and morphology are essential in assessing evolution pattern in a tidal dominated system man induced interventions especially substantive channel deepening worldwide for shipping can destabilize the equilibrium state of tidal river system in a direct way familkhalili and talke 2016 he et al 2019 winterwerp and wang 2013 proposed a positive feedback between suspended sediment concentration effective hydraulic drag and tidal deformation mostly induced by dredging operations in the loire and the ems river channel deepening sets in motion a process in which flood dominant condition is more prevailing fine sediments are consecutively pumped upstream and brings the tidal river into a hyper turbid regime winterwerp 2011 the hydraulic drag thus becomes increasingly lower which in turn favors tidal deformation and pumping effect similarly a dynamic link between tidal amplification turbidity maximum zone and bottom roughness is also presented in the garonne tidal river jalón rojas et al 2018 due to river discharge decline and gravel extraction the tidal range and asymmetry direction in the garonne obviously enhance which likely favors the intensification of turbidity and its upstream shifts this in turn contributes to lower bottom roughness and therefore stronger tidal pumping notwithstanding these recent advances there is still progress to be made in understanding the nonlinear interactions and feedbacks between different terrestrial and marine processes in tidal rivers zhang et al 2018b a key challenge is to explain the morphological evolution of tidal river after the implement of dredging activities and its interaction with tidal dynamics cai et al 2012 it has been well documented that positive feedback between tidal prism and sediment import contributes to the hyper turbid state after river trainings van maren et al 2015 which inevitably promotes sediment trapping and channel accretion ralston and geyer 2017 2019 the channel resilience and its morphodynamic responses can eventually drive the tidal river system toward a new configuration on decadal to centennial timescales or in a very short timeframe bolla pittaluga et al 2015 we believe that the identification and quantification of complex feedbacks between channel morphology hydrodynamics and sediment transport is critical in order to understand the fate of tidal rivers and even deltas after heavily anthropogenic interferences yet very little work has been done in this regard and without a systematic approach the general objective of this work is to unravel the interannual and seasonal feedback between channel morphology and tidal dynamics coupling with sediment transport and intra annual variation of hydrology in the shenzhen river szr the shenzhen estuary and its tributaries on the border between hong kong special administrative region sar and shenzhen special economic zone are indeed a clear example of a heavily trained tidal river with multiple pressures interplaying huang et al 2012 during the last two decades intensive regulation projects align widen and deepen have been launched for flood prevention water environment enhancement and navigation improvement chan and lee 2010 model simulations have illustrated that river trainings mainly dredging activities lead to about 50 tidal current decrease correspondingly tidal regime shifts from a damped tidal oscillation to a more standing wave with less amplitude damping chan and lee 2010 it remains a challenging task to assess the formation mechanism of sediment deposition zhang and mao 2015 and feedback between morphology and estuarine hydrodynamics additionally substantive hydrographic and bathymetry surveys have been regularly conducted since the 1990s thereby offering excellent opportunity for exploring the morphodynamic response of a tidal dominated system to intensive river trainings the specific aim of this work is to detect how river training can reverberate across the entire tidal river system and whether there is relation between tidal characteristic evolution sediment transport and morphological changes firstly we will detect the process of channel infilling on interannual and seasonal scales based on the analysis of continuous pre flood and post flood bathymetry surveys furthermore the tidal regime shifts i e the tidal amplification tidal distortion and asymmetry direction are evaluated and its implication on the balance of sediment import and export is then discussed which in turn is highly intertwined with morphological process this provides further insight into prospective morphological configuration relating with equilibrium state of tidal river system which is critical for future river restoration and management projects 2 study area the szr is an urbanized tidal river located at the southern china its mainstream as the border of shenzhen and hong kong sar connects to the pearl river estuary via the shenzhen bay szb the catchment covers a drainage area of 312 5 km2 60 area in shenzhen and hosts several main tributaries such as futian buji and shawan river fig 1 nowadays the szr brings a daily discharge about 4 m3 s while occasional floods can reach more than 100 m3 s during the wet season tides at the mouth are irregular semidiurnal with a mean tidal range about 1 4 m zhang and mao 2015 as the tidal wave propagates upstream from szhk to lh the tidal amplitude is amplified with shorter flood duration further upstream the tidal dynamic significantly damps due to overwhelming frictional effects the limit of tidal influence near pyhk is about 13 5 km extending from the river mouth table 1 since the rapidly economic development in the past several decades the process of drastic industrialization and urbanization in shenzhen substantially transforms the agricultural area into urbanized area ng et al 2011 indicating much less riverine soil erosion however the semi enclosed szb hosts extensive tidal flats in the inner bay which introduces sufficient sediment source for river deposition the median sizes of suspended sediment and surficial sediment are 8 μm and 10 μm respectively both of which are characterized by cohesive silt and clay in the estuarine region the szr was shallow and meandering before 1995 and it was only capable of conveying a flood of 2 5 years return periods therefore urban area usually suffered significant flood hazard triggered by heavy rainstorms chan and lee 2010 for the purpose of flood prevention a series of river trainings mainly including dredging activities have been implemented since 1995 the regulation projects which was divided into three stages downstream the pyhk fig 1 table 2 significantly deepened the channel to the design bed level about 4 5 m the trained river is designed to meet the demand of flood prevention standard of 50 year return period zhang and mao 2015 unexpectedly remarkable sediment accretion emerged after the regulation project additional dredging activities were conducted in 2004 and 2006 2007 with about 0 42 and 0 49 million m3 sediment excavated respectively the river trainings have successfully prevented the city from flood disasters without overflowing of the banks in the last two decades 3 field observed data and methods 3 1 data source observational data were collected from long term monitoring stations maintained by the municipal shenzhen river regulation office of shenzhen msrro including hydrological surveys and bathymetry surveys summary of survey data are displayed in table 3 hydrological surveys were mostly performed from 2006 monthly precipitation runoff and suspended sediment concentration ssc were obtained at bjh and pyhk gauging stations both of which were situated upstream the tidal limit moreover hourly tidal level and ssc were recorded from szhk river mouth and lh upstream stations the tidal level was measured with a pressure type automatic water level recorder the ssc recorded by the turbidity sensors were deployed about 0 5 m below water surface due to technical restrictions which was calibrated by water samples collected during spring and neap tides every month considering the data availability and the process of channel infilling tidal level time series were selected at 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 after the completion of stage 3 regulation project in 2006 and dredging activities in 2007 continuous bathymetry measurements were collected in the mainstream of szr including scattered bathymetric data and cross sectional bathymetric profiles the sampling spacing is about 5 10 m for the scattered data measurement in the transection bathymetry survey the bed level elevation was recorded in fixed transects 100 m apart with 5 10 m sampling spacing at each transect bathymetry surveys were implemented twice a year before and after the wet season mostly in april and october respectively additionally bed level elevation was collected in 2002 in the downstream and midstream reaches which is the most recent year in bathymetry surveys 3 2 analysis procedure 3 2 1 trend analysis the trends of hydrological variables derived from upstream stations pyhk and bjh can illustrate the changing riverine sediment and fluvial impacts on tidal dynamics therefore the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was applied here to identify the potential tendency in hydrological time series in combination with sen s approach sen 1968 for the estimation of magnitudes the nonparametric mk test is capable of detecting trends without assuming any special form for lost data and is more powerful than other similar trend tests yue et al 2002 which has been commonly applied in trend analysis in previous studies for further information about the method the reader is referred to hirsch et al 1982 3 2 2 tidal analysis the amplification of tidal range tr and tidal asymmetry were selected to characterize the tidal dynamics in this work the tidal amplification trlh trszhk was calculated as the ratio of the tidal range at lh trlh upper part of estuary and trszhk the tidal range at the river mouth the parameter of tidal amplification identifies the evolution of tidal propagation intrinsic to the tidal river but not of ocean origin jalón rojas et al 2018 considering that the tidal regime at the szr are characterized by irregular semi diurnal character in range and time both semi diurnal and diurnal constituents play a key role on the overall tidal asymmetry therefore the tidal skewness is employed to quantify tidal asymmetry instead of the amplitude ratio and relative phase friedrichs and aubrey 1988 since it can consider different combinations of tidal constituents the tidal skewness captures the amplitude and phase information of tidal constituents in one metric nidzieko 2010 song et al 2011 the skewness created by combination of two or three constituents is defined as 1 γ 2 3 4 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 ω 2 sin 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 3 2 for pairs or 2 γ 2 3 2 a 1 ω 1 a 2 ω 2 a 3 ω 3 sin ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 3 2 for triads where a and φ is the tidal amplitude and phase respectively and ω is the frequency of tidal constituent the contribution to total tidal skewness by different pairs or triad combinations of tidal constituents is defined as 3 β 2 γ 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for pairs and 4 β 3 γ 3 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for triplets the total tidal skewness γ n is defined as 5 γ n β 2 β 3 generally the falling tide duration is longer than the rising tide for γ n 0 and the rising tide is longer for γ n 0 due to the nonstationarity of tidal signal ns tide is applied to calculate the amplitude and phase of tidal constituents which can deal with the nonlinear interaction between tide and river flow matte et al 2014 in this work 1 year tidal signal of 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 was analyzed in order to remove the sub annual impact of changes in channel geometries zhang et al 2018a detail information about the ns tide won t be introduced here readers can refer to matte et al 2013 4 results 4 1 temporal variations of sediment volume although the regulation projects of stage 1 2 finished in 1999 additional dredging activities in downstream and midstream channel were found in 2004 and 2007 moreover the regulation project of stage 3 upstream was completed in 2006 then its bathymetry surveys were carried out given barely anthropogenic interferences after 2007 and the data availability the temporal variations of sediment volume above the design bed level were analyzed from 2007 to 2017 in order to detect the morphological processes fig 2 as the result of intensive river trainings the szr experienced significant channel infilling after 2007 fig 2 all the three reaches performed consecutive siltation from february 2008 to march 2012 both the sediment volumes of lower and middle reaches increased by 0 38 million m3 accounting for 30 of the whole sediment volume above the design bed level although the sediment deposited in upstream reach also amounted 0 37 million m3 it suffered much more remarkable accretion intensity owning to narrower channel since the channel was dredged to the design bed level by the regulation project of stage 3 in 2006 the sediment volume of upstream reach increased by more than 150 from 2008 to 2012 fig 2a actually significant sediment accumulation also occurred in the downstream and midstream reaches before 2007 the sediment volumes are only 0 99 and 1 17 million m3 in the downstream and midstream reaches in june 2002 respectively during the period of 2012 to 2017 the morphological processes experienced slightly intra annual fluctuation but no trend in annual sediment volume variations indicating that the channel switched from successive accumulation to an equilibrium state after 2012 based on the consecutive bathymetry surveys at pre flood and post flood season after 2007 the seasonal variability of sediment volume was calculated in fig 3 both wet and dry seasons from 2008 to 2012 performed significant channel deposition fig 3a the sediment accumulation in downstream reach at dry season is about 2 fold compared to wet season which reveals stronger sediment trapping ability at dry season for lower channel for the midstream and upstream reaches similar magnitude of channel deposition emerged at both wet and dry seasons with about 4 0 104 m3 sediment volume increment at average after 2012 the sediment volume displayed increasing trend at dry season while it obviously experienced erosion during the wet season in the lower and middle channel fig 3b the morphological process switched between erosion and accumulation at different seasons implying episodic sediment trapping and flushing however the upstream reach was subjected to slight deposition at wet season which was primarily induced by the river borne sediment 4 2 profile evolution profile evolution illustrates the bed level change of the szr in greater details fig 4 between 2002 and 2007 the siltation zone primarily concentrated in the lower segment where the regulation project of stage 2 locates the bed level persistently elevated from 2007 to 2012 with a total deposition exceeding 0 5 m for the downstream and midstream reaches the upstream reach however was subjected to much more intensive channel infilling since the regulation project of stage 3 shortly finished in 2006 the thalweg elevation in 2007 close to the longitudinal profile of design bed level significantly increased by about 2 5 m leading the channel thread to be shallower and flatter fig 4b during the period of 2012 2017 the longitudinal profile of lower and middle segment presents moderate oscillations while the bed level of upper segment maintains a relatively equilibrium state with barely net sediment volume variation three cross sections in lower middle and upper segments located at 3 km 6 km and 11 km from river mouth respectively were selected fig 5 the layout of these sections was presented in fig 4 with the red lines notable and continuous sedimentation occurred at the right bank in cross section 1 cs1 from 2002 to 2012 with the average elevations of the river bed increasing by about 1 m the left bank in the shenzhen however experienced little sediment accumulation during 2012 and 2016 the bed level was generally maintained indicating the formation of a relatively stable v shape cross section which probably associated with the curvature of tidal river similarly cs2 also displayed relatively stable v shape section after 2012 as sediment accretion in the left bank in the period 2007 2012 shoal area was widened and extended with more than 0 5 m bed level elevated at average cs3 located at 11 km from the river mouth was subjected to significant channel infilling from 2007 to 2012 the whole section vertically elevated about 2 m with about 40 cm y sedimentation rate after 2012 the depositing trend almost disappeared due to the dynamic equilibrium of upper reach 4 3 channel hydrology hydrological series mostly between 2006 and 2017 including monthly precipitation discharge and ssc at pyhk and bjh in non tidal reach were analyzed to explore the fluvial regime results of trend analysis based on mann kendall and sen s slope estimator statistical tests were displayed in table 4 precipitation as the most representative hydrological signal of climate factors showed no significant temporal variations for the 95 confidence level at both pyhk and bjh during the study period precipitation pattern was thus considered stable in the szr basin actually for the whole pearl river delta zhang et al 2009 reported that precipitation barely changed after 1951 based on long term time series from more than 40 rain gauge stations furthermore a downward trend by 0 28 m3 s in river flow was detected at bjh at the 1 significance level while the discharge time series in pyhk showed significant positive trend with slight increment of 0 062 m3 s per year which is possibly an outcome of distinct land use practices relating with surface runoff generation in different sub basins ng et al 2011 since the trend analysis of the two tributaries of the szr seems to be contradictory and their changing magnitudes are low the river flow during the study period thus can be concluded relatively steady considering the stable precipitation pattern and the most completion of urbanization abrupt changes in river flow also shouldn t be expected in the near future for the ssc time series during the study period significantly decreasing trends with 0 0074 kg m3 and 0 022 kg m3 per year were explored at pyhk and bjh respectively which is accordant with the results of zhang and mao 2015 table 4 zhang and mao 2015 indicated a decreasing trend by 5 38 103 kg m3 year in ssc time series ranging from 1998 to 2009 at pyhk additionally the annual suspended sediment load at pyhk and bjh sharply decreased from above 0 1 mt to less than 0 04 mt fig 6 due to the uneven intra annual distribution of discharge large proportion of sediment was delivered at wet season which also suffered drastic decline sediment load at dry season generally less than 0 01 mt maintains low level with no obvious trend detected during the study period in the past several decades shenzhen has experienced rapid urbanization from 1998 to 2008 urban built up area in shenzhen substantially increased from 22 71 km2 to 140 10 km2 correspondingly cultivation land was occupied which was expected to result in the decline of soil loss and sediment yields zhang and huang 2015 4 4 tidal dynamics to advance our understanding of tidal properties in response to morphology the tidal range amplification trlh trszhk and tidal asymmetry at the szhk and lh stations are explored at 1998 2007 2012 and 2016 only a 1 year tidal series was applied to remove the impacts of interannual morphological evolution the year 1998 was selected because the regulation project of stage 1 2 was just finished with minimum deposited sediment and is the most earlies year counting with tidal level data at the szr furthermore in order to isolate the influence of morphology contributions due to river flow were eliminated by filtering out large possible discharge values the temporal variations of tidal range amplification and tidal skewness are calculated for a narrow range of streamflow 1 m3 s q 5 m3 s at pyhk which is representative of all study years actually the occurrence probability of daily streamflow in the selected range accounts for more than 90 percentage according to the historical discharge record at pyhk the median tidal range at szhk trszhk close to the river mouth was amplified by a factor of 1 13 in 1998 fig 7 while the amplification factor stepwise decreased by 5 89 and 3 25 during the period of 1998 2007 and 2007 2012 respectively table 5 then between 2012 and 2016 tidal range was barely amplified from szhk to lh with the amplification factor approximately equal to 1 fig 7 the tidal skewness of three primary combinations of tidal constituents m2 m4 m2 s2 ms4 and k1 o1 m2 are employed to detect the tidal asymmetry in the szr the total tidal skewness has a positive value at both szhk and lh indicating a shorter duration of the rising tide than the falling tide the tidal skewness varies over the szr with lower values in the downstream channel szhk and larger values upstream lh probably due to the enhanced impact of bottom friction and streamflow fig 8 the total tidal skewness experienced a progressive increase between 1998 and 2012 the values significantly rose by 109 25 and 31 26 at szhk and lh respectively table 5 during the period of 2012 2016 the total tidal skewness remained roughly constant the interaction between m2 and m4 contributing most to the tidal skewness also followed similar trend over the investigated years which displayed stepwise increase in the course of 1998 2007 and 2007 2012 the k1 o1 m2 triad with a negative value are characterized by ebb dominance consecutive decrease in tidal skewness of k1 o1 m2 occurred during the study period indicating that the ebb dominant tidal asymmetry was undermined additionally the m2 s2 ms4 asymmetry plays a tertiary role in contributing to the total tidal skewness which generally showed similar trend with the m2 m4 pairs in flood dominant regime fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 impact of channel resilience on the tidal dynamics morphological changes of tidal river often lead to the modification of hydrodynamic tidal regimes including the amplification damping and asymmetry of tidal wave jalón rojas et al 2018 due to the highly economic development in estuarine regions anthropogenic intervention has been a dominant agent in controlling estuary morphology such as dredging activities for improving and maintaining the ships navigability reclamations for shoreline management and land demand wang et al 2015 active widening and deepening of tidal river channels especially in the lower reaches generally result in intensifying the tidal pumping de jonge et al 2014 van rijn et al 2018 winterwerp 2011 land reclamation by suppressing intertidal zones however has most likely led to an attenuation of the actual tidal patterns picado et al 2010 the previous study has revealed that the szr was suffered progressive channel infilling before 2012 while equilibrium state was achieved with seasonal sediment trapping and flushing after 2012 tidal dynamics characterized by tidal range amplification and vertical tidal asymmetry seem to evolve temporally with the influence of morphology modifications in the szr due to significant channel widening and deepening with the implement of dredging activities in the early study period the tidal pumping effect has the potential to be intensified along with tidal range amplification and flood dominant tidal asymmetry ralston et al 2019 as the consecutive channel infilling after 1998 tides were thus expected to be more distorted especially during the period of 2007 2012 the tidal skewness at szhk and lh significantly increased by 88 42 and 23 98 respectively fig 8 table 5 the sharp increase in tidal skewness was concurrent well with the process of sediment volume increase after 2012 the szr experienced relatively steady tidal regime in response to barely net annual sediment accretion figs 2 and 8 therefore the tidal dynamics modification can be primarily attributed to the impact of channel infilling existence of shallow river probably reinforces the bottom friction then improves the energy dissipation and accelerates tidal attenuation along the szr gong et al 2016 guo et al 2016 just like tidal asymmetry the tidal range amplification was subjected to similar changing pattern induced by the morphological changes of the szr fig 7 as a consequence of the navigation and flood release demand dredging activities are launched in numerous tidal rivers worldwide dijkstra et al 2019 ralston and geyer 2019 which can generally exert significant impacts on the tidal regime for example gravel extraction in the gironde estuary amplified tidal range and asymmetry direction by up to 17 and 10 respectively concurrent with natural morphological changes between 1956 and 1994 indicating an intensification of flood dominant condition with time jalón rojas et al 2018 since large scale dredging and sand mining emerged in the pearl river delta the tidal duration asymmetry has exhibited a decrease of the positive tendency in the past decades zhang et al 2018a in the ems estuary due to continuous channel deepening the flood dominance in terms of 2 ϕ m 2 ϕ m 4 increases by up to 18 in upstream reach from 1980 to 2005 with drastic tidal amplification chernetsky et al 2010 van maren et al 2015 such a quantitative analysis on the tidal pattern modification pre and post dredging activities is not possible in the szr due to the scarcity of tidal signal data before the implement of regulation projects the reduction of intertidal flats triggered by channelization contributes to the promotion of flood dominance in tidal rivers due to the lack of intertidal storage and the lag effects of tidal drainage caused by friction pritchard and green 2017 the channel infilling in the szr with the progradation of intertidal flats in turn causes the tidal attenuation generally the effects of fluvial flow also play a dominant role on tidal pattern fluvial flow attenuates tidal energy improves tidal distortion thus creating low and high frequency harmonics decaying tidal amplitude and altering tidal duration cai et al 2014 godin 1985 guo et al 2015 jalón rojas et al 2018 jalón rojas et al 2018 encompassed the effects of morphology and hydrology on the evolution of tidal propagation according to in site measurement the impacts of streamflow on tidal damping was quantified and distinguished from the geomorphologic modifications furthermore for a fluvial dominated system like the gironde river the decreasing river flow is responsible for enhancing the tidal range and asymmetry direction nevertheless the tidal dominated szr with stable and low fluvial flow is occasionally subjected to high discharge episodes during the wet season which has been filtered out to eliminate the influence of river flow on the tidal pattern therefore the river flow can be regarded as a marginal effect in the szr apart from the river tide interaction the alteration of tidal dynamics in the szr is also sensitive to the hydrodynamic and geometrical configuration of the szb which is a semi enclosed embayment connecting the szr and open water in the past several decades the szb has suffered from intensive anthropogenic interferences especially before 2007 large scale land reclamation was conducted in the middle part which is highly linked to tidal regime variations moreover a cascade of oyster farming was built for aquaculture purpose at the hong kong side which has the potential to facilitate flow dissipation and sediment settling sally et al 2018 to advance our knowledge of the relative role of the szb the tidal asymmetry at ljz station located at the bay mouth fig 1 were explored it is roughly representative of the asymmetry of astronomical tides driven by the morphological changes of the szb rather than the progradation process of the szr which can be incorporated to detect the influence of the szb the tidal skewness at ljz moderately decreased from 0 04 to 0 06 between 2007 and 2012 indicating the ebb dominant tides slightly became more asymmetric considering the obvious tidal skewness increase in the szr during the period of 2007 2012 the szb seems to exert minor impacts on the tidal regime of the szr since much fewer human activities were found with barely additional land reclamation after 2007 nevertheless the impacts of the szb on the tidal asymmetry can t be ignored before 2007 when tremendous reclamation projects were implemented to cater for demand of land and highly economic development unfortunately the year 2007 is the most earlies year counting with tidal level data at the ljz so quantifying the tidal signal variations at the bay mouth before 2007 is unavailable due to the scarcity of data bay area narrowing and tidal flat loss with land reclaimed is generally conductive to ebb dominant tidal asymmetry as the disappearance of mudflats facilitates flood duration friedrichs and aubrey 1988 he et al 2019 which can be a key indicator of variable tidal dynamics in the szr this should be incorporated with the process of channel infilling for further investigation 5 2 implication of estuarine hydrodynamics change in tidally energetic systems the intensification of tidal amplification and asymmetry driven by channel dredging generally favor the upstream net transport of fine sediment increasing import of marine sediment in turn has the potential to lower the hydraulic drag as the result of the deepening and topping off of riverbed and the decreasing intratidal area with hydrophyte burchard et al 2018 winterwerp and wang 2013 which further intensify the tidal pumping associated with sediment transport up estuary jalón rojas et al 2018 the tidal river therefore shifts from a relatively low concentration regime to hyper turbid one indicating an alternative steady state winterwerp 2011 due to active deepening of tidal channel for navigation purpose the ssc in the lower reaches of ems river increased an average of 2 to 3 fold during the period of 1954 2005 in response to internal tidal asymmetry and flocculation process asymmetry triggered by remarkable asymmetry in velocity the larger peak flood velocity with longer duration of high water slack contributes to net landward sediment transport and settling wu et al 2018 this flood dominated asymmetry yields an efficient mechanism in importing large amounts of fine sediment and expelling turbidity maximum zone up river de jonge et al 2014 another highly modified estuary the hudson river estuary presents similar regime change after channel dredging as the tidal amplitude has more than doubled in the upper reaches in conjunction with the decline of friction effect the hydrodynamic regime shifts from hyposynchronous tide decaying to hypersynchronous tide amplifying ralston et al 2019 which probably strengthens sediment import and trapping efficiency chant et al 2011 increased sediment imports and trapping efficiency inevitably lead to the enhancement of sediment accumulation in the dredged tidal river burchard et al 2018 although the timescale necessary for this deposition process can be long years to decades ralston and geyer 2017 we have demonstrated that the szr experiences progressive channel infilling after the regulation project thereby undermining the tidal amplification and the flood duration correspondingly decreased tidal pumping effect then might reduce the landward suspended sediment transport in order to verify this hypothesis the annual variations of ssc are calculated during the flood and ebb periods in fig 9 the comparison of ssc between the flood and ebb tide implies the net sediment transport relating with channel accretion and erosion since the import and export of tidal volume is nearly equivalent considering the negligible fluvial discharge at most time before 2012 the ssc during the flood tide was obviously higher than the ebb at both szhk and lh implicating net sediment transport up river which is well in line with the result of channel infilling between 2008 and 2012 fig 2 with sustained sediment accretion in conjunction with the attenuation of tidal pumping effect figs 7 and 8 the ssc difference between the flood and ebb almost disappeared after 2012 the transport regime of fine sediment even shifts from import to export due to higher ebb tide ssc after 2014 in szhk fig 9a additionally the ssc substantially lowered after 2012 while the tidal river system was characterized by more hyper turbid in the early phase which was primarily attributed to the intensification of tidal dissipation and was also potentially associated with the decline of fluvial sediment fig 6 furthermore the upstream ssc in lh was roughly higher than that in the mouth region szhk in the process of channel infilling however sscs between lower and upper reaches presented barely difference after 2012 since the ssc in lh suffered larger decrement 5 3 implication of episodic sediment trapping and flushing having related the process of channel infilling with tidal dynamic alteration in conjunction with annual residual suspended sediment transport pattern in the upfront section now we focus on the implication of morphological changes on a seasonal scale we recall that the morphological process of the middle and lower reaches of szr performs switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season after 2012 fig 3 maintaining a relatively dynamic equilibrium state the episodic sediment trapping and flushing probably associates with the intra annual variation of hydrodynamic regime as a result of the uneven allocation of fluvial discharge at different seasons pritchard and green 2017 river flow generally enhances tidal distortion then attenuates the flood dominated asymmetry which steers the sediment import and export relating with bed level alteration in a tidal energy system based on observational tidal signal in the north sea gräwe et al 2014 documented that the upslope transport of suspended sediment is highly associated with the seasonality of m2 and m4 tidal components since the tidal pumping term mostly affected by the phase relation of m2 and m4 is the dominating term in residual sediment transport becherer et al 2016 in the szr although the fluvial discharge is nearly negligible compared with the tidal prism there still exists a significantly uneven intra annual distribution of river flow the average discharge at wet season is about 0 13 billion m3 far overweighting the dry season less than 0 08 billion m3 such an intra annual distribution in streamflow generally introduces the seasonal variation in tidal propagation in a tidal river providing a conceivable hint for alternate channel erosion and accretion at wet and dry seasons hoitink et al 2017 hence the tidal skewness and tidal amplification are calculated at different seasons at szhk and lh according to the consecutively measured water level from 2012 to 2016 fig 10 it is clear that the tidal skewness at wet season is significantly larger than the dry season the tidal skewness at szhk and lh is 0 11 and 0 23 during the dry season respectively tides become more asymmetric at wet season the tidal skewness is amplified by factors of about 2 and more than 3 at lh and szhk respectively indicating an obvious variation in tidal asymmetry along the river upper reach with stronger fluvial impact induces more pronounced tidal decay additionally high water discharge undermines the tidal propagation so lowers the tidal amplification lh szhk similar seasonal variability of tidal amplification has only been previously mentioned in gionde and guadalquivir river jalón rojas et al 2018 interpreted the tidal wave amplification with seasonal variation of bottom roughness in gironde river since alternate presence of mud could affect the effective hydraulic drag as well as the tidal range during high and low water periods wang et al 2014 documented a similar seasonal variability of tidal range amplification in the guadalquivir river while it increased with the suspended sediment concentration introduced by high river flows contrary to the guadalquivir the seasonality of tidal dominated regime in the szr is closely intertwined with the marine sediment transport considering sufficient sediment source from large tidal flat of the szb zhang and mao 2015 the flood dominated asymmetry with larger tidal amplification at dry season should be responsible for sediment import which accounts for the sediment trapping and deposition at the lower and middle reaches nevertheless the enhancement of fluvial flow at wet season hampers the landward sediment transport then lowers the marine sediment import in comparison with the dry season high discharges especially the presence of episodic flood events contribute to the expelling of mobile mud jalón rojas et al 2015 most of which is probably imported during the latest dry season the trapping and expelling of seasonal mobile mud driven by intra annual variation of hydrodynamics thus accounts for the alternate channel erosion and accretion from 2012 to 2016 with barely anthropogenic interferences during this period the continuous process of progradation and degradation in a roughly equivalent magnitude provides an interesting hint of equilibrium state in tidal river system 5 4 feedback mechanisms in a tidal river system in summary as the implement of regulation projects for the purpose of flood prevention the mainstream of the szr is significantly dredged enhancing not only the tidal prism but also the residual sediment import the upstream sediment transport in the flood tide induced by stronger tidal pumping effect is obviously larger than the sediment export during the ebb period indicating pronounced sediment trapping and silting after the river training fig 9 the tidal river is thus subjected to consecutively deposited which in turn leads the tidal amplification to be undermined correspondingly the gap of sediment concentration between the flood and ebb tide is mostly bridged and therefore the tidal river attains a relatively equilibrium state on an interannual scale however on a seasonal scale the morphological process in the lower and middle reaches of the szr exhibits switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season as a result of the intra annual variation of tidal amplification and tidal asymmetry induced by the uneven allocation of fluvial discharge the sediment import during low flows generally balances the sediment export during high flow over a seasonal cycle which proves the feedback between the morphology and hydrodynamics such a seasonal offset in sediment import and export after 2012 indicates the szr achieves a near dynamic morphological equilibrium generally tidal deltas are fragile systems whose morphology can be readily altered by diverse natural and anthropogenic process which disrupts the morphological equilibrium over a long enough time span and even induces permanent morphological changes hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 however the szr performs rapid channel resilience after intensive and frequent river trainings our preliminary analysis involving tidal regime alteration in conjunction with sediment advection has revealed significant channel infilling the channel evolves towards a near equilibrium morphology in 2012 after dredging activities in a part of middle reach and regulation projects in the upper reach respectively implemented in 2006 and 2007 which implicates pronounced channel resilience within about 5 years feedback mechanisms in this work are particularly crucial for conducting river management strategy in the future intensive river trainings should be ruled out since it causes a sediment sink although the riverine sediment is subjected to remarkable decline due to urbanization and soil conservation fig 6 sufficient sediment source from the bay area is readily imported in a tidal dominated system zhang and mao 2015 which rapidly mitigates the magnitude of sediment starvation further river trainings are thus expected to suffer significant sediment progradation despite the szr has attained a dynamic morphological equilibrium the entire system has the potential to shift toward a new configuration at the decadal timescale zhang et al 2018b on one hand although the annual discharges at bjh and pyhk displayed contradictory trend with small magnitudes in discharge variations table 4 the accumulative effect can directly modulate the tidal range and asymmetry direction from the long term perspective more research and monitoring in discharge are thus needed in the szr on the other hand given that the mean sea level is projected to increase as in other estuaries worldwide kirwan and megonigal 2013 lovelock et al 2015 the capacity of sediment export is potentially reduced since sea level rise undermines the peak current asymmetry and slack water asymmetry guo et al 2018 the intensification of flood dominance driven by sea level rise can modify the sediment balance in tidal river systems and consequently alter morphology indicating a new feedback mechanism which can determine whether the szr and estuarine system will keep pace or drown in the near future passeri et al 2015 6 conclusions this study has unraveled possible feedback mechanisms between morphology tidal dynamic and residual sediment transport after drastic dredging activities in the tidal river system of the szr the channel deepening generally enhances not only tidal pumping effect but also upstream sediment transport the in site measurement of ssc shows that the suspended sediment transport during the flood tide is obviously larger than the ebb tide indicating sediment import and trapping after the implement of river trainings which accounts for the continuous sediment accretion from 2008 to 2012 the process of channel infilling in turn stepwise modified the tidal amplification and the tidal skewness leading to the gap between sediment import and export to be bridged the tidal river was therefore achieved a near equilibrium state after 2012 with barely bathymetry variations on an interannual scale however on a seasonal scale the middle and lower reaches experience switch between erosion at wet season and deposition at dry season tidal motion modified by the uneven intra annual allocation of fluvial flow plays a dominant role on stabilizing the morphology of the tidal river system as the sediment expelling during high flows mostly balances the sediment import during low flows although the fluvial sediment load is subjected to significant decreasing trend large scale tidal flat in the bay area readily provides sufficient fine sediment source once sediment starvation emerges in the szr feedback between channel resilience tidal dynamic and sediment transport promotes the tidal river system to evolve towards an equilibrium state in a short timeframe implying that intensive river trainings should be ruled out in the further river management strategy even so given the impact of accumulative river flow variation and sea level rise the entire system has the potential to shift toward a new configuration in the future credit authorship contribution statement yao wu conceptualization methodology writing original draft

5212,permeability is an important physical characteristic of shales a lot of researches have been made by scholars to study permeability of shales but the study of permeability for moisturized shales are insufficient water exist in natural shales therefore the difference of permeability for dry and moisturized shales and the reasons causing the difference need to be studied carefully the permeability of dry and wet crushed carboniferous shale samples from the eastern qaidam basin china were calculated by the dynamic process data of methane adsorption equilibrium to obtain moisturized samples under different water saturation a portion of the samples was moisturized at relative humidity rh values of 65 85 and 95 in addition the thickness of water in pores of the samples of different rh were calculated the permeability was reduced by almost one order of magnitude after samples were wetted and the relationship between permeability and water saturation s fit the exponential equation well by calculating the porosity of dry and moisturized samples the porosity reduction and connectivity loss accounted for the permeability reduction clay minerals and specific surface areas were considered to have a positive effect on permeability reduction the permeability of moisturized samples were not declined with the water saturation as expectation the permeability values for each moisturized sample under different rh only fluctuated in a small range correspondingly the biggest water film thickness of moisturized samples under different rh was also almost the same the difference of the water film thickness between rh 65 and rh 95 for each sample is only about 1 8 nm the small difference in water film thickness under different rh is regarded as the reason for the low permeability difference of moisturized samples keywords moisturized shale permeability methane adsorption water film thickness 1 introduction shale gas is an important form of unconventional energy that is widely distributed in the united states canada and china the international energy agency iea 2015 indicated that the global remaining technically recoverable resource of shale gas is estimated 213 tcm 1 t c m 1 10 12 m 3 properties such as the pore structure adsorption capacity and transport mechanism of dry shales have been studied in depth however water is a key factor that influences the properties of shales water exists in shales under actual reservoir conditions the initial water saturations of barnett basin marcellus basin haynesville basin eagle ford basin and fayetteville basin are 0 25 0 35 0 12 0 35 0 15 0 35 0 20 and 0 25 0 50 respectively wang et al 2009 sondergeld et al 2010 handwerger et al 2012 therefore it is important and of practical significance to study the influence of water on shales shales are extremely tight mudrocks with 50 grains smaller than 62 5 μm kuila et al 2012 the average pore sizes of shales from the haynesville basin beaufort mackenzie basin mississippi basin and sichuan basin are 20 nm elgmati 2011 25 1000 nm connell madore and katsube 2006 5 750 nm loucks et al 2009 and approximately 100 nm respectively zou et al 2010a 2010b 2011 very low porosity and permeability are of great importance to the productivity of shale gas reservoirs bustin and bustin 2012 letham and bustin 2015 letham and bustin 2016 mokhtari et al 2013 zhang and wang 2018 shales have a low permeability of approximately 10 20 to 10 18 m2 heller et al 2014 mbia et al 2014 the complex pore structures of shales cause diverse flow mechanisms such as the flow from the matrix due to diffusion javadpour et al 2007 slip flow etminan et al 2014 sorption yuan et al 2014 and viscous flow from fractures xie et al 2015 permeability has been studied by several methods guo et al 2017 such as the traditional steady state method applied in conventional reservoirs klinkenberg 1941 rushing et al 2004 sinha et al 2013 the pulse decay method which includes the core column method bourbie and walls 1982 chen and stagg 1984 dicker and smits 1988 hsieh et al 1981 core chip or drill cutting methods qu et al 2015 the degassing method egermann et al 2005 luffel et al 1993 and the mercury intrusion method washburn 1921 rashid et al 2015 thomeer 1960 1983 in addition cui et al 2009 provided a measurement of gas permeability considering methane adsorption and zhou et al 2016 indicated serious and permanent shale imbibition reduced matrix permeability however the apparent permeability of the shale matrix would obviously decrease because of the existence of pre adsorbed water gensterblum et al 2015 therefore the study of wet shale permeability is important complex pore structure is also a key property of shales that needs to be better understood focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy fib sem technology was introduced by curtis et al 2010 to observe nanoscale pore structures in three dimensions however sem fails to provide a specific pore size distribution psd low pressure adsorption lpa of co2 and n2 and mercury injection capillary pressure analysis micp can be combined to produce an accurate psd of shales according to the classification of the international union of pure and applied chemistry rouquerol et al 1994 pores can be classified into three categories micropores pore diameter 2 nm mesopores pore diameter of 2 50 nm and macropores pore diameter larger than 50 nm the lpas of co2 and n2 are usually used to measure the psd of micropores and mesopores respectively and micp is an accessible method to measure the psd of macropores katsube and williamson 1994 strapoc et al 2010 clarkson et al 2013 labani et al 2013 water can severely influence the characteristics of shales the initial water in tight shales is regarded as sub irreducible water newsham et al 2002 water is adsorbed on the organic and inorganic pores of shales for organic matter water adsorption is strongly influenced by the presence of functional hydrophilic groups nishino 2001 for inorganic minerals such as clay water exists on the matter mainly due to hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces in addition water adsorbed on clay via chemical bonds is always difficult to remove during the desorption process zolfaghari and dehghanpour 2015 due to the diverse storage mechanisms of water on shales the influences of water on shale properties are complicated in this study the permeability of shales for different water saturations was investigated a method using dynamic methane adsorption data was presented for permeability calculation cui et al 2009 a series of experiments were conducted to determine the mineral contents and pore structures of the samples lpa of co2 and n2 combined with micp were used for psd analysis we have measured the permeability of dry shale samples using this method and found the permeability have the same variation trend as the methane adsorption rate at experimental pressures before an inflection point wang and yu 2019 in this study the change in the permeability of wet samples compared to dry samples was observed the influence of water on the pore structures of the shales was studied this influence was considered the main reason for the permeability reduction after sample wetting in addition the relationships between permeability and water saturation and other properties of the shale samples were investigated 2 methodology 2 1 samples the samples in this study were carboniferous shales extracted from the eastern qaidam basin china the qaidam basin is located in northwestern china in the northern part of the qinghai tibet plateau the basin contains paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic strata and the carboniferous shale of the eastern qaidam basin is thick and widely distributed li et al 2015 all the three shale samples c015 c027 and c034 were taken from a core retrieved from borehole chaiye 2 in the eastern qaidam basin wang and yu 2017 2019 fig 1 shows the lithology log for the 900 1100 m range of the sampling strata 2 2 component analyses 2 2 1 mineral composition x ray diffraction xrd analyses were conducted with a d max rb x ray diffractometer to show the bulk mineralogy and clay minerals of the studied shale samples in this study the shale samples were crushed to an ultrafine particle size 200 meshes i e 0 074 mm and then dried for 12 h prior to the experiments a siemens xrd 6100 analyzer was used to scan 0 70 the experimental procedure followed the sy t 5163 2010 standard 2 2 2 total organic carbon content the total organic carbon content is an essential parameter for shales to evaluate the potential of a shale gas reservoir kenomore et al 2017 wang et al 2013 in this study the toc was measured based on the gb t 19145 2003 standard the samples were crushed 200 meshes i e 0 074 mm and pretreated with hcl to remove inorganic carbon prior to the experiments a leco sc 144dr carbon sulfur analyzer was used to conduct the experiment 2 2 3 thermal maturity and kerogen type thermal maturity is a parameter that can indicate the hydrocarbon potential and the hydrocarbon generation history of shale luo et al 2016 schito et al 2016 in this study the maturity was estimated by vitrinite material reflectance ro measurements the experiments were conducted using a hitachi f7000 mpv sp microscope equipped with an oil immersion objective lens based on the sy t5124 1995 standard the kerogen types and compositions of the shale samples were determined by using an axioskop 2 plus biological microscope based on the sy t 5125 1996 standard 2 3 pore size distribution 2 3 1 low pressure n2 and co2 adsorption according to the gb t 21650 2 and gb t 21650 3 standards the lpa of n2 was conducted at 77 k 196 and a pressure below 1 27 bar using an autosorb iq station 1 instrument the crushed samples 0 25 mm were heated at 110 c for 6 h before the experiments to remove gas free water and other possible impurities the surface area and psd of pore sizes between 2 nm and 50 nm were obtained by the lpa of n2 the brunauer emmett teller bet theory brunauer et al 1938 based on the langmuir adsorption theory is a widely used method for surface area determination the bet is used in this work to calculate the surface area several methods based on the kelvin equation gregg and sing 1967 such as the brratt jayner halenda bjh model barrett et al 1951 the dollimore heal dh model dollimore and heal 1964 and the horvath kawazoe hk model horvath and kawazoe 1983 can be applied to determine psd using nitrogen adsorption analysis data considering that the kelvin method is inadequate for fine pores the density functional theory dft molecular model based on the hohenberg kohn equation groen et al 2003 was used to analyze the psd of mesopores in this study do and do 2003 the lpas of co2 experiments were conducted at 273 k 0 using a nova station a instrument the crushed samples 0 25 mm were dried at 110 for 6 h prior to the experiments the bet and dft were used to analyze the surface area and psd based on the lpa of co2 data 2 3 2 mercury injection capillary pressure analysis psds with pore diameters greater than 50 nm were obtained by micp based on the gb t 21650 1 2008 standard mercury injection capillary pressure analysis was conducted on vacuum dried samples using a quantachrome poremaster at pressures up to 30 000 psi except for psd various parameters including surface area total pore volume bulk density and porosity were also obtained by micp giesche 2006 2 4 moisturizing shale samples in this work both dry and wet shale samples were studied therefore some samples had to be moisturized the standard test method for equilibrium moisture of coal at 96 97 percent relative humidity astm d1412 93 krooss et al 2002 is a common criterion for moisturizing coal or shale samples the astm method a process of drying over wetting samples to reach a final equilibrium moisture in this method a certain mass of samples is put into a sealed chamber over a saturated solution of k2so4 to maintain 96 97 moisture at 30 for 72 h to achieve equilibration however drying accelerates oxidation and can also result in pore size and volume shrinkage which affects the moisture holding capacity when overdrying astm d1412 in addition the samples need to be pre wetted before the moisturizing procedure therefore a th 225 a f programmable temperature and humidity chamber was used to moisturize the samples in this study the programmable temperature and humidity chamber provided stable conditions with temperatures from 25 to 150 and a relative humidity rh from 20 to 98 the error for temperature was 0 5 and the error for rh was 2 5 in this study because the indoor temperature was about 25 c when the experiments were conducted and the apparatus had high accuracy at 25 c the temperature of the chamber was set at 25 c according to the pre experiments the sample mass changes were not obvious when rh was lower than 65 therefore and the samples were moisturized at a rh of 65 85 or 95 2 5 methane adsorption experiments dry and wet crushed samples were used for methane adsorption experiments based on the static manometric method himeno et al 2005 the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 2 the apparatus allows a temperature measurement range of 273 373 k and a pressure of 0 10 mpa all experiments were conducted at 40 c with a relative error of 0 2 c the samples were crushed to 0 25 mm and dried at 150 to remove impurities before the experiments a portion of the samples was moisturized as described in section 2 4 before methane adsorption experiments helium was used firstly to get the void volume of the sample cell which is a parameter will be used in methane adsorption amount calculation and permeability calculation the samples were put into the sample cell and helium gas of approximately 2 mpa was injected into the reference cell when the whole system reached equilibrium approximately 2 h later valve 1 was opened between the sample and reference cells to allow the helium to expand into the sample cell after 12 h the void volume of the sample cell which was defined as the volume except for sample particles was calculated following eqn 1 1 p r v r z 1 r t p r v r z 1 r t p s v 0 z 2 r t where pr is the pressure of the reference cell mpa vr is the volume of the reference cell cm3 v0 is the void volume cm3 and z1 is the helium compressibility factor of the reference cell before opening valve 1 when the system reaches equilibrium after the helium expansion pr and ps are the pressures of the reference and sample cells mpa and z1 and z2 are the compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells respectively r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature k after the helium expansion experiment the system was vacuumed to remove helium before methane adsorption experiments the methane was injected into the reference cell and then valve 1 was opened to allow the methane flow into the sample cell when the system was stable approximately 4 h later valve 1 was closed during the methane adsorption process in the sample cell the pressure and temperature of the two cells were monitored every minute for 12 h methane was injected successively according to preset pressure time p t correlations then the above steps were repeated and the methane amounts adsorbed under specific pressures were obtained the amount of methane adsorbed by the first adsorption balance can be described by the following equation 2 n 1 1 rt p 1 v r z 1 p 1 v r z 1 p 2 v 0 z 2 where n1 is the adsorbed methane amount mol of the first adsorption balance p1 is the reference cell pressure mpa and z1 is the methane compressibility factor in the reference cell before the opening of valve 1 when the methane adsorption equilibrium is reached p1 and p2 are the pressures of the reference and sample cells mpa and z1 and z2 are the methane compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells respectively when the nth adsorption equilibrium is reached the increment of the absorbed methane amount corresponding to the balance pressure is as follows 3 δ n n 1 rt p 1 n v r z 1 n p 1 n v r z 1 n p 2 n v 0 z 2 n p 2 n 1 v 0 z 2 n 1 where δ nn mol is the increase in the adsorbed methane at the balance pressure p2 n mpa p1 n and p1 n mpa are the reference cell pressures before and after the nth adsorption experiment z1 n and z2 n 1 are the methane compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells before the nth adsorption experiment and z1 n and z2 n are the methane compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells at the nth adsorption equilibrium respectively p2 n 1 is the n 1th adsorption balance pressure according to eqns 1 and 2 the total adsorbed methane amount mol at p2 n is 4 n n n 1 i 2 n δ n i the adsorbed methane amount per unit mass mol g of shale is 5 q a n n m where m is the mass of the shale samples g data pressure and temperature both of the reference and sample cells were collected every minute in this study when the adsorption reaches equilibrium the fluctuation in the methane adsorption amount is small therefore the instant adsorption methane amount was calculated using the two sets of data in one minute according to eqns 2 5 methane adsorption experiments were conducted on dry and wet samples the results were fitted by the langmuir equation the langmuir equation can be expressed as eqn 6 lu et al 1995 bumb and mckee 1988 ambrose et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 gasparik et al 2012 wang and yu 2016 6 n n max k t p 1 k t p where n mol is the adsorption capacity nmax is the maximum adsorbed amount k t is the temperature dependent langmuir parameter and p mpa is the experimental pressure 2 6 permeability calculation the permeability calculation was adapted from cui et al 2009 for dry shale particles a fairly small unit was supposed as shown in fig 3 as assumed in darcy s law a fluid flows through this unit in δ t the unit is rectangular with a length width and height of δ x δ y and δ z respectively the porosity of the unit φ is a constant the fluid velocities before and after the fluid flows through the unit are vx and vx δ x respectively and the densities of the fluid before and after δ t are ρt and ρt δ t respectively the adsorption capacities of the fluid in the unit before and after δ t are defined as qt

darcy s law the velocity v can be described as 11 v k μ p l where k is the permeability of the unit μ is the viscosity of the fluid p is the pressure and l is the length combining eqn 10 and eqn 11 eqn 10 can be described as follows 12 x ρ μ k p x φ ρ t 1 φ q t converted to spherical coordinates eqn 12 can be described as follows 13 1 r 2 r r 2 ρ k μ p r φ ρ t 1 φ q t if the variation in the

18 ρ p zrt where z is the gas compressibility factor r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature combining eqn 14 with eqn 15 eqn 14 can be described as follows 19 dp dt k r 2 r r 2 p r according to eqn 18 eqn 14 then becomes 20 d ρ dt k r 2 r r 2 ρ r eqn 20 is similar to the diffusion equation so we named k the transport coefficient the apparatus for the methane adsorption experiment in our study is shown in fig 3 the volumes of the reference and sample cells are vr and vs respectively and the volume of shale particles is vb kc is defined as the ratio of the total void space of the reference and sample cells vc vr vs vb to the total void volume of the sample particles 21 k c v c m ρ b φ 1 φ k a where m and ρ b are the mass and bulk density respectively of the sample vc can also be obtained by the helium expansion experiment as discussed in section 2 5 where vc is equal to v0 when the methane adsorption is at equilibrium ρc0 is defined as the average methane density mol m3 22 ρ c 0 ρ r 0 v r ρ 0 v s v b v r v s v b where ρr0 is the initial gas density mol m3 in the reference cell and ρ 0 is the initial density in the sample cell according to carslaw and jeager 1947 the gas density in the total void space of the reference and sample cells vc is 23 ρ ρ c 0 ρ c 0 ρ 0 k c 1 6 k c ρ c 0 ρ 0 n 1 e k α n 2 t r a 2 1 k c 2 α n 2 9 k c 1 where ra is the

instant gas density in the sample cell f r 1 k c ρ c 0 ρ ρ c 0 ρ 0 in eqn 26 1 is interpreted as the mass fraction of gas in the void volume of the reference and sample cells that will eventually be taken up by the sample particles relative to the total gas that can be taken by the sample cui et al 2009 fr is the ratio of the difference between the final and instant methane adsorption amounts to the final methane adsorption amounts therefore f can be obtained by eqns 26 1 and 26 2 according to eqn 25 the logarithmic value of f becomes a linear function of time 27 ln f f 0 s 1 t where s1 is the slope of the straight line 28 s 1 k α 1 2 r a 2 f0 is the y intercept of the straight line 29 f 0 ln 6 k c k c 1 k c 2 α 1 2 9 k c 1 and α1 is the first root of eqn 24 then the permeability can be derived from eqns 15 and 28 as 30 k r a 2 φ 1 φ k a μ c g s 1 α 1 2 for wet shale particles the sample porosity is defined as 31 φ w φ v w v s where φ is the porosity of the dry samples vw is the water volume cm3 and vs is the sample volume cm3 water can affect methane adsorption on shales and the permeability can be derived from the dynamic data of the methane adsorption process therefore the permeability calculation procedure of wet samples is similar to that of dry shale and the difference in permeability caused by water is included in the data 2 7 water film thickness calculation method when shales get wet water is adsorbed in the shale pores and forms water films water film will influence the microstructure methane adsorption capacity and permeability of the samples the pores in the shales may be slit or capillary as discussed in section 3 2 the pores in the samples of this study are considered narrow slits according to the lpa of the n2 isotherm hysteresis loop type li et al 2016 2017 have discussed the water film thickness in pores of different types including single flat surface slit and cylinder pore therefore here the method which calculates water film thickness in slit pores was used according to li et al 2016 the disjoining pressure between the water film and surface on which the water is adsorbed π1 the interaction between the water film and opposite surface π2 and the interaction between two films adsorbed on opposite walls π3 are considered the force πslit in the slit pores containing the water film h 32 π slit π 1 π 2 π 3 the disjoining pressure π1 consists of the london van der waals force πm electrical force πe and structural force πs derjaguin et al 1987 πm can be expressed as eqn 33 33 π m a h h 3 where ah is the hamaker constant in a gas water solid system and the characteristic value is 10 21 10 20 j the electrical force πe is starov et al 2007 34 π e ε ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 h 2 where ε is the relative dielectric permittivity of a liquid f m ε0 is the electric constant in vacuum f m and ζ1 and ζ2 are the electric potentials of the solid liquid and liquid air interfaces respectively in mv the potential difference between the water solid interface and the water air interface is δ ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 40 80 mv under contact angles 20 chureav 1995a b mattia et al 2012 the structural force πs can be expressed as starov et al 2007 35 π s ke h λ where k is the coefficient for the strength of the structural force in n m2 and λ is the characteristic length of water molecules in nm in this study the values k 0 1 10 7 n m2 and λ 1 2 nm churaev

21 j tuller et al 1999 churaev et al 2000 3 experiment results 3 1 mineral composition and organic matter content the percentages of the dominant minerals such as quartz pyrite calcite albite microcline siderite and ankerite were obtained from xrd table 1 lists the results of the xrd experiments and shows the mineral composition and organic matter content of the samples all three samples show a high quartz content in addition the total clay content is also high 31 49 the toc values of the samples are 0 66 0 67 and 2 76 and the similar ro values of the samples indicate similar thermal maturities the specific clay mineral contents of the samples are shown in table 2 illite smectite accounts for a large proportion of the clay mineral content i e 52 63 followed by kaolinite 3 2 pore size distribution the low pressure co2 adsorption results are shown in fig 4 based on the categories of sing et al 1985 the isotherms are typical type i isotherms sample c015 has the largest adsorption capacity i e 0 8208 cm3 g and is followed by samples c027 and c034 which have capacities of 0 4263 and 0 334 cm3 g respectively correspondingly sample c015 has a higher micropore volume than c027 and c034 table 3 the low pressure n2 adsorption results are shown in fig 5 in contrast to the lpa of co2 the isotherm hysteresis loops were obtained by the lpa of n2 c027 has the highest adsorption amount i e 10 405 cm3 g and c015 and c034 have lower adsorption amounts of 8 4134 and 7 0781 cm3 g respectively correspondingly c027 has the largest mesopore volume and c015 and c034 have lower mesopore volumes table 3 according to the iupac hysteresis loop type classification sing et al 1985 all the isotherms are type h4 which accounts for multilayer adsorption according to de boer 1958 and the iupac rouquerol et al 1994 the mesopore geometry of the samples is characterized by narrow slits brunauer et al 1940 sing et al 1985 table 3 shows the parameters obtained by lpa and micp the bulk density skeletal density and macropore volume were determined by micp the total porosity was calculated by the combination of lpa of co2 microporosity and n2 mesoporosity and micp macroporosity in addition the psds of the dry samples are shown in fig 6 3 3 water saturation of the samples under different relative humidities in this study shales are divided into two groups dry samples and wet samples wet samples were moisturized according to the procedure described in section 2 4 under a temperature of 25 and rh of 65 85 or 95 water saturation s is defined as the ratio of the volume of liquid water to the total volume of the sample table 4 shows the water saturation of the samples at different rh s 3 4 methane adsorption experiments the results of the methane adsorption experiments including the langmuir fitted equations r2 correlation coefficients and nmax and k t values are shown in table 5 and the adsorption isotherms of the samples are shown in fig 7 the experimental data are well fitted to the langmuir fitting data with an average correlation coefficient of 0 992 and the best fit result with a correlation coefficient of 0 999 was obtained for c015 at rh 95 nmax significantly decreased with increasing water saturation table 5 which indicates that the methane adsorption capacity of the shale samples decreased due to the existence of water 3 5 permeability permeability of dry and wet samples were determined following the calculation method described in section 2 6 the calculation parameters are shown in table 6 ka was the premise for determining the methane adsorption equilibrium according to cui et al 2009 when ka is 0 05 the calculation method is more accurate ka is determined as the derivative of the adsorbate density with respect to the gas density and the density of the adsorbate and free gas of the cells can be calculated by the pressure and temperature which are monitored every minute in the process of methane adsorption experiments therefore ka can be determined and other parameters can be obtained ra is the radius of the samples and here the value of ra is 0 000125 m the important parameter s1 is the slop of the straight line of lnf and t eqn 27 as shown in fig 8 the calculated permeability of crushed shale samples in this study is usually lower than the results of shale cores cheng and yu 2019 measured the permeability of dry shale cores ranged from 3 21 to 7 29 10 3 md the permeability of dry shale cores in the study of zhang and yu 2019 is about 10 2 10 3 md fractures are the main reason for higher permeability of shale cores than crushed shale in addition the permeability of shale cores is calculated by darcy s law under the experimental pressure lower than 2 mpa according to zhang and yu 2019 the permeability of shale cores decrease with the water content and drop to 10 8 md when the samples are almost saturated the result is similar to our study because the fractures in shale cores are blocked by water 3 6 water film thickness according to li et al 2016 churaev 1995a b churaev et al 2000 tuller et al 1999 starov et al 2007 and mattia et al 2012 the parameters values in the water film thickness calculation are listed in table 7 the specific water film thickness of the samples under different relative humidity is shown in fig 9 when the calculated water film thickness is bigger than the pore width fine pores are regarded as fully filled by water the water film thickness is considered as same as the pore width so in fig 9 the water film thickness increases firstly with pore width and gradually stabilizes when the water film thickness is less than the pore width according to the values the porosity of the moisturized samples can be calculated and the results are shown in table 8 4 discussions 4 1 methane adsorption the methane adsorption capacity averagely dropped by 46 8 for sample c015 by 46 55 for sample c027 and by 54 3 for sample c034 after sample wetting fig 7 the adsorption capacity was reduced by 80 90 in the study of li et al 2016 and by 19 7 5 3 to 36 1 6 1 in the study of wang and yu 2016 several experiments have indicated that the methane adsorption capacity of wet shales should be 40 90 less than that of dry shales ross and bustin 2009 gasparik et al 2014 the change trends of the wet sample isotherms are gentler than the dry sample isotherms and the isotherm inflection points are more obvious for the wet samples than for the dry samples the methane adsorption amount of wet samples is less than that of dry samples but there is no significant difference in methane adsorption among wet samples rh 65 85 and 95 the change trends among the isotherms of the wet samples vary slightly 4 2 permeability of the samples under different experimental pressures the permeability of the samples under different experimental pressures are shown in fig 10 the permeability of the wet samples is lower than that of the dry samples but there are no significant variations among the permeability of wet samples under different water saturation values 4 3 relationship between permeability and water saturation the average value of permeability under different pressures in table 6 was chosen as the permeability of each sample as shown in fig 11 the permeability of the samples declined with water saturation and the relationship between permeability and water saturation fits well with the exponential equation k a e bs the fitted equations and correlation coefficients are shown in table 9 permeability significantly declined by approximately one order of magnitude after the wetting of samples the permeability of wet samples decreased by approximately 74 4 to 89 3 compared with dry samples but there was no obvious reduction trend among the wet samples the porosity change is considered to be the reason for the permeability reduction in the wet samples compared with the dry samples as shown in table 8 porosity was reduced by 22 1 41 8 for sample c015 by 17 2 42 6 for sample c027 and by 13 3 35 8 for sample c034 after samples became wet the porosity reduction between rh 65 and 85 was similar but the porosity change was obvious when rh 95 in addition connectivity loss and pore collapse can be caused by water davudov and moghanloo 2018 indicated that connectivity loss can be expressed as the main reason for a significant permeability reduction when porosity change is limited therefore water affects permeability by influencing pore structure 4 4 psds of moisturized samples the water film thickness was calculated from the equations in section 3 6 combining the pore size distribution discussed in section 3 2 the psds pore diameter 50 nm of the samples under different water saturations can be obtained as shown in fig 12 because the change in pore volume is very small when the pore diameter is large only psds with pore diameters 50 nm are shown from the calculation results fig 9 water only influenced small pores pores under 1 7 nm 2 4 nm and 3 5 nm were filled completely by water when rh 65 rh 85 and rh 95 respectively other scholars have reported similar results li et al 2017 found that pores 6 7 nm were completely blocked by capillary water and wang and yu 2016 indicated that pores of approximately 2 7 nm were filled by water in this study the proportion of pore volume occupied by water was 20 when the pore width was larger than 10 nm this is the reason why permeability methane adsorption amount and porosity were not greatly affected by the increase of water saturation from rh 65 to rh 95 4 5 permeability reduction the permeability of samples c015 c027 and c034 decreased by 80 3 76 0 and 83 9 respectively after sample wetting the relationships between the permeability reductions and total clay content and surface area values of the samples are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the permeability reduction increased with the total clay content and specific surface area clay minerals are hydrophilic feng et al 2018 pang et al 2017 and water adsorption on shales is strengthened by the presence of nanometer sized pores and related large specific surface areas in addition the swelling of clay minerals caused by water can result in porosity and permeability reductions grahama et al 2002 aksu et al 2015 zhang and yu 2016 therefore permeability decreases as the total clay content and specific surface area increase 5 conclusions a series of experiments were conducted to compare the permeability of dry and moisturized crushed shale samples mineral and organic matter contents were measured and the sample psds were analyzed shale samples were moisturized at rh values of 65 85 and 95 and the permeability both of the dry and moisturized samples was calculated using dynamic data from methane adsorption experiments from the results and discussions the permeability of the moisturized samples were found to decrease significantly by approximately 74 4 to 89 3 compared with the permeability of the dry samples the relationship between permeability and water saturation conforms to an exponential equation well k a e bs porosity reduction was the main reason for permeability reduction porosity was reduced by 22 1 41 8 for sample c015 by 17 2 42 6 for sample c027 and by 13 3 35 8 for sample c034 after sample wetting losses in connectivity caused by water can also reduce permeability however the change of permeability of the moisturized samples were not obvious when rh 65 85 and 95 the permeability of sample c015 were 3 25 3 22 and 3 83 10 8md respectively the permeability of sample c027 were 3 02 2 54 and 3 06 10 8 md respectively and the permeability of sample c034 were 3 34 2 25 and 4 56 10 8 md respectively the permeability dose not decrease with the water saturation as expectation water film thickness is considered the main reason for the unobvious permeability differences among the moisturized samples the water film thickness of samples under different water saturation values was calculated pores under 1 7 nm 2 4 nm and 3 5 nm were filled totally by water when rh 65 rh 85 and rh 95 respectively only extremely tiny pores were found to be fully filled by water even when rh 95 and the proportion of pore volume occupied by water was 20 when the pore width was above 10 nm little differences were observed in the effect of water on pore structures under different rh values therefore the difference in permeability among wet samples was not prominent in addition the reduction in permeability was greater as the total clay content and surface area of the samples increased which is related to the influence of clay minerals and specific surface area on the hydrophilicity of shales a series of work have been done in this work to improve the accuracy of the complicated experiments and calculation for the sample moisturizing experiments many pre experiments have been conducted to determine the appropriate relative humidity and the suitable experimental duration for the methane adsorption experiments air tightness of the apparatus must be examined before every group of experiment helium is used to get the precise void volume of the sample cell the experimental duration must be long enough to ensure a complete adsorption reaction for permeability calculation late time data of the adsorption experiments when ka is below 0 05 are chosen to make the calculation the data are recorded every minute to ensure the data amount is huge enough to make regular results however the method in this work still has limitations only crushed shale samples which are conceptualized as spherical particles not shales under natural conditions are studied the water saturation range and experimental pressure and temperature are limited therefore more rigorous experiments need to be conducted to make more accurate results credit authorship contribution statement milei wang methodology investigation validation

5212,permeability is an important physical characteristic of shales a lot of researches have been made by scholars to study permeability of shales but the study of permeability for moisturized shales are insufficient water exist in natural shales therefore the difference of permeability for dry and moisturized shales and the reasons causing the difference need to be studied carefully the permeability of dry and wet crushed carboniferous shale samples from the eastern qaidam basin china were calculated by the dynamic process data of methane adsorption equilibrium to obtain moisturized samples under different water saturation a portion of the samples was moisturized at relative humidity rh values of 65 85 and 95 in addition the thickness of water in pores of the samples of different rh were calculated the permeability was reduced by almost one order of magnitude after samples were wetted and the relationship between permeability and water saturation s fit the exponential equation well by calculating the porosity of dry and moisturized samples the porosity reduction and connectivity loss accounted for the permeability reduction clay minerals and specific surface areas were considered to have a positive effect on permeability reduction the permeability of moisturized samples were not declined with the water saturation as expectation the permeability values for each moisturized sample under different rh only fluctuated in a small range correspondingly the biggest water film thickness of moisturized samples under different rh was also almost the same the difference of the water film thickness between rh 65 and rh 95 for each sample is only about 1 8 nm the small difference in water film thickness under different rh is regarded as the reason for the low permeability difference of moisturized samples keywords moisturized shale permeability methane adsorption water film thickness 1 introduction shale gas is an important form of unconventional energy that is widely distributed in the united states canada and china the international energy agency iea 2015 indicated that the global remaining technically recoverable resource of shale gas is estimated 213 tcm 1 t c m 1 10 12 m 3 properties such as the pore structure adsorption capacity and transport mechanism of dry shales have been studied in depth however water is a key factor that influences the properties of shales water exists in shales under actual reservoir conditions the initial water saturations of barnett basin marcellus basin haynesville basin eagle ford basin and fayetteville basin are 0 25 0 35 0 12 0 35 0 15 0 35 0 20 and 0 25 0 50 respectively wang et al 2009 sondergeld et al 2010 handwerger et al 2012 therefore it is important and of practical significance to study the influence of water on shales shales are extremely tight mudrocks with 50 grains smaller than 62 5 μm kuila et al 2012 the average pore sizes of shales from the haynesville basin beaufort mackenzie basin mississippi basin and sichuan basin are 20 nm elgmati 2011 25 1000 nm connell madore and katsube 2006 5 750 nm loucks et al 2009 and approximately 100 nm respectively zou et al 2010a 2010b 2011 very low porosity and permeability are of great importance to the productivity of shale gas reservoirs bustin and bustin 2012 letham and bustin 2015 letham and bustin 2016 mokhtari et al 2013 zhang and wang 2018 shales have a low permeability of approximately 10 20 to 10 18 m2 heller et al 2014 mbia et al 2014 the complex pore structures of shales cause diverse flow mechanisms such as the flow from the matrix due to diffusion javadpour et al 2007 slip flow etminan et al 2014 sorption yuan et al 2014 and viscous flow from fractures xie et al 2015 permeability has been studied by several methods guo et al 2017 such as the traditional steady state method applied in conventional reservoirs klinkenberg 1941 rushing et al 2004 sinha et al 2013 the pulse decay method which includes the core column method bourbie and walls 1982 chen and stagg 1984 dicker and smits 1988 hsieh et al 1981 core chip or drill cutting methods qu et al 2015 the degassing method egermann et al 2005 luffel et al 1993 and the mercury intrusion method washburn 1921 rashid et al 2015 thomeer 1960 1983 in addition cui et al 2009 provided a measurement of gas permeability considering methane adsorption and zhou et al 2016 indicated serious and permanent shale imbibition reduced matrix permeability however the apparent permeability of the shale matrix would obviously decrease because of the existence of pre adsorbed water gensterblum et al 2015 therefore the study of wet shale permeability is important complex pore structure is also a key property of shales that needs to be better understood focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy fib sem technology was introduced by curtis et al 2010 to observe nanoscale pore structures in three dimensions however sem fails to provide a specific pore size distribution psd low pressure adsorption lpa of co2 and n2 and mercury injection capillary pressure analysis micp can be combined to produce an accurate psd of shales according to the classification of the international union of pure and applied chemistry rouquerol et al 1994 pores can be classified into three categories micropores pore diameter 2 nm mesopores pore diameter of 2 50 nm and macropores pore diameter larger than 50 nm the lpas of co2 and n2 are usually used to measure the psd of micropores and mesopores respectively and micp is an accessible method to measure the psd of macropores katsube and williamson 1994 strapoc et al 2010 clarkson et al 2013 labani et al 2013 water can severely influence the characteristics of shales the initial water in tight shales is regarded as sub irreducible water newsham et al 2002 water is adsorbed on the organic and inorganic pores of shales for organic matter water adsorption is strongly influenced by the presence of functional hydrophilic groups nishino 2001 for inorganic minerals such as clay water exists on the matter mainly due to hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces in addition water adsorbed on clay via chemical bonds is always difficult to remove during the desorption process zolfaghari and dehghanpour 2015 due to the diverse storage mechanisms of water on shales the influences of water on shale properties are complicated in this study the permeability of shales for different water saturations was investigated a method using dynamic methane adsorption data was presented for permeability calculation cui et al 2009 a series of experiments were conducted to determine the mineral contents and pore structures of the samples lpa of co2 and n2 combined with micp were used for psd analysis we have measured the permeability of dry shale samples using this method and found the permeability have the same variation trend as the methane adsorption rate at experimental pressures before an inflection point wang and yu 2019 in this study the change in the permeability of wet samples compared to dry samples was observed the influence of water on the pore structures of the shales was studied this influence was considered the main reason for the permeability reduction after sample wetting in addition the relationships between permeability and water saturation and other properties of the shale samples were investigated 2 methodology 2 1 samples the samples in this study were carboniferous shales extracted from the eastern qaidam basin china the qaidam basin is located in northwestern china in the northern part of the qinghai tibet plateau the basin contains paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic strata and the carboniferous shale of the eastern qaidam basin is thick and widely distributed li et al 2015 all the three shale samples c015 c027 and c034 were taken from a core retrieved from borehole chaiye 2 in the eastern qaidam basin wang and yu 2017 2019 fig 1 shows the lithology log for the 900 1100 m range of the sampling strata 2 2 component analyses 2 2 1 mineral composition x ray diffraction xrd analyses were conducted with a d max rb x ray diffractometer to show the bulk mineralogy and clay minerals of the studied shale samples in this study the shale samples were crushed to an ultrafine particle size 200 meshes i e 0 074 mm and then dried for 12 h prior to the experiments a siemens xrd 6100 analyzer was used to scan 0 70 the experimental procedure followed the sy t 5163 2010 standard 2 2 2 total organic carbon content the total organic carbon content is an essential parameter for shales to evaluate the potential of a shale gas reservoir kenomore et al 2017 wang et al 2013 in this study the toc was measured based on the gb t 19145 2003 standard the samples were crushed 200 meshes i e 0 074 mm and pretreated with hcl to remove inorganic carbon prior to the experiments a leco sc 144dr carbon sulfur analyzer was used to conduct the experiment 2 2 3 thermal maturity and kerogen type thermal maturity is a parameter that can indicate the hydrocarbon potential and the hydrocarbon generation history of shale luo et al 2016 schito et al 2016 in this study the maturity was estimated by vitrinite material reflectance ro measurements the experiments were conducted using a hitachi f7000 mpv sp microscope equipped with an oil immersion objective lens based on the sy t5124 1995 standard the kerogen types and compositions of the shale samples were determined by using an axioskop 2 plus biological microscope based on the sy t 5125 1996 standard 2 3 pore size distribution 2 3 1 low pressure n2 and co2 adsorption according to the gb t 21650 2 and gb t 21650 3 standards the lpa of n2 was conducted at 77 k 196 and a pressure below 1 27 bar using an autosorb iq station 1 instrument the crushed samples 0 25 mm were heated at 110 c for 6 h before the experiments to remove gas free water and other possible impurities the surface area and psd of pore sizes between 2 nm and 50 nm were obtained by the lpa of n2 the brunauer emmett teller bet theory brunauer et al 1938 based on the langmuir adsorption theory is a widely used method for surface area determination the bet is used in this work to calculate the surface area several methods based on the kelvin equation gregg and sing 1967 such as the brratt jayner halenda bjh model barrett et al 1951 the dollimore heal dh model dollimore and heal 1964 and the horvath kawazoe hk model horvath and kawazoe 1983 can be applied to determine psd using nitrogen adsorption analysis data considering that the kelvin method is inadequate for fine pores the density functional theory dft molecular model based on the hohenberg kohn equation groen et al 2003 was used to analyze the psd of mesopores in this study do and do 2003 the lpas of co2 experiments were conducted at 273 k 0 using a nova station a instrument the crushed samples 0 25 mm were dried at 110 for 6 h prior to the experiments the bet and dft were used to analyze the surface area and psd based on the lpa of co2 data 2 3 2 mercury injection capillary pressure analysis psds with pore diameters greater than 50 nm were obtained by micp based on the gb t 21650 1 2008 standard mercury injection capillary pressure analysis was conducted on vacuum dried samples using a quantachrome poremaster at pressures up to 30 000 psi except for psd various parameters including surface area total pore volume bulk density and porosity were also obtained by micp giesche 2006 2 4 moisturizing shale samples in this work both dry and wet shale samples were studied therefore some samples had to be moisturized the standard test method for equilibrium moisture of coal at 96 97 percent relative humidity astm d1412 93 krooss et al 2002 is a common criterion for moisturizing coal or shale samples the astm method a process of drying over wetting samples to reach a final equilibrium moisture in this method a certain mass of samples is put into a sealed chamber over a saturated solution of k2so4 to maintain 96 97 moisture at 30 for 72 h to achieve equilibration however drying accelerates oxidation and can also result in pore size and volume shrinkage which affects the moisture holding capacity when overdrying astm d1412 in addition the samples need to be pre wetted before the moisturizing procedure therefore a th 225 a f programmable temperature and humidity chamber was used to moisturize the samples in this study the programmable temperature and humidity chamber provided stable conditions with temperatures from 25 to 150 and a relative humidity rh from 20 to 98 the error for temperature was 0 5 and the error for rh was 2 5 in this study because the indoor temperature was about 25 c when the experiments were conducted and the apparatus had high accuracy at 25 c the temperature of the chamber was set at 25 c according to the pre experiments the sample mass changes were not obvious when rh was lower than 65 therefore and the samples were moisturized at a rh of 65 85 or 95 2 5 methane adsorption experiments dry and wet crushed samples were used for methane adsorption experiments based on the static manometric method himeno et al 2005 the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 2 the apparatus allows a temperature measurement range of 273 373 k and a pressure of 0 10 mpa all experiments were conducted at 40 c with a relative error of 0 2 c the samples were crushed to 0 25 mm and dried at 150 to remove impurities before the experiments a portion of the samples was moisturized as described in section 2 4 before methane adsorption experiments helium was used firstly to get the void volume of the sample cell which is a parameter will be used in methane adsorption amount calculation and permeability calculation the samples were put into the sample cell and helium gas of approximately 2 mpa was injected into the reference cell when the whole system reached equilibrium approximately 2 h later valve 1 was opened between the sample and reference cells to allow the helium to expand into the sample cell after 12 h the void volume of the sample cell which was defined as the volume except for sample particles was calculated following eqn 1 1 p r v r z 1 r t p r v r z 1 r t p s v 0 z 2 r t where pr is the pressure of the reference cell mpa vr is the volume of the reference cell cm3 v0 is the void volume cm3 and z1 is the helium compressibility factor of the reference cell before opening valve 1 when the system reaches equilibrium after the helium expansion pr and ps are the pressures of the reference and sample cells mpa and z1 and z2 are the compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells respectively r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature k after the helium expansion experiment the system was vacuumed to remove helium before methane adsorption experiments the methane was injected into the reference cell and then valve 1 was opened to allow the methane flow into the sample cell when the system was stable approximately 4 h later valve 1 was closed during the methane adsorption process in the sample cell the pressure and temperature of the two cells were monitored every minute for 12 h methane was injected successively according to preset pressure time p t correlations then the above steps were repeated and the methane amounts adsorbed under specific pressures were obtained the amount of methane adsorbed by the first adsorption balance can be described by the following equation 2 n 1 1 rt p 1 v r z 1 p 1 v r z 1 p 2 v 0 z 2 where n1 is

when the methane adsorption equilibrium is reached p1 and p2 are the pressures of the reference and sample cells mpa and z1 and z2 are the methane compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells respectively when the nth adsorption equilibrium is reached the increment of the absorbed methane amount corresponding to the balance pressure is as follows 3 δ n n 1 rt p 1 n v r z 1 n p 1 n v r z 1 n p 2 n v 0 z 2 n p 2 n 1 v 0 z 2 n 1 where δ nn mol is the increase in the adsorbed methane at the balance pressure p2 n mpa p1 n and p1 n mpa are the reference cell pressures before and after the nth adsorption experiment z1 n and z2 n 1 are the methane compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells before the nth adsorption experiment and z1 n and z2 n are the methane compressibility factors of the reference and sample cells at the nth adsorption equilibrium respectively p2 n 1 is the n 1th adsorption balance pressure according to eqns 1 and 2 the total adsorbed methane amount mol at p2 n is 4 n n n 1 i 2 n δ n i the adsorbed methane amount per unit mass mol g of shale is 5 q a n n m where m is the mass of the shale samples g data pressure and temperature both of the reference and sample cells were collected every minute in this study when the adsorption reaches equilibrium the fluctuation in the methane adsorption amount is small therefore the instant adsorption methane amount was calculated using the two sets of data in one minute according to eqns 2 5 methane adsorption experiments were conducted on dry and wet samples the results were fitted by the langmuir equation the langmuir equation can be expressed as eqn 6 lu et al 1995 bumb and mckee 1988 ambrose et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 gasparik et al 2012 wang and yu 2016 6 n n max k t p 1 k t p where n mol is the adsorption capacity nmax is the maximum adsorbed amount k t is the temperature dependent langmuir parameter and p mpa is the experimental pressure 2 6 permeability calculation the permeability calculation was adapted from cui et al 2009 for dry shale particles a fairly small unit was supposed as shown in fig 3 as assumed in darcy s law a fluid flows through this unit in δ t the unit is rectangular with a length width and height of δ x δ y and δ z respectively the porosity of the unit φ is a constant the fluid velocities before and after the fluid flows through the unit are vx and vx δ x respectively and the densities of the fluid before and after δ t are ρt and ρt δ t respectively the adsorption capacities of the fluid in the unit before and after δ t are defined as qt and qt δ t respectively the flux change in δ t is 7 f l ρ v x δ x δ y δ z δ t ρ v x δ y δ z δ t the flux increment of the unit in δ t is 8 f i φ ρ t δ t ρ t δ x δ y δ z 1 φ q t δ t q t δ x δ y δ z according to the conservation of mass fl is equal to fi 9 ρ v x v x δ x δ y δ z δ t φ ρ t δ t ρ t 1 φ q t δ t q t δ x δ y δ z eqn 8 can be described as follows 10 ρ v x x φ ρ t 1 φ q t according to darcy s law the velocity v can be described as 11 v k μ p l where k is the permeability of the unit μ is the viscosity of the fluid p is the pressure and l is the length combining eqn 10 and eqn 11 eqn 10 can be described as follows 12 x ρ μ k p x φ ρ t 1 φ q t converted to spherical coordinates eqn 12 can be described as follows 13 1 r 2 r r 2 ρ k μ p r φ ρ t 1 φ q t if the variation in the pressure is fairly small then the coefficients in eqn 13 can be considered constants so 14 dp dt k μ ρ d ρ dp φ 1 φ q ρ 1 r 2 r r 2 p r a new parameter k is defined as 15 k k μ ρ d ρ dp φ 1 φ q ρ k μ

18 ρ p zrt where z is the gas compressibility factor r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature combining eqn 14 with eqn 15 eqn 14 can be described as follows 19 dp dt k r 2 r r 2 p r according to eqn 18 eqn 14 then becomes 20 d ρ dt k r 2 r r 2 ρ r eqn 20 is similar to the diffusion equation so we named k the transport coefficient the apparatus for the methane adsorption experiment in our study is shown in fig 3 the volumes of the reference and sample cells are vr and vs respectively and the volume of shale particles is vb kc is defined as the ratio of the total void space of the reference and sample cells vc vr vs vb to the total void volume of the sample particles 21 k c v c m ρ b φ 1 φ k a where m and ρ b are the mass and bulk density respectively of the sample vc can also be obtained by the helium expansion experiment as discussed in section 2 5 where vc is equal to v0 when the methane adsorption is at equilibrium ρc0 is defined as the average methane density mol m3 22 ρ c 0 ρ r 0 v r ρ 0 v s v b v r v s v b where ρr0 is the initial gas density mol m3 in the reference cell and ρ 0 is the initial density in the sample cell according to carslaw and jeager 1947 the gas density in the total void space of the reference and sample cells vc is 23 ρ ρ c 0 ρ c 0 ρ 0 k c 1 6 k c ρ c 0 ρ 0 n 1 e k α n 2 t r a 2 1 k c 2 α n 2 9 k c 1 where ra is the radius of the particle αn is the nth root of 24 tan α 3 α 3 k c α 2 here f is introduced as follows 25 f 1 k c 1 ρ c 0 ρ 0 ρ c 0 ρ 6 k c k c 1 n 1 e k α n 2 t r a 2 1 k c 2 α n 2 9 k c 1 eqn 25 can be

instant gas density in the sample cell f r 1 k c ρ c 0 ρ ρ c 0 ρ 0 in eqn 26 1 is interpreted as the mass fraction of gas in the void volume of the reference and sample cells that will eventually be taken up by the sample particles relative to the total gas that can be taken by the sample cui et al 2009 fr is the ratio of the difference between the final and instant methane adsorption amounts to the final methane adsorption amounts therefore f can be obtained by eqns 26 1 and 26 2 according to eqn 25 the logarithmic value of f becomes a linear function of time 27 ln f f 0 s 1 t where s1 is the slope of the straight line 28 s 1 k α 1 2 r a 2 f0 is the y intercept of the straight line 29 f 0 ln 6 k c k c 1 k c 2 α 1 2 9 k c 1 and α1 is the first root of eqn 24 then the permeability can be derived from eqns 15 and 28 as 30 k r a 2 φ 1 φ k a μ c g s 1 α 1 2 for wet shale particles the sample porosity is defined as 31 φ w φ v w v s where φ is the porosity of the dry samples vw is the water volume cm3 and vs is the sample volume cm3 water can affect methane adsorption on shales and the permeability can be derived from the dynamic data of the methane adsorption process therefore the permeability calculation procedure of wet samples is similar to that of dry shale and the difference in permeability caused by water is included in the data 2 7 water film thickness calculation method when shales get wet water is adsorbed in the shale pores and forms water films water film will influence the microstructure methane adsorption capacity and permeability of the samples the pores in the shales may be slit or capillary as discussed in section 3 2 the pores in the samples of this study are considered narrow slits according to the lpa of the n2 isotherm hysteresis loop type li et al 2016 2017 have discussed the water film thickness in pores of different types including single flat surface slit and cylinder pore therefore here the method which calculates water film thickness in slit pores was used according to li et al 2016 the disjoining pressure between the water film and surface on which the water is adsorbed π1 the interaction between the water film and opposite surface π2 and the interaction between two films adsorbed on opposite walls π3 are considered the force πslit in the slit pores containing the water film h 32 π slit π 1 π 2 π 3 the disjoining pressure π1 consists of the london van der waals force πm electrical force πe and structural force πs derjaguin et al 1987 πm can be expressed as eqn 33 33 π m a h h 3 where ah is the hamaker constant in a gas water solid system and the characteristic value is 10 21 10 20 j the electrical force πe is starov et al 2007 34 π e ε ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 h 2 where ε is the relative dielectric permittivity of a liquid f m ε0 is the electric constant in vacuum f m and ζ1 and ζ2 are the electric potentials of the solid liquid and liquid air interfaces respectively in mv the potential difference between the water solid interface and the water air interface is δ ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 40 80 mv under contact angles 20 chureav 1995a b mattia et al 2012 the structural force πs can be expressed as starov et al 2007 35 π s ke h λ where k is the coefficient for the strength of the structural force in n m2 and λ is the characteristic length of water molecules in nm in this study the values k 0 1 10 7 n m2 and λ 1 2 nm churaev 1995a b were used for calculation therefore π1 is 36 π 1 π m π e π s a h h 3 ε ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 h 2 ke h λ the interaction forces π2 and π3 can be expressed as tuller et al 1999 churaev et al 2000 37 π 2 a h h h 3 ε ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 h h 2 38 π 3 a h h h 3 where h is the width of pores in nm and ah is the hamaker constant for liquid gas liquid interactions in j ah ranges from 1 3 10 21 j to 1 9 10 21 j tuller et al 1999 churaev et al 2000 3 experiment results 3 1 mineral composition and organic matter content the percentages of the dominant minerals such as quartz pyrite calcite albite microcline siderite and ankerite were obtained from xrd table 1 lists the results of the xrd experiments and shows the mineral composition and organic matter content of the samples all three samples show a high quartz content in addition the total clay content is also high 31 49 the toc values of the samples are 0 66 0 67 and 2 76 and the similar ro values of the samples indicate similar thermal maturities the specific clay mineral contents of the samples are shown in table 2 illite smectite accounts for a large proportion of the clay mineral content i e 52 63 followed by kaolinite 3 2 pore size distribution the low pressure co2 adsorption results are shown in fig 4 based on the categories of sing et al 1985 the isotherms are typical type i isotherms sample c015 has the largest adsorption capacity i e 0 8208 cm3 g and is followed by samples c027 and c034 which have capacities of 0 4263 and 0 334 cm3 g respectively correspondingly sample c015 has a higher micropore volume than c027 and c034 table 3 the low pressure n2 adsorption results are shown in fig 5 in contrast to the lpa of co2 the isotherm hysteresis loops were obtained by the lpa of n2 c027 has the highest adsorption amount i e 10 405 cm3 g and c015 and c034 have lower adsorption amounts of 8 4134 and 7 0781 cm3 g respectively correspondingly c027 has the largest mesopore volume and c015 and c034 have lower mesopore volumes table 3 according to the iupac hysteresis loop type classification sing et al 1985 all the isotherms are type h4 which accounts for multilayer adsorption according to de boer 1958 and the iupac rouquerol et al 1994 the mesopore geometry of the samples is characterized by narrow slits brunauer et al 1940 sing et al 1985 table 3 shows the parameters obtained by lpa and micp the bulk density skeletal density and macropore volume were determined by micp the total porosity was calculated by the combination of lpa of co2 microporosity and n2 mesoporosity and micp macroporosity in addition the psds of the dry samples are shown in fig 6 3 3 water saturation of the samples under different relative humidities in this study shales are divided into two groups dry samples and wet samples wet samples were moisturized according to the procedure described in section 2 4 under a temperature of 25 and rh of 65 85 or 95 water saturation s is defined as the ratio of the volume of liquid water to the total volume of the sample table 4 shows the water saturation of the samples at different rh s 3 4 methane adsorption experiments the results of the methane adsorption experiments including the langmuir fitted equations r2 correlation coefficients and nmax and k t values are shown in table 5 and the adsorption isotherms of the samples are shown in fig 7 the experimental data are well fitted to the langmuir fitting data with an average correlation coefficient of 0 992 and the best fit result with a correlation coefficient of 0 999 was obtained for c015 at rh 95 nmax significantly decreased with increasing water saturation table 5 which indicates that the methane adsorption capacity of the shale samples decreased due to the existence of water 3 5 permeability permeability of dry and wet samples were determined following the calculation method described in section 2 6 the calculation parameters are shown in table 6 ka was the premise for determining the methane adsorption equilibrium according to cui et al 2009 when ka is 0 05 the calculation method is more accurate ka is determined as the derivative of the adsorbate density with respect to the gas density and the density of the adsorbate and free gas of the cells can be calculated by the pressure and temperature which are monitored every minute in the process of methane adsorption experiments therefore ka can be determined and other parameters can be obtained ra is the radius of the samples and here the value of ra is 0 000125 m the important parameter s1 is the slop of the straight line of lnf and t eqn 27 as shown in fig 8 the calculated permeability of crushed shale samples in this study is usually lower than the results of shale cores cheng and yu 2019 measured the permeability of dry shale cores ranged from 3 21 to 7 29 10 3 md the permeability of dry shale cores in the study of zhang and yu 2019 is about 10 2 10 3 md fractures are the main reason for higher permeability of shale cores than crushed shale in addition the permeability of shale cores is calculated by darcy s law under the experimental pressure lower than 2 mpa according to zhang and yu 2019 the permeability of shale cores decrease with the water content and drop to 10 8 md when the samples are almost saturated the result is similar to our study because the fractures in shale cores are blocked by water 3 6 water film thickness according to li et al 2016 churaev 1995a b churaev et al 2000 tuller et al 1999 starov et al 2007 and mattia et al 2012 the parameters values in the water film thickness calculation are listed in table 7 the specific water film thickness of the samples under different relative humidity is shown in fig 9 when the calculated water film thickness is bigger than the pore width fine pores are regarded as fully filled by water the water film thickness is considered as same as the pore width so in fig 9 the water film thickness increases firstly with pore width and gradually stabilizes when the water film thickness is less than the pore width according to the values the porosity of the moisturized samples can be calculated and the results are shown in table 8 4 discussions 4 1 methane adsorption the methane adsorption capacity averagely dropped by 46 8 for sample c015 by 46 55 for sample c027 and by 54 3 for sample c034 after sample wetting fig 7 the adsorption capacity was reduced by 80 90 in the study of li et al 2016 and by 19 7 5 3 to 36 1 6 1 in the study of wang and yu 2016 several experiments have indicated that the methane adsorption capacity of wet shales should be 40 90 less than that of dry shales ross and bustin 2009 gasparik et al 2014 the change trends of the wet sample isotherms are gentler than the dry sample isotherms and the isotherm inflection points are more obvious for the wet samples than for the dry samples the methane adsorption amount of wet samples is less than that of dry samples but there is no significant difference in methane adsorption among wet samples rh 65 85 and 95 the change trends among the isotherms of the wet samples vary slightly 4 2 permeability of the samples under different experimental pressures the permeability of the samples under different experimental pressures are shown in fig 10 the permeability of the wet samples is lower than that of the dry samples but there are no significant variations among the permeability of wet samples under different water saturation values 4 3 relationship between permeability and water saturation the average value of permeability under different pressures in table 6 was chosen as the permeability of each sample as shown in fig 11 the permeability of the samples declined with water saturation and the relationship between permeability and water saturation fits well with the exponential equation k a e bs the fitted equations and correlation coefficients are shown in table 9 permeability significantly declined by approximately one order of magnitude after the wetting of samples the permeability of wet samples decreased by approximately 74 4 to 89 3 compared with dry samples but there was no obvious reduction trend among the wet samples the porosity change is considered to be the reason for the permeability reduction in the wet samples compared with the dry samples as shown in table 8 porosity was reduced by 22 1 41 8 for sample c015 by 17 2 42 6 for sample c027 and by 13 3 35 8 for sample c034 after samples became wet the porosity reduction between rh 65 and 85 was similar but the porosity change was obvious when rh 95 in addition connectivity loss and pore collapse can be caused by water davudov and moghanloo 2018 indicated that connectivity loss can be expressed as the main reason for a significant permeability reduction when porosity change is limited therefore water affects permeability by influencing pore structure 4 4 psds of moisturized samples the water film thickness was calculated from the equations in section 3 6 combining the pore size distribution discussed in section 3 2 the psds pore diameter 50 nm of the samples under different water saturations can be obtained as shown in fig 12 because the change in pore volume is very small when the pore diameter is large only psds with pore diameters 50 nm are shown from the calculation results fig 9 water only influenced small pores pores under 1 7 nm 2 4 nm and 3 5 nm were filled completely by water when rh 65 rh 85 and rh 95 respectively other scholars have reported similar results li et al 2017 found that pores 6 7 nm were completely blocked by capillary water and wang and yu 2016 indicated that pores of approximately 2 7 nm were filled by water in this study the proportion of pore volume occupied by water was 20 when the pore width was larger than 10 nm this is the reason why permeability methane adsorption amount and porosity were not greatly affected by the increase of water saturation from rh 65 to rh 95 4 5 permeability reduction the permeability of samples c015 c027 and c034 decreased by 80 3 76 0 and 83 9 respectively after sample wetting the relationships between the permeability reductions and total clay content and surface area values of the samples are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the permeability reduction increased with the total clay content and specific surface area clay minerals are hydrophilic feng et al 2018 pang et al 2017 and water adsorption on shales is strengthened by the presence of nanometer sized pores and related large specific surface areas in addition the swelling of clay minerals caused by water can result in porosity and permeability reductions grahama et al 2002 aksu et al 2015 zhang and yu 2016 therefore permeability decreases as the total clay content and specific surface area increase 5 conclusions a series of experiments were conducted to compare the permeability of dry and moisturized crushed shale samples mineral and organic matter contents were measured and the sample psds were analyzed shale samples were moisturized at rh values of 65 85 and 95 and the permeability both of the dry and moisturized samples was calculated using dynamic data from methane adsorption experiments from the results and discussions the permeability of the moisturized samples were found to decrease significantly by approximately 74 4 to 89 3 compared with the permeability of the dry samples the relationship between permeability and water saturation conforms to an exponential equation well k a e bs porosity reduction was the main reason for permeability reduction porosity was reduced by 22 1 41 8 for sample c015 by 17 2 42 6 for sample c027 and by 13 3 35 8 for sample c034 after sample wetting losses in connectivity caused by water can also reduce permeability however the change of permeability of the moisturized samples were not obvious when rh 65 85 and 95 the permeability of sample c015 were 3 25 3 22 and 3 83 10 8md respectively the permeability of sample c027 were 3 02 2 54 and 3 06 10 8 md respectively and the permeability of sample c034 were 3 34 2 25 and 4 56 10 8 md respectively the permeability dose not decrease with the water saturation as expectation water film thickness is considered the main reason for the unobvious permeability differences among the moisturized samples the water film thickness of samples under different water saturation values was calculated pores under 1 7 nm 2 4 nm and 3 5 nm were filled totally by water when rh 65 rh 85 and rh 95 respectively only extremely tiny pores were found to be fully filled by water even when rh 95 and the proportion of pore volume occupied by water was 20 when the pore width was above 10 nm little differences were observed in the effect of water on pore structures under different rh values therefore the difference in permeability among wet samples was not prominent in addition the reduction in permeability was greater as the total clay content and surface area of the samples increased which is related to the influence of clay minerals and specific surface area on the hydrophilicity of shales a series of work have been done in this work to improve the accuracy of the complicated experiments and calculation for the sample moisturizing experiments many pre experiments have been conducted to determine the appropriate relative humidity and the suitable experimental duration for the methane adsorption experiments air tightness of the apparatus must be examined before every group of experiment helium is used to get the precise void volume of the sample cell the experimental duration must be long enough to ensure a complete adsorption reaction for permeability calculation late time data of the adsorption experiments when ka is below 0 05 are chosen to make the calculation the data are recorded every minute to ensure the data amount is huge enough to make regular results however the method in this work still has limitations only crushed shale samples which are conceptualized as spherical particles not shales under natural conditions are studied the water saturation range and experimental pressure and temperature are limited therefore more rigorous experiments need to be conducted to make more accurate results credit authorship contribution statement milei wang methodology investigation validation

5213,long lead time streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management in both the short and long terms despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead time forecasting capabilities of these methods and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms in this work an artificial neural network ann and a long short term memory lstm a powerful tool for learning long term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead time period for long lead time streamflow forecasting a recursive forecasting procedure which takes the last one step ahead forecast as a new input for the next step ahead forecast is used in the ann and lstm forecasting systems two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the nan river basin and ping river basin thailand covering the period 1974 to 2014 to further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance two parameters i e the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs are examined in the ann and lstm models the main findings are highlighted here first with an optimal setting up of model parameters both the ann and lstm model can provide accurate daily forecasting up to 20 days ahead second in comparison to the ann model the lstm model exhibits better model performance in long lead time daily forecasting but less satisfactory in multi monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset third the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ann and lstm modelling are the key for long lead time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales these findings suggest that the lstm could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management keywords streamflow forecast artificial neural network long short term memory long

milly et al 2005 nourani and komasi 2013 xiao et al 2019 numerous hydrological models have been developed for forecasting streamflow however owing to numerous sources of uncertainty involved in streamflow forecasting these models have limited forecasting capability in capturing the non stationary and non linearity characteristics of hydrologic datasets nourani et al 2011 shortridge et al 2016 yaseen et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 to deal with uncertainties in streamflow forecasting ensemble streamflow forecasting is widely used in hydrological forecasting cloke and pappenberger 2009 pappenberger et al 2012 fan et al 2014 duan et al 2019 one advantage of ensemble streamflow forecasting is that it contains a number of forecast scenarios for explicitly characterizing forecast uncertainties an ensemble prediction system could recognise the uncertainty in the initial conditions and perturb them to produce several initial states emerton et al 2016 boelee et al 2019 this allows streamflow forecast driven by uncertainty to be assessed and forecast lead times to be extended boelee et al 2019 boelee et al 2017 for example alfieri et al 2013 proposed a global flood awareness system glofas it detected probabilistic exceedance of warning thresholds and utilized ensemble streamflow predictions to provide upcoming flood forecasts in large world river basins however it is still difficult to evaluate probabilistic forecasts by relying on a large number of flood scenarios and this unavoidably raises computational challenges cloke and pappenberger 2009 therefore accurate streamflow forecasting in both the short and long terms remains still a challenging task in recent decades the use of data driven techniques of machine learning methods such as neural networks nns nourani and komasi 2013 noori and kalin 2016 support vector machines svms sudheer et al 2014 rasouli et al 2012 yaseen et al 2016 adnan et al 2019 fuzzy logic alvisi and franchini 2011 and wavelet transform wt kisi and cimen 2011 fang et al 2019 have received considerable attention for streamflow forecasting in applications various studies have shown that machine learning methods are capable of capturing non linear processes numerically with no knowledge of the underlying physical processes involved yaseen et al 2015 rathinasamy et al 2013 prasad et al 2017 alvisi and franchini 2011 among these machine learning methods artificial neural network ann as a self learning and self adaptive function approximator has shown great ability in modelling nonlinear hydrologic datasets nourani and komasi 2013 the anns can recognize the nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs and well reproduce strongly nonlinear relationships especially in case that these relationships are not known or cannot be made explicit a priori alvisi and franchini 2011 the anns have been extensively applied to forecast streamflow at various lead times such as forecasting one day ahead river flow in the semiarid mountain region by he et al 2014 forecasting daily lake levels up to 3 days ahead by kisi et al 2012 and predicting river flow for 5 days ahead by badrzadeh et al 2013 although widely used some drawbacks associated with anns such as over fitting shortridge et al 2016 sun et al 2014 and convergence to local minima guo et al 2011 kalra et al 2013 make it difficult to achieve a satisfactory forecasting performance for a long lead time in dealing with time series hydrological processes most recently long short term memory lstm has gained significant attention among hydrologists lstm introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 has proved to be a powerful tool for addressing time series prediction problems hu et al 2019 compared to classical nns lstms are able to capture both the periodic and chaotic behaviours of time series data and learn their long range dependencies with greater accuracy mouatadid et al 2019 for example kratzert et al 2018 successfully adopted the lstm model to describe the rainfall runoff behaviour of a large number of complex catchments at daily scale ni et al 2019 developed two hybrid models based on the traditional lstm model for monthly streamflow and rainfall forecasting results proved that lstm was applicable for time series prediction in addition hu et al 2018 demonstrated that the lstm model outperformed the ann model for flood forecasting up to 6 h ahead similarly le et al 2019 explored the capabilities of the ann and lstm models for forecasting the one day two day and three day ahead flowrate at hoa binh the results revealed that the lstm model could learn long term dependencies between sequential data series and exhibited good performance in flood forecasting while research on the ann and lstm models in the field of streamflow forecasting has developed rapidly some shortcomings still persist first most research focuses on streamflow forecast at a specific time scale such as daily or monthly and lacks a systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms yaseen et al 2015 second to obtain streamflow forecasting at different lead times most studies have to construct multi models with different pairs of inputs and outputs at a few successive lags hu et al 2018 nourani and partoviyan 2018 for example nourani 2017 constructed three kinds of relationships in three models to obtain the forecasting values at the lead times of 2 4 and 7 days respectively although up to 6 8 day ahead or 1 2 month ahead streamflow forecasts was achieved in some research fathian et al 2019 it is not only time consuming to build multi models but also remains unknown for model performance in longer lead time forecasting third parameter setting in machine learning methods is the key technology in model development especially for the impact of the time lag length on streamflow forecasting dehghani et al 2015 however investigations of parameter settings among those models are rarely explored the purpose of this paper is to identify the robust modelling approach from two popular machine methods namely ann and lstm especially for the long lead time forecasting capability through assessing both modelling accuracy and precision at daily and monthly scales two models are applied into two realistic cases the nan river basin nrb and ping river basin prb two of main subbasins of chao phraya river basin cprb the heart of thailand the main objectives of this paper are 1 to investigate the parameter settings on model forecasting performance at daily and monthly scales and enable a screening of the best setting of parameters to attain an accurate model 2 to explore the forecasting capabilities of machine learning methods for a long lead time at daily and monthly scales 3 to compare model forecasting results at daily and monthly scales provide a deep insight into the quality of model forecast and explore the way in which various processes are represented the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations for multi step ahead streamflow forecast strategy are briefly formulated and the daily and monthly forecast models ann and lstm are introduced in detail section 3 presents the study area nan river basin and ping river basin as well as model development for streamflow forecasting forecasting performance of two models in daily and monthly scales is described in section 4 finally in section 5 conclusions are presented 2 methodology in this paper the long lead time streamflow forecasting is conducted using both ann and lstm at daily and monthly scales the ann and lstm models are developed for forecasting streamflow at several lead times such as 1 20 days and 1 12 months in the model development the model for one step ahead forecasting is first obtained in the training process then a recursive strategy is adopted in the trained models so that the multi step ahead forecast can be achieved the following sections provide a detailed description of the one step ahead and multi step ahead daily monthly streamflow forecasting strategy 2 1 multi step ahead daily and monthly streamflow forecast strategy 2 1 1 one step ahead daily and monthly streamflow forecast in general a streamflow forecasting model f is used to provide the predictive streamflow q t 1 in a specified time scale such as daily or monthly based on historical climatic records it is generally known that streamflow generation processes are influenced by many factors including rainfall evaporation temperature etc guo et al 2011 as rainfall a natural process that has a high degree of variability in both time and space is the key factor for streamflow this paper focuses on developing a streamflow forecasting model depending on rainfall given a series of rainfall observation r t m 1 r t r t 1 where m is the length of time lag a one step ahead streamflow forecast can be given as 1 q t 1 f r t m 1 r t r t 1 where q t 1 represents the predictive streamflow at time t 1 r denotes rainfall dataset f is a forecasting model in order to obtain a satisfactory forecast accuracy a key problem is how to choose the length of lagged inputs m in eq 1 enough high quality observed inputs enable the pattern detection between rainfall and runoff however the length of inputs is limited by availability of measurements in practice in addition as the lagged time length m increases so too does the number of inputs and the complexity of the forecasting model developed bowden et al 2005 in this paper an investigation of impacts of the time lag length on model forecasting performance is conducted in section 4 1 1 and section 4 2 1 2 1 2 multi step ahead daily and monthly streamflow forecast the multi step ahead time series forecasting can be described as an estimation on future time series q t h where h 1 h h is the total of predictive steps also called the lead time the most popular forecasting strategy is the recursive also called iterated strategy taieb et al 2010 bontempi et al 2012 in this study to achieve the multi step ahead streamflow forecast a single forecasting model f is trained to perform a one step ahead forecast in section 2 1 1 after the learning process the multi step ahead streamflow can be predicted using 2 q t h f r t m 1 r t r t 1 h 1 f r t m h r t 1 q t 1 q t h 1 h 2 m 1 f q t m h 1 q t h 1 h m 2 h where h is the total of predictive steps also the length of lead time m is the length of time lag the last equation in 2 is used for streamflow forecasting when the rainfall data is not available during the predictive period in this paper the multi step ahead streamflow forecast q t h at daily and monthly scales is obtained as following steps 1 splitting a series of rainfall and runoff datasets into training datasets x training y training the training period t 0 t p and validation datasets x validated y validated the validation period t p

step ahead streamflow by the trained model in step 3 6 combining the one step ahead streamflow forecast in step 5 and the available rainfall records as new inputs and repeating the step 5 to obtain the second step ahead streamflow forecast 7 repeating the steps 6 and 5 to forecast h step ahead streamflow in eq 2 during t p t n in this work the ann and lstm models are selected as the forecasting model f in eqs 1 and 2 for daily and monthly streamflow forecasting in a recursive strategy as shown in fig 1 details in algorithm 1 which is introduced in detail in section 2 2 and section 2 3

streamflow forecast ann a mathematical model of biologically inspired system provides a novel and appealing solution to the problem of relating input and output variables in complex systems basheer and hajmeer 2000 it requires no information about the underlying complex physical process while constructing black box models of complex and nonlinear relationships between the input and output variables in general an ann model consists of three typical layers each layer processes a series of neurons which are fully connected with those of the following layer as illustrated in fig s1 in the supplementary material the first layer is the input layer that receives the input data the hidden layer is the information processing section which uses weights to achieve nonlinear transformation between the connection links to determine the output the output layer receives the processed information from the last hidden layer and then outputs the result the ann model can be mathematically formulated as 3 y k σ k j 1 m w kj σ j i 1 n w ij x i b j b k where x i represents the input value at the neuron i y k is the output value at the neuron k σ k and σ j denote the activation function for the hidden and output layers respectively m and n are the number of neurons at the input and hidden layers respectively w ij is the weight between the input neuron i and the hidden neuron j w kj is the weight between the hidden neuron j and the output neuron k b j and b k are biases of the j th neuron at the hidden layer and k th neuron at the output layer respectively to achieve appropriate performance of anns the parameters for example the number of neurons weights and biases between layers and the number of iterations should be optimized in this study a four layer ann network that consists of one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer is established the sigmoid function f a 1 1 exp a and the hyperbolic tangent function f a tanh a are employed between the layers levenberg marquardt algorithm asadi et al 2013 alizadeh et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 is selected as the optimization algorithm for training the ann model which is a way to adjust the parameters consisting of weights w and bias b between layers referring to multi step ahead forecast steps in section 2 1 2 the ann forecasting approach at daily and monthly scales as shown in fig 1 is summarized in algorithm 1 2 3 long short term memory model lstm for daily and monthly streamflow forecast the lstm architecture is composed of special units called memory blocks in the recurrent hidden layers each memory block contains the self connected memory cells and multiplicative units the memory cells are used to store the temporal state of the networks the multiplicative units including the input output and forget gates controls the flow of information between the cells the input gate is responsible for controlling the flow of inputs into the memory cell while the output gate conducts the output flow of cell activations the forget gate scales the internal state of the cell fig s2 in the supplementary material shows the information flow through a lstm cell the lstm transition equations are written below 4 f s σ w f h s 1 x s b f 5 i s σ w i h s 1 x s b i 6 c s tanh w c h s 1 x s b c 7 c s f s c s 1 i s c s 8 o s σ w o h s 1 x s b o 9 h s o s tanh c s where i s o s and f s are the input output and forget gates respectively w i w o w f and w c represent the weights for each gate b i b o b f and b c are the bias terms σ denotes the logistic sigmoid function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function is the scalar product of two vectors c s represents the cell state c s is the updated cell state x s and h s are the cell input and output respectively in this study the lstm forecasting approach consists of one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer the lstm is trained based on truncated back propagation through time bptt which uses a back propagation network to update the parameters in iterations werbos 1990 referring to multi step ahead forecast steps in section 2 1 2 the lstm model forecasting at daily and monthly scales similar to that of the ann forecasting approach is described in fig 1 and algorithm 1 3 application 3 1 study area the chao phraya river basin cprb the heart of thailand is the center of rice production and the region economy wichakul et al 2013 nan river basin nrb and ping river basin prb were selected as two study sites as shown in fig 2 the first study site nrb as one of major subbasins of cprb covers an area of 11 950 km 2 kinouchi et al 2018 the cprb located in the heart of thailand is the center of rice production and the region economy wichakul et al 2013 nan river basin nrb as one of major subbasins of cprb covers the area of 11 950 km 2 kinouchi et al 2018 this basin includes the third largest dam reservoir sirikit dam reservoir in thailand as shown in fig 2 the function of sirikit dam reservoir is to supply domestic water irrigation and power generation the river flow through the center of nan province and drains into the reservoir the basin is in a subtropical monsoon region with relatively abundant rainfall and a humid climate from may to september the average annual precipitation over the basin is 900 2000 mm to determine the relationship between rainfall and runoff streamflow into the sirikit dam reservoir and rainfall data from gauges as shown in fig 2 were collected at daily and monthly scales from 1974 to 2014 the introduction and results of streamflow forecasts at the second study site prb are provided in the supplementary material 3 2 daily and monthly model development in this study the ann and lstm models are employed to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales the daily and monthly dataset are split into the separations of training and validation datasets as shown in table 1 the model inputs are the available observed rainfall and predicted streamflow output from the previous time levels t m 1 t as shown in eq 2 the targeted output is the streamflow at the time level t 1 all datasets were scaled to the range of 0 1 to match the consistency of machine learning based models and rescaled back to the original values after the model simulation zhang et al 2018 to evaluate the model parameter impact different setups of model parameters are employed in the ann and lstm models during training period in both daily and monthly forecasting the parameters settings used in two models are summarized in table 2 3 3 model performance evaluation the performance of the ann and lstm forecasting models developed in this study is assessed using various standard statistical performance evaluation criteria the statistical measures used here are the root mean squared error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of correlation cc taylor 1990 and the mean absolute error mae legates and mccabe 1999 these indicators can be defined as follows 1 root mean squared error rmse 10 rmse i 1 n q i s q i o n 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 11 nse 1 i 1 n q i o q i s 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 3 coefficient of correlation cc 12 cc i 1 n q i s q s q i o q o i 1 n q i s q s 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 4 mean absolute error mae 13 mae 1 n i 1 n q i s q i o where q i s and q i o are the i th forecasting and observed streamflow respectively q s and q o are the average forecasting and observed streamflow n is the number of datasets 4 results and discussions in this section the observed streamflow in the sirikit dam reservoir is compared with forecasting streamflow from the ann and lstm models combined with different model parameters at daily and monthly scales over the validation period 4 1 daily streamflow forecast 4 1 1 modelling parameter optimization in daily streamflow forecast a number of ann and lstm modelling cases have been set up with varying parameters the length of the time lag and the maximum epoch number the impact of modelling parameters used in ann and lstm on results is demonstrated in fig 3 and fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the average rmse in the boxes is gradually decreased when the length of the time lag increases from 1 day to 10 days and then remains almost the same 220 m 3 s when the time lag exceeds 10 days in ann modelling while the length of the time lag has a slight effect on results of lstm modelling fig 4 shows that the average values of rmse in both the ann and lstm models exhibit a rising trend when the maximum epoch number increases the impact of the number of lagged days and epochs used in ann and lstm modelling is further estimated by the map of the rmse of the forecasting daily streamflow results shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material where the box is masked from green to blue in fig s3 a and b it is observed that the lstm model achieves better forecast performance than ann models the lowest and highest rmse outlined in red for ann modelling are 149 25 m 3 s and 271 51 m 3 s respectively while for lstm modelling 118 51 m 3 s and 199 22 m 3 s respectively the optimal settings of the lagged days and the maximum epoch number are provided in table 3 the best statistical result of ann modelling in one step ahead forecast is achieved with the time lag 10 days and epochs 200 for lstm modelling the best statistical results are obtained for 25 days and 10 respectively overall the ann and lstm models exhibit different forecasting performance with varying parameter settings it can be concluded that 1 an optimal time lag can be selected to improve the ann performance 2 the effects of the length of time lag for the lstm model are uncertain in one day ahead forecast and 3 the increase of the number of epochs deteriorates the ann and lstm performance in one day ahead forecast 4 1 2 one day ahead streamflow forecast fig 5 shows the daily hydrographs at sirikit dam reservoir in one day ahead forecast from 2007 to 2010 using optimal parameters in table 3 as shown in fig 5 it can be noticed that the forecasting streamflow exhibits good agreement with the observed streamflow the streamflow forecast using the ann and lstm models could capture the daily variability but underestimates the streamflow in the dry season while overestimates it in the wet season by using lstm model the predicted streamflow shows a reduction of overestimation in the wet season compared to that using the ann model and exhibits a good match with the observations in fig 5 a comparison between the ann and lstm models indicates that the lstm model performs better than the ann model in daily streamflow forecasting for example the r 2 is 0 86 for lstm modelling while it is 0 76 in 2008 streamflow forecast for ann modelling in addition it is noted that the number of epochs required for lstm model convergence is much smaller than the ann model while the number of the time lag has little effect on lstm model results this indicates that the lstm model is more robust and can extract nonlinearity characteristics of data more efficiently zhang et al 2018 in comparison to the ann model 4 1 3 multi day ahead streamflow forecast the ann and lstm models have been further applied to multi day ahead streamflow forecasting the comparative plots of the forecasting results obtained from the ann and lstm models at the lead time 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 day and 5 day are shown in fig 6 it can be observed that a relatively good agreement between the observed and forecasting streamflow especially the streamflow peak is achieved at the lead time 1 day and 2 day with increasing the lead time the arrival time of forecasting streamflow peaks becomes slightly delayed which is caused by the accumulation of forecast errors compared with low streamflow simulation of the lstm model from 5 october 2008 to 26 october 2008 the streamflow peaks of the ann model are generally higher than observed streamflow in addition the predicted streamflow exhibits abnormal fluctuations in the ann simulation four indicators rmse nse cc and mae are chosen to evaluate the multi day ahead forecast performance during the validation period from 18 november 2007 to 20 february 2011 the corresponding evaluation of forecasting streamflow results during the lead times of 1 20 days is illustrated in fig 7 it can be seen that the lstm model generally outperforms the ann model with the smaller rmse and mae in fig 7 a and d and higher nse and cc especially at the longer lead times in fig 7 b and c it is also visible that the predicted accuracy of the ann and lstm models decays as the forecasting horizon extends further in time i e with the increasing lead time length as the lead time increases from 1 to 20 days the rmse and mae in ann modelling increase approximately by 254 and 232 respectively while in lstm modelling the rmse and mae increase approximately by 291 and 215 respectively the nse ranges between 0 1 and 0 68 for the ann model while between 0 33 and 0 78 for the lstm model the cc decreases from 0 83 to 0 59 for the ann model and from 0 89 and 0 64 for the lstm model as the lead time increases the results suggest that the forecasting performance for the lstm model is better than that of the ann model for long lead time daily forecasting which may be explained by the model structure for lstm model it processes the time series datasets as a sequence and one element as input at a time and the past temporal information is stored in the memory cell which helps the lstm model to capture datasets trend and to exhibit more powerful forecasting capability than the ann model zhang et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 this enables a memory mechanism in the lstm model where the network uses information about past calculations from a few past steps to inform the decision of whether or not this information should be passed along to the next iteration mouatadid et al 2019 as the lstm model processes the input data in many time steps the input data are used to update a number of parameters in the lstm internal memory cell states in every step during a training period during the prediction period the memory cell states depend only on the input at a specific time step and the states from the last time step kratzert et al 2018 however the ann model does not have a temporal memory and the inputs in the model are assumed to be independent of each other so that it is difficult to recognise temporal changes de la fuente et al 2019 therefore memory cells in the model structure help the lstm model capture datasets trend and exhibit more powerful forecasting capability than the ann model 4 2 monthly streamflow forecast 4 2 1 modelling parameter optimization in monthly streamflow forecast for optimal setting up of modelling parameters used in ann and lstm we have undertaken a number of test cases with varying the time lag length and epoch number the error estimate of results with different modelling parameters has been plotted in fig 8 and fig 9 as shown in fig 8 it can be noticed that the average rmse in the boxes is diminishing rapidly as the length of the time lag rises from 1 month to 5 months in ann modelling while the length of the time lag has no obvious impact on results in lstm modelling in contrast the average values of rmse exhibit a descending trend when the maximum number of epochs increases in lstm modelling however there is no obvious trend of epochs effecting on ann modelling in fig 9 fig s4 in the supplementary material shows the map of the rmse of the forecasting daily streamflow results in ann and lstm modelling by comparing fig s4 a and b it is obvious that the ann model is sensitive to the time lag selection while the lstm model is more susceptible to the maximum epoch number for example in ann modelling the rsme of results is increased from 3800 m 3 s blue box to 1500 m 3 s yellow box when the time lag rises from 1 to 5 months with a fixed maximum epoch number in fig s4 a similarly in fig s4 b the performance of the lstm model becomes better when the maximum epoch number gradually increases from 10 to 50 with the time lag 1 month the lowest and highest rmse outlined in red for the ann model are 1660 16 m 3 s and 3738 63 m 3 s respectively while those of the lstm model are 1698 97 m 3 s and 2535 57 m 3 s respectively the highest accuracy statistics of the ann and lstm models at monthly scale are given in table 4 the best statistical result of the ann model in one month ahead forecast is achieved with the time lag 4 months and epochs 500 for the lstm model the time lag and maximum epoch numbers are 2 months and 50 respectively the results indicate that the ann model is comparable to the lstm model in monthly streamflow forecast overall for the influence of different parameter settings on the ann and lstm model performance it can be concluded that 1 increasing the time lag could improve the ann model accuracy in one month ahead forecast while remain inconspicuous for the lstm model and 2 the increase of maximum epochs could improve the lstm accuracy but remains uncertain for the ann model in one month ahead forecast 4 2 2 one month ahead streamflow forecast fig 10 displays the monthly hydrographs at sirikit dam reservoir in one month ahead forecast from year 2004 to 2012 using the optimal parameters in table 4 it is shown in fig 10 that the forecasting streamflow exhibits good agreement with the observed streamflow the ann and lstm models not only capture the monthly streamflow variability but also successfully predict the low streamflow in dry season during the validation period from april of 2004 to december of 2013 the r 2 is 0 94 and 0 95 for the ann and lstm models respectively 4 2 3 multi month ahead streamflow forecasting the ann and lstm models have been further applied to multi month ahead streamflow forecasting fig 11 gives the comparative plots of the forecasting results obtained from the ann and lstm models at the lead time 1 month 2 month and 3 month one observes a relatively good match between the observed and forecasting streamflow from two models in the first and second month ahead forecast low streamflow is accurately forecasted and high streamflow events are also properly captured although the arrival time of forecasting streamflow peaks is slightly delayed in multi month ahead forecasting again four indicators are used to evaluate the multi month ahead forecast performance during the validation period from april of 2004 to december of 2014 the results from these indicators for the forecast performance at the lead times of 1 12 months are illustrated in fig 12 it is seen that as the lead time length increases from 1 to 12 months the rmse and mae of results in ann modelling increase approximately by 499 and 457 respectively while in lstm modelling approximately by 442 and 425 respectively bearing in mind that nse 0 indicates the model forecasts are unreliable we can see that the lstm model can perform accurately streamflow forecast only for a one month lead period afterwards nse 0 while the ann model is able to forecasting streamflow up to 2 months ahead fig 12 b the cc of forecasting streamflow in both the ann and lstm models rapidly decreases from 0 97 to 0 20 for the first 3 month predictive period both model performance and forecast reliability is diminished as the lead time increases as shown in fig 12 the main reason for this could be the autocorrelation which decreases in time series making time series much less predictable with rising the lead time liu et al 2014 it is noticed that the lstm gradually fails to capture flow peaks in some occasions in the third month ahead forecast in contrast to its good performance in long lead time daily forecasting the lstm model fails in multi month ahead forecasting the reason for this is that in this case study the number of observed monthly datasets available is much smaller than that of daily datasets for accurate prediction in lstm a large number of datasets is required for learning the long term dependencies between the input and output datasets during the training process this finding is similar to that of kratzert et al 2018 where the authors found that the data intensive nature of the lstms was a potential barrier for applying them in data scarce problems 5 conclusion in this study a recursive forecasting framework has been developed to explore the long lead time forecasting capabilities of the ann and lstm models at daily and monthly scales the impact of the selection of parameters the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs on model performance is also explored in ann and lstm modelling the proposed models have been applied to a realistic case study the nan river basin nrb and ping river basin prb as two of major subbasins of the chao phraya river basin cprb in the heart of thailand the main findings are listed as follows 1 in daily streamflow forecasting the lstm model outperforms the ann model up to 20 days ahead the forecasting streamflow achieves a relatively good agreement with the observed streamflow especially for the streamflow peak 2 in monthly streamflow forecasting the situation becomes reverse in the lstm model where the forecasts of the ann model turn out to be better with the increase of lead time up to 12 months ahead high streamflow events could be properly captured by the ann model except for a slight flow peak delayed 3 the length of time lag and the number of epochs exert great impacts on model forecasting performance at daily and monthly scales this indicates that parameter optimization at different time scales could be effective to enhance the long lead time forecasting accuracy of the machine learning models in the short and long terms overall our study shows that the lstm method is superior to the ann model in the daily streamflow forecasting for a long lead time this could provide an insight to water resource managers to infer daily river discharge ahead in realistic hydrological applications while for monthly streamflow forecast the forecasting accuracy of both models is still restricted over two or three months ahead this could be a subject of future research efforts providing additional climatic factors into the presented models such as temperature and humidity or developing hybrid models such as machine learning methods combined with data assimilation would improve model accuracy in monthly streamflow forecast for a long lead time

5213,long lead time streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management in both the short and long terms despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead time forecasting capabilities of these methods and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms in this work an artificial neural network ann and a long short term memory lstm a powerful tool for learning long term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead time period for long lead time streamflow forecasting a recursive forecasting procedure which takes the last one step ahead forecast as a new input for the next step ahead forecast is used in the ann and lstm forecasting systems two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the nan river basin and ping river basin thailand covering the period 1974 to 2014 to further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance two parameters i e the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs are examined in the ann and lstm models the main findings are highlighted here first with an optimal setting up of model parameters both the ann and lstm model can provide accurate daily forecasting up to 20 days ahead second in comparison to the ann model the lstm model exhibits better model performance in long lead time daily forecasting but less satisfactory in multi monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset third the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ann and lstm modelling are the key for long lead time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales these findings suggest that the lstm could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management keywords streamflow forecast artificial neural network long short term memory long lead time machine learning 1 introduction accurate streamflow forecasting plays a crucial role for timely and effective water resource management irrigation management decisions flood risk evaluation scheduling releases and many other applications ni et al 2019 fathian et al 2019 tongal and booij 2018 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 yaseen et al 2015 streamflow forecasts in hourly daily monthly or even longer are important for optimizing the system or planning for future expansion or reduction in the short and long terms kisi and cimen 2011 liang et al 2019 as streamflow exhibits strong nonlinear dependence on hydrometeorological and anthropogenic factors it involves tremendous variability in spatial and temporal spaces and is difficult to forecast in both the short and long terms milly et al 2005 nourani and komasi 2013 xiao et al 2019 numerous hydrological models have been developed for forecasting streamflow however owing to numerous sources of uncertainty involved in streamflow forecasting these models have limited forecasting capability in capturing the non stationary and non linearity characteristics of hydrologic datasets nourani et al 2011 shortridge et al 2016 yaseen et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 to deal with uncertainties in streamflow forecasting ensemble streamflow forecasting is widely used in hydrological forecasting cloke and pappenberger 2009 pappenberger et al 2012 fan et al 2014 duan et al 2019 one advantage of ensemble streamflow forecasting is that it contains a number of forecast scenarios for explicitly characterizing forecast uncertainties an ensemble prediction system could recognise the uncertainty in the initial conditions and perturb them to produce several initial states emerton et al 2016 boelee et al 2019 this allows streamflow forecast driven by uncertainty to be assessed and forecast lead times to be extended boelee et al 2019 boelee et al 2017 for example alfieri et al 2013 proposed a global flood awareness system glofas it detected probabilistic exceedance of warning thresholds and utilized ensemble streamflow predictions to provide upcoming flood forecasts in large world river basins however it is still difficult to evaluate probabilistic forecasts by relying on a large number of flood scenarios and this unavoidably raises computational challenges cloke and pappenberger 2009 therefore accurate streamflow forecasting in both the short and long terms remains still a challenging task in recent decades the use of data driven techniques of machine learning methods such as neural networks nns nourani and komasi 2013 noori and kalin 2016 support vector machines svms sudheer et al 2014 rasouli et al 2012 yaseen et al 2016 adnan et al 2019 fuzzy logic alvisi and franchini 2011 and wavelet transform wt kisi and cimen 2011 fang et al 2019 have received considerable attention for streamflow forecasting in applications various studies have shown that machine learning methods are capable of capturing non linear processes numerically with no knowledge of the underlying physical processes involved yaseen et al 2015 rathinasamy et al 2013 prasad et al 2017 alvisi and franchini 2011 among these machine learning methods artificial neural network ann as a self learning and self adaptive function approximator has shown great ability in modelling nonlinear hydrologic datasets nourani and komasi 2013 the anns can recognize the nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs and well reproduce strongly nonlinear relationships especially in case that these relationships are not known or cannot be made explicit a priori alvisi and franchini 2011 the anns have been extensively applied to forecast streamflow at various lead times such as forecasting one day ahead river flow in the semiarid mountain region by he et al 2014 forecasting daily lake levels up to 3 days ahead by kisi et al 2012 and predicting river flow for 5 days ahead by badrzadeh et al 2013 although widely used some drawbacks associated with anns such as over fitting shortridge et al 2016 sun et al 2014 and convergence to local minima guo et al 2011 kalra et al 2013 make it difficult to achieve a satisfactory forecasting performance for a long lead time in dealing with time series hydrological processes most recently long short term memory lstm has gained significant attention among hydrologists lstm introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 has proved to be a powerful tool for addressing time series prediction problems hu et al 2019 compared to classical nns lstms are able to capture both the periodic and chaotic behaviours of time series data and learn their long range dependencies with greater accuracy mouatadid et al 2019 for example kratzert et al 2018 successfully adopted the lstm model to describe the rainfall runoff behaviour of a large number of complex catchments at daily scale ni et al 2019 developed two hybrid models based on the traditional lstm model for monthly streamflow and rainfall forecasting results proved that lstm was applicable for time series prediction in addition hu et al 2018 demonstrated that the lstm model outperformed the ann model for flood forecasting up to 6 h ahead similarly le et al 2019 explored the capabilities of the ann and lstm models for forecasting the one day two day and three day ahead flowrate at hoa binh the results revealed that the lstm model could learn long term dependencies between sequential data series and exhibited good performance in flood forecasting while research on the ann and lstm models in the field of streamflow forecasting has developed rapidly some shortcomings still persist first most research focuses on streamflow forecast at a specific time scale such as daily or monthly and lacks a systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms yaseen et al 2015 second to obtain streamflow forecasting at different lead times most studies have to construct multi models with different pairs of inputs and outputs at a few successive lags hu et al 2018 nourani and partoviyan 2018 for example nourani 2017 constructed three kinds of relationships in three models to obtain the forecasting values at the lead times of 2 4 and 7 days respectively although up to 6 8 day ahead or 1 2 month ahead streamflow forecasts was achieved in some research fathian et al 2019 it is not only time consuming to build multi models but also remains unknown for model performance in longer lead time forecasting third parameter setting in machine learning methods is the key technology in model development especially for the impact of the time lag length on streamflow forecasting dehghani et al 2015 however investigations of parameter settings among those models are rarely explored the purpose of this paper is to identify the robust modelling approach from two popular machine methods namely ann and lstm especially for the long lead time forecasting capability through assessing both modelling accuracy and precision at daily and monthly scales two models are applied into two realistic cases the nan river basin nrb and ping river basin prb two of main subbasins of chao phraya river basin cprb the heart of thailand the main objectives of this paper are 1 to investigate the parameter settings on model forecasting performance at daily and monthly scales and enable a screening of the best setting of parameters to attain an accurate model 2 to explore the forecasting capabilities of machine learning methods for a long lead time at daily and monthly scales 3 to compare model forecasting results at daily and monthly scales provide a deep insight into the quality of model forecast and explore the way in which various processes are represented the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations for multi step ahead streamflow forecast strategy are briefly formulated and the daily and monthly forecast models ann and lstm are introduced in detail section 3 presents the study area nan river basin and ping river basin as well as model development for streamflow forecasting forecasting performance of two models in daily and monthly scales is described in section 4 finally in section 5 conclusions are presented 2 methodology in this paper the long lead time streamflow forecasting is conducted using both ann and lstm at daily and monthly scales the ann and lstm models are developed for forecasting streamflow at several lead times such as 1 20 days and 1 12 months in the model development the model for one step ahead forecasting is first obtained in the training process then a recursive strategy is adopted in the trained models so that the multi step ahead forecast can be achieved the following sections provide a detailed description of the one step ahead and multi step ahead daily monthly streamflow forecasting strategy 2 1 multi step ahead daily and monthly streamflow forecast strategy 2 1 1 one step ahead daily and monthly streamflow forecast in general a streamflow forecasting model f is used to provide the predictive streamflow q t 1 in a specified time scale such as daily or monthly based on historical climatic records it is generally known that streamflow generation processes are influenced by many factors including rainfall evaporation temperature etc guo et al 2011 as rainfall a natural process that has a high degree of variability in both time and space is the key factor for streamflow this paper focuses on developing a streamflow forecasting model depending on rainfall given a series of rainfall observation r t m 1 r t r t 1 where m is the length of time lag a one step ahead streamflow forecast can be given as 1 q t 1 f r t m 1 r t r t 1 where q t 1 represents the predictive streamflow at time t 1 r denotes rainfall dataset f is a forecasting model in order to obtain a satisfactory forecast accuracy a key problem is how to choose the length of lagged inputs m in eq 1 enough high quality observed inputs enable the pattern detection between rainfall and runoff however the length of inputs is limited by availability of measurements in practice in addition as the lagged time length m increases so too does the number of inputs and the complexity of the forecasting model developed bowden et al 2005 in this paper an investigation of impacts of the time lag length on model forecasting performance is conducted in section 4 1 1 and section 4 2 1 2 1 2 multi step ahead daily and monthly streamflow forecast the multi step ahead time series forecasting can be described as an estimation on future time series q t h where h 1 h h is the total of predictive steps also called the lead time the most popular forecasting strategy is the recursive also called iterated strategy taieb et al 2010 bontempi et al 2012 in this study to achieve the multi step ahead streamflow forecast a single forecasting model f is trained to perform a one step ahead forecast in section 2 1 1 after the learning process the multi step ahead streamflow can be predicted using 2 q t h f r t m 1 r t r t 1 h 1 f r t m h r t 1 q t 1 q t h 1 h 2 m 1 f q t m h 1 q t h 1 h m 2 h where h is the total of predictive steps also the length of lead time m is the length of time lag the last equation in 2 is used for streamflow forecasting when the rainfall data is not available during the predictive period in this paper the multi step ahead streamflow forecast q t h at daily and monthly scales is obtained as following steps 1 splitting a series of rainfall and runoff datasets into training datasets x training y training the training period t 0 t p and validation datasets x validated y validated the validation period t p t n let x training r t m 1 r t r t 1 t 1 t 0 t p as inputs and y training q t 1 as the targeted outputs 2 selecting the time lag length m the number of lagged rainfall records to use as inputs to

parameter combination for one step ahead streamflow forecasting 4 selecting the length of lead time h in eq 2 5 using the x validated r t m 1 r t r t 1 t m t p t n as new inputs to forecast the next step ahead streamflow by the trained model in step 3 6 combining the one step ahead streamflow forecast in step 5 and the available rainfall records as new inputs and repeating the step 5 to obtain the second step ahead streamflow forecast 7 repeating the steps 6 and 5 to forecast h step ahead streamflow in eq 2 during t p t n in this work the ann and lstm models are selected as the forecasting model f in eqs 1 and 2 for daily and monthly streamflow forecasting in a recursive strategy as shown in fig 1 details in algorithm 1 which is introduced in detail in section 2 2 and section 2 3

streamflow forecast ann a mathematical model of biologically inspired system provides a novel and appealing solution to the problem of relating input and output variables in complex systems basheer and hajmeer 2000 it requires no information about the underlying complex physical process while constructing black box models of complex and nonlinear relationships between the input and output variables in general an ann model consists of three typical layers each layer processes a series of neurons which are fully connected with those of the following layer as illustrated in fig s1 in the supplementary material the first layer is the input layer that receives the input data the hidden layer is the information processing section which uses weights to achieve nonlinear transformation between the connection links to determine the output the output layer receives the processed information from the last hidden layer and then outputs the result the ann model can be mathematically formulated as 3 y k σ k j 1 m w kj σ j i 1 n w ij x i b j b k where x i represents the input value at the neuron i y k is the output value at the neuron k σ k and σ j denote the activation function for the hidden and output layers respectively m and n are the number of neurons at the input and hidden layers respectively w ij is the weight between the input neuron i and the hidden neuron j w kj is the weight between the hidden neuron j and the output neuron k b j and b k are biases of the j th neuron at the hidden layer and k th neuron at the output layer respectively to achieve appropriate performance of anns the parameters for example the number of neurons weights and biases between layers and the number of iterations should be optimized in this study a four layer ann network that consists of one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer is established the sigmoid function f a 1 1 exp a and the hyperbolic tangent function f a tanh a are employed between the layers levenberg marquardt algorithm asadi et al 2013 alizadeh et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 is selected as the optimization algorithm for training the ann model which is a way to adjust the parameters consisting of weights w and bias b between layers referring to multi step ahead forecast steps in section 2 1 2 the ann forecasting approach at daily and monthly scales as shown in fig 1 is summarized in algorithm 1 2 3 long short term memory model lstm for daily and monthly streamflow forecast the lstm architecture is composed of special units called memory blocks in the recurrent hidden layers each memory block contains the self connected memory cells and multiplicative units the memory cells are used to store the temporal state of the networks the multiplicative units including the input output and forget gates controls the flow of information between the cells the input gate is responsible for controlling the flow of inputs into the memory cell while the output gate conducts the output flow of cell activations the forget gate scales the internal state of the cell fig s2 in the supplementary material shows the information flow through a lstm cell the lstm transition equations are written below 4 f s σ w f h s 1 x s b f 5 i s σ w i h s 1 x s b i 6 c s tanh w c h s 1 x s b c 7 c s f s c s 1 i s c s 8 o s σ w o h s 1 x s b o 9 h s o s tanh c s where i s o s and f s are the input output and forget gates respectively w i w o w f and w c represent the weights for each gate b i b o b f and b c are the bias terms σ denotes the logistic sigmoid function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function is the scalar product of two vectors c s represents the cell state c s is the updated cell state x s and h s are the cell input and output respectively in this study the lstm forecasting approach consists of one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer the lstm is trained based on truncated back propagation through time bptt which uses a back propagation network to update the parameters in iterations werbos 1990 referring to multi step ahead forecast steps in section 2 1 2 the lstm model forecasting at daily and monthly scales similar to that of the ann forecasting approach is described in fig 1 and algorithm 1 3 application 3 1 study area the chao phraya river basin cprb the heart of thailand is the center of rice production and the region economy wichakul et al 2013 nan river basin nrb and ping river basin prb were selected as two study sites as shown in fig 2 the first study site nrb as one of major subbasins of cprb covers an area of 11 950 km 2 kinouchi et al 2018 the cprb located in the heart of thailand is the center of rice production and the region economy wichakul et al 2013 nan river basin nrb as one of major subbasins of cprb covers the area of 11 950 km 2 kinouchi et al 2018 this basin includes the third largest dam reservoir sirikit dam reservoir in thailand as shown in fig 2 the function of sirikit dam reservoir is to supply domestic water irrigation and power generation the river flow through the center of nan province and drains into the reservoir the basin is in a subtropical monsoon region with relatively abundant rainfall and a humid climate from may to september the average annual precipitation over the basin is 900 2000 mm to determine the relationship between rainfall and runoff streamflow into the sirikit dam reservoir and rainfall data from gauges as shown in fig 2 were collected at daily and monthly scales from 1974 to 2014 the introduction and results of streamflow forecasts at the second study site prb are provided in the supplementary material 3 2 daily and monthly model development in this study the ann and lstm models are employed to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales the daily and monthly dataset are split into the separations of training and validation datasets as shown in table 1 the model inputs are the available observed rainfall and predicted streamflow output from the previous time levels t m 1 t as shown in eq 2 the targeted output is the streamflow at the time level t 1 all datasets were scaled to the range of 0 1 to match the consistency of machine learning based models and rescaled back to the original values after the model simulation zhang et al 2018 to evaluate the model parameter impact different setups of model parameters are employed in the ann and lstm models during training period in both daily and monthly forecasting the parameters settings used in two models are summarized in table 2 3 3 model performance evaluation the performance of the ann and lstm forecasting models developed in this study is assessed using various standard statistical performance evaluation criteria the statistical measures used here are the root mean squared error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of correlation cc taylor 1990 and the mean absolute error mae legates and mccabe 1999 these indicators can be defined as follows 1 root mean squared error rmse 10 rmse i 1 n q i s q i o n 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 11 nse 1 i 1 n q i o q i s 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 3 coefficient of correlation cc 12 cc i 1 n q i s q s q i o q o i 1 n q i s q s 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 4 mean absolute error mae 13 mae 1 n i 1 n q i s q i o where q i s and q i o are the i th forecasting and observed streamflow respectively q s and q o are the average forecasting and observed streamflow n is the number of datasets 4 results and discussions in this section the observed streamflow in the sirikit dam reservoir is compared with forecasting streamflow from the ann and lstm models combined with different model parameters at daily and monthly scales over the validation period 4 1 daily streamflow forecast 4 1 1 modelling parameter optimization in daily streamflow forecast a number of ann and lstm modelling cases have been set up with varying parameters the length of the time lag and the maximum epoch number the impact of modelling parameters used in ann and lstm on results is demonstrated in fig 3 and fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the average rmse in the boxes is gradually decreased when the length of the time lag increases from 1 day to 10 days and then remains almost the same 220 m 3 s when the time lag exceeds 10 days in ann modelling while the length of the time lag has a slight effect on results of lstm modelling fig 4 shows that the average values of rmse in both the ann and lstm models exhibit a rising trend when the maximum epoch number increases the impact of the number of lagged days and epochs used in ann and lstm modelling is further estimated by the map of the rmse of the forecasting daily streamflow results shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material where the box is masked from green to blue in fig s3 a and b it is observed that the lstm model achieves better forecast performance than ann models the lowest and highest rmse outlined in red for ann modelling are 149 25 m 3 s and 271 51 m 3 s respectively while for lstm modelling 118 51 m 3 s and 199 22 m 3 s respectively the optimal settings of the lagged days and the maximum epoch number are provided in table 3 the best statistical result of ann modelling in one step ahead forecast is achieved with the time lag 10 days and epochs 200 for lstm modelling the best statistical results are obtained for 25 days and 10 respectively overall the ann and lstm models exhibit different forecasting performance with varying parameter settings it can be concluded that 1 an optimal time lag can be selected to improve the ann performance 2 the effects of the length of time lag for the lstm model are uncertain in one day ahead forecast and 3 the increase of the number of epochs deteriorates the ann and lstm performance in one day ahead forecast 4 1 2 one day ahead streamflow forecast fig 5 shows the daily hydrographs at sirikit dam reservoir in one day ahead forecast from 2007 to 2010 using optimal parameters in table 3 as shown in fig 5 it can be noticed that the forecasting streamflow exhibits good agreement with the observed streamflow the streamflow forecast using the ann and lstm models could capture the daily variability but underestimates the streamflow in the dry season while overestimates it in the wet season by using lstm model the predicted streamflow shows a reduction of overestimation in the wet season compared to that using the ann model and exhibits a good match with the observations in fig 5 a comparison between the ann and lstm models indicates that the lstm model performs better than the ann model in daily streamflow forecasting for example the r 2 is 0 86 for lstm modelling while it is 0 76 in 2008 streamflow forecast for ann modelling in addition it is noted that the number of epochs required for lstm model convergence is much smaller than the ann model while the number of the time lag has little effect on lstm model results this indicates that the lstm model is more robust and can extract nonlinearity characteristics of data more efficiently zhang et al 2018 in comparison to the ann model 4 1 3 multi day ahead streamflow forecast the ann and lstm models have been further applied to multi day ahead streamflow forecasting the comparative plots of the forecasting results obtained from the ann and lstm models at the lead time 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 day and 5 day are shown in fig 6 it can be observed that a relatively good agreement between the observed and forecasting streamflow especially the streamflow peak is achieved at the lead time 1 day and 2 day with increasing the lead time the arrival time of forecasting streamflow peaks becomes slightly delayed which is caused by the accumulation of forecast errors compared with low streamflow simulation of the lstm model from 5 october 2008 to 26 october 2008 the streamflow peaks of the ann model are generally higher than observed streamflow in addition the predicted streamflow exhibits abnormal fluctuations in the ann simulation four indicators rmse nse cc and mae are chosen to evaluate the multi day ahead forecast performance during the validation period from 18 november 2007 to 20 february 2011 the corresponding evaluation of forecasting streamflow results during the lead times of 1 20 days is illustrated in fig 7 it can be seen that the lstm model generally outperforms the ann model with the smaller rmse and mae in fig 7 a and d and higher nse and cc especially at the longer lead times in fig 7 b and c it is also visible that the predicted accuracy of the ann and lstm models decays as the forecasting horizon extends further in time i e with the increasing lead time length as the lead time increases from 1 to 20 days the rmse and mae in ann modelling increase approximately by 254 and 232 respectively while in lstm modelling the rmse and mae increase approximately by 291 and 215 respectively the nse ranges between 0 1 and 0 68 for the ann model while between 0 33 and 0 78 for the lstm model the cc decreases from 0 83 to 0 59 for the ann model and from 0 89 and 0 64 for the lstm model as the lead time increases the results suggest that the forecasting performance for the lstm model is better than that of the ann model for long lead time daily forecasting which may be explained by the model structure for lstm model it processes the time series datasets as a sequence and one element as input at a time and the past temporal information is stored in the memory cell which helps the lstm model to capture datasets trend and to exhibit more powerful forecasting capability than the ann model zhang et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 this enables a memory mechanism in the lstm model where the network uses information about past calculations from a few past steps to inform the decision of whether or not this information should be passed along to the next iteration mouatadid et al 2019 as the lstm model processes the input data in many time steps the input data are used to update a number of parameters in the lstm internal memory cell states in every step during a training period during the prediction period the memory cell states depend only on the input at a specific time step and the states from the last time step kratzert et al 2018 however the ann model does not have a temporal memory and the inputs in the model are assumed to be independent of each other so that it is difficult to recognise temporal changes de la fuente et al 2019 therefore memory cells in the model structure help the lstm model capture datasets trend and exhibit more powerful forecasting capability than the ann model 4 2 monthly streamflow forecast 4 2 1 modelling parameter optimization in monthly streamflow forecast for optimal setting up of modelling parameters used in ann and lstm we have undertaken a number of test cases with varying the time lag length and epoch number the error estimate of results with different modelling parameters has been plotted in fig 8 and fig 9 as shown in fig 8 it can be noticed that the average rmse in the boxes is diminishing rapidly as the length of the time lag rises from 1 month to 5 months in ann modelling while the length of the time lag has no obvious impact on results in lstm modelling in contrast the average values of rmse exhibit a descending trend when the maximum number of epochs increases in lstm modelling however there is no obvious trend of epochs effecting on ann modelling in fig 9 fig s4 in the supplementary material shows the map of the rmse of the forecasting daily streamflow results in ann and lstm modelling by comparing fig s4 a and b it is obvious that the ann model is sensitive to the time lag selection while the lstm model is more susceptible to the maximum epoch number for example in ann modelling the rsme of results is increased from 3800 m 3 s blue box to 1500 m 3 s yellow box when the time lag rises from 1 to 5 months with a fixed maximum epoch number in fig s4 a similarly in fig s4 b the performance of the lstm model becomes better when the maximum epoch number gradually increases from 10 to 50 with the time lag 1 month the lowest and highest rmse outlined in red for the ann model are 1660 16 m 3 s and 3738 63 m 3 s respectively while those of the lstm model are 1698 97 m 3 s and 2535 57 m 3 s respectively the highest accuracy statistics of the ann and lstm models at monthly scale are given in table 4 the best statistical result of the ann model in one month ahead forecast is achieved with the time lag 4 months and epochs 500 for the lstm model the time lag and maximum epoch numbers are 2 months and 50 respectively the results indicate that the ann model is comparable to the lstm model in monthly streamflow forecast overall for the influence of different parameter settings on the ann and lstm model performance it can be concluded that 1 increasing the time lag could improve the ann model accuracy in one month ahead forecast while remain inconspicuous for the lstm model and 2 the increase of maximum epochs could improve the lstm accuracy but remains uncertain for the ann model in one month ahead forecast 4 2 2 one month ahead streamflow forecast fig 10 displays the monthly hydrographs at sirikit dam reservoir in one month ahead forecast from year 2004 to 2012 using the optimal parameters in table 4 it is shown in fig 10 that the forecasting streamflow exhibits good agreement with the observed streamflow the ann and lstm models not only capture the monthly streamflow variability but also successfully predict the low streamflow in dry season during the validation period from april of 2004 to december of 2013 the r 2 is 0 94 and 0 95 for the ann and lstm models respectively 4 2 3 multi month ahead streamflow forecasting the ann and lstm models have been further applied to multi month ahead streamflow forecasting fig 11 gives the comparative plots of the forecasting results obtained from the ann and lstm models at the lead time 1 month 2 month and 3 month one observes a relatively good match between the observed and forecasting streamflow from two models in the first and second month ahead forecast low streamflow is accurately forecasted and high streamflow events are also properly captured although the arrival time of forecasting streamflow peaks is slightly delayed in multi month ahead forecasting again four indicators are used to evaluate the multi month ahead forecast performance during the validation period from april of 2004 to december of 2014 the results from these indicators for the forecast performance at the lead times of 1 12 months are illustrated in fig 12 it is seen that as the lead time length increases from 1 to 12 months the rmse and mae of results in ann modelling increase approximately by 499 and 457 respectively while in lstm modelling approximately by 442 and 425 respectively bearing in mind that nse 0 indicates the model forecasts are unreliable we can see that the lstm model can perform accurately streamflow forecast only for a one month lead period afterwards nse 0 while the ann model is able to forecasting streamflow up to 2 months ahead fig 12 b the cc of forecasting streamflow in both the ann and lstm models rapidly decreases from 0 97 to 0 20 for the first 3 month predictive period both model performance and forecast reliability is diminished as the lead time increases as shown in fig 12 the main reason for this could be the autocorrelation which decreases in time series making time series much less predictable with rising the lead time liu et al 2014 it is noticed that the lstm gradually fails to capture flow peaks in some occasions in the third month ahead forecast in contrast to its good performance in long lead time daily forecasting the lstm model fails in multi month ahead forecasting the reason for this is that in this case study the number of observed monthly datasets available is much smaller than that of daily datasets for accurate prediction in lstm a large number of datasets is required for learning the long term dependencies between the input and output datasets during the training process this finding is similar to that of kratzert et al 2018 where the authors found that the data intensive nature of the lstms was a potential barrier for applying them in data scarce problems 5 conclusion in this study a recursive forecasting framework has been developed to explore the long lead time forecasting capabilities of the ann and lstm models at daily and monthly scales the impact of the selection of parameters the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs on model performance is also explored in ann and lstm modelling the proposed models have been applied to a realistic case study the nan river basin nrb and ping river basin prb as two of major subbasins of the chao phraya river basin cprb in the heart of thailand the main findings are listed as follows 1 in daily streamflow forecasting the lstm model outperforms the ann model up to 20 days ahead the forecasting streamflow achieves a relatively good agreement with the observed streamflow especially for the streamflow peak 2 in monthly streamflow forecasting the situation becomes reverse in the lstm model where the forecasts of the ann model turn out to be better with the increase of lead time up to 12 months ahead high streamflow events could be properly captured by the ann model except for a slight flow peak delayed 3 the length of time lag and the number of epochs exert great impacts on model forecasting performance at daily and monthly scales this indicates that parameter optimization at different time scales could be effective to enhance the long lead time forecasting accuracy of the machine learning models in the short and long terms overall our study shows that the lstm method is superior to the ann model in the daily streamflow forecasting for a long lead time this could provide an insight to water resource managers to infer daily river discharge ahead in realistic hydrological applications while for monthly streamflow forecast the forecasting accuracy of both models is still restricted over two or three months ahead this could be a subject of future research efforts providing additional climatic factors into the presented models such as temperature and humidity or developing hybrid models such as machine learning methods combined with data assimilation would improve model accuracy in monthly streamflow forecast for a long lead time

5214,alpine meadow degradation has become serious in recent decades due to the combined effects of overgrazing human activities and rodents but very few studies focus on the possible impact of alpine meadow degradation on soil water retention on the qinghai tibet plateau in this study four degradation stages non degradation nd light degradation ld moderate degradation md heavy degradation hd were selected results showed that 1 the aboveground biomass decreased with increasing degradation while the belowground biomass first increased and then decreased with a maximum value in md 2 as the degree of degradation increased from nd to md the 0 10 cm soil bulk density bd and soil compaction sc decreased with the minimum values in md 0 61 g cm 3 for bd and 1619 51 kpa for sc while soil organic matter som increased with maximum value in md 247 36 g kg 1 the 0 10 cm som in md was the 1 5 times of that in nd however the 0 10 cm particle size distribution did not change significantly with increasing degradation while the 20 40 cm clay content in hd was significantly higher than those of the other three degradation stages 3 the md stage displayed a strong water holding capacity in 0 10 cm soil layer due to its higher soil organic matter induced by the thick mattic epipedon meanwhile the water holding capacity in the hd stage was higher than that of the other three degradation stages in the 20 40 cm soil layer owing to its higher capillary porosity furthermore the soil water retention was greatly affected by the mattic epipdon through its effects on soil properties such as reducing bd and increasing som our results suggested that the mattic epipdon may play a crucial role in water retention in alpine ecosystems keywords soil water retention mattic epipedon alpine meadow degradation stages qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the world s the principal area of alpine grassland almost 60 area of qtp was covered by grassland ecosystem which is about 2 5 million km2 dong et al 2020 however in the past decades a great proportion of the qtp grassland has suffered serious degradation due to increasing grazing intensities and rodent infestation dai et al 2019a dong et al 2020 subsequently altering soil water retention retention via its effects on soil properties and vegetation li et al 2015 zeng et al 2013 for example the abovegroud biomass decreased with increasing grassland degradation dai et al 2019a the soil bulk density was observed to increased while soil moisture and aggregate stability decreased with increasing grassland degradation lu et al 2017 the soil organic matter content decreased with increasing grassland degradation wang et al 2010 the changing soil and vegetation characteristics caused by grassland degradation could greatly affect the soil water retention therefore exploring the changing patterns in soil water retention at different degradation stages is not only important for assessing the effects on soil hydrology and for establishing grassland management strategies but is also important for quantifying the impacts of grassland degradation on soil water retention recently many studies have examined the dominant controls on soil water retention in alpine ecosystem but no overall consensus has been reached due to the complexity of influencing factors such as soil properties yang et al 2014 dai et al 2020 topography sun et al 2019 vegetation gao et al 2018 wu et al 2019 and the highly heterogeneous both spatially and temporally in soil water retention ma et al 2016 for example pan et al 2017 indicated that the field capacity and soil moisture content decreased with the increasing alpine grassland degradation yi et al 2012 found that the saturated water content and capillary water holding capacity reduced across all soil depths with the increasing alpine grassland degradation however wei et al 2010 reported that field capacity first increased but then decreased with the increasing alpine grassland degradation moreover it has been confirmed that soil water retention is greatly affected by the soil properties such as soil organic matter and soil texture yang et al 2014 wösten et al 2001 previous studies found that the soil organic matter content was the most important factor affecting soil water retention in an alpine grassland owing to its affinity to water and direct effect on soil bulk density while soil texture only exerted a weak impact yang et al 2014 dai et al 2020 however there also study reported that the soil texture was the most important factors affecting the soil water retention wösten et al 2001 overall although many studies have been conducted regarding the effects of grassland degradation on soil hydraulic properties the pattern and controls in soil water retention are still not fully understood and few studies have considered the role of mattic epipedon on soil water retention in alpine ecosystems the mattic epipedon has been recognized as a special diagnostic surface horizon for soils in alpine meadow and is widely distributed in alpine ecosystems zhi et al 2017 a great number of studies have indicated that the mattic epipedon in alpine ecosystem play a crucial role in soil water retention owing to its densely intertwined grass roots and high topsoil organic matter content zhang et al 2019 li et al 2015 zhi et al 2017 therefore understanding the effect of mattic epipedon on soil water retention under different degradation stages may provide insight for water resources management in alpine ecosystem to better predict the soil water retention under different degradation stages the soil water characteristic curves was established on the basis of the relationship between soil water content and soil water potential or et al 1999 the soil water characteristic curves have been widely used to examined the soil water storage capacity thus understanding the soil water characteristic curves is of great significance when considering soil water storage retention movement supply and dynamics in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in this study we determined soil water characteristic curves by adopting the gardner model with the aim of estimating the soil water retention characteristics and controls in an alpine meadow at varying stages of degradation specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the changes pattern of vegetation soil property and soil water retention 2 examine the dominant factors and reveal the influencing mechanism of grassland degradation on soil water retention 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture of qinghai province china 101 19 e 37 37 n fig 1 which located on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau at an average elevation of 3230 m the site has a plateau continental monsoon climate the mean annual air temperature is approximately 1 7 c with a month maximum in july 9 8 c and minimum in january 14 80 c and the average annual precipitation is 618 mm which mainly falls in the growing season early may to late september the soil type in the study area is classified as mollic gryic cambisols based on the classification of soil systems in china liu et al 2018 the terrain in this region is relatively flat with no runoff occurs the soil horizon is approximately 50 80 cm and shows an as a1 ab bc c d configuration with abundant soil organic matter in the as layer due to the thick mattic epipedon cao et al 2004 before 1995 the vegetation distribution across the study site was relatively uniform with little grazing by local herdsmen and the plant community is gramineae grass kobresia humilis community then the pasture was assigned into four individual households from 1995 which resulted in the degradation of the alpine grassland and formed four distinct degradation stages reflecting different grazing intensities although a diverse range of qualitative and semi qualitative methods for the classification of alpine meadow degradation have been employed previous studies pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 in this study we adopt the space for time substitution to describe the degree of alpine meadow degradation this method has been widely used in grassland degradation stage classification according to community succession stage and vegetation coverage index table 1 which was classified as non degradation nd light degradation ld moderate degradation md and heavy degradation hd based on four community succession stages a a gramineae grass kobresia humilis community b a kobresia humilis community c a thickening mattic epipedon of the kobresia pygmaea community and d development of cracks in the mattic epipedon of the kobresia pygmaea community fig 1 to demonstrate the rationality of the space time strategy space in this study we also observed long term changes of community succession stage in the same region which were consistent with the community succession stage in this study therefore it was reasonable that local vegetation degradation process will develop along the four stages described in this study 2 2 soil and plant sampling at the end of august 2019 both disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected at three points randomly distributed across four degradation stage sites at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm using a soil bulk sampler with a stainless steel cutting ring 5 0 cm diameter 5 0 cm high all disturbed soil sample was sieved to determine the soil organic matter content som soil particle density ds and soil particle sizes with 3 replicates in each degradation stage sites the som was determined by the walkley black procedure nelson and sommers 1996 the ds was obtained by a glass pycnometer in which a 10 g air dried 2 mm soil sample was inserted and the displaced volume of distilled water was determined soil particle sizes were measured using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments uk which enabled calculation of the clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm and sand 0 02 2 mm contents according to the international classification standard to investigate the impact of alpine meadow degradation on plant biomass the aboveground biomass agb and belowground biomass bgb were determined at four degradation study sites at the end of august of 2019 the agb was measured by the standard harvesting method dai et al 2019a following the random positioning of three 25 cm 25 cm quadrats at the four degradation stage sites the bgb include both live and dead was determined by extracting soil cores diameter 7 cm in each quadrat at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm these were washed with clean water to remove all soil particles finally both abg and bgb samples were oven dried to constant weight at 65 c 2 3 laboratory analysis the undisturbed soil samples were analyzed for soil bulk density i e the ratio of mass of soil to volume of soil soil total porosity i e the percentage of soil pore volume to soil volume capillary porosity i e the percentage of pore size 0 1 mm volume to soil volume non capillary porosity the percentage of pore size 0 1 mm pore volume to soil volume and hydraulic properties including field moisture capacity capillary moisture capacity saturation moisture capacity and soil water characteristic curves firstly undisturbed soil samples collected as ring cores were saturated with tap water for 48 h and was weighted as m1 g then were placed in a flat container filled with dry sand at the bottom the soil ring core was weighed as m2 g after 2 h finally they were oven dried at 105 c for 72 h to the constant mass and weighed as m3 g the soil bulk density bd saturation moisture capacity smc and capillary moisture capacity cmc was calculated by following equation cui et al 2019 1 bd m 3 m v 2 smc m 1 m 3 m m 3 m 3 cmc m 2 m 3 m m 3 m where v is the volume of the steel ring core cm3 m is the weight of the steel ring core without soil sample g the soil total porosity tp soil capillary porosity cp and soil non capillary porosity ncp were calculated by following equation jiao et al 2011 4 tp 1 bd ds 100 5 cp cmc bd v 100 6 ncp tp cp where bd is soil bulk density ds is the soil particle density g cm 3 cmc is capillary moisture capacity v is is the volume of the steel ring core the soil water characteristic curves swccs was measured by the soil moisture pressure membrane method at 30 50 100 200 300 450 800 1200 and 1500 kpa to describe the relationship between matric potential and soil water content the field capacity fc and wilting water content wc thus could obtained from the swccs as the soil water content at 30 and 1500 kpa respectively the plant available water content pawc was measured by following equation pawc fc wc then the obtained soil water retention curve was fitted by the gardner model gardner et al 1970 the gardner model is an empirical equation and has widely used to describe the soil water retention in grassland ecosystems in the gardner model the soil matric potential value is the independent variable and soil water content is the dependent variable the model was used to fit the soil water characteristic curves at different soil layers and then to obtain the parameters a and b for the gardner model as follows h a θ b where θ is matric potential kpa h is the soil water content a and b is the fitting parameters we mainly focus on parameters a a higher value of parameter a indicated a higher soil water retention furthermore the soil water content swc and soil compaction sc were also determined in each degradation stage site the 5 cm swc was measured from january to december 2018 using soil water heat and salt monitoring system hydra probe ii stevens usa the sc was measured by soil compactness instrument at depth of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm with 3 replicates in each degradation stagesites 2 4 statistical analysis one way anova was adopted to compare averages of individual soil layers properties across the different degradation stages the significant differences among different degradation stages were identified at the 0 05 level then we conducted the least significant difference lsd test to account for multiple comparisons at the p 0 05 level pearson correlation analysis was applied to study the relationship between soil properties and soil water retention 3 results 3 1 aboveground biomass and belowground biomass across four degradation stages the aboveground biomass decreased with increasing degradation and the aboveground biomass in no degradation 445 15 71 56 g m 2 was significantly higher than that in light degradation 323 94 57 92 g m 2 moderate degradation 289 24 41 24 g m 2 and heavy degradation 250 38 62 81 g m 2 fig 2 a in contrast belowground biomass firstly increased and then decreased as degradation increased with the maximum belowground biomass in moderate degradation fig 2b the belowground biomass declined sharply with depth with most root biomass distributed in the top 0 10 cm fig 2b furthermore the 0 20 cm root biomass in belowground biomass was significantly higher than that in the other three degradation stages fig 2b 3 2 soil particle size distribution across four degradation stages sand 0 02 2 mm was the dominant component in the top 0 40 cm across all four degradation stages mean 49 34 followed by silt 0 002 0 05 mm mean 44 76 and clay 0 002 mm mean 5 87 fig 3 for each stage of degradation the clay and silt contents increased sharply with soil depth while sand content decreased fig 3 furthermore the clay content within the different soil layers varied significantly between degradation stages fig 3 the 0 10 cm clay content not changed significantly with increasing degradation but 20 40 cm clay content in heavy degradation was significantly higher than other three degradation sites fig 3a however there was no significant changed for silt and sand content with increasing degradation fig 3b and c 3 3 soil properties across four degradation stages the soil organic matter was mainly distributed in the top 10 cm soil layer and decreased rapidly with soil depth across all four degradation stages whereas the soil bulk density and soil compaction increased with soil depth fig 4 a c similarly to soil organic matter the soil total porosity reduced with soil depth but there was no clear pattern in capillary porosity or non capillary porosity fig 4d f soil organic matter firstly increased and then decreased with increasing degradation fig 4a the 0 10 cm soil organic matter 247 36 35 80 g kg 1 in moderate degradation was significantly higher than those of the other three degradation sites whereas there was no significant change in the 10 40 cm layer fig 4a in contrast the 0 10 cm soil bulk density slightly decreased with increasing degradation from no degradation to moderate degradation reaching a minimum value in moderate degradation 0 61 0 05 g cm 3 fig 4b the 0 20 cm soil compaction decreased with increasing degradation while the 20 40 cm soil compaction firstly increased and then decreased with the maximum value in light degradation fig 4c however there was no significant change in soil total porosity but wide variability in capillary porosity and non capillary porosity with increasing degradation fig 4e and f the 5 cm soil temperature in hd was higher than other three degradation sites fig 5 a the 5 cm soil water content increases with vegetation degradation for nd to md then decrease from md to hd fig 5b 3 4 soil water retention across four degradation stages the soil water characteristic curves fig 6 based on the gardner model yielded a good fit between soil water potential and soil water content with a high r 2 across four degradation stage parameter a for the 0 10 cm soil layer increased from no degradation to moderate degradation then decreased with the maximum in moderate degradation fig 6 reflecting that the 0 10 cm maximum soil water retention capacity occurred in moderate degradation whereas no clear pattern was seen in the 10 40 cm layer fig 6 overall the moderate degradation stage display the strongest capacities for soil water retention in 0 10 cm while the heavy degradation stage exert the strongest capacities for soil water retention in 20 40 cm fig 6 similar to the former case the strongest capacities for plant available water content were observed in the moderate degradation in 0 10 cm and the heavy degradation in 20 40 cm table 2 3 5 relationships between soil water retention and soil properties pearson correlation indicated that parameter a and plant available water content were significantly positively related to soil organic matter soil total porosity capillary porosity and sand content but significantly negatively related to soil bulk density silt content and clay content table 3 the non capillary porosity exert no significant effect on parameter a and plant available water content these correlations indicated that the soil water retention capacity of alpine grassland was positively associated with soil organic matter soil total porosity capillary porosity and sand content but significantly negatively related to soil bulk density silt content and clay content furthermore there was a good correlation between soil physical properties and soil organic matter table 3 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties under different degradation stages estimating changes in soil properties under different degradation stages is of great importance in assessing the vulnerability of grassland to degradation in general grassland degradation is often associated with soil physical properties such as reduced organic matter increased soil bulk density and reduced water retention zha and tang 2003 these soil changes can be described as a deterioration of soil structure and are part of a broad range of both soil physical conditions and soil chemistry processes alegre and cassel 1996 many studies have found that soil bulk density increased with increasing grassland degradation owing to trampling by cattle pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 this pattern was not observed in our study furthermore soil organic matter content showed an increasing then decreasing pattern with the maximum in the moderate degradation stage fig 4a this result was not consistent with previous studies that the soil organic matter content decreased with increasing degradation pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 these discrepancies may be attributed to the unique mattic diagnostic epipedon at our study site the mattic epipedons are mainly distributed in alpine ecosystems especially on the qinghai tibet plateau zhi et al 2017 previous study reported that the thickness of the mattic epipedon gradually increased with increasing grassland degradation from no degradation to moderate degradation in the same study site to a maximum in the moderate degradation stage i e there was a thickening in the mattic epipedon of the k pygmaea community dai et al 2019a lead to a higher soil organic matter in the surface soil layer owing to its high root biomass triggered by the extreme development of k pygmaea community fig 2b subsequently a lower soil bulk density under moderate degradation in this study furthermore several studies have shown that changes in soil physical properties are strongly affected by soil organic matter yang et al 2014 this pattern was supported by the well correlation between soil physical properties and soil organic matter in our results table 3 the soil texture also varied between degradation stages here the 0 10 cm soil layer particle size distribution was not significantly changed but there was an increased in the 20 40 cm clay content with increasing degradation suggesting that degradation of the alpine meadow could enhance clay content in 20 40 cm this result was inconsistent with a previous study in which the clay and silt contents of both the deep and top soil layers decreased with increasing degradation zeng et al 2013 such increased clay contents in the 20 40 cm in our study perhaps attributed to the downwards migration of the smallest topsoil particles clay and silt by precipitation infiltration or rodent infestation moreover we found that the capillary porosity increased under stronger degradation in the 20 40 cm soil layers fig 3a which could ascribe to the increasing clay content furthermore our results highlight that the grassland degradation index proposed in this study table 1 is likely to be suitable for describing the level of degradation of the vegetation cover but it is inadequate for detecting soil degradation therefore given the high soil organic matte an improved classification standard for grassland degradation should be established for mattic epipedons which takes into account soil degradation 4 2 soil water retention and its controls under varying levels of degradation given that soil water retention was controlled by vegetation and soil properties changes in these factors must cause changes in soil water retention zeng et al 2013 dai et al 2020 in this study 0 10 cm soil water retention in moderate degradation stage was much higher than that of the other three degradation stages fig 6a this pattern is not consistent with previous studies finding that the water holding capacity decreased with increasing grassland degradation pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 our results suggest that the degradation of vegetation cover does not necessarily lead to a decrease in soil water retention because soil properties such as soil organic matter and soil bulk density also play a vital role in regulating soil water retention therefore an improved degradation classification system should include both soil and vegetation conditions when estimating soil water retention under varying levels of degradation in this study the higher 0 10 cm soil water retention in moderate degradation may be associated with the higher soil organic matter owing to the overgrowth of mattic epipedon i e dense organic rich turf in moderate degradation because the higher soil organic matter is often associated with more stable aggregates and water storage li et al 2015 further evidence for this interpretation was provided by the significant positive relationships between plant available water content and soil organic matter table 3 these results have clearly documented that soil organic matter is the key factor affecting soil water retention in alpine ecosystem han et al 2012 yang et al 2014 dai et al 2020 the effects of soil organic matter on soil water retention were by following two aspects first the soil organic matter can improve soil structural stability by promoting water retention reducing erosion and contributing to the infiltration of air and water gregorich et al 1994 second the soil bulk density and aggregate stability have been shown to be strongly affected by soil organic matter baldock and nelson 2000 as supported by the good correlation in our study table 3 the organic matter affects soil bulk density by lowering the density of the solid phase and by building a soil structure that enhances soil porosity bot and benites 2005 furthermore the highest root biomass in moderate degradation may an alternative explanation for the highest soil water retention in moderate degradation there is increasing evidence indicating that root adsorption contributes strongly to soil water retention in alpine meadows gao et al 2018 li et al 2015 furthermore the soil volumetric water under moderate degradation was obvious higher other three stages fig 5b together with soil volumetric water content was maintained at 20 even at 1500 kpa wilting coefficient pressure fig 6 further supporting the strong soil water retention of the moderate degradation even under higher pressures therefore we may conclude that the highest soil water retention in 0 10 cm for moderate degradation was induced by the combine effects of root biomass and soil organic matter however the soil water retention in the 20 40 cm soil layer for heavy degradation was much higher than that of the other three degradation stages the higher soil water retention in heavy degradation may be attributed to the higher capillary porosity in general the soil porosity can be classified into non capillary porosity pore size 0 1 mm and capillary porosity pore size 0 1 mm and is primarily controlled by soil texture and aggregates gao et al 2015 a higher clay content leads to smaller pore sizes thereby increasing the capillary porosity it has been well documented that soil water retention is mainly dominated by capillary porosity with little influence of non capillary porosity pan et al 2017 in addition to soil organic matter the soil water retention was also affected by soil texture previous studies have documented that the clay and silt contents are strongly positively related to soil water retention whereas sand content is negatively associated with soil water retention khlosi et al 2013 mcbride and mackintosh 1984 in contrast to these studies we found that clay and silt contents were significantly negatively related to soil water retention whereas the sand content was significantly positively associated with soil water retention table 3 these differences might be attributed to the vertical distribution of soil particle sizes in our study the clay and silt contents increased with soil depth while the sand content decreased consistent with the trend in soil water retention furthermore the soil water retention was also greatly influenced by freezing thawing cycle in this study the soil frost period commenced in early november and ended in march the soil freezing process was from november to the following march and the soil thawing process was from the end of march to june dai et al 2019b during the soil freezing process the soil water begins to freeze from the surface to the deeper soil layers under the temperature gradient and the water was transferred from the unfrozen soil to the frozen soil with condensation occurs along the freeze front under soil water potential gradient ultimately increase the water content in frozen soil wen et al 2012 xu et al 2019 dai et al 2019b during the soil thawing process the soil melting starts from both upper and lower layers of the frozen soil and the water from melted ice in the upper layer was impeded by the frozen layer in the middle thereby increase the upper soil water content xu et al 2019 dai et al 2019b furthermore the soil porosity reduced significantly during freezing period thereby decreased soil moisture infiltration which impeding precipitation infiltration into deep soil ultimately reducing soil water retention whereas the soil moisture infiltration increased significantly during thawing period which improve the soil water retention this highlighted the need for additional research on the effect of freezing and thawing processes on soil water retention 4 3 effect of mattic epipedon on soil water retention of degradation alpine meadow soil water retention plays an important role in land surface processes and hydrologic cycles it not only affected by vegetation characteristic but also determined by soil property in this study although the aboveground biomass decreased with increasing degradation the soil organic matter content showed an increasing then decreasing pattern as vegetation degradation increased with the maximum in the moderate degradation stage fig 4a the high level of soil organic matter content in moderate degradation stage was attributed to the thick mattic epipedon in kobresia pygmaea community because the plant in kobresia pygmaea community tend to allocated more biomass to underground part to against livestock pressure and increases the activity of the plant community resulting in thickness of the mattic epipedon in moderate degradation stage lin et al 2015 dai et al 2019a thereby the higher soil organic matter content in the moderate degradation stage than other three degradation stages combine those we may conclude that the high soil water retention in moderate degradation stage was closely related to the high soil organic matter content induced by the thickness of the mattic epipedon overall the soil water retention of alpine meadow was controlled by the combine effect of root biomass and soil property and mattic epipedon play a critical role in soil water retention of alpine ecosystem via altering root biomass and soil property there is increasing evidence indicated that many environmental factors have been changed such as soil bulk density soil moisture and temperature and soil nutrient as the mattic epipedon thickens dai et al 2019a lin et al 2015 subsequent altering the hydrological process the mattic epipedon enables a stronger soil water storage capacity owing to its higher soil organic matter and soil porosity in the shallow soil layers li et al 2015 of course it should be noted that over growth of the mattic epipedon can provide favorable conditions for rodent infestations by supplying abundant food and suitable habitats consequently resulting in the subsequent destruction of the mattic epipedon kang et al 2007 lin et al 2015 in recent decades the distribution of mattic epipedon has been severely diminished across the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau because of the increasing effects of grazing as well as rodent infestation zhi et al 2017 considering the vital role of mattic epipedon in soil water retention in alpine meadows we should take effective measures taken to protect the mattic epipedon across this region in the future for example the grassland in moderate degradation stage should prevent the livestock trampling by controlling grazing intensity such as reduced grazing or grazing exclusion 5 conclusion the soil water retention of the alpine meadow soil was strongly affected by grassland degradation due to the resulting changes in soil properties under increasing levels of grassland degradation the 0 10 cm clay content not change significantly but increased 20 40 cm clay content the soil water retention of the 0 10 cm soil layer displays an increasing and then decreasing trend with the maximum water holding capacity in the moderate degradation stage this pattern may be associated with the higher soil organic matter content in the moderate degradation stage due to the thicker mattic epipedon however the soil water retention under heavy degradation in the 20 40 cm soil layer was much higher than that of the other three degradation stages owing to its higher capillary porosity our result could provide new insights into the effects of grassland vegetation degradation on soil hydrology with benefits in establishing grassland management strategies furthermore we should focus more attention towards the protection of mattic epipedon across the qinghai tibetan plateau considering their strong water holding capacity credit authorship contribution statement licong dai writing original draft writing review editing yiming yuan

5214,alpine meadow degradation has become serious in recent decades due to the combined effects of overgrazing human activities and rodents but very few studies focus on the possible impact of alpine

matter som increased with maximum value in md 247 36 g kg 1 the 0 10 cm som in md was the 1 5 times of that in nd however the 0 10 cm particle size distribution did not change significantly with increasing degradation while the 20 40 cm clay content in hd was significantly higher than those of the other three degradation stages 3 the md stage displayed a strong water holding capacity in 0 10 cm soil layer due to its higher soil organic matter induced by the thick mattic epipedon meanwhile the water holding capacity in the hd stage was higher than that of the other three degradation stages in the 20 40 cm soil layer owing to its higher capillary porosity furthermore the soil water retention was greatly affected by the mattic epipdon through its effects on soil properties such as reducing bd and increasing som our results suggested that the mattic epipdon may play a crucial role in water retention in alpine ecosystems keywords soil water retention mattic epipedon alpine meadow degradation stages qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is the world s the principal area of alpine grassland almost 60 area of qtp was covered by grassland ecosystem which is about 2 5 million km2 dong et al 2020 however in the past decades a great proportion of the qtp grassland has suffered serious degradation due to increasing grazing intensities and rodent infestation dai et al 2019a dong et al 2020 subsequently altering soil water retention retention via its effects on soil properties and vegetation li et al 2015 zeng et al 2013 for example the abovegroud biomass decreased with increasing grassland degradation dai et al 2019a the soil bulk density was observed to increased while soil moisture and aggregate stability decreased with increasing grassland degradation lu et al 2017 the soil organic matter content decreased with increasing grassland degradation wang et al 2010 the changing soil and vegetation characteristics caused by grassland degradation could greatly affect the soil water retention therefore exploring the changing patterns in soil water retention at different degradation stages is not only important for assessing the effects on soil hydrology and for establishing grassland management strategies but is also important for quantifying the impacts of grassland degradation on soil water retention recently many studies have examined the dominant controls on soil water retention in alpine ecosystem but no overall consensus has been reached due to the complexity of influencing factors such as soil properties yang et al 2014 dai et al 2020 topography sun et al 2019 vegetation gao et al 2018 wu et al 2019 and the highly heterogeneous both spatially and temporally in soil water retention ma et al 2016 for example pan et al 2017 indicated that the field capacity and soil moisture content decreased with the increasing alpine grassland degradation yi et al 2012 found that the saturated water content and capillary water holding capacity reduced across all soil depths with the increasing alpine grassland degradation however wei et al 2010 reported that field capacity first increased but then decreased with the increasing alpine grassland degradation moreover it has been confirmed that soil water retention is greatly affected by the soil properties such as soil organic matter and soil texture yang et al 2014 wösten et al 2001 previous studies found that the soil organic matter content was the most important factor affecting soil water retention in an alpine grassland owing to its affinity to water and direct effect on soil bulk density while soil texture only exerted a weak impact yang et al 2014 dai et al 2020 however there also study reported that the soil texture was the most important factors affecting the soil water retention wösten et al 2001 overall although many studies have been conducted regarding the effects of grassland degradation on soil hydraulic properties the pattern and controls in soil water retention are still not fully understood and few studies have considered the role of mattic epipedon on soil water retention in alpine ecosystems the mattic epipedon has been recognized as a special diagnostic surface horizon for soils in alpine meadow and is widely distributed in alpine ecosystems zhi et al 2017 a great number of studies have indicated that the mattic epipedon in alpine ecosystem play a crucial role in soil water retention owing to its densely intertwined grass roots and high topsoil organic matter content zhang et al 2019 li et al 2015 zhi et al 2017 therefore understanding the effect of mattic epipedon on soil water retention under different degradation stages may provide insight for water resources management in alpine ecosystem to better predict the soil water retention under different degradation stages the soil water characteristic curves was established on the basis of the relationship between soil water content and soil water potential or et al 1999 the soil water characteristic curves have been widely used to examined the soil water storage capacity thus understanding the soil water characteristic curves is of great significance when considering soil water storage retention movement supply and dynamics in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in this study we determined soil water characteristic curves by adopting the gardner model with the aim of estimating the soil water retention characteristics and controls in an alpine meadow at varying stages of degradation specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the changes pattern of vegetation soil property and soil water retention 2 examine the dominant factors and reveal the influencing mechanism of grassland degradation on soil water retention 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture of qinghai province china 101 19 e 37 37 n fig 1 which located on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau at an average elevation of 3230 m the site has a plateau continental monsoon climate the mean annual air temperature is approximately 1 7 c with a month maximum in july 9 8 c and minimum in january 14 80 c and the average annual precipitation is 618 mm which mainly falls in the growing season early may to late september the soil type in the study area is classified as mollic gryic cambisols based on the classification of soil systems in china liu et al 2018 the terrain in this region is relatively flat with no runoff occurs the soil horizon is approximately 50 80 cm and shows an as a1 ab bc c d configuration with abundant soil organic matter in the as layer due to the thick mattic epipedon cao et al 2004 before 1995 the vegetation distribution across the study site was relatively uniform with little grazing by local herdsmen and the plant community is gramineae grass kobresia humilis community then the pasture was assigned into four individual households from 1995 which resulted in the degradation of the alpine grassland and formed four distinct degradation stages reflecting different grazing intensities although a diverse range of qualitative and semi qualitative methods for the classification of alpine meadow degradation have been employed previous studies pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 in this study we adopt the space for time substitution to describe the degree of alpine meadow degradation this method has been widely used in grassland degradation stage classification according to community succession stage and vegetation coverage index table 1 which was classified as non degradation nd light degradation ld moderate degradation md and heavy degradation hd based on four community succession stages a a gramineae grass kobresia humilis community b a kobresia humilis community c a thickening mattic epipedon of the kobresia pygmaea community and d development of cracks in the mattic epipedon of the kobresia pygmaea community fig 1 to demonstrate the rationality of the space time strategy space in this study we also observed long term changes of community succession stage in the same region which were consistent with the community succession stage in this study therefore it was reasonable that local vegetation degradation process will develop along the four stages described in this study 2 2 soil and plant sampling at the end of august 2019 both disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected at three points randomly distributed across four degradation stage sites at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm using a soil bulk sampler with a stainless steel cutting ring 5 0 cm diameter 5 0 cm high all disturbed soil sample was sieved to determine the soil organic matter content som soil particle density ds and soil particle sizes with 3 replicates in each degradation stage sites the som was determined by the walkley black procedure nelson and sommers 1996 the ds was obtained by a glass pycnometer in which a 10 g air dried 2 mm soil sample was inserted and the displaced volume of distilled water was determined soil particle sizes were measured using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments uk which enabled calculation of the clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm and sand 0 02 2 mm contents according to the international classification standard to investigate the impact of alpine meadow degradation on plant biomass the aboveground biomass agb and belowground biomass bgb were determined at four degradation study sites at the end of august of 2019 the agb was measured by the standard harvesting method dai et al 2019a following the random positioning of three 25 cm 25 cm quadrats at the four degradation stage sites the bgb include both live and dead was determined by extracting soil cores diameter 7 cm in each quadrat at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm these were washed with clean water to remove all soil particles finally both abg and bgb samples were oven dried to constant weight at 65 c 2 3 laboratory analysis the undisturbed soil samples were analyzed for soil bulk density i e the ratio of mass of soil to volume of soil soil total porosity i e the percentage of soil pore volume to soil volume capillary porosity i e the percentage of pore size 0 1 mm volume to soil volume non capillary porosity the percentage of pore size 0 1 mm pore volume to soil volume and hydraulic properties including field moisture capacity capillary moisture capacity saturation moisture capacity and soil water characteristic curves firstly undisturbed soil samples collected as ring cores were saturated with tap water for 48 h and was weighted as m1 g then were placed in a flat container filled with dry sand at the bottom the soil ring core was weighed as m2 g after 2 h finally they were oven dried at 105 c for 72 h to the constant mass and weighed as m3 g the soil bulk density bd saturation moisture capacity smc and capillary moisture capacity cmc was calculated by following equation cui et al 2019 1 bd m 3 m v 2 smc m 1 m 3 m m 3 m 3 cmc m 2 m 3 m m 3 m where v is the volume of the steel ring core cm3 m is the weight of the steel ring core without soil sample g the soil total porosity tp soil capillary porosity cp and soil non capillary porosity ncp were calculated by following equation jiao et al 2011 4 tp 1 bd ds 100 5 cp cmc bd v 100 6 ncp tp cp where bd is soil bulk density ds is the soil particle density g cm 3 cmc is capillary moisture capacity v is is the volume of the steel ring core the soil water characteristic curves swccs was measured by the soil moisture pressure membrane method at 30 50 100 200 300 450 800 1200 and 1500 kpa to describe the relationship between matric potential and soil water content the field capacity fc and wilting water content wc thus could obtained from the swccs as the soil water content at 30 and 1500 kpa respectively the plant available water content pawc was measured by following equation pawc fc wc then the obtained soil water retention curve was fitted by the gardner model gardner et al 1970 the gardner model is an empirical equation and has widely used to describe the soil water retention in grassland ecosystems in the gardner model the soil matric potential value is the independent variable and soil water content is the dependent variable the model was used to fit the soil water characteristic curves at different soil layers and then to obtain the parameters a and b for the gardner model as follows h a θ b where θ is matric potential kpa h is the soil water content a and b is the fitting parameters we mainly focus on parameters a a higher value of parameter a indicated a higher soil water retention furthermore the soil water content swc and soil compaction sc were also determined in each degradation stage site the 5 cm swc was measured from january to december 2018 using soil water heat and salt monitoring system hydra probe ii stevens usa the sc was measured by soil compactness instrument at depth of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm with 3 replicates in each degradation stagesites 2 4 statistical analysis one way anova was adopted to compare averages of individual soil layers properties across the different degradation stages the significant differences among different degradation stages were identified at the 0 05 level then we conducted the least significant difference lsd test to account for multiple comparisons at the p 0 05 level pearson correlation analysis was applied to study the relationship between soil properties and soil water retention 3 results 3 1 aboveground biomass and belowground biomass across four degradation stages the aboveground biomass decreased with increasing degradation and the aboveground biomass in no degradation 445 15 71 56 g m 2 was significantly higher than that in light degradation 323 94 57 92 g m 2 moderate degradation 289 24 41 24 g m 2 and heavy degradation 250 38 62 81 g m 2 fig 2 a in contrast belowground biomass firstly increased and then decreased as degradation increased with the maximum belowground biomass in moderate degradation fig 2b the belowground biomass declined sharply with depth with most root biomass distributed in the top 0 10 cm fig 2b furthermore the 0 20 cm root biomass in belowground biomass was significantly higher than that in the other three degradation stages fig 2b 3 2 soil particle size distribution across four degradation stages sand 0 02 2 mm was the dominant component in the top 0 40 cm across all four degradation stages mean 49 34 followed by silt 0 002 0 05 mm mean 44 76 and clay 0 002 mm mean 5 87 fig 3 for each stage of degradation the clay and silt contents increased sharply with soil depth while sand content decreased fig 3 furthermore the clay content within the different soil layers varied significantly between degradation stages fig 3 the 0 10 cm clay content not changed significantly with increasing degradation but 20 40 cm clay content in heavy degradation was significantly higher than other three degradation sites fig 3a however there was no significant changed for silt and sand content with increasing degradation fig 3b and c 3 3 soil properties across four degradation stages the soil organic matter was mainly distributed in the top 10 cm soil layer and decreased rapidly with soil depth across all four degradation stages whereas the soil bulk density and soil compaction increased with soil depth fig 4 a c similarly to soil organic matter the soil total porosity reduced with soil depth but there was no clear pattern in capillary porosity or non capillary porosity fig 4d f soil organic matter firstly increased and then decreased with increasing degradation fig 4a the 0 10 cm soil organic matter 247 36 35 80 g kg 1 in moderate degradation was significantly higher than those of the other three degradation sites whereas there was no significant change in the 10 40 cm layer fig 4a in contrast the 0 10 cm soil bulk density slightly decreased with increasing degradation from no degradation to moderate degradation reaching a minimum value in moderate degradation 0 61 0 05 g cm 3 fig 4b the 0 20 cm soil compaction decreased with increasing degradation while the 20 40 cm soil compaction firstly increased and then decreased with the maximum value in light degradation fig 4c however there was no significant change in soil total porosity but wide variability in capillary porosity and non capillary porosity with increasing degradation fig 4e and f the 5 cm soil temperature in hd was higher than other three degradation sites fig 5 a the 5 cm soil water content increases with vegetation degradation for nd to md then decrease from md to hd fig 5b 3 4 soil water retention across four degradation stages the soil water characteristic curves fig 6 based on the gardner model yielded a good fit between soil water potential and soil water content with a high r 2 across four degradation stage parameter a for the 0 10 cm soil layer increased from no degradation to moderate degradation then decreased with the maximum in moderate degradation fig 6 reflecting that the 0 10 cm maximum soil water retention capacity occurred in moderate degradation whereas no clear pattern was seen in the 10 40 cm layer fig 6 overall the moderate degradation stage display the strongest capacities for soil water retention in 0 10 cm while the heavy degradation stage exert the strongest capacities for soil water retention in 20 40 cm fig 6 similar to the former case the strongest capacities for plant available water content were observed in the moderate degradation in 0 10 cm and the heavy degradation in 20 40 cm table 2 3 5 relationships between soil water retention and soil properties pearson correlation indicated that parameter a and plant available water content were significantly positively related to soil organic matter soil total porosity capillary porosity and sand content but significantly negatively related to soil bulk density silt content and clay content table 3 the non capillary porosity exert no significant effect on parameter a and plant available water content these correlations indicated that the soil water retention capacity of alpine grassland was positively associated with soil organic matter soil total porosity capillary porosity and sand content but significantly negatively related to soil bulk density silt content and clay content furthermore there was a good correlation between soil physical properties and soil organic matter table 3 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties under different degradation stages estimating changes in soil properties under different degradation stages is of great importance in assessing the vulnerability of grassland to degradation in general grassland degradation is often associated with soil physical properties such as reduced organic matter increased soil bulk density and reduced water retention zha and tang 2003 these soil changes can be described as a deterioration of soil structure and are part of a broad range of both soil physical conditions and soil chemistry processes alegre and cassel 1996 many studies have found that soil bulk density increased with increasing grassland degradation owing to trampling by cattle pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 this pattern was not observed in our study furthermore soil organic matter content showed an increasing then decreasing pattern with the maximum in the moderate degradation stage fig 4a this result was not consistent with previous studies that the soil organic matter content decreased with increasing degradation pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 these discrepancies may be attributed to the unique mattic diagnostic epipedon at our study site the mattic epipedons are mainly distributed in alpine ecosystems especially on the qinghai tibet plateau zhi et al 2017 previous study reported that the thickness of the mattic epipedon gradually increased with increasing grassland degradation from no degradation to moderate degradation in the same study site to a maximum in the moderate degradation stage i e there was a thickening in the mattic epipedon of the k pygmaea community dai et al 2019a lead to a higher soil organic matter in the surface soil layer owing to its high root biomass triggered by the extreme development of k pygmaea community fig 2b subsequently a lower soil bulk density under moderate degradation in this study furthermore several studies have shown that changes in soil physical properties are strongly affected by soil organic matter yang et al 2014 this pattern was supported by the well correlation between soil physical properties and soil organic matter in our results table 3 the soil texture also varied between degradation stages here the 0 10 cm soil layer particle size distribution was not significantly changed but there was an increased in the 20 40 cm clay content with increasing degradation suggesting that degradation of the alpine meadow could enhance clay content in 20 40 cm this result was inconsistent with a previous study in which the clay and silt contents of both the deep and top soil layers decreased with increasing degradation zeng et al 2013 such increased clay contents in the 20 40 cm in our study perhaps attributed to the downwards migration of the smallest topsoil particles clay and silt by precipitation infiltration or rodent infestation moreover we found that the capillary porosity increased under stronger degradation in the 20 40 cm soil layers fig 3a which could ascribe to the increasing clay content furthermore our results highlight that the grassland degradation index proposed in this study table 1 is likely to be suitable for describing the level of degradation of the vegetation cover but it is inadequate for detecting soil degradation therefore given the high soil organic matte an improved classification standard for grassland degradation should be established for mattic epipedons which takes into account soil degradation 4 2 soil water retention and its controls under varying levels of degradation given that soil water retention was controlled by vegetation and soil properties changes in these factors must cause changes in soil water retention zeng et al 2013 dai et al 2020 in this study 0 10 cm soil water retention in moderate degradation stage was much higher than that of the other three degradation stages fig 6a this pattern is not consistent with previous studies finding that the water holding capacity decreased with increasing grassland degradation pan et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 our results suggest that the degradation of vegetation cover does not necessarily lead to a decrease in soil water retention because soil properties such as soil organic matter and soil bulk density also play a vital role in regulating soil water retention therefore an improved degradation classification system should include both soil and vegetation conditions when estimating soil water retention under varying levels of degradation in this study the higher 0 10 cm soil water retention in moderate degradation may be associated with the higher soil organic matter owing to the overgrowth of mattic epipedon i e dense organic rich turf in moderate degradation because the higher soil organic matter is often associated with more stable aggregates and water storage li et al 2015 further evidence for this interpretation was provided by the significant positive relationships between plant available water content and soil organic matter table 3 these results have clearly documented that soil organic matter is the key factor affecting soil water retention in alpine ecosystem han et al 2012 yang et al 2014 dai et al 2020 the effects of soil organic matter on soil water retention were by following two aspects first the soil organic matter can improve soil structural stability by promoting water retention reducing erosion and contributing to the infiltration of air and water gregorich et al 1994 second the soil bulk density and aggregate stability have been shown to be strongly affected by soil organic matter baldock and nelson 2000 as supported by the good correlation in our study table 3 the organic matter affects soil bulk density by lowering the density of the solid phase and by building a soil structure that enhances soil porosity bot and benites 2005 furthermore the highest root biomass in moderate degradation may an alternative explanation for the highest soil water retention in moderate degradation there is increasing evidence indicating that root adsorption contributes strongly to soil water retention in alpine meadows gao et al 2018 li et al 2015 furthermore the soil volumetric water under moderate degradation was obvious higher other three stages fig 5b together with soil volumetric water content was maintained at 20 even at 1500 kpa wilting coefficient pressure fig 6 further supporting the strong soil water retention of the moderate degradation even under higher pressures therefore we may conclude that the highest soil water retention in 0 10 cm for moderate degradation was induced by the combine effects of root biomass and soil organic matter however the soil water retention in the 20 40 cm soil layer for heavy degradation was much higher than that of the other three degradation stages the higher soil water retention in heavy degradation may be attributed to the higher capillary porosity in general the soil porosity can be classified into non capillary porosity pore size 0 1 mm and capillary porosity pore size 0 1 mm and is primarily controlled by soil texture and aggregates gao et al 2015 a higher clay content leads to smaller pore sizes thereby increasing the capillary porosity it has been well documented that soil water retention is mainly dominated by capillary porosity with little influence of non capillary porosity pan et al 2017 in addition to soil organic matter the soil water retention was also affected by soil texture previous studies have documented that the clay and silt contents are strongly positively related to soil water retention whereas sand content is negatively associated with soil water retention khlosi et al 2013 mcbride and mackintosh 1984 in contrast to these studies we found that clay and silt contents were significantly negatively related to soil water retention whereas the sand content was significantly positively associated with soil water retention table 3 these differences might be attributed to the vertical distribution of soil particle sizes in our study the clay and silt contents increased with soil depth while the sand content decreased consistent with the trend in soil water retention furthermore the soil water retention was also greatly influenced by freezing thawing cycle in this study the soil frost period commenced in early november and ended in march the soil freezing process was from november to the following march and the soil thawing process was from the end of march to june dai et al 2019b during the soil freezing process the soil water begins to freeze from the surface to the deeper soil layers under the temperature gradient and the water was transferred from the unfrozen soil to the frozen soil with condensation occurs along the freeze front under soil water potential gradient ultimately increase the water content in frozen soil wen et al 2012 xu et al 2019 dai et al 2019b during the soil thawing process the soil melting starts from both upper and lower layers of the frozen soil and the water from melted ice in the upper layer was impeded by the frozen layer in the middle thereby increase the upper soil water content xu et al 2019 dai et al 2019b furthermore the soil porosity reduced significantly during freezing period thereby decreased soil moisture infiltration which impeding precipitation infiltration into deep soil ultimately reducing soil water retention whereas the soil moisture infiltration increased significantly during thawing period which improve the soil water retention this highlighted the need for additional research on the effect of freezing and thawing processes on soil water retention 4 3 effect of mattic epipedon on soil water retention of degradation alpine meadow soil water retention plays an important role in land surface processes and hydrologic cycles it not only affected by vegetation characteristic but also determined by soil property in this study although the aboveground biomass decreased with increasing degradation the soil organic matter content showed an increasing then decreasing pattern as vegetation degradation increased with the maximum in the moderate degradation stage fig 4a the high level of soil organic matter content in moderate degradation stage was attributed to the thick mattic epipedon in kobresia pygmaea community because the plant in kobresia pygmaea community tend to allocated more biomass to underground part to against livestock pressure and increases the activity of the plant community resulting in thickness of the mattic epipedon in moderate degradation stage lin et al 2015 dai et al 2019a thereby the higher soil organic matter content in the moderate degradation stage than other three degradation stages combine those we may conclude that the high soil water retention in moderate degradation stage was closely related to the high soil organic matter content induced by the thickness of the mattic epipedon overall the soil water retention of alpine meadow was controlled by the combine effect of root biomass and soil property and mattic epipedon play a critical role in soil water retention of alpine ecosystem via altering root biomass and soil property there is increasing evidence indicated that many environmental factors have been changed such as soil bulk density soil moisture and temperature and soil nutrient as the mattic epipedon thickens dai et al 2019a lin et al 2015 subsequent altering the hydrological process the mattic epipedon enables a stronger soil water storage capacity owing to its higher soil organic matter and soil porosity in the shallow soil layers li et al 2015 of course it should be noted that over growth of the mattic epipedon can provide favorable conditions for rodent infestations by supplying abundant food and suitable habitats consequently resulting in the subsequent destruction of the mattic epipedon kang et al 2007 lin et al 2015 in recent decades the distribution of mattic epipedon has been severely diminished across the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau because of the increasing effects of grazing as well as rodent infestation zhi et al 2017 considering the vital role of mattic epipedon in soil water retention in alpine meadows we should take effective measures taken to protect the mattic epipedon across this region in the future for example the grassland in moderate degradation stage should prevent the livestock trampling by controlling grazing intensity such as reduced grazing or grazing exclusion 5 conclusion the soil water retention of the alpine meadow soil was strongly affected by grassland degradation due to the resulting changes in soil properties under increasing levels of grassland degradation the 0 10 cm clay content not change significantly but increased 20 40 cm clay content the soil water retention of the 0 10 cm soil layer displays an increasing and then decreasing trend with the maximum water holding capacity in the moderate degradation stage this pattern may be associated with the higher soil organic matter content in the moderate degradation stage due to the thicker mattic epipedon however the soil water retention under heavy degradation in the 20 40 cm soil layer was much higher than that of the other three degradation stages owing to its higher capillary porosity our result could provide new insights into the effects of grassland vegetation degradation on soil hydrology with benefits in establishing grassland management strategies furthermore we should focus more attention towards the protection of mattic epipedon across the qinghai tibetan plateau considering their strong water holding capacity credit authorship contribution statement licong dai writing original draft writing review editing yiming yuan
