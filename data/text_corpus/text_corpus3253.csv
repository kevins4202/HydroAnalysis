16265,graphene oxide go coating has recently been reported as a novel approach to increase membrane flux of membrane distillation md yet the phenomena underlying the process are still not fully understood in this study a mathematical model based on capillary film assumption was developed and validated with the results r2 0 99 from a series of md experiments according to the model when go layer was placed at the evaporation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface increases significantly 44 2 92 0 and the temperature polarization coefficient is increased greatly from 0 29 0 38 to around 0 55 this leads to a big increase of driving force for higher heat flow and subsequently mass flux 17 8 45 5 however the vapor pressure on membrane surface was decreased due to kelvin effect of go capillary pores which has a negative influence on the driving force accounting for about 26 9 to 52 6 drop in the achieved flux in comparison when go layer was placed at the condensation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface decreases slightly 7 2 12 2 but the reduced vapor pressure on go capillary pores due to kelvin effect become the dominant factor affecting membrane flux resulting in an increase mass flux of 12 4 16 4 the model developed in this study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of go coating on flux

and wastewater reclamation are two strategies to produce clean water from seawater or wastewaters however a large volume of high salinity brine is generated in such processes containing different salts and organic contaminants due to the environmental risks associated with disposal of these high salinity brines zero liquid discharge zld has become an important wastewater management strategy globally castro munoz et al 2021a li et al 2020 reverse osmosis ro is the most efficient desalination or brine concentration technology but its current salinity limit is around 80 g kg therefore other desalination technologies are required to desalinate or concentrate brines above the salinity limit of ro castro munoz 2020 deshmukh et al 2018 membrane distillation md is a phase change process which uses hydrophobic micro porous membrane to separates two different aqueous solutions but allows only vapor permeation it can obtain a high quality of permeate from hypersaline wastewaters by using thermal energy lu et al 2019 castro munoz et al 2021b md has the advantages of employing a simple heat transfer equipment a low areal footprint and low grade waste heat utilization from industrial facilities or power plants however the large scale implementation of md remains rather limited throughout the world at present time apart from its inherent low energy efficiency the relatively low average water fluxes and possible scaling and fouling problems are the main reasons behind this deshmukh et al 2018 lee et al 2016 ma et al 2021 recently graphene based materials have received more and more attention in the membrane distillation field gontarek castro et al 2021a in particular graphene oxide go containing unoxidized hexagonal networks of carbon atoms and large amount of oxygen containing functional groups hydroxyl carboxyl and epoxy in the carbon lattice has exhibited a superior water permeability and anti fouling properties anand et al 2018 gontarek castro et al 2021b these specific features have attracted interests on fabrication of novel hybrid membranes involving coating of md membrane by a go layer to increase water flux and heat efficiency of membrane distillation dcmd systems bhadra et al reported the increase of membrane flux by over 35 through immobilization of go layer on ptfe bhadra et al 2016 e gontarek et al demonstrated a 285 flux increase by incorporating graphene platelets into pvdf membranes gontarek et al 2019 similar results with a flux increase of 35 169 were also reported by other studies including our research group leaper et al 2018 abdel karim et al 2019 ren et al 2020 interestingly when the go layer was employed on the permeate side of pvdf membrane the membrane flux was only increase of 15 0 18 9 apparently less than that when contacted with hot stream intrchom et al 2018 xu et al 2020 the above studies suggested that go incorporation can be a promising method to fabricate high flux md membranes however there seems to be no clear explanation for the fundamental mechanism underlying the phenomena it is believed that the formation of sp2 nanocapillaries by close graphene laminate provides a frictionless flow channel 0 7 0 9 nm for water monolayers chong et al 2018 the intermolecular interactions between water molecular and the flow channel could lead to the enhancement of water transport castro munoz et al 2019 joshi et al 2014 in addition go laminates have a higher thermal conductivity 2 to 20 w m k depending on the oxidation of go sheets which is an order of magnitude higher than conventional ptfe material renteria et al 2015 zeng et al 2020 therefore the incorporation of go can reduce the heat transfer resistance of the boundary layer resulting in the increase of membrane surface temperature this phenomenon was proved by seo and coworkers by placing temperature probes as close as to the membrane surface seo et al 2018 however it should be noted that the vapor pressure would be changed inside the hydrophilic capillary go pores due to kelvin effect which was often overlooked in md calculation therefore the vapor pressure change at the liquid vapor meniscus of go layer should be considered as well from the above discussion it can be concluded that the enhanced flux of graphene oxide composite membrane is correlated to the aforementioned factors however to the best of our knowledge there is limited studies on development of a model to explain the flux increasing mechanism of go layer in addition the great difference between go at evaporation and condensation interfaces is also interesting to explore therefore a mathematical model based on go capillary film assumption was developed and validated with the results from a series of md experiments the temperature profile at membrane surfaces tmf and tmp heat efficiency η and temperature polarization coefficient tpc as well as the vapor pressure profile at membrane surfaces pmf and pmp in dcmd at various feed temperatures of 40 c 70 c were calculated according to the model based on this model the effect of go layer on heat transfer and mass transfer were exploited to understanding the role of go coating on flux improvement 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of go ptfe membrane the go solution 5 mg ml and dopamine powder were purchased from guosen linghang inc china the polymerized dopamine solution 2 g l was prepared by adding dopamine powder into tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 5 the supporting ptfe hydrophobic membrane was supplied by changqi inc china and the overall porosity nominal pore size and thickness was 90 8 0 2 µm and 19 µm respectively the supporting ptfe membrane was dipped in anhydrous ethanol for ultrasonic cleaning for 1 h then the surface was cleaned with distilled water until neutral the cleaned ptfe membrane was immersed in the polymerized dopamine solution at room temperature for 6 h next in order to remove the residual unbound pda the membrane was washed with deionized water and dried in the open air for 12 h in the next step the dopamine pre coated ptfe membrane was placed on a film scraper the go solution was coated onto this with a pre set thickness finally the go ptfe composite membrane was dried naturally under shade for more than 12 h 2 2 membrane characterizations the top and the cross sectional view of the go ptfe were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jsm it500hr operating at 5 kv horiba soiontific lab ram hr evolution raman system japan and x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d2 germany were used to investigate the structure of go placed on the top of the composite membrane the thickness of the go layer was measured by atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension icon germany and the defects were observed by afm and transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai f30 holland surface area analyzer bet quantachrome 2200e usa was employed to measure go s pore diameter surface area and pore volume go s porosity was measured by weighting methods described elsewhere tanis kanbur et al 2021 the wettability of pristine ptfe and go ptfe composite membranes were characterized by measuring the in air contact angles using a contact angle meter krüss dsa25 germany with sessile drop method 2 3 direct contact membrane distillation experiment the prepared composite go ptfe membranes were tested in a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd setup with measurements carried out with the go film facing the feed side at first and then facing the permeate side next the experiments were done at inlet feed temperatures of 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively and permeate temperatures was maintained at 20 c constantly in order to avoid the salt effect on mass transport pure water was used to obtain the go ptfe membrane flux the feed and permeate flow rates were kept at 0 2 m s in a counter current mode via peristaltic pumps wt600 2 j longer pump co ltd china the weight of distilled water obtained from the permeate side was measured by a digital balance for 8 h ja1202 haikang co ltd china and the flux was calculated by dividing the weight by the effective membrane area 27 cm2 2 4 evaporation test of the wetted go ptfe a water bath circulation double layer beaker was used to measure the surface vapor pressure of the wetted go ptfe composite membrane the beaker was placed in the incubator where the temperature humidity and mass data were measured and recorded on a computer the pristine ptfe membrane and go ptfe composite membrane were put on the thin pad with 4 cm2 notch and dipped in the water the hot water enters from the lower port and flows out from the upper port to keep the evaporation temperature constant evaporation temperature was controlled from 20 c to 70 c once every 5 c every evaporation test lasted 10 h and repeated 3 times the surface vapor pressure of the go ptfe membrane was calculated based on the measurement of the mass loss rate by comparing two evaporation flux of ptfe membrane and go ptfe membrane as followed 1 j 1 k ptfe p 0 t p env t 2 j 2 k ptfe p go t p env t in which j1 and j2 are the evaporation flux of hydrophobic membrane and go ptfe composite membrane respectively kptfe is the membrane permeability of vapor p 0 t is the vapor pressure of the wetting plane liquid saturated vapor pressure at t which can be calculated by antoine equation li et al 2015 3 lgp 7 07406 1657 46 t 227 02 p env t is the water vapor pressure of the environment at t which can be measured by humidiometer p go t is the vapor pressure of the go evaporation interface at t according to eq 1 and eq 2 p go t can be calculated the empirical equation of p go t t can be drawn based on a series of evaporation experiment at different t which will be discussed in section 3 1 3 mathematical modeling the go composite membrane is composed of a top hydrophilic go layer and a hydrophobic ptfe supporting membrane as depicted in fig 2 a network of nano and micro capillaries is coexisted in the go coating layer and it provides a sufficient flow to keep the external go surface wetted therefore in the model development the go layer is regarded as a hydrophilic film with a large of capillary pores and the liquid vapor interfaces is formed only at the end of the hydrophobic ptfe layer with no phase change occurred at the interface of hot cold stream go layer the mass transfer and heat transfer models were developed based on the above assumptions 3 1 mass transfer when pure water is applied the concentration polarization effect can be ignored therefore water passes through go ptfe membrane mainly by three steps 1 liquid water passes through the go layer driven by capillary pressure of go pores 2 liquid water evaporates in go capillary pores at the go ptfe interface 3 water vapor diffuses through hydrophobic ptfe membrane based on knudsen and or molecular diffusion the flow of water in the go layer is driven by capillary pressure which can be described by modified hagen poiseuille s law baskoro et al 2018 4 j go d 4 12 l 2 η h δ p where d is d spacing of go lamellar l is the average lateral length of go lamellar η is the viscosity of water h is the thickness of go layer and δ p is the pressure gradient between two sides of go layer since the feed and permeate side are both open to the atmosphere the driving force in this process is mainly coming from the capillary force 5 δ p 2 σ cos θ r where σ is the surface tension between the liquid water and its vapor and r is the radius of capillary pores θ is the contact angle made between the liquid surface and the capillary wall water evaporation at meniscus interface of go s capillary pores can be described based on the dalton equation el mahdy et al 2021 6 j v d a p go pores t p ptfe t where d is the diffusivity of water vapor in air a is the evaporation area p go pores t is the saturated vapor pressure in the go capillary pores of liquid vapor interfaces at t and p ptfe t is the average vapor pressure in ptfe at t in addition the p go pores t is correlated to the morphology of go capillary layer which can be calculated by kelvin equation 7 rt ln p 0 t p go pores t v w 2 σ cos θ r where p 0 t denotes the equilibrium vapor partial pressure of a flat surface at t and v w is molar volume of the water the diffusion of water vapor in the ptfe membrane can be calculated as follows 8 j ptfe k ptfe p go pores t p ptfe t where kptfe is the membrane permeability of vapor p ptfe t is the vapor pressure of ptfe membrane surface at t which can be calculated by antoine equation the vapor transfer resistance in go ptfe composite membrane was mainly that arising from the pristine ptfe membrane which includes knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion expressed as qtaishat et al 2009 9 k ptfe 3 2 τ t δ t ε t r t π rt 8 m 1 2 τ t δ t ε t m p a r 1 895 10 5 t 1 072 1 where ε t r t τ t δ t means the porosity pore radius pore tortuosity and thickness of hydrophobic ptfe membrane which was provided by the supplier m is water s molecular weight r is molar gas constant and t is the average absolute temperature on both sides of the membrane that is t tmf tmp 2 pa is the air pressure according to the law of mass conservation the mass transfer of each part is equal 10 j go j v j ptfe with above equations the vapor pressure in the go capillary pores at the liquid vapor interface p go pores t for evaporation interface and condensation interface respectively can be obtained for a given temperature however it should be noted that the structure parameters of the top go layer such as d spacing pore size distribution thickness and contact angle would vary in presence of water and they are also temperature sensitive these parameters are difficult to measure in presence of water at different temperatures therefore an empirical equation based on evaporation test of go layer was established to describe the relationship between vapor pressure in go capillary pores and temperature eq 11 11 p go pores t 5 6 10 3 t 2 3 1 t 442 3 with this equation the model of mass transfer can be simplified as the following 12 j ptfe k ptfe 5 6 10 3 t 2 3 1 t 442 3 p ptfe t 3 2 heat transfer the heat transfer in go ptfe membrane when go layer is placed at evaporation interface includes four steps 1 the heat transfer from feed to the membrane interface through the heat boundary layer 2 heat through the go film in the form of latent heat and thermal conductivity 3 heat through ptfe membrane in the form of thermal conductivity 4 heat transfer from the membrane surface to permeate through the heat boundary layer the heat transfer is described as followed through the feed solution boundary layer 13 q f h f t f t go through the go top layer 14 q s h s t go t mf j δ h through the ptfe sub layer 15 q t h t t mf t mp through the permeate boundary layer 16 q p h p t mp t p in contrast when the go layer of go ptfe composite membrane is placed at the condensation

oxide hydrophilic layer hydrophobic layer the heat transfer coefficient hf and hp can be calculated based the equation 22 h f or h p nu λ w d 23 n u ar e x p r y μ b μ m z where nusselt numbers nu can be estimated with the help of reynolds re and prandtl pr numbers characteristics constants a x y and z of the liquid flow regime and water viscosity μ b and μ m at the bulk and at the membrane λw is thermal conductivity of water and d is the diameter of the pipe qtaishat et al 2009 heat transfer coefficient ht and hs can be calculated through the followed equations where λg and λt are the thermal conductivities of the gas inside the pores and the hydrophobic ptfe membrane λw and λs are that of the water inside the pores and the hydrophilic layer go δ t and δ s are the membrane thickness of ptfe and go ε t and ε s respectively are porosity of ptfe and go membrane 24 h t λ g ε t λ t 1 ε t δ t 25 h s λ w ε s λ s 1 ε s δ s the latent heat of vaporization through the membrane is the main way

not all used for water vapor transfer of the membrane and the temperature polarization coefficient tpc is introduced as followed 28 tpc t mf t mp t f t p 3 3 model solution and the iterative approach three equations can be established by heat conservation in eq 21 while there are four unknowns i e the flux and the three unknown temperatures tmf tmp and tgo all four are difficult to measure and could not be calculated directly based on the above equations therefore a program was developed implemented in r language to calculate these parameters based on an iterative procedure in this program the membrane surface temperature is calculated using eq 13 to eq 16 or eq 17 to eq 20 depending on the position of go layer the vapor pressure is obtained from membrane surface temperature through antony equation eq 3 the vapor pressure in go capillary pores is then computed by eq 11 in order to evaluate all the parameters a value of j0 is used as an input as an initial estimate then the value j can be obtained according to the eq 20 the initial input value of j is now adjusted accordingly and the process repeated until the conditions j j 0 j 0 0 05 t mf t f and t mp t p are all met once convergence has been obtained the values of j tmf tmp and tgo are obtained by the program 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of go ptfe composite membrane the go ptfe composite membrane was characterized by sem tem bet raman and xrd analytical methods it can be seen in fig 3 that a thin go layer was formed on the pristine ptfe membrane and it had an uneven and folding structure at a layered stacking condition which was similar to that reported from other studies li et al 2017 chen et al 2021 the porosity nominal pore size and thickness of the top hydrophilic go layer was measured as 74 3 1 1 3 8 nm and 153 210 nm respectively in addition the go layer showed two distinct raman peaks d band at 1350 cm and g band at 1602 cm fig 3c the d band is related to the defects in the hexagonal networks of carbon atoms and chemical functionalization whereas the g band is usually attributed to the breathing mode of the e2g phonon at the brillouin zone center these two peaks confirm the existence of graphene oxide on the composite membrane and the laminates have a multi layer structure goh et al 2015 the xrd patterns of the go layer exhibits a sharp peak at 10 38 which corresponds to a 0 78 nm interlayer spacing between the go sheets based on bragg s law fig 3d xu et al 2020 however it should be noted that the d spacing of go would be changed in presence of water castro munoz et al 2019 which was around 1 07 nm in this study the water contact angle of the go ptfe membrane was changed from 133 2 0 4 pristine ptfe membrane to 67 8 1 3 the above results show that a go layer of 153 210 nm was coated on the pristine ptfe membrane surface and the membrane changed from a hydrophobic surface to a hydrophilic state to further illustrate the detailed structure of the go layer afm and tem were conducted to show the lamellar structure defects of the laminates and the possible existence of nanopores imaging with afm in fig 4 a b shows the presence of defects in form of amorphization on the surface of graphene oxide the main reason is that when the graphene grows to a certain size and begins to cross and merge the different crystal orientation will lead to the formation of graphene line defects the size of defects on the surface of the graphene oxide varied in length of 0 2 4 5 µm depth of 3 10 nm chen et al 2021 sun et al 2019 fig 4 c d is ultra hr tem images of go layer which shows that there were many lamellar defects and nanopores in the go layer the lamellar defects were caused by laminate fracturing and overlapping which are consistent with those shown by afm imaging with afm and tem demonstrated that the inner structure of the go layer is complex as many lamellar defects and nanopores co existed it is believed that the capillary like pressure provides sufficient flow to keep such a thin go layer wetted therefore the flux of the go ptfe composite membrane was determined by the water vapor pressure difference between the go capillary pores and the liquid air interfaces 4 2 the vapor pressure of go capillary pores and model validation it is well known that for a wetting liquid confine to a hydrophilic pore the attractive force between the neighboring molecules will increase as compared to that of a plane surface resulting in a vapor pressure depression yang et al 2020 this vapor pressure depression becomes significant for capillary pores smaller than 100 nm and it can be calculated by kelvin equation for capillary films with uniform pore structure goh et al 2013 the evaporation tests were conducted to obtain the empirical equation of vapor pressure of go capillary pores vs temperature it can be seen in fig 5 that vapor pressure in the go capillary pores was increased apparently when temperature increased but all the value were lower than that of plane surface at the same temperature solid line in fig 5 the results indicate that water vapor pressure was reduced at the go capillary pores which is caused by the kelvin effect of the curvature of the evaporating surface the correlation co efficiency of the empirical equation was 0 991 indicating the validation of the method as described in 3 1 a series of md experiments were done to measure the pure water flux of the go ptfe membrane distillation process with go layer facing hot and cold side respectively the feed had four temperature levels i e 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c with cold side temperature was controlled at 20 c for each feeding temperature the flux was measured for three times and the average was used to show the flux of this temperature fig 6a depicted the flux of pristine ptfe and go ptfe membrane at various feed temperatures the flux of pristine ptfe membrane was 11 2 20 1 31 5 and 45 1 kg m2 h respectively however the flux of go ptfe membrane go layer at evaporation interface was 13 2 25 4 43 9 and 65 6 kg m2 h at 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively this indicates an increase of 17 8 26 3 39 5 and 45 5 compared to pristine membrane the flux increased more promisingly as temperature increased in comparison the flux of go ptfe membrane go layer at condensation interface was apparently less than that of hot side which were 13 1 22 7 35 4 and 51 9 kg m2 h at 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively corresponding to an increase of 16 4 13 1 12 4 and 15 0 interestingly the flux increase was in the range of 12 4 to 16 4 regardless of the different feed temperature indicating that flux go layer at condensation interface was not sensitive to the feed temperature these results were in accordance with the previous studies in which the flux could increase by 35 169 when go layer was coated to face hot stream leaper et al 2018 abdel karim et al 2019 ren et al 2020 but the increase was obviously less when it was contacted with cold stream 15 0 18 9 intrchom et al 2018 xu et al 2020 although the flux of go ptfe membrane was quite different for these two circumstances all the flux calculated from our model agrees very well with the experimental results r2 0 99 fig 6b this indicates that the flux in both cases can be calculated by the capillary film evaporation model thus indicating its universal validity however it should be noted that most of the measured fluxes were slightly lower than the predicted value this may be due to the fact that there is heat dissipation in the actual experiment so the heat transferred will be slightly lower than that in the ideal state the overall efficiency of a selected desalination membrane process is influenced by the achievable permeation flux which is concurrently influenced by the material and operating temperature castro munoz 2020 the model developed in this study could provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of go coating on flux enhancement which can be used for further development of high flux membranes in particular increase of membrane flux could reduce the md module complexity and capital cost remarkably making md more competitive 4 3 effect of go layer on flux enhancement at evaporation interface in order to reveal the role of go layer at different conditions the temperature at the membrane surfaces tmf tmp the heat efficiency η and temperature polarization coefficient tpc as well as the vapor pressure profile at membrane surfaces pmf pmp were calculated by the model fig 7 the go ptfe membrane surface temperature tmf was apparently higher that of pristine ptfe membrane which is 1 64 c 2 89 c 4 26 c and 6 31 c higher at feed temperature of 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively interestingly it was evident that tmp at the permeate side is also smaller than that of pristine membrane which is 1 75 c 3 04 c 4 53 c and 6 87 c lower respectively as such the temperature difference across ptfe membrane t tmf tmp was accordingly increased by 3 39 c 5 93 c 8 79 c and 13 18 c in comparison to the pristine membrane corresponding to an increase of 44 2 55 9 68 4 and 92 0 temperature polarization coefficient tpc is an index to evaluate the temperature polarization effect which can be used to examine the role of heat transfer limitation tpc of the pristine ptfe membrane was low 0 29 0 38 indicating that temperature polarization effect was serious especially at high feed temperatures and the md process was controlled by heat transfer in comparison go ptfe demonstrated a much higher tpc with a constant value of around 0 55 suggesting that temperature polarization was largely relieved and mass transfer tends to become the limitation in the go ptfe membrane in addition go ptfe membrane also demonstrated an obviously higher heat efficiency η which were 46 9 61 9 as compared to that of pristine ptfe membrane 33 4 40 4 the results indicate that more heat was being utilized to evaporate the water in the go ptfe composite membrane similar results have been reported by seo and coworkers in which the temperature difference across ptfe membrane was apparently increased with the coating of graphene based materials seo et al 2018 abdel karim et al studied the dcmd performance go pvdf composite membrane where they noted that the flux increased with a higher graphene oxide concentration in the go layer the authors attributed this flux increase to the greater value of t across the membrane abdel karim et al 2019 fig 7c and d shows the change of the surface vapor pressure pmf pmp and mass transfer coefficient k of the pristine ptfe membrane and go ptfe membrane respectively it is clearly showed that the mass transfer coefficient k was almost same for the two cases indicating that the effect of temperature on k was negligible both pmf and pmp of go ptfe membrane showed a similar trend as compared to the tmf and tmp indicating that the partial water pressure of the end of ptfe interface was associated closely with the respective surface temperature in order to further understand the effect of go layer on flux enhancement the driving force vapor pressure difference p across the pristine ptfe and go ptfe composite membrane were presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the driving force p was 1 88 3 38 5 23 and 7 41 kpa for pristine ptfe membrane at the feeding temperature of 40 70 c however they were increased to 2 19 4 26 7 24 and 10 89 kpa for go ptfe considering the unchanged mass transfer coefficient this leads to a flux increase of 17 8 26 3 39 5 and 45 5 as shown in fig 6a for comparison fig 8 also listed the vapor pressure gradient of go ptfe composite membrane when kelvin effect of the go capillary pores was not considered which were 2 72 5 32 9 15 and 14 68 kpa respectively the values were apparently higher than the actual p of go ptfe composite membrane indicating that the go capillary structure must have had a negative effect on membrane flux the similar results were achieved by goh and coworkers in which a vapor pressure depression of 21 31 was reported for a hydrophilic layer with a diameter of 4 8 nm goh et al 2013 to have a quantity analysis the contribution of these two effects on flux increase were calculated the increase of driving force by increase of temperature gradient was contributed to increases of 44 7 57 4 75 0 and 98 1 as compared to the pristine ptfe membrane however the opposing effect of vapor pressure depression due to go capillary structure caused a reduction in the flux by 26 9 31 1 35 5 and 52 6 as compared to the pristine ptfe membrane due to the above combined effect a flux increase of 17 8 26 3 39 5 and 45 5 was detected in the experiment for go at evaporation interface fig 6a 4 4 effect of go layer on flux enhancement at condensation interface the model was also used to evaluate the temperature at membrane surfaces heat efficiency η and temperature polarization coefficient tpc for the go ptfe membrane when go layer is placed at the condensation interface as shown in fig 9 tmf tmp t tmf tmp and tpc were decreased slightly than that of the pristine ptfe membrane it was speculated that the decrease of these parameters is related to the high thermal conductivity of go layer in which more heat was transferred to permeate side rather than to be utilized for evaporation however it is interesting that the heat efficiency of go ptfe membrane were almost unchanged than that of the pristine ptfe membrane indicating that more water was evaporated in this process fig 9c and d shows the variations of pmf pmp and k for the pristine ptfe membrane and the go ptfe membrane respectively the change of pmf and k was negligible however pmp displayed a notably decrease than that of pristine membrane even though tmp was almost same as compared to pristine membrane fig 8b we have already discussed the kelvin effect of go capillary pores of when go is placed at the evaporation interface which is negative due to that the water vapor flows in the opposite direction of the meniscus however when go is placed at the condensation interface the vapor liquid interface within go layer would still form a meniscus but it will be in the same direction of the water vapor flow therefore the vapor pressure depression would lead to a positive effect i e increasing the vapor pressure of the liquid vapor interface fig 10 shows the driving force vapor pressure difference p across the pristine ptfe and go ptfe composite membrane as shown in fig 10 the driving force p for go ptfe when go placing at condensation interface were 2 27 3 89 5 65 and 7 84 kpa the increase of the driving force values p was leading to an increase of flux of 16 4 13 1 12 4 and 15 0 than that of pristine ptfe fig 6a however when kelvin effect of the go capillary pores was not considered the values were 1 65 3 09 4 89 and 6 97 kpa at the feed temperature of 40 c to 70 c which was slightly lower than that of pristine membrane indicating that the major impact on flux enhancement was attributing to the reduction of vapor pressure of go capillary pores at condensation interface the above results are in consistent with the previous studies in which the membrane flux of dcmd system was enhanced by 15 18 9 when go coating was deposited on the permeate side of the ptfe membrane intrchom et al 2018 xu et al 2020 4 5 different role at evaporation and condensation interfaces all the above discussion supports the fact that the flux increase phenomenon of go layer incorporation was governed by the combined effects of heat transfer resistance reduction by go layer and vapor pressure depression of go capillary pores the prime role of go layer was the decrease of heat transfer resistance in md process when it was placed at evaporation interface this effect leads to significantly increased tmf but a drop in tmp which in turn promotes higher rates of water evaporation at the air liquid interface this effect becomes increasingly important at higher temperatures i e the higher the feeding temperature the more noticeable is the increase of the measured flux in comparison when go was placed at the condensation interface its high thermal conductivity would reduce the heat amount used for evaporation making the temperature gradient across the membrane decreased another thing is the vapor pressure depression of the go capillary pores the direction of liquid vapor meniscus at evaporation side would decrease the water vapor pressure leading to a notable drop of membrane flux especially at higher temperatures nevertheless this effect become positive as the meniscus direction was reversed when go was placed at condensation interface although the increase of temperature gradient was slightly reduced in this scenario the flux enhancement was still noticeable due to this positive contribution however the increase of flux was apparently less than that at evaporation interface which probably due to the weak kelvin effect of go capillary pores at low temperature of the cooling stream 20 c the model development of this study provides a theoretical foundation of understanding the mass and heat transfer of water molecular for go composite membrane it seems that the water superpermeability of go layer and the fast water evaporation rate at the liquid vapor interface would make the diffusion through hydrophobic microfiltration membrane as the rate limiting step therefore the key is to increase the vapor pressure of the vapor liquid meniscus of go layer to achieve such goal regulation of heat conductivity and nano scale structure of go layer might be the future directions 5 conclusions a mathematical model to describe the influence of the go coating on increase of flux for membrane distillation process was developed and validated against the experimental results this model considers both the effect of go on changing temperature gradient and vapor pressure depression caused by the presence of the capillary pores in the go layer according to the model when go is placed at the evaporation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface increases and the temperature polarization is greatly reduced this leads to an increase of driving force for higher thermal heat flow and subsequently mass flux however the vapor pressure depression due to kelvin effect has a negative influence on the driving force accounting for about 26 9 to 52 6 drop in the achieved flux in comparison when go is placed at the condensation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface decreases slightly 7 2 12 2 the contribution of flux increments as kelvin effect becomes the dominant factor for the flux enhancement in addition the flux increase is more notable when go placing at the evaporation interface rather than the condensation interface this indicates that the former operation mode is more effective to increase membrane flux the model developed in this study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of go coating on flux increase it should help to pave the way for further development of high flux go composite membranes to be used in membrane distillation processes fig 1 declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgements this work was

16265,graphene oxide go coating has recently been reported as a novel approach to increase membrane flux of membrane distillation md yet the phenomena underlying the process are still not fully understood in this study a mathematical model based on capillary film assumption was developed and validated with the results r2 0 99 from a series of md experiments according to the model when go layer was placed at the evaporation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface increases significantly 44 2 92 0 and the temperature polarization coefficient is increased greatly from 0 29 0 38 to around 0 55 this leads to a big increase of driving force for higher heat flow and subsequently mass flux 17 8 45 5 however the vapor pressure on membrane surface was decreased due to kelvin effect of go capillary pores which has a negative influence on the driving force accounting for about 26 9 to 52 6 drop in the achieved flux in comparison when go layer was placed at the condensation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface decreases slightly 7 2 12 2 but the reduced vapor pressure on go capillary pores due to kelvin effect become the dominant factor affecting membrane flux resulting in an increase mass flux of 12 4 16 4 the model developed in this study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of go coating on flux

and wastewater reclamation are two strategies to produce clean water from seawater or wastewaters however a large volume of high salinity brine is generated in such processes containing different salts and organic contaminants due to the environmental risks associated with disposal of these high salinity brines zero liquid discharge zld has become an important wastewater management strategy globally castro munoz et al 2021a li et al 2020 reverse osmosis ro is the most efficient desalination or brine concentration technology but its current salinity limit is around 80 g kg therefore other desalination technologies are required to desalinate or concentrate brines above the salinity limit of ro castro munoz 2020 deshmukh et al 2018 membrane distillation md is a phase change process which uses hydrophobic micro porous membrane to separates two different aqueous solutions but allows only vapor permeation it can obtain a high quality of permeate from hypersaline wastewaters by using thermal energy lu et al 2019 castro munoz et al 2021b md has the advantages of employing a simple heat transfer equipment a low areal footprint and low grade waste heat utilization from industrial facilities or power plants however the large scale implementation of md remains rather limited throughout the world at present time apart from its inherent low energy efficiency the relatively low average water fluxes and possible scaling and fouling problems are the main reasons behind this deshmukh et al 2018 lee et al 2016 ma et al 2021 recently graphene based materials have received more and more attention in the membrane distillation field gontarek castro et al 2021a in particular graphene oxide go containing unoxidized hexagonal networks of carbon atoms and large amount of oxygen containing functional groups hydroxyl carboxyl and epoxy in the carbon lattice has exhibited a superior water permeability and anti fouling properties anand et al 2018 gontarek castro et al 2021b these specific features have attracted interests on fabrication of novel hybrid membranes involving coating of md membrane by a go layer to increase water flux and heat efficiency of membrane distillation dcmd systems bhadra et al reported the increase of membrane flux by over 35 through immobilization of go layer on ptfe bhadra et al 2016 e gontarek et al demonstrated a 285 flux increase by incorporating graphene platelets into pvdf membranes gontarek et al 2019 similar results with a flux increase of 35 169 were also reported by other studies including our research group leaper et al 2018 abdel karim et al 2019 ren et al 2020 interestingly when the go layer was employed on the permeate side of pvdf membrane the membrane flux was only increase of 15 0 18 9 apparently less than that when contacted with hot stream intrchom et al 2018 xu et al 2020 the above studies suggested that go incorporation can be a promising method to fabricate high flux md membranes however there seems to be no clear explanation for the fundamental mechanism underlying the phenomena it is believed that the formation of sp2 nanocapillaries by close graphene laminate provides a frictionless flow channel 0 7 0 9 nm for water monolayers chong et al 2018 the intermolecular interactions between water molecular and the flow channel could lead to the enhancement of water transport castro munoz et al 2019 joshi et al 2014 in addition go laminates have a higher thermal conductivity 2 to 20 w m k depending on the oxidation of go sheets which is an order of magnitude higher than conventional ptfe material renteria et al 2015 zeng et al 2020 therefore the incorporation of go can reduce the heat transfer resistance of the boundary layer resulting in the increase of membrane surface temperature this phenomenon was proved by seo and coworkers by placing temperature probes as close as to the membrane surface seo et al 2018 however it should be noted that the vapor pressure would be changed inside the hydrophilic capillary go pores due to kelvin effect which was often overlooked in md calculation therefore the vapor pressure change at the liquid vapor meniscus of go layer should be considered as well from the above discussion it can be concluded that the enhanced flux of graphene oxide composite membrane is correlated to the aforementioned factors however to the best of our knowledge there is limited studies on development of a model to explain the flux increasing mechanism of go layer in addition the great difference between go at evaporation and condensation interfaces is also interesting to explore therefore a mathematical model based on go capillary film assumption was developed and validated with the results from a series of md experiments the temperature profile at membrane surfaces tmf and tmp heat efficiency η and temperature polarization coefficient tpc as well as the vapor pressure profile at membrane surfaces pmf and pmp in dcmd at various feed temperatures of 40 c 70 c were calculated according to the model based on this model the effect of go layer on heat transfer and mass transfer were exploited to understanding the role of go coating on flux improvement 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of go ptfe membrane the go solution 5 mg ml and dopamine powder were purchased from guosen linghang inc china the polymerized dopamine solution 2 g l was prepared by adding dopamine powder into tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 5 the supporting ptfe hydrophobic membrane was supplied by changqi inc china and the overall porosity nominal pore size and thickness was 90 8 0 2 µm and 19 µm respectively the supporting ptfe membrane was dipped in anhydrous ethanol for ultrasonic cleaning for 1 h then the surface was cleaned with distilled water until neutral the cleaned ptfe membrane was immersed in the polymerized dopamine solution at room temperature for 6 h next in order to remove the residual unbound pda the membrane was washed with deionized water and dried in the open air for 12 h in the next step the dopamine pre coated ptfe membrane was placed on a film scraper the go solution was coated onto this with a pre set thickness finally the go ptfe composite membrane was dried naturally under shade for more than 12 h 2 2 membrane characterizations the top and the cross sectional view of the go ptfe were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jsm it500hr operating at 5 kv horiba soiontific lab ram hr evolution raman system japan and x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d2 germany were used to investigate the structure of go placed on the top of the composite membrane the thickness of the go layer was measured by atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension icon germany and the defects were observed by afm and transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai f30 holland surface area analyzer bet quantachrome 2200e usa was employed to measure go s pore diameter surface area and pore volume go s porosity was measured by weighting methods described elsewhere tanis kanbur et al 2021 the wettability of pristine ptfe and go ptfe composite membranes were characterized by measuring the in air contact angles using a contact angle meter krüss dsa25 germany with sessile drop method 2 3 direct contact membrane distillation experiment the prepared composite go ptfe membranes were tested in a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd setup with measurements carried out with the go film facing the feed side at first and then facing the permeate side next the experiments were done at inlet feed temperatures of 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively and permeate temperatures was maintained at 20 c constantly in order to avoid the salt effect on mass transport pure water was used to obtain the go ptfe membrane flux the feed and permeate flow rates were kept at 0 2 m s in a counter current mode via peristaltic pumps wt600 2 j longer pump co ltd china the weight of distilled water obtained from the permeate side was measured by a digital balance for 8 h ja1202 haikang co ltd china and the flux was calculated by dividing the weight by the effective membrane area 27 cm2 2 4 evaporation test of the wetted go ptfe a water bath circulation double layer beaker was used to measure the surface vapor pressure of the wetted go ptfe composite membrane the beaker was placed in the incubator where the temperature humidity and mass data were measured and recorded on a computer the pristine ptfe membrane and go ptfe composite membrane were put on the thin pad with 4 cm2 notch and dipped in the water the hot water enters from the lower port and flows out from the upper port to keep the evaporation temperature constant evaporation temperature was controlled from 20 c to 70 c once every 5 c every evaporation test lasted 10 h and repeated 3 times the surface vapor pressure of the go ptfe membrane was calculated based on the measurement of the mass loss rate by comparing two evaporation flux of ptfe membrane and go ptfe membrane as followed 1 j 1 k ptfe p 0 t p env t 2 j 2 k ptfe p go t p env t in which j1 and j2 are the evaporation flux of hydrophobic membrane and go ptfe composite membrane respectively kptfe is the membrane permeability of vapor p 0 t is the vapor pressure of the wetting plane liquid saturated vapor pressure at t which can be calculated by antoine equation li et al 2015 3 lgp 7 07406 1657 46 t 227 02 p env t is the water vapor pressure of the environment at t which can be measured by humidiometer p go t is the vapor pressure of the go evaporation interface at t according to eq 1 and eq 2 p go t can be calculated the empirical equation of p go t t can be drawn based on a series of evaporation experiment at different t which will be discussed in section 3 1 3 mathematical modeling the go composite membrane is composed of a top hydrophilic go layer and a hydrophobic ptfe supporting membrane as depicted in fig 2 a network of nano and micro capillaries is coexisted in the go coating layer and it provides a sufficient flow to keep the external go surface wetted therefore in the model development the go layer is regarded as a hydrophilic film with a large of capillary pores and the liquid vapor interfaces is formed only at the end of the hydrophobic ptfe layer with no phase change occurred at the interface of hot cold stream go layer the mass transfer and heat transfer models were developed based on the above assumptions 3 1 mass transfer when pure water is applied the concentration polarization effect can be ignored therefore water passes through go ptfe membrane mainly by three steps 1 liquid water passes through the go layer driven by capillary pressure of go pores 2 liquid water evaporates in go capillary pores at the go ptfe interface 3 water vapor diffuses through hydrophobic ptfe membrane based on knudsen and or molecular diffusion the flow of water in the go layer is driven by capillary pressure which can be described by modified hagen poiseuille s law baskoro et al 2018 4 j go d 4 12 l 2 η h δ p where d is d spacing of go lamellar l is the average lateral length of go lamellar η is the viscosity of water h is the thickness of go layer and δ p is the pressure gradient between two sides of go layer since the feed and permeate side are both open to the atmosphere the driving force in this process is mainly coming from the capillary force 5 δ p 2 σ cos θ r where σ is the surface tension between the liquid water and its vapor and r is the radius of capillary pores θ is the contact angle made between the liquid surface and the capillary wall water evaporation at meniscus interface of go s capillary pores can be described based on the dalton equation el mahdy et al 2021 6 j v d a p go pores t p ptfe t where d is the diffusivity of water vapor in air a is the evaporation area p go pores t is the saturated vapor pressure in the go capillary pores of liquid vapor interfaces at t and p ptfe t is the average vapor pressure in ptfe at t in addition the p go pores t is correlated to the morphology of go capillary layer which can be calculated by kelvin equation 7 rt ln p 0 t p go pores t v w 2 σ cos θ r where p 0 t denotes the equilibrium vapor partial pressure of a flat surface at t and v w is molar volume of the water the diffusion of water vapor in the ptfe membrane can be calculated as follows 8 j ptfe k ptfe p go pores t p ptfe t where kptfe is the membrane permeability of vapor p ptfe t is the vapor pressure of ptfe membrane surface at t which can be calculated by antoine equation the vapor transfer resistance in go ptfe composite membrane was mainly that arising from the pristine ptfe membrane which includes knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion expressed as qtaishat et al 2009 9 k ptfe 3 2 τ t δ t ε t r t π rt 8 m 1 2 τ t δ t ε t m p a r 1 895 10 5 t 1 072 1 where ε t r t τ t δ t means the porosity pore radius pore tortuosity and thickness of hydrophobic ptfe membrane which was provided by the supplier m is water s molecular weight r is molar gas constant and t is the average absolute temperature on both sides of the membrane that is t tmf tmp 2 pa is the air pressure according to the law of mass conservation the mass transfer of each part is equal 10 j go j v j ptfe with above equations the vapor pressure in the go capillary pores at the liquid vapor interface p go pores t for evaporation interface and condensation interface respectively can be obtained for a given temperature however it should be noted that the structure parameters of the top go layer such as d spacing pore size distribution thickness and contact angle would vary in presence of water and they are also temperature sensitive these parameters are difficult to measure in presence of water at different temperatures therefore an empirical equation based on evaporation test of go layer was established to describe the relationship between vapor pressure in go capillary pores and temperature eq 11 11 p go pores t 5 6 10 3 t 2 3 1 t 442 3 with this equation the model of mass transfer can be simplified as the following 12 j ptfe k ptfe 5 6 10 3 t 2 3 1 t 442 3 p ptfe t 3 2 heat transfer the heat transfer in go ptfe membrane when go layer is placed at evaporation interface includes four steps 1 the heat transfer from feed to the membrane interface through the heat boundary layer 2 heat through the go film in the form of latent heat and thermal conductivity 3 heat through ptfe membrane in the form of thermal conductivity 4 heat transfer from the membrane surface to permeate through the heat boundary layer the heat transfer is described as followed through the feed solution boundary layer 13 q f h f t f t go through the go top layer 14 q s h s t go t mf j δ h

thermal conductivity of water and d is the diameter of the pipe qtaishat et al 2009 heat transfer coefficient ht and hs can be calculated through the followed equations where λg and λt are the thermal conductivities of the gas inside the pores and the hydrophobic ptfe membrane λw and λs are that of the water inside the pores and the hydrophilic layer go δ t and δ s are the membrane thickness of

three equations can be established by heat conservation in eq 21 while there are four unknowns i e the flux and the three unknown temperatures tmf tmp and tgo all four are difficult to measure and could not be calculated directly based on the above equations therefore a program was developed implemented in r language to calculate these parameters based on an iterative procedure in this program the membrane surface temperature is calculated using eq 13 to eq 16 or eq 17 to eq 20 depending on the position of go layer the vapor pressure is obtained from membrane surface temperature through antony equation eq 3 the vapor pressure in go capillary pores is then computed by eq 11 in order to evaluate all the parameters a value of j0 is used as an input as an initial estimate then the value j can be obtained according to the eq 20 the initial input value of j is now adjusted accordingly and the process repeated until the conditions j j 0 j 0 0 05 t mf t f and t mp t p are all met once convergence has been obtained the values of j tmf tmp and tgo are obtained by the program 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of go ptfe composite membrane the go ptfe composite membrane was characterized by sem tem bet raman and xrd analytical methods it can be seen in fig 3 that a thin go layer was formed on the pristine ptfe membrane and it had an uneven and folding structure at a layered stacking condition which was similar to that reported from other studies li et al 2017 chen et al 2021 the porosity nominal pore size and thickness of the top hydrophilic go layer was measured as 74 3 1 1 3 8 nm and 153 210 nm respectively in addition the go layer showed two distinct raman peaks d band at 1350 cm and g band at 1602 cm fig 3c the d band is related to the defects in the hexagonal networks of carbon atoms and chemical functionalization whereas the g band is usually attributed to the breathing mode of the e2g phonon at the brillouin zone center these two peaks confirm the existence of graphene oxide on the composite membrane and the laminates have a multi layer structure goh et al 2015 the xrd patterns of the go layer exhibits a sharp peak at 10 38 which corresponds to a 0 78 nm interlayer spacing between the go sheets based on bragg s law fig 3d xu et al 2020 however it should be noted that the d spacing of go would be changed in presence of water castro munoz et al 2019 which was around 1 07 nm in this study the water contact angle of the go ptfe membrane was changed from 133 2 0 4 pristine ptfe membrane to 67 8 1 3 the above results show that a go layer of 153 210 nm was coated on the pristine ptfe membrane surface and the membrane changed from a hydrophobic surface to a hydrophilic state to further illustrate the detailed structure of the go layer afm and tem were conducted to show the lamellar structure defects of the laminates and the possible existence of nanopores imaging with afm in fig 4 a b shows the presence of defects in form of amorphization on the surface of graphene oxide the main reason is that when the graphene grows to a certain size and begins to cross and merge the different crystal orientation will lead to the formation of graphene line defects the size of defects on the surface of the graphene oxide varied in length of 0 2 4 5 µm depth of 3 10 nm chen et al 2021 sun et al 2019 fig 4 c d is ultra hr tem images of go layer which shows that there were many lamellar defects and nanopores in the go layer the lamellar defects were caused by laminate fracturing and overlapping which are consistent with those shown by afm imaging with afm and tem demonstrated that the inner structure of the go layer is complex as many lamellar defects and nanopores co existed it is believed that the capillary like pressure provides sufficient flow to keep such a thin go layer wetted therefore the flux of the go ptfe composite membrane was determined by the water vapor pressure difference between the go capillary pores and the liquid air interfaces 4 2 the vapor pressure of go capillary pores and model validation it is well known that for a wetting liquid confine to a hydrophilic pore the attractive force between the neighboring molecules will increase as compared to that of a plane surface resulting in a vapor pressure depression yang et al 2020 this vapor pressure depression becomes significant for capillary pores smaller than 100 nm and it can be calculated by kelvin equation for capillary films with uniform pore structure goh et al 2013 the evaporation tests were conducted to obtain the empirical equation of vapor pressure of go capillary pores vs temperature it can be seen in fig 5 that vapor pressure in the go capillary pores was increased apparently when temperature increased but all the value were lower than that of plane surface at the same temperature solid line in fig 5 the results indicate that water vapor pressure was reduced at the go capillary pores which is caused by the kelvin effect of the curvature of the evaporating surface the correlation co efficiency of the empirical equation was 0 991 indicating the validation of the method as described in 3 1 a series of md experiments were done to measure the pure water flux of the go ptfe membrane distillation process with go layer facing hot and cold side respectively the feed had four temperature levels i e 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c with cold side temperature was controlled at 20 c for each feeding temperature the flux was measured for three times and the average was used to show the flux of this temperature fig 6a depicted the flux of pristine ptfe and go ptfe membrane at various feed temperatures the flux of pristine ptfe membrane was 11 2 20 1 31 5 and 45 1 kg m2 h respectively however the flux of go ptfe membrane go layer at evaporation interface was 13 2 25 4 43 9 and 65 6 kg m2 h at 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively this indicates an increase of 17 8 26 3 39 5 and 45 5 compared to pristine membrane the flux increased more promisingly as temperature increased in comparison the flux of go ptfe membrane go layer at condensation interface was apparently less than that of hot side which were 13 1 22 7 35 4 and 51 9 kg m2 h at 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively corresponding to an increase of 16 4 13 1 12 4 and 15 0 interestingly the flux increase was in the range of 12 4 to 16 4 regardless of the different feed temperature indicating that flux go layer at condensation interface was not sensitive to the feed temperature these results were in accordance with the previous studies in which the flux could increase by 35 169 when go layer was coated to face hot stream leaper et al 2018 abdel karim et al 2019 ren et al 2020 but the increase was obviously less when it was contacted with cold stream 15 0 18 9 intrchom et al 2018 xu et al 2020 although the flux of go ptfe membrane was quite different for these two circumstances all the flux calculated from our model agrees very well with the experimental results r2 0 99 fig 6b this indicates that the flux in both cases can be calculated by the capillary film evaporation model thus indicating its universal validity however it should be noted that most of the measured fluxes were slightly lower than the predicted value this may be due to the fact that there is heat dissipation in the actual experiment so the heat transferred will be slightly lower than that in the ideal state the overall efficiency of a selected desalination membrane process is influenced by the achievable permeation flux which is concurrently influenced by the material and operating temperature castro munoz 2020 the model developed in this study could provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of go coating on flux enhancement which can be used for further development of high flux membranes in particular increase of membrane flux could reduce the md module complexity and capital cost remarkably making md more competitive 4 3 effect of go layer on flux enhancement at evaporation interface in order to reveal the role of go layer at different conditions the temperature at the membrane surfaces tmf tmp the heat efficiency η and temperature polarization coefficient tpc as well as the vapor pressure profile at membrane surfaces pmf pmp were calculated by the model fig 7 the go ptfe membrane surface temperature tmf was apparently higher that of pristine ptfe membrane which is 1 64 c 2 89 c 4 26 c and 6 31 c higher at feed temperature of 40 c 50 c 60 c and 70 c respectively interestingly it was evident that tmp at the permeate side is also smaller than that of pristine membrane which is 1 75 c 3 04 c 4 53 c and 6 87 c lower respectively as such the temperature difference across ptfe membrane t tmf tmp was accordingly increased by 3 39 c 5 93 c 8 79 c and 13 18 c in comparison to the pristine membrane corresponding to an increase of 44 2 55 9 68 4 and 92 0 temperature polarization coefficient tpc is an index to evaluate the temperature polarization effect which can be used to examine the role of heat transfer limitation tpc of the pristine ptfe membrane was low 0 29 0 38 indicating that temperature polarization effect was serious especially at high feed temperatures and the md process was controlled by heat transfer in comparison go ptfe demonstrated a much higher tpc with a constant value of around 0 55 suggesting that temperature polarization was largely relieved and mass transfer tends to become the limitation in the go ptfe membrane in addition go ptfe membrane also demonstrated an obviously higher heat efficiency η which were 46 9 61 9 as compared to that of pristine ptfe membrane 33 4 40 4 the results indicate that more heat was being utilized to evaporate the water in the go ptfe composite membrane similar results have been reported by seo and coworkers in which the temperature difference across ptfe membrane was apparently increased with the coating of graphene based materials seo et al 2018 abdel karim et al studied the dcmd performance go pvdf composite membrane where they noted that the flux increased with a higher graphene oxide concentration in the go layer the authors attributed this flux increase to the greater value of t across the membrane abdel karim et al 2019 fig 7c and d shows the change of the surface vapor pressure pmf pmp and mass transfer coefficient k of the pristine ptfe membrane and go ptfe membrane respectively it is clearly showed that the mass transfer coefficient k was almost same for the two cases indicating that the effect of temperature on k was negligible both pmf and pmp of go ptfe membrane showed a similar trend as compared to the tmf and tmp indicating that the partial water pressure of the end of ptfe interface was associated closely with the respective surface temperature in order to further understand the effect of go layer on flux enhancement the driving force vapor pressure difference p across the pristine ptfe and go ptfe composite membrane were presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the driving force p was 1 88 3 38 5 23 and 7 41 kpa for pristine ptfe membrane at the feeding temperature of 40 70 c however they were increased to 2 19 4 26 7 24 and 10 89 kpa for go ptfe considering the unchanged mass transfer coefficient this leads to a flux increase of 17 8 26 3 39 5 and 45 5 as shown in fig 6a for comparison fig 8 also listed the vapor pressure gradient of go ptfe composite membrane when kelvin effect of the go capillary pores was not considered which were 2 72 5 32 9 15 and 14 68 kpa respectively the values were apparently higher than the actual p of go ptfe composite membrane indicating that the go capillary structure must have had a negative effect on membrane flux the similar results were achieved by goh and coworkers in which a vapor pressure depression of 21 31 was reported for a hydrophilic layer with a diameter of 4 8 nm goh et al 2013 to have a quantity analysis the contribution of these two effects on flux increase were calculated the increase of driving force by increase of temperature gradient was contributed to increases of 44 7 57 4 75 0 and 98 1 as compared to the pristine ptfe membrane however the opposing effect of vapor pressure depression due to go capillary structure caused a reduction in the flux by 26 9 31 1 35 5 and 52 6 as compared to the pristine ptfe membrane due to the above combined effect a flux increase of 17 8 26 3 39 5 and 45 5 was detected in the experiment for go at evaporation interface fig 6a 4 4 effect of go layer on flux enhancement at condensation interface the model was also used to evaluate the temperature at membrane surfaces heat efficiency η and temperature polarization coefficient tpc for the go ptfe membrane when go layer is placed at the condensation interface as shown in fig 9 tmf tmp t tmf tmp and tpc were decreased slightly than that of the pristine ptfe membrane it was speculated that the decrease of these parameters is related to the high thermal conductivity of go layer in which more heat was transferred to permeate side rather than to be utilized for evaporation however it is interesting that the heat efficiency of go ptfe membrane were almost unchanged than that of the pristine ptfe membrane indicating that more water was evaporated in this process fig 9c and d shows the variations of pmf pmp and k for the pristine ptfe membrane and the go ptfe membrane respectively the change of pmf and k was negligible however pmp displayed a notably decrease than that of pristine membrane even though tmp was almost same as compared to pristine membrane fig 8b we have already discussed the kelvin effect of go capillary pores of when go is placed at the evaporation interface which is negative due to that the water vapor flows in the opposite direction of the meniscus however when go is placed at the condensation interface the vapor liquid interface within go layer would still form a meniscus but it will be in the same direction of the water vapor flow therefore the vapor pressure depression would lead to a positive effect i e increasing the vapor pressure of the liquid vapor interface fig 10 shows the driving force vapor pressure difference p across the pristine ptfe and go ptfe composite membrane as shown in fig 10 the driving force p for go ptfe when go placing at condensation interface were 2 27 3 89 5 65 and 7 84 kpa the increase of the driving force values p was leading to an increase of flux of 16 4 13 1 12 4 and 15 0 than that of pristine ptfe fig 6a however when kelvin effect of the go capillary pores was not considered the values were 1 65 3 09 4 89 and 6 97 kpa at the feed temperature of 40 c to 70 c which was slightly lower than that of pristine membrane indicating that the major impact on flux enhancement was attributing to the reduction of vapor pressure of go capillary pores at condensation interface the above results are in consistent with the previous studies in which the membrane flux of dcmd system was enhanced by 15 18 9 when go coating was deposited on the permeate side of the ptfe membrane intrchom et al 2018 xu et al 2020 4 5 different role at evaporation and condensation interfaces all the above discussion supports the fact that the flux increase phenomenon of go layer incorporation was governed by the combined effects of heat transfer resistance reduction by go layer and vapor pressure depression of go capillary pores the prime role of go layer was the decrease of heat transfer resistance in md process when it was placed at evaporation interface this effect leads to significantly increased tmf but a drop in tmp which in turn promotes higher rates of water evaporation at the air liquid interface this effect becomes increasingly important at higher temperatures i e the higher the feeding temperature the more noticeable is the increase of the measured flux in comparison when go was placed at the condensation interface its high thermal conductivity would reduce the heat amount used for evaporation making the temperature gradient across the membrane decreased another thing is the vapor pressure depression of the go capillary pores the direction of liquid vapor meniscus at evaporation side would decrease the water vapor pressure leading to a notable drop of membrane flux especially at higher temperatures nevertheless this effect become positive as the meniscus direction was reversed when go was placed at condensation interface although the increase of temperature gradient was slightly reduced in this scenario the flux enhancement was still noticeable due to this positive contribution however the increase of flux was apparently less than that at evaporation interface which probably due to the weak kelvin effect of go capillary pores at low temperature of the cooling stream 20 c the model development of this study provides a theoretical foundation of understanding the mass and heat transfer of water molecular for go composite membrane it seems that the water superpermeability of go layer and the fast water evaporation rate at the liquid vapor interface would make the diffusion through hydrophobic microfiltration membrane as the rate limiting step therefore the key is to increase the vapor pressure of the vapor liquid meniscus of go layer to achieve such goal regulation of heat conductivity and nano scale structure of go layer might be the future directions 5 conclusions a mathematical model to describe the influence of the go coating on increase of flux for membrane distillation process was developed and validated against the experimental results this model considers both the effect of go on changing temperature gradient and vapor pressure depression caused by the presence of the capillary pores in the go layer according to the model when go is placed at the evaporation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface increases and the temperature polarization is greatly reduced this leads to an increase of driving force for higher thermal heat flow and subsequently mass flux however the vapor pressure depression due to kelvin effect has a negative influence on the driving force accounting for about 26 9 to 52 6 drop in the achieved flux in comparison when go is placed at the condensation interface the temperature difference across the membrane surface decreases slightly 7 2 12 2 the contribution of flux increments as kelvin effect becomes the dominant factor for the flux enhancement in addition the flux increase is more notable when go placing at the evaporation interface rather than the condensation interface this indicates that the former operation mode is more effective to increase membrane flux the model developed in this study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of go coating on flux increase it should help to pave the way for further development of high flux go composite membranes to be used in membrane distillation processes fig 1 declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgements this work was

16266,the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility that the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes could be alleviated with additional electric field the results showed that the accumulation of acidity seriously suppressed methanogenesis and no methane was detected in the electrode supplemented digester without applied voltage in contrast with applied voltages of 0 6 1 2 v the suppression of acidity was alleviated and methane production rates reached 558 669 l kg volatile suspended solid that were higher than that previously reported with carbon based conductive materials such as granular active carbon and biochar although the reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v close to the reduced potential of co2 ch4 detected via cyclic voltammetry the maximum methane yield derived from cathodic reduction of co2 only accounted for 0 13 0 33 of total methane yield with applied voltages microbial community analysis showed that methanosarcina species were specially enriched with applied voltages accounting for ca 40 70 of the communities together with the increase in the relative abundance of syntrophomonas species methanosarcina species directly accepting electrons from syntrophomonas species via diet might be the primary reason for alleviating the suppression of acidity further investigations via three dimensional excitation emission matrix and in situ electrochemical fourier transform infrared spectroscopy found that additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps primarily comprised of protein like substance which might mediate the eet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina species keywords kitchen wastes anaerobic digestion electro active methanogens direct interspecies electron transfer extracellular polymeric substances additional electric field 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is one of the best environmental friendly alternatives for the disposal of kitchen wastes because of its limited environmental footprints relatively low energy consumption and secondary pollution and high potential for bio energy recovery sharma et al 2020 dahiya et al 2018 however a large proportion of the current anaerobic digestion projects treating kitchen wastes are still under the technical bottlenecks involved in the low conversion efficiency of organic substrates and poor stability of systems xu et al 2018 a prominent factor limiting the efficiency and stability of these anaerobic digestion projects is that kitchen wastes with plenty of the biodegradable organic substrates can easily cause the accumulation of acidity ren et al 2018 as the increase in the content of organic solids the further accumulation of acidity will break the metabolic balance between electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens which leads to a final failure of anaerobic digestion xu et al 2018 conversion of h and electrons that are released from the decomposition of organic substrates to h2 2h 2e h2 by h2 producing syntrophs is well known as the primary pathway for maintaining the metabolic balance of acidity in anaerobic digestion okoro shekwaga et al 2019 however the production of h2 is not feasible in thermodynamics 2h 2e h2 δgo 79 1 kj mol ph 7 stams and plugge 2009 it only functions well as long as h2 utilizing methanogens consume h2 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o to keep the h2 partial pressure of systems low enough that the production of h2 is thermodynamically feasible if the consumption of h2 fails to keep up with production the systems will break down as the accumulation of organic substrates and acidity that are toxic to methanogens okoro shekwaga et al 2019 even worse trafficking in h2 between h2 producing syntrophs and h2 utilizing methanogens depends on diffusion and no strategy to speed up h2 diffusion is readily apparent zhao et al 2020a the discovery of methanothrix and methanosarcina species capable of accepting electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 8h 8e co2 ch4 2h2o provides a novel pathway for maintaining the metabolic balance of acidity in anaerobic digestion lovley 2017 it no longer depends on diffusion but extracellular electron transfer eet which hereby overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of h2 production more inspiringly carbon based conductive materials such as granular active carbon gac liu et al 2013 biochar chen et al 2014b and carbon cloth chen et al 2014a can promote diet the most likely explanation is that carbon based conductive materials serve as the electrical conduits and cells directly attach to the surface of these materials for the long range electron transport dang et al 2017 however in some instances zhao et al 2017 dang et al 2016 the application of diet to enhance anaerobic digestion of organic wastes in response to the high content of organic solids is still limited even if in the presence of carbon based conductive materials one hand there is lack of the electro active methanogens such as methanothrix and methanosarcina species capable of directly accepting electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane on the other hand it seems likely that the electrical connections from cell to cell require a long period to be established it was observed in co cultures of geobacter with methanothrix or methanosarcina species that a long lag period approximately 40 60 days was required before diet was established lovley 2017 in addition the poor capacity of eet in methanothrix and methanosarcina species may also limit the role of diet since none of these species are known to display membrane bound multi heme c type cytochromes on their outer surface yee and rotaru 2020 electrical connections from electrode to cell can support the growth of electro active methanogens li et al 2019a it was first documented in a two chamber microbial electrolysis cell for the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane cheng et al 2009 the increase in the current generation provided the electrochemical evidence of direct electron transfer from electrode to the biofilms primarily comprised of methanobacterium species cheng et al 2009 however the evidence for direct electron transfer from electrode to methanobacterium species is insufficient until that the recent observation that methanobacterium species also capable of accepting electrons via diet in defined co cultures with geobacter species zheng et al 2020 another study lohner et al 2014 observed methane formation via directly accepting electrons from electrode in a hydrogenase deletion mutant of methanococcus species lacking all catabolic hydrogenases indicating the presence of a hydrogenase independent mechanism of electron transfer from electrode to cell these results further supported the fact that directly accepting electrons from electrode could support the growth of methanococcus species in addition some studies zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2014 observed that additional electric field could stimulate the cathodic biofilms to secrete the extracellular polymeric substances eps eps a high molecular weight secretion from microbes can bind with the cells and protect them in response to the stressed conditions flemming and wingender 2010 recent studies li et al 2019a 2019b yan et al 2018 on eps serving as an electron shuttle to mediate the electrical connections between cell to cell or cell to electrode have been adequately evaluated therefore it seems likely that additional electric field can stimulate the secretion of eps that further compensates for the poor capacity of eet in electro active methanogens the primary objective of the study presented here was to investigate the feasibility that the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes could be alleviated via enriching the electro active methanogens with additional electric field in addition to the performances of anaerobic digestion scanning electron microscope sem and microbial community analysis were utilized to clarify this another objective was to explore the possibility of eps mediating eet between cell to cell or cell to electrode electrochemical characteristics including cyclic voltammetry cv electron accepting donating capacity eac edc and in situ electrochemical fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy as well as three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem were utilized to clarify the potential mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 kitchen wastes and seed sludge kitchen wastes were collected from a canteen in the campus of dalian university of technology china after removing the non biodegradable components such as plastics bones and eggshells

206 253 247 mg l corresponding to tss content of 17 9 1 2 volatile suspended solid vss 190 110 266 mg l corresponding to vss content of 16 5 1 4 ph 3 91 0 10 seed sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant in dalian china the main characteristics of the seed sludge are as follows tss 61 068 431 mg l corresponding to tss content of 5 3 0 7 vss 25 349 152 mg l corresponding to vss content of 2 2 0 6 ph 8 34 0 10 the kitchen wastes and seed sludge were stored under the anaerobic conditions at 2 4 c before use 2 2 experimental setup semi continuous flow experiments of anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes were conducted in four parallel completely mixed anaerobic digesters each of which had a working volume of 900 ml a cylinder anode diameter of 1 cm surrounded by the titanium wire mesh and eight carbon cloth cathodes length of 7 cm width of 4 cm and height of 2 cm were inserted into each of the four anaerobic digesters to form an electrode supplemented digester referred to as es digester the distance between anode and cathode is 0 5 cm the schematic diagram of an es digester and electrode configuration are shown in fig 1 one of the four es digester was not connected to the dc power supply open circuit the applied voltage in the other three es digesters was respectively 0 6 v 0 9 v and 1 2 v before experiments each of the four es digesters received a 900 ml of the seed sludge and operated at a temperature of 37 0 c the initial solid retention time srt in these digesters was 30 d namely each day 30 ml of the treated kitchen wastes was extracted from each of these digesters and then 30 ml of the fresh kitchen wastes was injected into each of these digesters by a 100 ml of syringe after 30 day experiments the srt in these digesters was adjusted to 20 d 2 3 analytical methods tss and vss were determined with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater ph was measured with a ph analyzer

was determined with another gas chromatograph tianmei gc 7900 tcd china the current in the three electrode supplemented digesters with applied voltage was determined with a data acquisition card zhouzheng daqm 4200 china morphology of the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes at the end of experiments was observed by sem hitachi s4800 japan liu et al 2020 cv performed on an electrochemical workstation chenhua chi1030c china was used to evaluate the electrochemical response of the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes at the end of experiments the detailed measurements are shown in supporting information cation exchange resin 20 50 mesh 732 001 7 frolund et al 1995b was used to extract eps from the sludge of the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes at the end of experiments the sludge extraction method on the surface of the cathode biofilm is shown above eac edc of the extracted eps was performed on an electrochemical workstation chenhua co ltd chi650b shanghai china with a conventional three electrode cell the cell consisted of a vitreous carbon with a projected surface area of 2 25 cm2 as working electrode an ag agcl as

sample was added to the buffer solution ph 7 0 1 m phosphate 0 1 m kcl before measure the transferred number of electrons by chronoamperometry ca aeschbacher et al 2010 the potential components of the extracted eps were evaluated by a 3d eem using a fluorescence spectrometry hitachi fl4500 japan the excitation wavelength ex ranged from 200 to 500 nm with 5 nm steps while the emission wavelength em ranged from 200 to 600 nm with 5 nm steps matlab 2014b was used to perform parallel factor parafac analysis further investigations via in situ electrochemical ftir were to evaluate the electrochemical response of the extracted eps the detailed measurements are shown in supporting information 2 4 microbial community analysis microbial community composition in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of

microbial community via marker gene sequencing profiles shannon wiener and simpson diversity index were analyzed by mothur http www mothur org 3 results 3 1 performances of anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes the performances in the four es digesters with the equivalent p 0 05 methane production rates fig 2 a and phs fig 2b diverged at day 3 the accumulation of acidity in the es digester without applied voltage gradually increased accompanied by the dramatic decline in the phs from 7 3 to 5 5 fig 2b the accumulation of acidity seriously suppressed the methanogenesis and no methane production was detected at the end of experiments fig 2a in contrast it was observed that the suppression of acidity was gradually alleviated in the es digester with applied voltage of 0 6 v at day 20 fig 2b at the end of experiments the methane production rate and ph increased to 4608 ml d corresponding to 558 l kg vss fig 2a and 7 5 fig 2b respectively the higher applied voltages 0 9 v and 1 2 v enhanced the better performances since the accumulation of acidity was almost not observed and the methane production rates reached 610 670 l kg vss in these digesters fig 2a and b the es digester without applied voltage broke down as the accumulation of organic substrates fig 2c and vfas fig 3 specifically at the end of experiments the removal efficiency of vss was only 19 fig 2c and the concentration of vfas was more than 12 000 mg l fig 3a in contrast as expected from the methane production data in the es digesters with applied voltages the removal efficiencies of vss were more than 80 fig 3c and the concentrations of vfas were lower than 6000 mg l fig 3b c and d these results sufficiently supported the hypothesis in the section of introduction that additional electric field could alleviate the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes some studies reporting enhancing anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes with carbon based conductive materials or electrodes are summarized and shown in table s1 see supporting information the methane production rates 558 669 l kg vss in this study were comparable to that in some es digesters with applied voltages hassanein et al 2017 choi and lee 2019 and significantly higher than that with the carbon based conductive materials such as gac and biochar linville et al 2017 cai et al 2016 ko et al 2018 zhang and loh 2019 the current in the es digesters with applied voltages was continuously detected during the 50 day experiments fig 2d it was assumed that the electrons based on the current calculation were completely consumed for the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane the maximum methane yield derived from cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane only accounted for 0 13 0 33 of total methane yield table s2 suggesting that the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane was not the primary pathway for alleviating the suppression of acidity in the es digesters with applied voltages 3 2 morphology of cathodic biofilms and their electrochemical characteristics after the 50 day experiments the morphology of the biofilms on the surface of electrodes in the four es digesters was analyzed by sem fig 4 it was clearly observed that the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were larger and denser than that without applied voltage fig 4 c e and g the biofilms in the es digesters with applied voltages were primarily comprised of tightly packed rod ball like cells associated with the eps like excretions fig 4 d f and h the most likely role of these eps like excretions was to bind with the rod ball like cells to aggregate the biofilms as well as to protect them against the accumulation of acidity more et al 2014 in addition some studies yan et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 indicated that eps played a significant role in eet and additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps in the cathodic biofilms further experiments via cv analysis were to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of the biofilms on the surface of cathodic electrodes in the four electrode supplemented digesters fig 5 it was clearly observed that a reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v close to the reduced potential of co2 ch4 0 24 v ph 7 cheng et al 2009 was detected in the es digesters with applied voltages but no reduced peak was detected in the es digester without applied voltage it should be pointed out that the cathodic reduction of h to h2 could be eliminated in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages since its reduced potential of h h2 0 44 v ph 7 was more negative call and logan 2008 and no molecular h2 was detected throughout the whole experiments in addition the above mentioned evaluation of electron flow table s2 see supporting information also indicated that the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane was not the primary pathway for methane production therefore the most likely explanation for the reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v detected in the biofilms with applied voltages was that some electro active methanogens might be enriched to accept electrons via diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 3 3 microbial community composition of cathodic biofilms analysis of the diversity of microbial community are showed in tables s3 and s4 see supporting information there was no significant difference in the shannon and simpson index of bacterial community among all the biofilms on the surface of electrodes in the four es digesters suggesting that additional electric field did not primarily influence the bacterial community composition in contrast the shannon and simpson index of archaeal community in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes in the es digesters with applied voltages generally lower than that without applied voltage which might be attributed to the fact that additional electric field specially enriched the electro active methanogens further experiments via microbial community analysis were to investigate the potential enrichment of electro active methanogens and their diet based syntrophic partners in the cathodic biofilms after the 50 day experiments fig 6 the dominant methanogenic genus in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes without applied voltage was methanospirillum known as the typical h2 utilizing methanogens dong et al 1994 accounting for more than 30 of the archaeal communities fig 6a although recent studies gunsalus et al 2016 poweleit et al 2017 reported that methanospirillum hungatei jf 1 the closest relative of methanospirillum species were capable of producing the electrically conductive archaellum and expressing the functional genes involved in proceeding eet study zhao et al 2020b in defined co cultures with geobacter species did not support that methanospirillum species were capable of directly accepting electrons via diet in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages the relative abundance of methanospirillum species declined fig 6a their decline was accompanied by the increase in the relative abundance of methanosarcina species that accounted for ca 40 70 of the communities fig 6a up to date all methanosarcina species that have been evaluated can directly accept electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane via diet rotaru et al 2014 another electro active methanogens capable of diet detected in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages was methanothrix fig 5a however the relative abundance of methanothrix species in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages was lower than that without applied voltages therefore the most likely role of methanothrix species detected was to convert acetate to methane associated with the relatively higher concentration of acetate detected in the digesters fig 2 syntrophomonas known as the h2 producing syntrophs mcinerney et al 1981 was dominant in the cathodic biofilms of all the four electrode supplemented digesters accounting for ca 20 30 of the bacterial communities fig 5b although no direct evidence indicated that syntrophomonas was capable of proceeding diet recent studies li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 observed that the abundance of syntrophomonas species evidently increased in the anaerobic digesters with carbon based conductive materials suggesting that they utilized the carbon based conductive materials as the electron conduits sporanaerobacter a moderately thermophilic genus capable of directly oxidizing glucose with the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor dang et al 2016 was only detected in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltage of 0 6 v fig 5b although no direct evidence indicated that sporanaerobacter was capable of proceeding diet the capacity of eet to the elemental sulfur was very linked to the capacity of eet to fe iii oxides or electrodes li et al 2020 in addition in an anaerobic digester treating kitchen wastes with carbon cloth demonstrated that carbon cloth could enhance the growth of sporanaerobacter species associated with methanosarcina species dang et al 2016 3 4 composition of eps in cathodic biofilms and its electrochemical characteristics further experiments via 3d eem analysis was to investigate the composition of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the electrodes linked to the promoted mechanisms fig 7 a b c and d the characteristic peaks of three different components were obtained by eem parafac c1 ex em 275 nm 360 nm c2 ex em 310 nm 380 nm and c3 ex em 350 nm 430 460 nm which represented the protein like substance c1 microbial humic like substance c2 and terrigenous humic like substance c3 fluorophores respectively fig 7a b and c chen et al 2003 peng et al 2015 it should be pointed out that the fluorescence intensities related to the microbial by products and protein like substance in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were evidently higher than that without applied voltages the total fluorescence intensity of control 0 6 v 0 9 v and 1 2 v were 2539 a u 3432 a u 3630 a u and 3952 a u respectively fig 7d consistent with the phenomenon via sem analysis that the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were larger and denser than that without applied voltage fig 4 in addition the protein like substances also contained the varieties of cytochromes that could mediated the electron transfer between electrode to cell or cell to cell gao and lu 2021 additional electric field also stimulated the secretion of the tyrosine like substances i ex em 200 250 200 330 nm and fulvic acid like substances iii ex em 200 250 380 500 nm but almost no peak of fluorescence related to these substances was detected in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes without applied voltage fig 8 a b c and d fulvic acid like substances belong to the redox active organic compounds that are largely contained in the paddy soils and sediments chipman et al 2010 and can serve as the electron shuttles that accept the electrons from one cell and donate them to another cell in the microbial remediation these results indicated that additional electric field significantly stimulated the secretion of eps which might mediate the eet between the electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens to further investigate the possibility that eps might mediate the eet the electrochemical characteristics of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms were analyzed via cv fig s1 see supporting information and eac edc table s5 see supporting information although no redox peak based on cv scan was detected in the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms fig s1 the capacitance of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages 1 7 2 0 10 5 f was approximately 1 7 2 0 folds higher than that without applied voltage 1 06 10 5 f indicating that the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages presented a higher capacity of charge discharge than that without applied voltage this hypothesis was further supported by eac edc scan table s5 both eac and edc of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were higher than that without applied voltage to further evaluate the electrochemical response of the eps the electrochemical activity variations of the surface group bands in eps were identified by in situ electrochemical ftir spectroscopy fig 9 with the detecting potential shifting from 0 9 v to 0 4 v v s ag agcl the intensity changes of the bands indicated the redox reaction characters that occurred at the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes yu et al 2015 as shown in fig 9 for the extracted eps the intensities of the bands around 1550 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn in amide ii and 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of the c o group in amide i showed significant increases with the detecting potential shifting while the that of the control group showed negative responses to the applied detecting potential the increased intensities of bands were attributed to the polarization of the relative functional groups therefore the cn and c o in amide groups in eps were more likely to be polarized with potential applied the electric susceptibility was reported to be proportional to the relative dielectric constant that reflects the capacitance of materials dubois et al 2015 therefore for applied voltages the more significant responses in polarity of the amide groups to detecting potential indicated that the capacity of the cn and c o in amide groups were more likely to be polarized which may further improve the capacitance of amide groups in the eps consistent with cv results yu and zhang 2019 amide groups were regarded as the basic co factors that could mediate the long range electron transfer processes in protein like substances forster et al 2004 akhoury et al 2013 according to the results of protein like substances fig 7 increase of protein like substances also further improves capacitance of eps and the enhancement of capacitance of amide groups is beneficial to the electron transfer process assisted by substances in eps 4 discussion the electrodes comprised of conductive carbon cloth in the es digester without applied voltage did not promote anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes as expected fig 2 a prominent reason was that there was lack of the electro active methanogens such as methanosarcina species fig 6a which limited the role of diet for the maintaining the metabolic balance of acidity in anaerobic digestion via directly accepting electrons from the potential diet based syntrophs such as syntrophomonas species fig 6b the dominant methanogens in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes without applied voltage was the h2 utilizing methanogens methanospirillum species fig 6a suggesting that trafficking in h2 between h2 producing syntrophs and h2 utilizing methanogens was still the primary pathway for the metabolic balance of acidity in the es digester without applied voltage in some instances villano et al 2010 cheng et al 2009 the reason for enhancing anaerobic digestion with additional electric field was primarily attributed to the phenomenon that h2 utilizing methanogens were enriched in the cathodic biofilms however the only reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v detected fig 5 and the abundance of h2 utilizing methanogens evidently declined fig 6a did not support the possibility of trafficking in h2 between electrodes to h2 utilizing methanogens in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages multiple line of evidence related to the performances figs 2 and fig 3 demonstrated that additional electric field rather than electrodes could alleviate the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes especially in response to the decrease of srt from 30 d to 20 d although additional electric field evidently enriched the electro active methanogens such as methanosarcina species fig 6a the evaluation of electron flow based on the current generation table s2 almost eliminated the contribution of directly accepting electrons from electrodes for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane however the special enrichment of methanosarcina species also provided the possibility that they were capable of directly accepting electrons via diet since the abundance of their potential diet based syntrophs syntrophomonas species evidently increased in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages fig 6b up to date all methanosarcina species have been evaluated to directly accept electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane via diet in defined co cultures with geobacter species zhou et al 2021 however the eet mechanisms in methanosarcina species is still enigmatic since none of these species except m acetivorans are known to display membrane bound multi heme cytochromes yee and rotaru 2020 however the study presented here observed that additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps figs 4 and 7 with a relatively higher capacity of charge discharge table s5 in the cathodic biofilms providing a possibility that eps mediated the eet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina species the eps were electrically active in situ electrochemical ftir fig 9 with the detecting potential shifting from 0 9 v to 0 4 v the intensity changes of the bands indicated the redox reaction characters that occurred at the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes in addition 3d eem and eem parafac analysis showed that additional electric field evidently increased the content of protein like substance figs 7 and 8 these results and the fact that protein like substance was capable of mediating the eet further supported the possibility that additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps to mediated the eet between electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens 5 conclusions the study present here demonstrated that additional electric field could alleviate the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes especially in response to the decrease of srt from 30 d to 20 d additional electric field supported the growth of the electro active methanogens methanosarcina species in the cathodic biofilms and they might directly accept electrons from their potential diet based syntrophs syntrophomonas species via diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in addition the study also found that additional electric field promoting the secretion of eps in the cathodic biofilms the eps were electrically active and primarily comprised of the protein like substance which provided a possibility that eps mediated the eet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina species credit authorship contribution statement

16266,the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility that the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes could be alleviated with additional electric field the results showed that the accumulation of acidity seriously suppressed methanogenesis and no methane was detected in the electrode supplemented digester without applied voltage in contrast with applied voltages of 0 6 1 2 v the suppression of acidity was alleviated and methane production rates reached 558 669 l kg volatile suspended solid that were higher than that previously reported with carbon based conductive materials such as granular active carbon and biochar although the reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v close to the reduced potential of co2 ch4 detected via cyclic voltammetry the maximum methane yield derived from cathodic reduction of co2 only accounted for 0 13 0 33 of total methane yield with applied voltages microbial community analysis showed that methanosarcina species were specially enriched with applied voltages accounting for ca 40 70 of the communities together with the increase in the relative abundance of syntrophomonas species methanosarcina species directly accepting electrons from syntrophomonas species via diet might be the primary reason for alleviating the suppression of acidity further investigations via three dimensional excitation emission matrix and in situ electrochemical fourier transform infrared spectroscopy found that additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps primarily comprised of protein like substance which might mediate the eet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina species keywords kitchen wastes anaerobic digestion electro active methanogens direct interspecies electron transfer extracellular polymeric substances additional electric field 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is one of the best environmental friendly alternatives for the disposal of kitchen wastes because of its limited environmental footprints relatively low energy consumption and secondary pollution and high potential for bio energy recovery sharma et al 2020 dahiya et al 2018 however a large proportion of the current anaerobic digestion projects treating kitchen wastes are still under the technical bottlenecks involved in the low conversion efficiency of organic substrates and poor stability of systems xu et al 2018 a prominent factor limiting the efficiency and stability of these anaerobic digestion projects is that kitchen wastes with plenty of the biodegradable organic substrates can easily cause the accumulation of acidity ren et al 2018 as the increase in the content of organic solids the further accumulation of acidity will break the metabolic balance between electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens which leads to a final failure of anaerobic digestion xu et al 2018 conversion of h and electrons that are released from the decomposition of organic substrates to h2 2h 2e h2 by h2 producing syntrophs is well known as the primary pathway for maintaining the metabolic balance of acidity in anaerobic digestion okoro shekwaga et al 2019 however the production of h2 is not feasible in thermodynamics 2h 2e h2 δgo 79 1 kj mol ph 7 stams and plugge 2009 it only functions well as long as h2 utilizing methanogens consume h2 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o to keep the h2 partial pressure of systems low enough that the production of h2 is thermodynamically feasible if the consumption of h2 fails to keep up with production the systems will break down as the accumulation of organic substrates and acidity that are toxic to methanogens okoro shekwaga et al 2019 even worse trafficking in h2 between h2 producing syntrophs and h2 utilizing methanogens depends on diffusion and no strategy to speed up h2 diffusion is readily apparent zhao et al 2020a the discovery of methanothrix and methanosarcina species capable of accepting electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 8h 8e co2 ch4 2h2o provides a novel pathway for maintaining the metabolic balance of acidity in anaerobic digestion lovley 2017 it no longer depends on diffusion but extracellular electron transfer eet which hereby overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of h2 production more inspiringly carbon based conductive materials such as granular active carbon gac liu et al 2013 biochar chen et al 2014b and carbon cloth chen et al 2014a can promote diet the most likely explanation is that carbon based conductive materials serve as the electrical conduits and cells directly attach to the surface of these materials for the long range electron transport dang et al 2017 however in some instances zhao et al 2017 dang et al 2016 the application of diet to enhance anaerobic digestion of organic wastes in response to the high content of organic solids is still limited even if in the presence of carbon based conductive materials one hand there is lack of the electro active methanogens such as methanothrix and methanosarcina species capable of directly accepting electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane on the other hand it seems likely that the electrical connections from cell to cell require a long period to be established it was observed in co cultures of geobacter with methanothrix or methanosarcina species that a long lag period approximately 40 60 days was required before diet was established lovley 2017 in addition the poor capacity of eet in methanothrix and methanosarcina species may also limit the role of diet since none of these species are known to display membrane bound multi heme c type cytochromes on their outer surface yee and rotaru 2020 electrical connections from electrode to cell can support the growth of electro active methanogens li et al 2019a it was first documented in a two chamber microbial electrolysis cell for the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane cheng et al 2009 the increase in the current generation provided the electrochemical evidence of direct electron transfer from electrode to the biofilms primarily comprised of methanobacterium species cheng et al 2009 however the evidence for direct electron transfer from electrode to methanobacterium species is insufficient until that the recent observation that methanobacterium species also capable of accepting electrons via diet in defined co cultures with geobacter species zheng et al 2020 another study lohner et al 2014 observed methane formation via directly accepting electrons from electrode in a hydrogenase deletion mutant of methanococcus species lacking all catabolic hydrogenases indicating the presence of a hydrogenase independent mechanism of electron transfer from electrode to cell these results further supported the fact that directly accepting electrons from electrode could support the growth of methanococcus species in addition some studies zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2014 observed that additional electric field could stimulate the cathodic biofilms to secrete the extracellular polymeric substances eps eps a high molecular weight secretion from microbes can bind with the cells and protect them in response to the stressed conditions flemming and wingender 2010 recent studies li et al 2019a 2019b yan et al 2018 on eps serving as an electron shuttle to mediate the electrical connections between cell to cell or cell to electrode have been adequately evaluated therefore it seems likely that additional electric field can stimulate the secretion of eps that further compensates for the poor capacity of eet in electro active methanogens the primary objective of the study presented here was to investigate the feasibility that the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes could be alleviated via enriching the electro active methanogens with additional electric field in addition to the performances of anaerobic digestion scanning electron microscope sem and microbial community analysis were utilized to clarify this another objective was to explore the possibility of eps mediating eet between cell to cell or cell to electrode electrochemical characteristics including cyclic voltammetry cv electron accepting donating capacity eac edc and in situ electrochemical fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy as well as three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem were utilized to clarify the potential mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 kitchen wastes and seed sludge kitchen wastes were collected from a canteen in the campus of dalian university of technology china after removing the non biodegradable components such as plastics bones and eggshells

206 253 247 mg l corresponding to tss content of 17 9 1 2 volatile suspended solid vss 190 110 266 mg l corresponding to vss content of 16 5 1 4 ph 3 91 0 10 seed sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant in dalian china the main characteristics of the seed sludge are as follows tss 61 068 431 mg l corresponding to tss content of 5 3 0 7 vss 25 349 152 mg l corresponding to vss content of 2 2 0 6 ph 8 34 0 10 the kitchen wastes and seed sludge were stored under the anaerobic conditions at 2 4 c before use 2 2 experimental setup semi continuous flow experiments of anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes were conducted in four parallel completely mixed anaerobic digesters each of which had a working volume of 900 ml a cylinder anode diameter of 1 cm surrounded by the titanium wire mesh and eight carbon cloth cathodes length of 7 cm width of 4 cm and height of 2 cm were inserted into each of the four anaerobic digesters to form an electrode supplemented digester referred to as es digester the distance between anode and cathode is 0 5 cm the schematic diagram of an es digester and electrode configuration are shown in fig 1 one of the four es digester was not connected to the dc power supply open circuit the applied voltage in the other three es digesters was respectively 0 6 v 0 9 v and 1 2 v before experiments each of the four es digesters received a 900 ml of the seed sludge and operated at a temperature of 37 0 c the initial solid retention time srt in these digesters was 30 d namely each day 30 ml of the treated kitchen wastes was extracted from each of these digesters and then 30 ml of the fresh kitchen wastes was injected into each of these digesters by a 100 ml of syringe after 30 day experiments the srt in these digesters was adjusted to 20 d 2 3 analytical methods tss and vss were determined with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater ph was measured with a ph analyzer

was determined with another gas chromatograph tianmei gc 7900 tcd china the current in the three electrode supplemented digesters with applied voltage was determined with a data acquisition card zhouzheng daqm 4200 china morphology of the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes at the end of experiments was observed by sem hitachi s4800 japan liu et al 2020 cv performed on an electrochemical workstation chenhua chi1030c china was used to evaluate the electrochemical response of the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes at the end of experiments the detailed measurements are shown in supporting information cation exchange resin 20 50 mesh 732 001 7 frolund et al 1995b was used to extract eps from the sludge of the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes at the end of experiments the sludge extraction method on the surface of the cathode biofilm is shown above eac edc of the extracted eps was performed on an electrochemical workstation chenhua co ltd chi650b shanghai china with a conventional three electrode cell the cell consisted of a vitreous carbon with a projected surface area of 2 25 cm2 as working electrode an ag agcl as reference electrode and a platinum wire electrode as counter electrode the electrode was equilibrated to the desired potentials eh 0 49 v in mediated electrochemical reduction mer and eh 0 61 v in oxidation meo respectively the mediators were 520 µl diquat dibromide monohydrate dq for mer and 520 µl 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt abts for meo then 1 ml eps sample was added to the buffer solution ph 7 0 1 m phosphate 0 1 m kcl before measure the transferred number of electrons by chronoamperometry ca aeschbacher et al 2010 the potential components of the extracted eps were evaluated by a 3d eem using a fluorescence spectrometry hitachi fl4500 japan the excitation wavelength ex ranged from 200 to 500 nm with 5 nm steps while the emission wavelength em ranged from 200 to 600 nm with 5 nm steps matlab 2014b was used to perform parallel factor parafac analysis further investigations via in situ electrochemical ftir were to evaluate the electrochemical response of the extracted eps the detailed measurements are shown in supporting information 2 4 microbial community analysis microbial community composition in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of

pyrosequencing pipeline software https pyro cme msu edu phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the functional potential of the microbial community via marker gene sequencing profiles shannon wiener and simpson diversity index were analyzed by mothur http www mothur org 3 results 3 1 performances of anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes the performances in the four es digesters with the equivalent p 0 05 methane production rates fig 2 a and phs fig 2b diverged at day 3 the accumulation of acidity in the es digester without applied voltage gradually increased accompanied by the dramatic decline in the phs from 7 3 to 5 5 fig 2b the accumulation of acidity seriously suppressed the methanogenesis and no methane production was detected at the end of experiments fig 2a in contrast it was observed that the suppression of acidity was gradually alleviated in the es digester with applied voltage of 0 6 v at day 20 fig 2b at the end of experiments the methane production rate and ph increased to 4608 ml d corresponding to 558 l kg vss fig 2a and 7 5 fig 2b respectively the higher applied voltages 0 9 v and 1 2 v enhanced the better performances since the accumulation of acidity was almost not observed and the methane production rates reached 610 670 l kg vss in these digesters fig 2a and b the es digester without applied voltage broke down as the accumulation of organic substrates fig 2c and vfas fig 3 specifically at the end of experiments the removal efficiency of vss was only 19 fig 2c and the concentration of vfas was more than 12 000 mg l fig 3a in contrast as expected from the methane production data in the es digesters with applied voltages the removal efficiencies of vss were more than 80 fig 3c and the concentrations of vfas were lower than 6000 mg l fig 3b c and d these results sufficiently supported the hypothesis in the section of introduction that additional electric field could alleviate the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes some studies reporting enhancing anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes with carbon based conductive materials or electrodes are summarized and shown in table s1 see supporting information the methane production rates 558 669 l kg vss in this study were comparable to that in some es digesters with applied voltages hassanein et al 2017 choi and lee 2019 and significantly higher than that with the carbon based conductive materials such as gac and biochar linville et al 2017 cai et al 2016 ko et al 2018 zhang and loh 2019 the current in the es digesters with applied voltages was continuously detected during the 50 day experiments fig 2d it was assumed that the electrons based on the current calculation were completely consumed for the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane the maximum methane yield derived from cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane only accounted for 0 13 0 33 of total methane yield table s2 suggesting that the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane was not the primary pathway for alleviating the suppression of acidity in the es digesters with applied voltages 3 2 morphology of cathodic biofilms and their electrochemical characteristics after the 50 day experiments the morphology of the biofilms on the surface of electrodes in the four es digesters was analyzed by sem fig 4 it was clearly observed that the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were larger and denser than that without applied voltage fig 4 c e and g the biofilms in the es digesters with applied voltages were primarily comprised of tightly packed rod ball like cells associated with the eps like excretions fig 4 d f and h the most likely role of these eps like excretions was to bind with the rod ball like cells to aggregate the biofilms as well as to protect them against the accumulation of acidity more et al 2014 in addition some studies yan et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 indicated that eps played a significant role in eet and additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps in the cathodic biofilms further experiments via cv analysis were to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of the biofilms on the surface of cathodic electrodes in the four electrode supplemented digesters fig 5 it was clearly observed that a reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v close to the reduced potential of co2 ch4 0 24 v ph 7 cheng et al 2009 was detected in the es digesters with applied voltages but no reduced peak was detected in the es digester without applied voltage it should be pointed out that the cathodic reduction of h to h2 could be eliminated in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages since its reduced potential of h h2 0 44 v ph 7 was more negative call and logan 2008 and no molecular h2 was detected throughout the whole experiments in addition the above mentioned evaluation of electron flow table s2 see supporting information also indicated that the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to methane was not the primary pathway for methane production therefore the most likely explanation for the reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v detected in the biofilms with applied voltages was that some electro active methanogens might be enriched to accept electrons via diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 3 3 microbial community composition of cathodic biofilms analysis of the diversity of microbial community are showed in tables s3 and s4 see supporting information there was no significant difference in the shannon and simpson index of bacterial community among all the biofilms on the surface of electrodes in the four es digesters suggesting that additional electric field did not primarily influence the bacterial community composition in contrast the shannon and simpson index of archaeal community in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes in the es digesters with applied voltages generally lower than that without applied voltage which might be attributed to the fact that additional electric field specially enriched the electro active methanogens further experiments via microbial community analysis were to investigate the potential enrichment of electro active methanogens and their diet based syntrophic partners in the cathodic biofilms after the 50 day experiments fig 6 the dominant methanogenic genus in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes without applied voltage was methanospirillum known as the typical h2 utilizing methanogens dong et al 1994 accounting for more than 30 of the archaeal communities fig 6a although recent studies gunsalus et al 2016 poweleit et al 2017 reported that methanospirillum hungatei jf 1 the closest relative of methanospirillum species were capable of producing the electrically conductive archaellum and expressing the functional genes involved in proceeding eet study zhao et al 2020b in defined co cultures with geobacter species did not support that methanospirillum species were capable of directly accepting electrons via diet in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages the relative abundance of methanospirillum species declined fig 6a their decline was accompanied by the increase in the relative abundance of methanosarcina species that accounted for ca 40 70 of the communities fig 6a up to date all methanosarcina species that have been evaluated can directly accept electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane via diet rotaru et al 2014 another electro active methanogens capable of diet detected in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages was methanothrix fig 5a however the relative abundance of methanothrix species in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages was lower than that without applied voltages therefore the most likely role of methanothrix species detected was to convert acetate to methane associated with the relatively higher concentration of acetate detected in the digesters fig 2 syntrophomonas known as the h2 producing syntrophs mcinerney et al 1981 was dominant in the cathodic biofilms of all the four electrode supplemented digesters accounting for ca 20 30 of the bacterial communities fig 5b although no direct evidence indicated that syntrophomonas was capable of proceeding diet recent studies li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 observed that the abundance of syntrophomonas species evidently increased in the anaerobic digesters with carbon based conductive materials suggesting that they utilized the carbon based conductive materials as the electron conduits sporanaerobacter a moderately thermophilic genus capable of directly oxidizing glucose with the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor dang et al 2016 was only detected in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltage of 0 6 v fig 5b although no direct evidence indicated that sporanaerobacter was capable of proceeding diet the capacity of eet to the elemental sulfur was very linked to the capacity of eet to fe iii oxides or electrodes li et al 2020 in addition in an anaerobic digester treating kitchen wastes with carbon cloth demonstrated that carbon cloth could enhance the growth of sporanaerobacter species associated with methanosarcina species dang et al 2016 3 4 composition of eps in cathodic biofilms and its electrochemical characteristics further experiments via 3d eem analysis was to investigate the composition of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the electrodes linked to the promoted mechanisms fig 7 a b c and d the characteristic peaks of three different components were obtained by eem parafac c1 ex em 275 nm 360 nm c2 ex em 310 nm 380 nm and c3 ex em 350 nm 430 460 nm which represented the protein like substance c1 microbial humic like substance c2 and terrigenous humic like substance c3 fluorophores respectively fig 7a b and c chen et al 2003 peng et al 2015 it should be pointed out that the fluorescence intensities related to the microbial by products and protein like substance in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were evidently higher than that without applied voltages the total fluorescence intensity of control 0 6 v 0 9 v and 1 2 v were 2539 a u 3432 a u 3630 a u and 3952 a u respectively fig 7d consistent with the phenomenon via sem analysis that the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were larger and denser than that without applied voltage fig 4 in addition the protein like substances also contained the varieties of cytochromes that could mediated the electron transfer between electrode to cell or cell to cell gao and lu 2021 additional electric field also stimulated the secretion of the tyrosine like substances i ex em 200 250 200 330 nm and fulvic acid like substances iii ex em 200 250 380 500 nm but almost no peak of fluorescence related to these substances was detected in the cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes without applied voltage fig 8 a b c and d fulvic acid like substances belong to the redox active organic compounds that are largely contained in the paddy soils and sediments chipman et al 2010 and can serve as the electron shuttles that accept the electrons from one cell and donate them to another cell in the microbial remediation these results indicated that additional electric field significantly stimulated the secretion of eps which might mediate the eet between the electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens to further investigate the possibility that eps might mediate the eet the electrochemical characteristics of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms were analyzed via cv fig s1 see supporting information and eac edc table s5 see supporting information although no redox peak based on cv scan was detected in the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms fig s1 the capacitance of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages 1 7 2 0 10 5 f was approximately 1 7 2 0 folds higher than that without applied voltage 1 06 10 5 f indicating that the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages presented a higher capacity of charge discharge than that without applied voltage this hypothesis was further supported by eac edc scan table s5 both eac and edc of the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages were higher than that without applied voltage to further evaluate the electrochemical response of the eps the electrochemical activity variations of the surface group bands in eps were identified by in situ electrochemical ftir spectroscopy fig 9 with the detecting potential shifting from 0 9 v to 0 4 v v s ag agcl the intensity changes of the bands indicated the redox reaction characters that occurred at the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes yu et al 2015 as shown in fig 9 for the extracted eps the intensities of the bands around 1550 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn in amide ii and 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of the c o group in amide i showed significant increases with the detecting potential shifting while the that of the control group showed negative responses to the applied detecting potential the increased intensities of bands were attributed to the polarization of the relative functional groups therefore the cn and c o in amide groups in eps were more likely to be polarized with potential applied the electric susceptibility was reported to be proportional to the relative dielectric constant that reflects the capacitance of materials dubois et al 2015 therefore for applied voltages the more significant responses in polarity of the amide groups to detecting potential indicated that the capacity of the cn and c o in amide groups were more likely to be polarized which may further improve the capacitance of amide groups in the eps consistent with cv results yu and zhang 2019 amide groups were regarded as the basic co factors that could mediate the long range electron transfer processes in protein like substances forster et al 2004 akhoury et al 2013 according to the results of protein like substances fig 7 increase of protein like substances also further improves capacitance of eps and the enhancement of capacitance of amide groups is beneficial to the electron transfer process assisted by substances in eps 4 discussion the electrodes comprised of conductive carbon cloth in the es digester without applied voltage did not promote anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes as expected fig 2 a prominent reason was that there was lack of the electro active methanogens such as methanosarcina species fig 6a which limited the role of diet for the maintaining the metabolic balance of acidity in anaerobic digestion via directly accepting electrons from the potential diet based syntrophs such as syntrophomonas species fig 6b the dominant methanogens in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes without applied voltage was the h2 utilizing methanogens methanospirillum species fig 6a suggesting that trafficking in h2 between h2 producing syntrophs and h2 utilizing methanogens was still the primary pathway for the metabolic balance of acidity in the es digester without applied voltage in some instances villano et al 2010 cheng et al 2009 the reason for enhancing anaerobic digestion with additional electric field was primarily attributed to the phenomenon that h2 utilizing methanogens were enriched in the cathodic biofilms however the only reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 3 v to 0 2 v detected fig 5 and the abundance of h2 utilizing methanogens evidently declined fig 6a did not support the possibility of trafficking in h2 between electrodes to h2 utilizing methanogens in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages multiple line of evidence related to the performances figs 2 and fig 3 demonstrated that additional electric field rather than electrodes could alleviate the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes especially in response to the decrease of srt from 30 d to 20 d although additional electric field evidently enriched the electro active methanogens such as methanosarcina species fig 6a the evaluation of electron flow based on the current generation table s2 almost eliminated the contribution of directly accepting electrons from electrodes for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane however the special enrichment of methanosarcina species also provided the possibility that they were capable of directly accepting electrons via diet since the abundance of their potential diet based syntrophs syntrophomonas species evidently increased in the biofilms on the surface of electrodes with applied voltages fig 6b up to date all methanosarcina species have been evaluated to directly accept electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane via diet in defined co cultures with geobacter species zhou et al 2021 however the eet mechanisms in methanosarcina species is still enigmatic since none of these species except m acetivorans are known to display membrane bound multi heme cytochromes yee and rotaru 2020 however the study presented here observed that additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps figs 4 and 7 with a relatively higher capacity of charge discharge table s5 in the cathodic biofilms providing a possibility that eps mediated the eet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina species the eps were electrically active in situ electrochemical ftir fig 9 with the detecting potential shifting from 0 9 v to 0 4 v the intensity changes of the bands indicated the redox reaction characters that occurred at the extracted eps from cathodic biofilms on the surface of electrodes in addition 3d eem and eem parafac analysis showed that additional electric field evidently increased the content of protein like substance figs 7 and 8 these results and the fact that protein like substance was capable of mediating the eet further supported the possibility that additional electric field stimulated the secretion of eps to mediated the eet between electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens 5 conclusions the study present here demonstrated that additional electric field could alleviate the suppression of acidity in anaerobic digestion of kitchen wastes especially in response to the decrease of srt from 30 d to 20 d additional electric field supported the growth of the electro active methanogens methanosarcina species in the cathodic biofilms and they might directly accept electrons from their potential diet based syntrophs syntrophomonas species via diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in addition the study also found that additional electric field promoting the secretion of eps in the cathodic biofilms the eps were electrically active and primarily comprised of the protein like substance which provided a possibility that eps mediated the eet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina species credit authorship contribution statement

positive cq values were higher than respective lloq values 4 discussion 4 1 nist srm 2917 performance for qpcr standard curve generation nist srm 2917 is designed to generate standard curves for 13 recreational water quality qpcr assays using a linearized plasmid dna construct single laboratory performance assessment of this standard control material demonstrates the ability to generate high quality calibration models for all qpcr assays with e values ranging from 0 95 0 006 to 0 99 0 008 and r2 0 980 all within expert recommended guidelines for qpcr standard curves bustin et al 2009 regardless of qpcr assay variability in repeated cq measurements generated from six independent instrument runs at each dilution level were low cq standard deviations 0 657 and exhibited a heteroscedastic trend characteristic of qpcr standard curves bustin 2006 where measurement error is highest at the lowest concentration together these findings clearly demonstrate that nist srm 2917 functions with all qpcr methods and suggest that the future use of this control material by scientists and water quality managers should help reduce variability in qpcr concentration estimates and make results more consistent between laboratories results also indicate that a multiple laboratory study is warranted to evaluate nist srm 2917 performance across laboratories 4 2 use of yeast carrier trna the addition of an rna stabilizer such as yeast carrier trna to improve nucleic acid reference material storage stability is recommended for both qpcr and dpcr applications baoutina et al 2019 dmiqe 2020 jerome et al 2002 podivinsky et al 2009 yeast carrier trna was used in the preparation of nist srm 2917 to maximize stability for storage at 4 c kralj et al 2021 storage at 4 c has been reported to be superior to 20 c for dna based reference materials because this practice avoids unwanted degradation due to solution freezing and thawing after aliquot repeated use baoutina et al 2019 to confirm that the presence of the yeast carrier trna did not introduce contamination or influence standard curve model performance slope and y intercept a series of no template controls and standard curves were tested in the presence and absence of the yeast carrier trna additive findings indicate that the use of yeast carrier trna 10 ng µl as a stabilizer did not introduce contamination or alter qpcr performance suggesting that this practice may prove useful in future standard preparations for other nucleic acid based control materials of interest 4 3 the e coli reagent contamination challenge the presence of e coli genomic fragments in commercially prepared molecular reagents has been well documented for more than 30 years corless et al 2000 hughes et al 1994 meier et al 1993 rand and houck 1990 schmidt et al 1991 silkie et al 2008 these fragments are often identified in no template controls of pcr based experiments designed to detect trace quantities of e coli genetic material employing a high number of thermal cycles 35 the amount of e coli contamination has been reported to vary across commercially prepared reagent lot preparations sivaganesan et al 2019 and often occurs at levels below the limit of quantification 10 copies per reaction in this study no template controls identified the presence of the e coli multiple copy 23s ribosomal rna gene in 22 2 of reactions 76 of 342 with all cq values exceeding the ec23s857 lloq 33 3 cq table 2 suggesting that the presence of contamination had a minimal influence on standard curves generated in this study however it is highly recommended for any pcr based trace application targeting an e coli genetic marker such as recreational water quality monitoring to conduct control experiments to characterize potential contamination in each reagent lot prior to sample testing 4 4 implications for water quality management the lack of a standard control material is a key challenge for the successful widespread implementation of any qpcr based recreational water quality testing method the development of a high quality material readily available from a centralized source will have several important implications for water quality management first nist srm 2917 allows for implementation of multiple qpcr water quality methods to assess recreational water public health risk as well as characterize human dog avian ruminant cattle and pig fecal pollution sources all from a single control material preparation because nist srm 2917 functions with 13 qpcr water quality methods practitioners can customize experiments to implement one or more of these methodologies using the same standard control material second future use of this control material will help minimize concentration estimate variability and make results more comparable within and between laboratories nist srm 2917 will also benefit water quality management in less obvious ways for example standard curves generated with nist srm 2917 may be used to establish performance benchmarks to help scientists managers reviewers and the public evaluate the technical quality of future qpcr experiments against an established yardstick these benchmarks could also potentially serve as performance metrics for future lab accreditation protocols finally it is important to note that nist srm 2917 qpcr targets were selected to augment routine recreational water quality testing however many of these assays are also commonly used in stormwater management ahmed et al 2019 staley et al 2018 food production monitoring fu and li 2014 merino mascorro et al 2018 ravaliya et al 2014 wastewater surveillance wilder et al 2021 outbreak exposure route identification mattioli et al 2021 or any other application seeking to characterize the amount and sources of fecal waste in a sample 5 conclusions single laboratory performance assessment of nist srm 2917 demonstrates that this control material can consistently generate high quality standard curves for all recreational water quality qpcr dna targets key findings include nist srm 2917 is the first standard control material produced for fecal pollution recreational water quality monitoring that functions with 13 qpcr assays that can assess recreational water public health risk as well as characterize human dog avian ruminant cattle and pig fecal pollution sources the addition of yeast carrier trna as a stabilizer does not compromise qpcr standard curve performance or introduce contamination all nist srm 2917 dilution levels exhibited low variability across repeated measurements and instrument runs regardless of qpcr assay with dilution level 1 10 3 copies per reaction consistently exhibiting the highest variability single laboratory performance assessment findings suggest that nist srm 2917 is suitable for broad scale implementation for recreational water quality applications genetic targets harbored on nist srm 2917 could also serve as standard control material for stormwater food production wastewater surveillance outbreak exposure route identification or any other application seeking to characterize the amount and sources of fecal waste in a sample although this study represents an important step towards the validation and widespread use of qpcr based recreational water quality testing methods it will be necessary to assess

nist srm 2917 models indicated a range of quantification spanning 10 3 to 1 04 105 copies of target dna per reaction entire range tested in study and r2 values of 0 996 regardless of qpcr assay e ranged from 0 95 0 006 rum2bac to 0 99 0 008 cpq 056 a summary of standard curve performance parameters is shown in table 2 a total of 31 outliers out of 1170 total measurements 2 6 were identified

bacr287 humm2 and cowm2 multiplex iac measurements 102 copies 2 µl in no template controls yielded standard deviations 2 29 cq n 18 measurements per assay iac measurements in nist srm 2917 reactions performed as expected data not shown 3 4 nist srm 2917 qpcr measurement variability at each dilution level the standard deviation of repeated cq measurements across six instrument runs for each qpcr assay were assessed at all dilution levels using nist srm 2917 fig 3 all qpcr assays exhibited a heteroscedastic trend with average cq standard deviations of 0 443 at the 10 3 copies per reaction

control reactions indicated 99 75 dna free 4 of 1620 excluding the ec23s857 qpcr assay for ec23s857 a false positive rate of 22 2 was observed 76 of 342 no template control reactions all false positive cq values were higher than respective lloq values 4 discussion 4 1 nist srm 2917 performance for qpcr standard curve generation nist srm 2917 is designed to generate standard curves for 13 recreational water quality qpcr assays using a linearized plasmid dna construct single laboratory performance assessment of this standard control material demonstrates the ability to generate high quality calibration models for all qpcr assays with e values ranging from 0 95 0 006 to 0 99 0 008 and r2 0 980 all within expert recommended guidelines for qpcr standard curves bustin et al 2009 regardless of qpcr assay variability in repeated cq measurements generated from six independent instrument runs at each dilution level were low cq standard deviations 0 657 and exhibited a heteroscedastic trend characteristic of qpcr standard curves bustin 2006 where measurement error is highest at the lowest concentration together these findings clearly demonstrate that nist srm 2917 functions with all qpcr methods and suggest that the future use of this control material by scientists and water quality managers should help reduce variability in qpcr concentration estimates and make results more consistent between laboratories results also indicate that a multiple laboratory study is warranted to evaluate nist srm 2917 performance across laboratories 4 2 use of yeast carrier trna the addition of an rna stabilizer such as yeast carrier trna to improve nucleic acid reference material storage stability is recommended for both qpcr and dpcr applications baoutina et al 2019 dmiqe 2020 jerome et al 2002 podivinsky et al 2009 yeast carrier trna was used in the preparation of nist srm 2917 to maximize stability for storage at 4 c kralj et al 2021 storage at 4 c has been reported to be superior to 20 c for dna based reference materials because this practice avoids unwanted degradation due to solution freezing and thawing after aliquot repeated use baoutina et al 2019 to confirm that the presence of the yeast carrier trna did not introduce contamination or influence standard curve model performance slope and y intercept a series of no template controls and standard curves were tested in the presence and absence of the yeast carrier trna additive findings indicate that the use of yeast carrier trna 10 ng µl as a stabilizer did not introduce contamination or alter qpcr performance suggesting that this practice may prove useful in future standard preparations for other nucleic acid based control materials of interest 4 3 the e coli reagent contamination challenge the presence of e coli genomic fragments in commercially prepared molecular reagents has been well documented for more than 30 years corless et al 2000 hughes et al 1994 meier et al 1993 rand and houck 1990 schmidt et al 1991 silkie et al 2008 these fragments are often identified in no template controls of pcr based experiments designed to detect trace quantities of e coli genetic material employing a high number of thermal cycles 35 the amount of e coli contamination has been reported to vary across commercially prepared reagent lot preparations sivaganesan et al 2019 and often occurs at levels below the limit of quantification 10 copies per reaction in this study no template controls identified the presence of the e coli multiple copy 23s ribosomal rna gene in 22 2 of reactions 76 of 342 with all cq values exceeding the ec23s857 lloq 33 3 cq table 2 suggesting that the presence of contamination had a minimal influence on standard curves generated in this study however it is highly recommended for any pcr based trace application targeting an e coli genetic marker such as recreational water quality monitoring to conduct control experiments to characterize potential contamination in each reagent lot prior to sample testing 4 4 implications for water quality management the lack of a standard control material is a key challenge for the successful widespread implementation of any qpcr based recreational water quality testing method the development of a high quality material readily available from a centralized source will have several important implications for water quality management first nist srm 2917 allows for implementation of multiple qpcr water quality methods to assess recreational water public health risk as well as characterize human dog avian ruminant cattle and pig fecal pollution sources all from a single control material preparation because nist srm 2917 functions with 13 qpcr water quality methods practitioners can customize experiments to implement one or more of these methodologies using the same standard control material second future use of this control material will help minimize concentration estimate variability and make results more comparable within and between laboratories nist srm 2917 will also benefit water quality management in less obvious ways for example standard curves generated with nist srm 2917 may be used to establish performance benchmarks to help scientists managers reviewers and the public evaluate the technical quality of future qpcr experiments against an established yardstick these benchmarks could also potentially serve as performance metrics for future lab accreditation protocols finally it is important to note that nist srm 2917 qpcr targets were selected to augment routine recreational water quality testing however many of these assays are also commonly used in stormwater management ahmed et al 2019 staley et al 2018 food production monitoring fu and li 2014 merino mascorro et al 2018 ravaliya et al 2014 wastewater surveillance wilder et al 2021 outbreak exposure route identification mattioli et al 2021 or any other application seeking to characterize the amount and sources of fecal waste in a sample 5 conclusions single laboratory performance assessment of nist srm 2917 demonstrates that this control material can consistently generate high quality standard curves for all recreational water quality qpcr dna targets key findings include nist srm 2917 is the first standard control material produced for fecal pollution recreational water quality monitoring that functions with 13 qpcr assays that can assess recreational water public health risk as well as characterize human dog avian ruminant cattle and pig fecal pollution sources the addition of yeast carrier trna as a stabilizer does not compromise qpcr standard curve performance or introduce contamination all nist srm 2917 dilution levels exhibited low variability across repeated measurements and instrument runs regardless of qpcr assay with dilution level 1 10 3 copies per reaction consistently exhibiting the highest variability single laboratory performance assessment findings suggest that nist srm 2917 is suitable for broad scale implementation for recreational water quality applications genetic targets harbored on nist srm 2917 could also serve as standard control material for stormwater food production wastewater surveillance outbreak exposure route identification or any other application seeking to characterize the amount and sources of fecal waste in a sample although this study represents an important step towards the validation and widespread use of qpcr based recreational water quality testing methods it will be necessary to assess

16268,carbon based materials especially graphene oxide go and carbon dots possessing antibacterial properties are widely used for various applications recently we reported the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of carbonized nanogels cngs for the treatment of bacterial keratitis and as a virostatic agent against infectious bronchitis virus in this work we demonstrate the use of cngs go nanocomposite go cngs membrane for the efficient removal of gram negative e coli and gram positive s aureus bacteria from contaminated water the go cngs composite membrane with an optimized ratio of go to cngs could achieve more than 99 removal efficiency toward e coli and s aureus various strains of bacteria interact differently with the membrane and hence the membrane shows different removal rate which can be optimized by controlling the interaction time through regulating the water flux the go cngs membrane with an active area of 2 83 cm2 achieved 99 bacterial removal efficiency at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 the dynamic disruption of bacteria by go cngs plays a crucial role in eliminating the bacteria rather than filtering out the bacteria go cngs membrane allows them to pass through it interact with the bacteria and rupture the bacterial cell membranes our go cngs membrane shows great potential as a filter to remove bacteria from contaminated water samples operating under tap water pressure without any extra power consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane filtration gravity flow bacterial removal graphene oxide carbonized nanogels 1 introduction waterborne diseases due to contaminated drinking water and their related health complications especially bacterial infections have become a major threat in developing countries islam et al 2021 moreira and bondelind 2017 efficient treatment methods such as chlorination uv treatment and oxidation processes e g ozonation photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation have been widely used for the elimination of pathogens from water stange et al 2019 chen et al 2021 though the widely practiced method for large scale water disinfection to control bacteria population in municipal water supply using chlorine and related compounds effectively disinfect drinking water such method can form several carcinogenic byproducts mazhar et al 2020 chlorine reacts with the naturally occurring organic matters present in water to form disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acid and other halogenated derivatives mazhar et al 2020 long term exposure to those compounds causes adverse health effects including malignant tumors mazhar et al 2020 tang et al 2020 a detailed review on the hazards caused upon exposure to these byproducts and their minimization strategies has been reported by mazhar et al 2020 although some methods such as adsorption coagulation advanced oxidation process membrane based filtration and combined techniques have been developed to reduce the generated harmful byproducts in chlorine disinfection srivastav et al 2020 it usually involves complicated processes and conventional chlorine disinfection methods are still practiced in many countries for municipal water supply tang et al 2020 the advancement in membrane technology has paved the way for cost effective water purification by filtration replacing conventional water purification methods goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 obotey ezugbe and rathilal 2020 synthetic organic polymers such as polyethylene polytetrafluoroethylene polypropylene and cellulose acetate inorganic membranes from ceramics metals silica and zeolite are widely used for water treatment applications obotey ezugbe and rathilal 2020 kayvani fard et al 2018 thin film composite membranes containing polyamide polysulfone and bio based polymeric membranes such as cellulose and chitin based membranes also have been reported to be effective for removing bacteria dai et al 2020 karami et al 2020 mamah et al 2021 mansoori et al 2020 most of the membrane based purifications are highly pressure driven which may be unviable in several parts of the world hube et al 2020 in addition one of the major drawbacks of membrane technology in water purification fouling of the membranes further reduces the efficiency of the membrane chang et al 2019 fouling occurs mainly due to biofilm formation by bacteria which clogs the pores and demands higher pressure for filtration significantly reducing the filter s efficiency polymeric membranes are used for water treatment applications and various methods have been adopted for the modification of these polymeric membranes jhaveri and murthy 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 controlled orientation of nanomaterials in the polymeric nanocomposite could achieve effective bacterial elimination pandit et al 2020 in addition to the polymeric membranes commercial filter paper modified with polymers are also used in water treatment to filter bacteria ottenhall et al 2018 filter paper modified with polyelectrolyte polyvinylamine imparts positive charges on the surface and has been reported to be effective in trapping bacteria ottenhall et al 2018 the mechanism of removal of bacteria by the filter is solely based on the filtration effect size exclusion and electrostatic interactions recently nanocomposite membranes with nanoparticles dispersed into the polymeric membrane mixed matrix membrane or coated on membrane support thin film composite membrane are reported to exhibit superior antibacterial characteristics compared to unmodified membranes castro muñoz 2020 li et al 2017 ying et al 2017 carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube cnt graphene graphene oxide go and carbon dots cds are also used for modifying the polymeric membranes for improving antifouling and microbial resistance anand et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 zhang and tremblay 2020 zhao and chung 2018 commercial millipore membranes modified with cds incorporated cnts have also been reported for the removal of bacteria dong et al 2018 go has been widely studied as an antibacterial agent for the past few years since its first report by hu et al 2010 factors such as purity size morphology of go and molecules adsorbed on the go affect its antibacterial activity making it a flexible antibacterial nanomaterial with negligible cytotoxic behavior barbolina et al 2016 ming et al 2020 perreault et al 2015 sengupta et al 2019 the antibacterial behavior of go originates from various physical interactions and electron transfers of go with the bacteria mohammed et al 2020 seifi and kamali 2021 sengupta et al 2019 yaragalla et al 2021 however the antibacterial property of go in solution greatly differs from that on a coated surface or when incorporated into a membrane cao et al 2021 yadav et al 2017 in solution go nanosheets may wrap the bacteria isolating it from the environment on a coated surface go may act as an oxidizing agent with their oxidative potential depending on the size of go perreault et al 2015 unfortunately antibacterial go nanosheets lose their activity when fabricated into a membrane due to the stacking of go layers wang et al 2019 therefore a standalone go membrane is not practically feasible due to its low antibacterial activity and poor physical strength go polymer composites can form porous membranes with good stability and mass diffusivity which have been reported for water filtration application kumar et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 this study modified go with carbonized nanogels cngs to prepare a water purification membrane for eradicating bacteria the bacteria removal is based on an antibacterial layer consisting of cngs decorated go go cngs composite coated on a filter paper that serves as the support membrane the active layer of go cngs composite membrane on a filter paper was prepared by vacuum filtration and their bacterial removal efficiency was studied by a syringe pump and syringe filter set up as displayed in scheme s1 supporting information escherichia coli e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus were chosen as the representative bacteria to study the bacteria removal efficiency of the membrane go cngs composite membrane effectively eradicated bacteria 99 9 at an optimized water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 the dynamic disruption of bacteria passing through the membrane by go cngs is the major factor contributing to the removal of bacteria rather than the mere filtration effect in addition the membranes were effective in eliminating bacteria under a very low pressure gravity and have shown to be effective in inhibiting biofilm formation the efficiency of go cngs membranes in removing bacteria 96 from contaminated water such as drainage water stagnant water and water from a moderately maintained seawater aquarium further reveals their potential for water treatment applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of cngs cngs used for the present study was synthesized by a simple dry heating of lysine hcl lysine hcl 1 0 g was placed in a 50 ml glass vial and heated in a muffle furnace at 280 c for 3 h chou et al 2021 the carbonized product thus obtained was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized di water and sonicated for 1 h the resulting solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for 30 min to remove the bigger particles the cngs in the supernatant yield 70 was quantified and stored at 4 c for future use 2 2 preparation of go cngs composite coated filter paper go cngs composites with different mass ratio of go and cngs were prepared by taking constant amount of cngs e g 1 0 mg to different amount of go e g 0 25 2 0 mg in di water under stirring for 2 min followed by sonication for 20 min to prepare the go cngs composite membrane first a filter paper qualitative filter paper advantec 2 thickness 0 26 mm pore size 5 µm as provided by the manufacturer which acts as a support membrane was washed with 30 ml of di water then go cngs composite solution was passed through the filter paper by vacuum filtration to obtain a go cngs loading of 0 4 mg cm 2 on the top of the filter paper then the coated filter papers were washed with 200 ml of sodium phosphate buffer 5 mm ph 7 4 at a water flux of 5800 ml min 1 m 2 to remove the unbound go cngs go cngs composite membrane of area 4 91 cm2 active area 2 83 cm2 was used for the entire study 2 3 removal of bacteria using go cngs coated filter paper the prepared go cngs composite membrane was tested for the removal of gram negative e coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa and gram positive s aureus methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa and bacillus subtilis b subtilis bacteria the different strains of bacteria were cultured in lysogeny broth lb medium at 37 c with shaking at 150 rpm a portion of the cell culture od600 1 was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min at 25 c and washed twice with sodium phosphate buffer 5 mm ph 7 4 the bacteria suspension was diluted to 102 105 cfu ml 1 to check the removal efficiency of the membrane the experiments were carried out in dead end mode filtration at room temperature to design a standard experimental procedure and obtain consistent results the bacteria solution was passed through a syringe filter holder diameter 2 5 cm loaded with the composite membrane and one uncoated filter paper was placed on the go cngs coated filter paper to provide support a syringe pump kd scientific u s a was used at the feed side and at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 3 ml of the filtrate was collected to check the bacterial removal efficiency the collected filtrate was diluted 10 100 times from which 100 µl was spread on lb agar plate and incubated at 37 c for 12 h for the determination of bacterial colonies the liquid culture of the collected filtrate was also performed by supplementing lb and incubating at 37 c for 12 h followed by measuring the od600 values and the bacteria eliminating efficiency is expressed in terms of relative viability each experiment was performed in quadruplicate for each condition the morphology of bacteria before and after passing through the membrane was identified using transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopy sem for tem measurements the original bacteria solution and the filtrate were separately dropped on 300 mesh carbon coated copper grids allowed to stand for 30 min then dried under vacuum the samples were dropped on silicon wafer dried under vacuum and sputtered with platinum for sem analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of go cngs go synthesized by modified hummers method has lateral sizes ranging from 200 to 250 nm fig 1 a a marcano et al 2010 the atomic force microscope afm image reveals the single layer thickness of go with a height of 1 1 0 4 nm and an average size of ca 230 nm fig s1 a supporting information the high resolution tem hrtem images of cngs synthesized from lysine hcl through mild pyrolysis at 280 c for 3 h show that rather than having a perfectly spherical shape the cngs appear to be a polymeric gel with size ranging from 50 to 200 nm fig 1a b cngs are formed from lysine hcl after dry heating mainly through dehydration polymerization crosslinking and partial carbonization lin et al 2021 the lattice spacing of 0 24 nm could be ascribed to 112 planes of the graphene lattice fringes the inset to fig 1a b the cngs differ from most reported carbon dots including graphene quantum dots carbon quantum dots and carbonized polymer dots which possess sizes usually 20 nm and have spherical nanostructures with a perfect graphene lattice in the core li et al 2021 long et al 2021 xia et al 2019 the dynamic light scattering dls measurements in sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 5 mm reveal that the cngs have an average hydrodynamic size of 250 nm due to the polymeric nanogel like nature with positive charges zeta potential ζ 8 04 mv as a result of nitrogen doping and preservation of amine groups the nitrogen mass ratio was determined to be ca 12 by elemental analysis the afm image further confirms the wide size distribution of cngs fig s1 b fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of go and cngs are displayed in fig s2 supporting information a broad peak observed for go between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 corresponds to the o h stretching vibration the peaks at 1730 and 1600 cm 1 correspond to c o asymmetric stretching and c c bonds from unoxidized sp2 carbon atoms respectively marcano et al 2010 the o h bending of the carboxyl groups is observed at 1390 cm 1 the peaks at 1220 cm 1 and 1050 cm 1 depict the phenolic c oh stretching and c o c stretching of the epoxy groups respectively aliyev et al 2019 marcano et al 2010 the ft ir results support that go nanosheets are comprised of carboxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl at the edges and epoxy groups in the basal plane aliyev et al 2019 dreyer et al 2010 the ft ir spectrum of cngs shows an absorption band at 3400 cm 1 corresponding to o h stretching and the peak at 1650 cm 1 due to stretching vibration of c o carboxyl groups present in the cngs the bands at 3125 3040 and 2900 cm 1 correspond to the different functional c h stretching li et al 2014 the peaks at 1525 and 1400 cm 1 are attributed to the n h bending vibration of the primary amino group and c n stretching vibrations respectively the uv visible absorption spectrum of cngs shows a typical absorption band of π π transition of aromatic sp2 domains at 265 nm with a shoulder band between 290 and 315 nm due to the n π transitions of c o and c n bonds fig s3 supporting information the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of go shows a single band at 2θ value of 11 2 which reveals the complete oxidation of graphite to go possessing an interlayer distance of 0 80 nm fig s4 supporting information huang et al 2018 in the case of cngs a broad band at 23 corresponding to that of the 002 of graphitic carbon further confirms the partial carbonization during the formation of cngs pal et al 2020 go cngs were prepared by simple stirring and sonication in aqueous medium at the mass ratio of go cngs of 0 25 1 0 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 and 2 0 1 0 and are denoted as go0 25 cngs go0 5 cngs go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs respectively go exhibited ζ values n 5 in the range from 37 83 4 66 to 49 43 4 33 mv in the ph range from 3 to 11 whereas the cngs showed ζ values from 13 17 3 14 to 3 58 3 59 mv in the same ph range fig s5a supporting information the ζ of the go cngs composites with different ratio decreased upon increasing the ph from 3 to 11 the ζ of all the go cngs composites are higher than cngs at different ph values whereas the ζ of go was highly negative as high as 49 43 mv the high accumulation of positively charged cngs on go formed a highly condensed layer of cngs on go which increased the ζ of the go cngs the binding of cngs to go to form go cngs composite is also supported by the afm analysis fig s1c the afm image of go cngs displays multi layered sheets of go which shows a mild aggregation of the composite the xrd pattern of go cngs in fig s4 shows that the cngs capped on the go expands the interlayer distance of go stacking leading to the shifting of band at 11 2 to ca 5 also the dls measurements show that the hydrodynamic size of go cngs highly increased with an increase in the ratio of go at ph 9 and 11 fig s5b 3 2 go cngs membrane for the removal of bacteria the tem images of the go cngs composite dispersions with different ratio of go and cngs are presented in fig 1a c f go0 25 cngs and go0 5 cngs in aqueous solution are dispersed well whereas go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs showed aggregation the sem images and digital photographs of the membranes coated with go cngs or go cngs are displayed in fig 1b and c the higher ratios of go to cngs i e go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs show aggregation due to lower zeta potentials and therefore form a uniform solid layer on the support membrane qualitative filter paper advantec 2 go cngs and lower ratios of go cngs composites do not form a film on the support membrane surface however they are adsorbed on the membrane fibers fig 1c go cngs and various go cngs coated membranes were tested for their efficiency in removing the bacteria after passing 105 cfu ml 1 of the bacteria solution 5 ml e coli or s aureus through the different membranes at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 3 ml of the filtrate was collected and checked for bacterial viability using agar plate culture method the diluted sample solution 100 µl was spread on luria broth lb agar plates and incubated at 37 c for 12 h to determine the bacterial colonies figs 2 a and s6 supporting information the relative viability of bacteria obtained by measuring the od600 of the liquid culture supplemented with lb medium is given in fig 2b the filter paper control and filter paper coated with go or cngs was not capable of removing the gram negative and gram positive bacteria go loses its antibacterial activity when fabricated into a membrane due to the stacking of go layers the loss of antimicrobial activity of go nanosheets lateral size 10 75 nm when fabricated into a membrane of thickness 30 nm was also reported by wang et al 2019 in solution go nanosheets with their nanostructure play a major role in interacting with the bacterial cell membrane resulting in membranolysis wang et al 2019 however upon stacking go loses its sharp edge nanostructure and thereby its antibacterial nature cngs strongly interact with the bacterial membrane to induce bacterial aggregation and even cell lysis lin et al 2021 mao et al 2022 their positive charge and flexible gel like structure enable them to interact well with the bacterial cell wall however the standalone cng modified membrane is not practically feasible therefore we prepared a stable membrane where the cngs hybrid with go the filter papers modified with go cngs were effective in removing e coli and s aureus the composites with a higher ratio of go i e go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs were highly operative in removing e coli 105 cfu ml 1 with almost 99 9 removal rate a similar removal effect was also observed when lower concentrations 102 103 or 104 cfu ml 1 of bacteria solution was passed through different go cngs coated membranes with go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs modified membranes showing 99 removal rate for e coli fig s7 supporting information in the case of gram positive bacteria s aureus go0 5 cngs coated filter paper could eliminate 99 9 while the go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs modified ones showed only ca 86 and 87 removal respectively however 99 9 removal of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria could be attained if the bacteria solution is filtered by using two go cngs coated membranes placed one above the other fig s8 supporting information the difference in response of different bacteria to various carbon based nanomaterials has also been observed in previous studies kumar et al 2020 musico et al 2014 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 gram positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan layer outside the cell membrane while gram negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer between the cell membrane and outer membrane the ζ of e coli and s aureus were measured to be ca 20 and 18 mv respectively in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 at a concentration of 105 cfu ml 1 same conditions as used in filtration the different characteristics of bacterial membranes may result in different interactions with go cngs and hence the difference in eliminating efficiency in addition the shape of bacteria may also play a significant role in their interaction with the go cngs and hence the removal rate sengupta et al 2019 furthermore the go cngs composite membrane was effective in removing other gram negative and gram positive bacteria such as p aeruginosa b subtilis and even multidrug resistant bacteria mrsa fig s9 supporting information to test whether the removal of bacteria is caused by the interaction with the unbound leakage go or cngs of go cngs present in the filtrate sodium phosphate solution 5 mm ph 7 4 was passed through each modified filter paper and bacteria 104 cfu ml 1 was spiked into the collected filtrate the lb agar plate culture of the spiked bacterial solution does not show any antibacterial phenomenon fig s10 supporting information confirming that leaching of the materials has not occurred and the bacterial removal is due to the interaction of bacteria with the composite on the filter paper our go cngs membrane used for the removal of bacteria does not require high pressure and gravitational force is sufficient to pass the water through the go1 0 cngs composite membrane active area 2 83 cm2 with 99 removal of e coil our results reveal that go cngs membrane could effectively remove the gram positive and gram negative bacteria go and cngs are reported as good antibacterial agents for the eradication of various types of bacteria anand et al 2019 lin et al 2021 mao et al 2022 also the go and cngs used in the present study show antibacterial effect against e coli in solution with a minimal inhibitory concentration mic with 99 inhibition of bacterial growth of 1 5 mg ml 1 and 10 µg ml 1 respectively however the filter paper coated with only go or cngs exhibited negligible bacteria removal even for 103 cfu ml 1 though go and cngs showed antibacterial activity in solution the go cngs modified membranes exhibited negligible antibacterial activity toward e coli and s aureus similar to that of the unmodified filter paper control fig s11 supporting information however go modified filter paper showed slight antibacterial activity toward e coli and s aureus and cngs modified filter paper toward e coli the decrease in bacterial viability 30 upon interaction with bacteria may be due to the adsorption of bacteria on the surface of go membrane which depends on the genus of bacteria ming et al 2020 however the go films with a similar surface area is reported to exhibit mass dependent attachment for the specific type of bacteria ming et al 2020 3 3 mechanism of bacterial eradication using go cngs membrane upon passing through the go cngs modified filter paper the dynamic interaction of bacteria with the go cngs on the filter paper resulted in the severe disruption of the bacterial membranes leading to the leakage of the cellular contents the electron microscopy images show the disintegration of the bacterial cell membranes of e coli and s aureus after passing through go1 0 cngs modified filter paper fig 3 the antibacterial properties of cngs contribute to the disruption of the bacterial membrane upon interacting with go cngs the lb agar plates did not show any signs of bacterial growth even after seven days of incubation at 37 c indicating that bacteria have been destroyed completely after passing through the go cngs membrane however the mechanism of removal of bacteria by the go cngs membrane is not solely based on the interaction of go cngs with the bacteria although sem images of the go1 0 cngs coated filter paper after passing 105 cfu ml 1 of e coli solution 5 ml show no obvious bacteria are retained on the modified membrane surface the real time quantitative pcr qpcr results indicated the retention of small amount of bacteria ca 20 for e coli and 10 for s aureus in the solution above the go cngs modified filter paper as a result the filtration effect of the go1 0 cngs also contributes to the removal of bacteria however we believe the bacteria are inactivated mainly by the interaction with go cngs during passing through the pores of the modified filter paper the pore size of the support filter paper used for this study is 5 µm and though the go cngs composite reduces the pore size it does not completely block all the pores therefore the tested bacteria easily can pass through the membrane enabling a low pressure driven filtration however bacteria can interact with the go cngs coated on the support filter paper during the filtration process leading to the rupture of the bacterial membranes and the leakage of cellular contents therefore the accumulation of bacteria on the surface of the membrane and the formation of biofilm on the membrane surface can be prevented by the use of the go cngs composite membrane fig s12 supporting information reveals that go cngs enables inhibition of biofilm formation and even superior to antibiotic vancomycin at the concentration of 10 µg ml 1 this prevention of biofilm on the membrane surface is useful in preventing the clogging of the pores of the membrane over time which is a major factor responsible for lowering the efficiency of the membranes during long term use for membrane based water treatment applications 3 4 effect of water flux on the removal of bacteria the water flux through the membrane was controlled by a syringe pump in this study the efficiency of go cngs membrane in removing the bacteria upon passing through it depends on the water flux because sufficient time for interaction is needed to deactivate the bacteria the dependence of water flux on the eradication of bacteria was studied choosing go1 0 cngs membrane for e coli and go0 5 cqd membrane for s aureus because these two membranes show the highest removal efficiency for the two bacteria fig 4 a shows that with a water flux 400 ml min 1 m 2 the bacteria removal efficiency decreases for both e coli and s aureus which indicates that sufficient time is necessary for the interaction of bacteria with the go cngs to damage the cell membrane and subsequent disruption we further studied the efficiency of go cngs modified filter paper in the continuous removal of bacteria fig 4b the efficiency of go cngs modified filter paper was not compromised even after passing 300 ml of s aureus solution 105 cfu ml 1 in the case of e coli the removal rate showed a slight decrease after passing 25 ml of 105 cfu ml 1 solution through the membrane however it still showed 90 removal efficiency after passing 100 ml of e coli solution and 80 removal efficiency after 300 ml this decrease in the removal efficiency may be due to the adhesion of e coli to the go cngs modified filter paper which decreases the direct interaction with further bacteria however the back pressure showed an insignificant difference and membrane surface did not show any bacteria or their debris fig s13 supporting information after passing 300 ml of bacteria solution through the go cngs modified filter paper using a syringe pump revealing the fragments of dead bacteria have a negligible effect on the permeability of the go cngs modified filter paper however we believe the bacterial removal efficiency could be improved when dealing with a large volume of contaminated water under a high water flux by using multiple layers of filter paper coated with go cngs we used dead end filtration method in this study and 105 cfu ml 1 bacteria solution the membrane did not show clogging at this condition however for higher bacterial concentration and long term use a continuous cross flow filtration system will be suitable which removes the unfiltered bacteria regularly along with the concentrate which has to be studied in detail 3 5 effective removal of bacteria from wastewaters and aquaculture water of the three different water samples tested for the removal of bacteria using go cngs modified filter paper the samples from drainage and stagnant waters collected from national taiwan ocean university campus showed colonies of complicated bacteria strains whereas water from seawater aquarium has relatively simple bacteria strains fig 5 irrespective of the type of bacteria present in the water the go0 5 cngs and go1 0 cngs modified filter papers were effective in eliminating 96 99 of the bacteria even in high ionic strength seawater however colonies of some fungal strains were observed in the culture plate of stagnant water indicating the go cngs could not remove the fungal strains probably due to their rigid cell wall kang et al 2018 which resists physical disruption by antibacterial go cngs waterborne diseases due to the microbes present in water can cause mild infections and gastroenteritis to life threatening ailments like typhoid and pneumonia we hope go cngs coated filter could potentially eliminate pathogens from contaminated environmental water for domestic purposes and purify aquaculture water through continuous filtration cycles our previous work revealed that lys cngs exhibit negligible cytotoxicity toward human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line rd human liver cancer cell line hepg2 immortalized human keratinocyte line hacat and human embryonic kidney 293 sell line hek 293 t even at a concentration of 100 µg ml 1 mao et al 2022 however more studies on the mechanical stability long term use of the go cngs membrane toxicity and long term health effects are needed 4 conclusions go cngs composite was coated as an active layer on a supporting filter paper by vacuum filtration to remove bacteria 99 bacterial removal could be achieved with the go cngs modified filter paper at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 via the interaction of bacteria with the go cngs composite the interaction disrupts the bacterial cell membrane and prevents biofilm formation the go cngs modified filter paper was highly effective in eliminating bacterial colonies in real water samples which reveals its potential for water treatment applications however the membranes were not efficient in removing the fungal strains in water in our future work we will construct a continuous cross flow filtration system for the long term stability and reusability of the go cngs modified filter membrane which can remove all kinds of microorganisms from water we believe that this material can be the prototype for a new generation membrane that can achieve high removal efficiency of pathogens present in wastewater for water reclamation declaration of competing interest the authors

16268,carbon based materials especially graphene oxide go and carbon dots possessing antibacterial properties are widely used for various applications recently we reported the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of carbonized nanogels cngs for the treatment of bacterial keratitis and as a virostatic agent against infectious bronchitis virus in this work we demonstrate the use of cngs go nanocomposite go cngs membrane for the efficient removal of gram negative e coli and gram positive s aureus bacteria from contaminated water the go cngs composite membrane with an optimized ratio of go to cngs could achieve more than 99 removal efficiency toward e coli and s aureus various strains of bacteria interact differently with the membrane and hence the membrane shows different removal rate which can be optimized by controlling the interaction time through regulating the water flux the go cngs membrane with an active area of 2 83 cm2 achieved 99 bacterial removal efficiency at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 the dynamic disruption of bacteria by go cngs plays a crucial role in eliminating the bacteria rather than filtering out the bacteria go cngs membrane allows them to pass through it interact with the bacteria and rupture the bacterial cell membranes our go cngs membrane shows great potential as a filter to remove bacteria from contaminated water samples operating under tap water pressure without any extra power consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane filtration gravity flow bacterial removal graphene oxide carbonized nanogels 1 introduction waterborne diseases due to contaminated drinking water and their related health complications especially bacterial infections have become a major threat in developing countries islam et al 2021 moreira and bondelind 2017 efficient treatment methods such as chlorination uv treatment and oxidation processes e g ozonation photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation have been widely used for the elimination of pathogens from water stange et al 2019 chen et al 2021 though the widely practiced method for large scale water disinfection to control bacteria population in municipal water supply using chlorine and related compounds effectively disinfect drinking water such method can form several carcinogenic byproducts mazhar et al 2020 chlorine reacts with the naturally occurring organic matters present in water to form disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acid and other halogenated derivatives mazhar et al 2020 long term exposure to those compounds causes adverse health effects including malignant tumors mazhar et al 2020 tang et al 2020 a detailed review on the hazards caused upon exposure to these byproducts and their minimization strategies has been reported by mazhar et al 2020 although some methods such as adsorption coagulation advanced oxidation process membrane based filtration and combined techniques have been developed to reduce the generated harmful byproducts in chlorine disinfection srivastav et al 2020 it usually involves complicated processes and conventional chlorine disinfection methods are still practiced in many countries for municipal water supply tang et al 2020 the advancement in membrane technology has paved the way for cost effective water purification by filtration replacing conventional water purification methods goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 obotey ezugbe and rathilal 2020 synthetic organic polymers such as polyethylene polytetrafluoroethylene polypropylene and cellulose acetate inorganic membranes from ceramics metals silica and zeolite are widely used for water treatment applications obotey ezugbe and rathilal 2020 kayvani fard et al 2018 thin film composite membranes containing polyamide polysulfone and bio based polymeric membranes such as cellulose and chitin based membranes also have been reported to be effective for removing bacteria dai et al 2020 karami et al 2020 mamah et al 2021 mansoori et al 2020 most of the membrane based purifications are highly pressure driven which may be unviable in several parts of the world hube et al 2020 in addition one of the major drawbacks of membrane technology in water purification fouling of the membranes further reduces the efficiency of the membrane chang et al 2019 fouling occurs mainly due to biofilm formation by bacteria which clogs the pores and demands higher pressure for filtration significantly reducing the filter s efficiency polymeric membranes are used for water treatment applications and various methods have been adopted for the modification of these polymeric membranes jhaveri and murthy 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 controlled orientation of nanomaterials in the polymeric nanocomposite could achieve effective bacterial elimination pandit et al 2020 in addition to the polymeric membranes commercial filter paper modified with polymers are also used in water treatment to filter bacteria ottenhall et al 2018 filter paper modified with polyelectrolyte polyvinylamine imparts positive charges on the surface and has been reported to be effective in trapping bacteria ottenhall et al 2018 the mechanism of removal of bacteria by the filter is solely based on the filtration effect size exclusion and electrostatic interactions recently nanocomposite membranes with nanoparticles dispersed into the polymeric membrane mixed matrix membrane or coated on membrane support thin film composite membrane are reported to exhibit superior antibacterial characteristics compared to unmodified membranes castro muñoz 2020 li et al 2017 ying et al 2017 carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube cnt graphene graphene oxide go and carbon dots cds are also used for modifying the polymeric membranes for improving antifouling and microbial resistance anand et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 zhang and tremblay 2020 zhao and chung 2018 commercial millipore membranes modified with cds incorporated cnts have also been reported for the removal of bacteria dong et al 2018 go has been widely studied as an antibacterial agent for the past few years since its first report by hu et al 2010 factors such as purity size morphology of go and molecules adsorbed on the go affect its antibacterial activity making it a flexible antibacterial nanomaterial with negligible cytotoxic behavior barbolina et al 2016 ming et al 2020 perreault et al 2015 sengupta et al 2019 the antibacterial behavior of go originates from various physical interactions and electron transfers of go with the bacteria mohammed et al 2020 seifi and kamali 2021 sengupta et al 2019 yaragalla et al 2021 however the antibacterial property of go in solution greatly differs from that on a coated surface or when incorporated into a membrane cao et al 2021 yadav et al 2017 in solution go nanosheets may wrap the bacteria isolating it from the environment on a coated surface go may act as an oxidizing agent with their oxidative potential depending on the size of go perreault et al 2015 unfortunately antibacterial go nanosheets lose their activity when fabricated into a membrane due to the stacking of go layers wang et al 2019 therefore a standalone go membrane is not practically feasible due to its low antibacterial activity and poor physical strength go polymer composites can form porous membranes with good stability and mass diffusivity which have been reported for water filtration application kumar et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 this study modified go with carbonized nanogels cngs to prepare a water purification membrane for eradicating bacteria the bacteria removal is based on an antibacterial layer consisting of cngs decorated go go cngs composite coated on a filter paper that serves as the support membrane the active layer of go cngs composite membrane on a filter paper was prepared by vacuum filtration and their bacterial removal efficiency was studied by a syringe pump and syringe filter set up as displayed in scheme s1 supporting information escherichia coli e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus were chosen as the representative bacteria to study the bacteria removal efficiency of the membrane go cngs composite membrane effectively eradicated bacteria 99 9 at an optimized water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 the dynamic disruption of bacteria passing through the membrane by go cngs is the major factor contributing to the removal of bacteria rather than the mere filtration effect in addition the membranes were effective in eliminating bacteria under a very low pressure gravity and have shown to be effective in inhibiting biofilm formation the efficiency of go cngs membranes in removing bacteria 96 from contaminated water such as drainage water stagnant water and water from a moderately maintained seawater aquarium further reveals their potential for water treatment applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of cngs cngs used for the present study was synthesized by a simple dry heating of lysine hcl lysine hcl 1 0 g was placed in a 50 ml glass vial and heated in a muffle furnace at 280 c for 3 h chou et al 2021 the carbonized product thus obtained was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized di water and sonicated for 1 h the resulting solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for 30 min to remove the bigger particles the cngs in the supernatant yield 70 was quantified and stored at 4 c for future use 2 2 preparation of go cngs composite coated filter paper go cngs composites with different mass ratio of go and cngs were prepared by taking constant amount of cngs e g 1 0 mg to different amount of go e g 0 25 2 0 mg in di water under stirring for 2 min followed by sonication for 20 min to prepare the go cngs composite membrane first a filter paper qualitative filter paper advantec 2 thickness 0 26 mm pore size 5 µm as provided by the manufacturer which acts as a support membrane was washed with 30 ml of di water then go cngs composite solution was passed through the filter paper by vacuum filtration to obtain a go cngs loading of 0 4 mg cm 2 on the top of the filter paper then the coated filter papers were washed with 200 ml of sodium phosphate buffer 5 mm ph 7 4 at a water flux of 5800 ml min 1 m 2 to remove the unbound go cngs go cngs composite membrane of area 4 91 cm2 active area 2 83 cm2 was used for the entire study 2 3 removal of bacteria using go cngs coated filter paper the prepared go cngs composite membrane was tested for the removal of gram negative e coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa and gram positive s aureus methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa and bacillus subtilis b subtilis bacteria the different strains of bacteria were cultured in lysogeny broth lb medium at 37 c with shaking at 150 rpm a portion of the cell culture od600 1 was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min at 25 c and washed twice with sodium phosphate buffer 5 mm ph 7 4 the bacteria suspension was diluted to 102 105 cfu ml 1 to check the removal efficiency of the membrane the experiments were carried out in dead end mode filtration at room temperature to design a standard experimental procedure and obtain consistent results the bacteria solution was passed through a syringe filter holder diameter 2 5 cm loaded with the composite membrane and one uncoated filter paper was placed on the go cngs coated filter paper to provide support a syringe pump kd scientific u s a was used at the feed side and at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 3 ml of the filtrate was collected to check the bacterial removal efficiency the collected filtrate was diluted 10 100 times from which 100 µl was spread on lb agar plate and incubated at 37 c for 12 h for the determination of bacterial colonies the liquid culture of the collected filtrate was also performed by supplementing lb and incubating at 37 c for 12 h followed by measuring the od600 values and the bacteria eliminating efficiency is expressed in terms of relative viability each experiment was performed in quadruplicate for each condition the morphology of bacteria before and after passing through the membrane was identified using transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopy sem for tem measurements the original bacteria solution and the filtrate were separately dropped on 300 mesh carbon coated copper grids allowed to stand for 30 min then dried under vacuum the samples were dropped on silicon wafer dried under vacuum and sputtered with platinum for sem analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of go cngs go synthesized by modified hummers method has lateral sizes ranging from 200 to 250 nm fig 1 a a marcano et al 2010 the atomic force microscope afm image reveals the single layer thickness of go with a height of 1 1 0 4 nm and an average size of ca 230 nm fig s1 a supporting information the high resolution tem hrtem images of cngs synthesized from lysine hcl through mild pyrolysis at 280 c for 3 h show that rather than having a perfectly spherical shape the cngs appear to be a polymeric gel with size ranging from 50 to 200 nm fig 1a b cngs are formed from lysine hcl after dry heating mainly through dehydration polymerization crosslinking and partial carbonization lin et al 2021 the lattice spacing of 0 24 nm could be ascribed to 112 planes of the graphene lattice fringes the inset to fig 1a b the cngs differ from most reported carbon dots including graphene quantum dots carbon quantum dots and carbonized polymer dots which possess sizes usually 20 nm and have spherical nanostructures with a perfect graphene lattice in the core li et al 2021 long et al 2021 xia et al 2019 the dynamic light scattering dls measurements in sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 5 mm reveal that the cngs have an average hydrodynamic size of 250 nm due to the polymeric nanogel like nature with positive charges zeta potential ζ 8 04 mv as a result of nitrogen doping and preservation of amine groups the nitrogen mass ratio was determined to be ca 12 by elemental analysis the afm image further confirms the wide size distribution of cngs fig s1 b fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of go and cngs are displayed in fig s2 supporting information a broad peak observed for go between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 corresponds to the o h stretching vibration the peaks at 1730 and 1600 cm 1 correspond to c o asymmetric stretching and c c bonds from unoxidized sp2 carbon atoms respectively marcano et al 2010 the o h bending of the carboxyl groups is observed at 1390 cm 1 the peaks at 1220 cm 1 and 1050 cm 1 depict the phenolic c oh stretching and c o c stretching of the epoxy groups respectively aliyev et al 2019 marcano et al 2010 the ft ir results support that go nanosheets are comprised of carboxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl at the edges and epoxy groups in the basal plane aliyev et al 2019 dreyer et al 2010 the ft ir spectrum of cngs shows an absorption band at 3400 cm 1 corresponding to o h stretching and the peak at 1650 cm 1 due to stretching vibration of c o carboxyl groups present in the cngs the bands at 3125 3040 and 2900 cm 1 correspond to the different functional c h stretching li et al 2014 the peaks at 1525 and 1400 cm 1 are attributed to the n h bending vibration of the primary amino group and c n stretching vibrations respectively the uv visible absorption spectrum of cngs shows a typical absorption band of π π transition of aromatic sp2 domains at 265 nm with a shoulder band between 290 and 315 nm due to the n π transitions of c o and c n bonds fig s3 supporting information the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of go shows a single band at 2θ value of 11 2 which reveals the complete oxidation of graphite to go possessing an interlayer distance of 0 80 nm fig s4 supporting information huang et al 2018 in the case of cngs a broad band at 23 corresponding to that of the 002 of graphitic carbon further confirms the partial carbonization during the formation of cngs pal et al 2020 go cngs were prepared by simple stirring and sonication in aqueous medium at the mass ratio of go cngs of 0 25 1 0 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 and 2 0 1 0 and are denoted as go0 25 cngs go0 5 cngs go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs respectively go exhibited ζ values n 5 in the range from 37 83 4 66 to 49 43 4 33 mv in the ph range from 3 to 11 whereas the cngs showed ζ values from 13 17 3 14 to 3 58 3 59 mv in the same ph range fig s5a supporting information the ζ of the go cngs composites with different ratio decreased upon increasing the ph from 3 to 11 the ζ of all the go cngs composites are higher than cngs at different ph values whereas the ζ of go was highly negative as high as 49 43 mv the high accumulation of positively charged cngs on go formed a highly condensed layer of cngs on go which increased the ζ of the go cngs the binding of cngs to go to form go cngs composite is also supported by the afm analysis fig s1c the afm image of go cngs displays multi layered sheets of go which shows a mild aggregation of the composite the xrd pattern of go cngs in fig s4 shows that the cngs capped on the go expands the interlayer distance of go stacking leading to the shifting of band at 11 2 to ca 5 also the dls measurements show that the hydrodynamic size of go cngs highly increased with an increase in the ratio of go at ph 9 and 11 fig s5b 3 2 go cngs membrane for the removal of bacteria the tem images of the go cngs composite dispersions with different ratio of go and cngs are presented in fig 1a c f go0 25 cngs and go0 5 cngs in aqueous solution are dispersed well whereas go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs showed aggregation the sem images and digital photographs of the membranes coated with go cngs or go cngs are displayed in fig 1b and c the higher ratios of go to cngs i e go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs show aggregation due to lower zeta potentials and therefore form a uniform solid layer on the support membrane qualitative filter paper advantec 2 go cngs and lower ratios of go cngs composites do not form a film on the support membrane surface however they are adsorbed on the membrane fibers fig 1c go cngs and various go cngs coated membranes were tested for their efficiency in removing the bacteria after passing 105 cfu ml 1 of the bacteria solution 5 ml e coli or s aureus through the different membranes at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 3 ml of the filtrate was collected and checked for bacterial viability using agar plate culture method the diluted sample solution 100 µl was spread on luria broth lb agar plates and incubated at 37 c for 12 h to determine the bacterial colonies figs 2 a and s6 supporting information the relative viability of bacteria obtained by measuring the od600 of the liquid culture supplemented with lb medium is given in fig 2b the filter paper control and filter paper coated with go or cngs was not capable of removing the gram negative and gram positive bacteria go loses its antibacterial activity when fabricated into a membrane due to the stacking of go layers the loss of antimicrobial activity of go nanosheets lateral size 10 75 nm when fabricated into a membrane of thickness 30 nm was also reported by wang et al 2019 in solution go nanosheets with their nanostructure play a major role in interacting with the bacterial cell membrane resulting in membranolysis wang et al 2019 however upon stacking go loses its sharp edge nanostructure and thereby its antibacterial nature cngs strongly interact with the bacterial membrane to induce bacterial aggregation and even cell lysis lin et al 2021 mao et al 2022 their positive charge and flexible gel like structure enable them to interact well with the bacterial cell wall however the standalone cng modified membrane is not practically feasible therefore we prepared a stable membrane where the cngs hybrid with go the filter papers modified with go cngs were effective in removing e coli and s aureus the composites with a higher ratio of go i e go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs were highly operative in removing e coli 105 cfu ml 1 with almost 99 9 removal rate a similar removal effect was also observed when lower concentrations 102 103 or 104 cfu ml 1 of bacteria solution was passed through different go cngs coated membranes with go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs modified membranes showing 99 removal rate for e coli fig s7 supporting information in the case of gram positive bacteria s aureus go0 5 cngs coated filter paper could eliminate 99 9 while the go1 0 cngs and go2 0 cngs modified ones showed only ca 86 and 87 removal respectively however 99 9 removal of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria could be attained if the bacteria solution is filtered by using two go cngs coated membranes placed one above the other fig s8 supporting information the difference in response of different bacteria to various carbon based nanomaterials has also been observed in previous studies kumar et al 2020 musico et al 2014 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 gram positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan layer outside the cell membrane while gram negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer between the cell membrane and outer membrane the ζ of e coli and s aureus were measured to be ca 20 and 18 mv respectively in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 at a concentration of 105 cfu ml 1 same conditions as used in filtration the different characteristics of bacterial membranes may result in different interactions with go cngs and hence the difference in eliminating efficiency in addition the shape of bacteria may also play a significant role in their interaction with the go cngs and hence the removal rate sengupta et al 2019 furthermore the go cngs composite membrane was effective in removing other gram negative and gram positive bacteria such as p aeruginosa b subtilis and even multidrug resistant bacteria mrsa fig s9 supporting information to test whether the removal of bacteria is caused by the interaction with the unbound leakage go or cngs of go cngs present in the filtrate sodium phosphate solution 5 mm ph 7 4 was passed through each modified filter paper and bacteria 104 cfu ml 1 was spiked into the collected filtrate the lb agar plate culture of the spiked bacterial solution does not show any antibacterial phenomenon fig s10 supporting information confirming that leaching of the materials has not occurred and the bacterial removal is due to the interaction of bacteria with the composite on the filter paper our go cngs membrane used for the removal of bacteria does not require high pressure and gravitational force is sufficient to pass the water through the go1 0 cngs composite membrane active area 2 83 cm2 with 99 removal of e coil our results reveal that go cngs membrane could effectively remove the gram positive and gram negative bacteria go and cngs are reported as good antibacterial agents for the eradication of various types of bacteria anand et al 2019 lin et al 2021 mao et al 2022 also the go and cngs used in the present study show antibacterial effect against e coli in solution with a minimal inhibitory concentration mic with 99 inhibition of bacterial growth of 1 5 mg ml 1 and 10 µg ml 1 respectively however the filter paper coated with only go or cngs exhibited negligible bacteria removal even for 103 cfu ml 1 though go and cngs showed antibacterial activity in solution the go cngs modified membranes exhibited negligible antibacterial activity toward e coli and s aureus similar to that of the unmodified filter paper control fig s11 supporting information however go modified filter paper showed slight antibacterial activity toward e coli and s aureus and cngs modified filter paper toward e coli the decrease in bacterial viability 30 upon interaction with bacteria may be due to the adsorption of bacteria on the surface of go membrane which depends on the genus of bacteria ming et al 2020 however the go films with a similar surface area is reported to exhibit mass dependent attachment for the specific type of bacteria ming et al 2020 3 3 mechanism of bacterial eradication using go cngs membrane upon passing through the go cngs modified filter paper the dynamic interaction of bacteria with the go cngs on the filter paper resulted in the severe disruption of the bacterial membranes leading to the leakage of the cellular contents the electron microscopy images show the disintegration of the bacterial cell membranes of e coli and s aureus after passing through go1 0 cngs modified filter paper fig 3 the antibacterial properties of cngs contribute to the disruption of the bacterial membrane upon interacting with go cngs the lb agar plates did not show any signs of bacterial growth even after seven days of incubation at 37 c indicating that bacteria have been destroyed completely after passing through the go cngs membrane however the mechanism of removal of bacteria by the go cngs membrane is not solely based on the interaction of go cngs with the bacteria although sem images of the go1 0 cngs coated filter paper after passing 105 cfu ml 1 of e coli solution 5 ml show no obvious bacteria are retained on the modified membrane surface the real time quantitative pcr qpcr results indicated the retention of small amount of bacteria ca 20 for e coli and 10 for s aureus in the solution above the go cngs modified filter paper as a result the filtration effect of the go1 0 cngs also contributes to the removal of bacteria however we believe the bacteria are inactivated mainly by the interaction with go cngs during passing through the pores of the modified filter paper the pore size of the support filter paper used for this study is 5 µm and though the go cngs composite reduces the pore size it does not completely block all the pores therefore the tested bacteria easily can pass through the membrane enabling a low pressure driven filtration however bacteria can interact with the go cngs coated on the support filter paper during the filtration process leading to the rupture of the bacterial membranes and the leakage of cellular contents therefore the accumulation of bacteria on the surface of the membrane and the formation of biofilm on the membrane surface can be prevented by the use of the go cngs composite membrane fig s12 supporting information reveals that go cngs enables inhibition of biofilm formation and even superior to antibiotic vancomycin at the concentration of 10 µg ml 1 this prevention of biofilm on the membrane surface is useful in preventing the clogging of the pores of the membrane over time which is a major factor responsible for lowering the efficiency of the membranes during long term use for membrane based water treatment applications 3 4 effect of water flux on the removal of bacteria the water flux through the membrane was controlled by a syringe pump in this study the efficiency of go cngs membrane in removing the bacteria upon passing through it depends on the water flux because sufficient time for interaction is needed to deactivate the bacteria the dependence of water flux on the eradication of bacteria was studied choosing go1 0 cngs membrane for e coli and go0 5 cqd membrane for s aureus because these two membranes show the highest removal efficiency for the two bacteria fig 4 a shows that with a water flux 400 ml min 1 m 2 the bacteria removal efficiency decreases for both e coli and s aureus which indicates that sufficient time is necessary for the interaction of bacteria with the go cngs to damage the cell membrane and subsequent disruption we further studied the efficiency of go cngs modified filter paper in the continuous removal of bacteria fig 4b the efficiency of go cngs modified filter paper was not compromised even after passing 300 ml of s aureus solution 105 cfu ml 1 in the case of e coli the removal rate showed a slight decrease after passing 25 ml of 105 cfu ml 1 solution through the membrane however it still showed 90 removal efficiency after passing 100 ml of e coli solution and 80 removal efficiency after 300 ml this decrease in the removal efficiency may be due to the adhesion of e coli to the go cngs modified filter paper which decreases the direct interaction with further bacteria however the back pressure showed an insignificant difference and membrane surface did not show any bacteria or their debris fig s13 supporting information after passing 300 ml of bacteria solution through the go cngs modified filter paper using a syringe pump revealing the fragments of dead bacteria have a negligible effect on the permeability of the go cngs modified filter paper however we believe the bacterial removal efficiency could be improved when dealing with a large volume of contaminated water under a high water flux by using multiple layers of filter paper coated with go cngs we used dead end filtration method in this study and 105 cfu ml 1 bacteria solution the membrane did not show clogging at this condition however for higher bacterial concentration and long term use a continuous cross flow filtration system will be suitable which removes the unfiltered bacteria regularly along with the concentrate which has to be studied in detail 3 5 effective removal of bacteria from wastewaters and aquaculture water of the three different water samples tested for the removal of bacteria using go cngs modified filter paper the samples from drainage and stagnant waters collected from national taiwan ocean university campus showed colonies of complicated bacteria strains whereas water from seawater aquarium has relatively simple bacteria strains fig 5 irrespective of the type of bacteria present in the water the go0 5 cngs and go1 0 cngs modified filter papers were effective in eliminating 96 99 of the bacteria even in high ionic strength seawater however colonies of some fungal strains were observed in the culture plate of stagnant water indicating the go cngs could not remove the fungal strains probably due to their rigid cell wall kang et al 2018 which resists physical disruption by antibacterial go cngs waterborne diseases due to the microbes present in water can cause mild infections and gastroenteritis to life threatening ailments like typhoid and pneumonia we hope go cngs coated filter could potentially eliminate pathogens from contaminated environmental water for domestic purposes and purify aquaculture water through continuous filtration cycles our previous work revealed that lys cngs exhibit negligible cytotoxicity toward human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line rd human liver cancer cell line hepg2 immortalized human keratinocyte line hacat and human embryonic kidney 293 sell line hek 293 t even at a concentration of 100 µg ml 1 mao et al 2022 however more studies on the mechanical stability long term use of the go cngs membrane toxicity and long term health effects are needed 4 conclusions go cngs composite was coated as an active layer on a supporting filter paper by vacuum filtration to remove bacteria 99 bacterial removal could be achieved with the go cngs modified filter paper at a water flux of 400 ml min 1 m 2 via the interaction of bacteria with the go cngs composite the interaction disrupts the bacterial cell membrane and prevents biofilm formation the go cngs modified filter paper was highly effective in eliminating bacterial colonies in real water samples which reveals its potential for water treatment applications however the membranes were not efficient in removing the fungal strains in water in our future work we will construct a continuous cross flow filtration system for the long term stability and reusability of the go cngs modified filter membrane which can remove all kinds of microorganisms from water we believe that this material can be the prototype for a new generation membrane that can achieve high removal efficiency of pathogens present in wastewater for water reclamation declaration of competing interest the authors

16269,micropollutants present in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps after biological treatment are largely eliminated by effective advanced technologies such as ozonation discharge of contaminants into freshwater ecosystems can thus be minimized while simultaneously protecting drinking water resources however ozonation can lead to reactive and potentially toxic transformation products to remove these the swiss federal office for the environment recommends additional post treatment of ozonated wwtp effluent using sand filtration but other treatments may be similarly effective in this study 48 h composite wastewater samples were collected before and after full scale ozonation and after post treatments full scale sand filtration pilot scale fresh and pre loaded granular activated carbon and fixed and moving beds ecotoxicological tests were performed to quantify the changes in water quality following different treatment steps these included standard in vitro bioassays for the detection of endocrine genotoxic and mutagenic effects as well as toxicity to green algae and bacteria and flow through in vivo bioassays using oligochaetes and early life stages of rainbow trout results show that ozonation reduced a number of ecotoxicological effects of biologically treated wastewater by 66 93 it improved growth and photosynthesis of green algae decreased toxicity to luminescent bacteria reduced concentrations of hormonally active contaminants and significantly changed expression of biomarker genes in rainbow trout liver bioassay results showed that ozonation did not produce problematic levels of reaction products overall small increases in toxicity observed in a few samples were reduced or eliminated by post treatments however only relatively fresh granular activated carbon analyzed at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes significantly reduced effects additionally by up to 66 compared to ozonation alone inhibition of algal photosynthesis rainbow trout liver histopathology and biomarker gene expression proved to be sufficiently sensitive endpoints to detect the change in water quality achieved by post treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioassays aquatic contaminants biomarker gene expression histopathology 1 introduction conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharge a wide range of organic and inorganic micropollutants into surface waters loos et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 these include persistent pharmaceuticals personal care products cleaning agents residues of pesticides as well as transformation products petrie et al 2015 richardson and kimura 2016 sensitive species and communities in aquatic ecosystems have been shown to be adversely affected by chemicals released via wwtp effluent jobling et al 1998 kidd et al 2007 münze et al 2017 stalter et al 2013 triebskorn et al 2004 in order to minimize the discharge of micropollutants from wwtps into surface waters switzerland revised its water protection law in 2016 the aim is to protect flora and fauna of swiss rivers and drinking water resources as well as to reduce the amount of micropollutants released to other countries schweizerischer bundesrat 1998 update 1 january 2021 consequently the largest wwtps and those discharging to lakes or watercourses with a high proportion of wastewater must be upgraded using advanced technologies such as activated carbon treatment or ozonation both advanced treatment methods are highly effective in removing micropollutants and their ecotoxicological effects still present in wastewater after conventional biological treatment escher et al 2008b margot et al 2013 prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2013 völker et al 2019 which of these advanced treatments is best suited depends on the technical design of the wwtp as well as the type of wastewater wunderlin et al 2017 while activated carbon adsorbs micropollutants ozonation oxidizes the compounds and dissolved organic matter which produces transformation products and oxidation by products such as aldehydes and ketones which may be toxic lee and von gunten 2016 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 stalter et al 2010 problematic substances and their associated effects were shown to be removed by post treatment applied to abate assimilable organic carbon and biodegradable organic carbon hollender et al 2009 kienle et al 2011 stalter et al 2010 for this reason wwtps in switzerland which apply ozonation for advanced wastewater treatment are required by law to evaluate the suitability of their wastewater for ozonation by a defined procedure wunderlin et al 2017 and to include a biological post treatment step before effluent can be discharged to surface waters schweizerischer bundesrat 1998 wunderlin et al 2017 full scale ozonation is also implemented internationally as an advanced wastewater treatment technique e g in germany dopp et al 2021 wolf et al 2022 and canada maya et al 2018 nasuhoglu et al 2018 various methods are available as post treatments sand filters sf moving bed mb and fixed bed fb systems utilize biofilms to degrade chemicals while granular activated carbon gac filters remove chemicals mainly by adsorption schollée et al 2018 showed that these post treatment methods removed 54 83 of around 700 features formed in ozonation detected by non target screening with gac filters performing best target analysis also showed a better performance of gac filters compared to biological systems in removing ozonation transformation products otp from selected micropollutants bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021 however ozonation effluents contain a multitude of unidentified substances and it is not clear if post treatment can efficiently remove the ecotoxicity of such mixtures at a specific location or which post treatment methods are most efficient bioassays allow the detection and quantification of the combined effects of chemical mixtures in organisms or cells connon et al 2012 mode of action specific in vitro assays measure effects at the cellular level and are suitable for high throughput applications in the laboratory in vivo bioassays measure lethal and sublethal toxicity to model organisms exposed in static or flow through systems using a battery of bioassays this study evaluated the effectiveness of full scale ozonation for eliminating the ecotoxicity of wastewater constituents including micropollutants from conventionally treated wastewater and of different post treatment methods full scale and pilot scale in removing toxic reaction products it complements a previous study from the same wwtp and project bourgin et al 2018 which focused on the abatement of micropollutants and the formation of transformation products and oxidation by products performing these studies on a full scale plant provides the advantage that no extrapolation of results from laboratory to full scale is necessary bioassays were selected based on results of escher et al 2008b kienle et al 2011 margot et al 2013 and included in vitro assays to assess endocrine activity oxidative stress and mutagenicity as well as in vivo bioassays using organisms at different trophic levels long term tests with oligochaete worms and rainbow trout were performed in flow through systems on site at the wwtp in addition to standard effect endpoints rainbow trout livers were examined for histopathological alterations and expression of selected biomarker genes our specific goals were three fold i to monitor the occurrence of mutagenic potential of effluent due to ozonation ii to compare the efficacy of different post treatment technologies in removing ecotoxicity after ozonation and iii to identify a set of ecotoxicological endpoints suitable for routine monitoring of ozonated wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site in 2014 neugut dübendorf switzerland was the first wwtp in switzerland to begin operation of a full scale advanced wastewater treatment

the ames fluctuation assay detected no genotoxicity or mutagenicity respectively in any effluent sample when tested at higher refs several samples showed mutagenicity the ames fluctuation assay with strain ta100 without s9 showed mutagenicity at ref 10 and 20 and probable mutagenicity at ref 20 in two of 12 samples tested oz and sf campaign 1 si table s10 fig s3 while no mutagenicity was detected with strain ta100 with s9 si table s11 tests with strain ta98 without s9 classified samples after oz and sf from campaign 1 as probably mutagenic at ref 20 and 5 respectively and one sample after sf campaign 3 as mutagenic si table s12 fig s4 a b and c after metabolic activation with s9 the same strain indicated probable mutagenicity after sf campaign 3 at ref 10 si table s13 fig s4 d in samples from campaign 1 post treatments reduced sf or eliminated all other treatments the mutagenicity detected after ozonation strain ta100 without s9 tables s10 and s12 in samples from campaign 3 mutagenicity was solely observed after sf and neither after ozonation or any of the other post treatments table s12 fig s5 these results suggest that ozonation at wwtp neugut occasionally produced mutagenic compounds which were removed by fb mb gacfresh and gacloaded but not completely by sf similarly a recent review on the efficacy of advanced wastewater treatment technologies völker et al 2019 concluded that mutagenicity detected by the ames fluctuation assay with strains ta98 and ta100 occurred sporadically after ozonation as well as after different post treatments in 3 7 of samples from 11 studies other studies suggest that the formation of mutagenic compounds by ozonation depends on the type of wastewater treated schindler wildhaber et al 2015 found an increase in mutagenicity in ozone treated effluent from a wwtp treating wastewater with a high percentage of industrial wastewater the bioassay used in their study employed an additional bacterial strain yg7108 which is highly sensitive for alkylating agents yamada et al 1997 using the same assay other studies also detected mutagenicity in ozonated wastewater reduced significantly during post treatments magdeburg et al 2014 mestankova et al 2014 in our study nitrosamines one group of alkylating agents were chemically analyzed bourgin et al 2018 therefore strain yg7108 was not included another factor which might influence mutagenicity is the sample pre treatment acidification of samples before spe could lead to a decrease or an increase in mutagenicity compared to samples extracted at neutral ph depending on the composition of the wastewater sample abbas et al 2019 magdeburg et al 2014 chemical analytical results show that n nitrosodimetyhlamine ndma was formed during ozonation with a maximum concentration of 30 ng l bourgin et al 2018 this concentration can be considered unproblematic wunderlin et al 2017 and was abated during all post treatments by 41 fb to 83 gacfresh bourgin et al 2018

2013b but this effect is not seen consistently kienle et al 2013a it is possible that the effects observed were due to heavy metals or other contaminants not removed efficiently by ozonation or certain post treatments other advanced treatment methods such as activated carbon were able to remove such contaminants e g margot et al 2013 martin ruel et al 2011 3 2 flow through bioassays at wwtp

si tables s26 and s27 fig s7 these results differ from those of previous studies performed at other wwtps where growth was significantly reduced after ozonation abegglen et al 2009 kienle et al 2015 post treatment with a sand filter eliminated this effect which suggests that labile biologically active reaction products can be produced by ozonation depending on the composition of the wastewater 3

following ozonation plus post treatment with gacfresh p 0 05 table 3 fig s10 most of the post hatch mortality in sc effluent occurred during the extended test period between 65 and 96 d table 3 our results add to findings of similar studies with rainbow trout one of which detected detrimental effects of ozone treated wastewater on development and growth stalter et al 2010 another showed that ozonation reduced rainbow trout toxicity kienle et al 2013b no toxicity due to ozonation was observed by margot et al 2013 data on water quality parameters during the test are provided in si tables

berg 1997 rubin 1998 although in our experiment low dissolved oxygen levels only occurred on a few days for maximum periods of 24 h it may have contributed to the observed effects water temperature was occasionally above the target of 12 1 5 c after 45 d of exposure but never exceeded 15 8 c maximum reached in sc treatment the average temperature in experimental treatments ranged from 12 6 to 12

differences in oxygen saturation water temperature or flow rate si fig s14 between test chambers steel dwass n 25 p 0 05 during the test period ammonium can be very toxic to fish especially in its un ionized form nh3 depending on ph and temperature of the water in our experiment concentrations ranged from 0 to 0 45 mg l nh4 n before day 64 and from 0 4 to 1 16 mg l nh4 n between days 84 and 96 si table s34 fig s15 and the ph ranged from 7 1 to 8 5 si fig s16 based on available toxicity data for rainbow trout brinkman et al 2009 thurston et al 1984 u s environmental protection agency 2013 direct effects of measured ammonium concentrations on fish survival and development are unlikely furthermore severity of histopathological liver lesions did not correlate with ammonium concentrations in test chambers spearman s ρ n 5 ρ 0 14 p 0 13 and there was no covariance of liver histopathology with oxygen saturation temperature or flow rates an effect of the fish toxin ammonia nh3 which is in chemical equilibrium with ammonium is possible the measured values of maximum 1 16 mg nh4 n at 12 c in the test correspond to about 0 003 to 0 025 mg nh3 n at ph 7 8 ammonia values greater than 0 04 mg l caused histopathological effects after long term exposure over five years in rainbow trout thurston et al 1984 acute toxicity values for nh4 n and nh3 n respectively are 0 25 mg n l 2 79 mg nh3 l and 3 48 mg n l for freshwater ecosystems depending on ph and fish species ip et al 2001 randall and tsui 2002 the ec20 for effects on growth of early life stages of rainbow trout after 90 days was 7 72 mg l nh3 n brinkman et al 2009 based on all available ecotoxicity data for freshwater organisms the us epa recommends an acute quality criterion of 7 6 mg nh4 n l for ammonium and a chronic quality criterion of 1 3 mg nh4 n l at ph 8 and 12 c u s environmental protection agency 2013 based on these data direct effects of periodically increased ammonium concentrations on fish survival and development in our study are unlikely the reason for the increased ammonium concentrations is presumably the increased food requirement over time leading to an increased excretion rate of the fish however if regarded over the whole test period the increased values occurred in all treatments and thus should not influence the ability to compare between different treatments histopathology results of histopathological examination fig 6 showed that fish exposed to gacfresh effluent and control water had the healthiest livers significantly different from ozonated water oz p 0 027 and 0 0022 respectively there were no significant differences between fish exposed to effluent after ozonation and other post treatments these data confirm that gacfresh was more efficient in removing reactive substances caused by ozonation than gacloaded fish exposed to ozonated wastewater plus sf fb and mb showed most tissue damage these results are not entirely consistent with other test endpoints such as 96 d post hatch or overall survival which was lowest in fish exposed to biologically treated sc or ozonated oz wastewater table 3 based on available information see above it is unlikely but cannot be fully excluded that changes in water quality parameters in particular oxygen saturation temperature and ammonium concentrations affected these results gene expression principal component analysis pca of gene expression data shows a clear separation of trout exposed to sc effluent from all other treatments including controls fig 7 fish exposed to ozonated effluent separate clearly from those exposed to sc effluent controls and post treatments with the only exception being gacloaded there was no significant correlation of oxygen saturation or temperature with expression levels of the

reduced biomarker gene expression gacfresh and fb treatments were especially effective and gene expression patterns of fish exposed to these effluents were very similar to those of control fish 3 3 overall discussion and implications of the study our study demonstrates the significant beneficial effect of advanced treatment by ozonation on the water quality of wastewater effluent post treatments further reduced some ecotoxicological effects among these treatment with gacfresh sampled at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes performed best ozonation did not produce ecotoxicologically problematic levels of oxidation by products in our full scale set up at environmental concentrations i e 1 fold enrichment no mutagenicity was detected using the ames fluctuation assay with strains ta98 and ta100 at higher sample enrichment factors ref 1 in the assay mutagenicity occurred sporadically after ozonation campaign 1 or after sand filtration campaign 3 the low level occurrence of mutagenicity after sand filtration in one sample was unexpected and cannot be explained by the available chemical analytical data it should be kept in mind that the analyzed substances represent only a small fraction of those actually present several bioassays demonstrated the significant improvement of wastewater quality in the treatment process the combined algae assay photosynthesis and growth of green algae the bacterial luminescence inhibition assay and the erα estrogen receptor activation and pr progesterone receptor activation calux the average abatement of ecotoxicological effects during biological treatment varied for the assays and ranged from 36 pr calux to 97 erα calux only the combined algae r subcapitata bacterial luminescence inhibition a fischeri and pr calux assays were able to show the significant additional benefit of ozonation the average abatement of ecotoxicological effects during ozonation was 80 combined algae assay psii inhibition 75 combined algae assay growth inhibition 66 bacterial luminescence inhibition and 85 pr calux reproduction of water flea c dubia was impaired in one of three campaigns after ozonation and after three post treatments sf fb and gacloaded survival of waterflea and survival and reproduction of oligochaete worms l variegatus was neither affected by pc effluent nor by effluent of any other treatment step expression patterns of selected biomarker genes showed clear differences between control sc effluent ozonated effluent and some post treatments among post treatments however only gacfresh reduced ecotoxicological effects to the extent that multiple bioassay endpoints showed significant improvement compared to ozonation alone inhibition of algal photosynthesis rainbow trout liver histopathology and biomarker gene expression proved sufficiently sensitive to detect the relatively small improvement in water quality achieved by gacfresh sampled at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes post treatment with gacloaded which was run for a longer time than gacfresh and sampled at 35 000 43 000 bed volumes did not show an improvement in any test gene expression results further suggested that the fixed bed post treatment was effective in improving water quality however neither liver histopathology nor algal psii inhibition corroborated this finding histopathological results indicated that liver condition was negatively affected in fish exposed to ozonated wastewater as well as in fish exposed to effluents from all post treatments except gacfresh our study supports the results of other international studies which showed that wastewater ozonation removed certain ecotoxicological effects e g estrogenicity herbicidal effects but retained or even enhanced others e g certain endocrine effects for review see völker et al 2019 the study presented here is the first comparing the efficacy of various post treatments using a broad range of in vitro and in vivo bioassays together with the results of the accompanying publication on micropollutant elimination and the formation of transformation products and oxidation by products bourgin et al 2018 it provides valuable information on suitable post treatments following ozonation in addition results can guide the selection of relevant bioassays for future studies evaluating wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusions based on the results of our study using a broad range of bioassays and biomarkers we conclude that ozonation as an advanced wastewater treatment significantly reduces the ecotoxicity of treated wastewater increased mutagenicity due to ozonation reaction products was detected only sporadically and was successfully reduced or eliminated by all the post treatments applied in this study further improvement of water quality could be achieved by post treatment using a fresh activated carbon filter sampled at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes other post treatment methods such as fixed bed and moving bed could also be beneficial however a sand filter did not further improve wastewater quality in general it has to be kept in mind that water quality was already relatively good after biological treatment and ozonation therefore it was difficult to measure an additional improvement of the water quality by post treatments nevertheless biological post treatment after ozonation is required in switzerland to reduce biodegradable dissolved organic carbon and potentially toxic products formed during ozonation this study demonstrates that the combination of ozonation and activated carbon achieved the greatest reduction of ozonation reaction

16269,micropollutants present in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps after biological treatment are largely eliminated by effective advanced technologies such as ozonation discharge of contaminants into freshwater ecosystems can thus be minimized while simultaneously protecting drinking water resources however ozonation can lead to reactive and potentially toxic transformation products to remove these the swiss federal office for the environment recommends additional post treatment of ozonated wwtp effluent using sand filtration but other treatments may be similarly effective in this study 48 h composite wastewater samples were collected before and after full scale ozonation and after post treatments full scale sand filtration pilot scale fresh and pre loaded granular activated carbon and fixed and moving beds ecotoxicological tests were performed to quantify the changes in water quality following different treatment steps these included standard in vitro bioassays for the detection of endocrine genotoxic and mutagenic effects as well as toxicity to green algae and bacteria and flow through in vivo bioassays using oligochaetes and early life stages of rainbow trout results show that ozonation reduced a number of ecotoxicological effects of biologically treated wastewater by 66 93 it improved growth and photosynthesis of green algae decreased toxicity to luminescent bacteria reduced concentrations of hormonally active contaminants and significantly changed expression of biomarker genes in rainbow trout liver bioassay results showed that ozonation did not produce problematic levels of reaction products overall small increases in toxicity observed in a few samples were reduced or eliminated by post treatments however only relatively fresh granular activated carbon analyzed at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes significantly reduced effects additionally by up to 66 compared to ozonation alone inhibition of algal photosynthesis rainbow

graphical abstract keywords bioassays aquatic contaminants biomarker gene expression histopathology 1 introduction conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharge a wide range of organic and inorganic micropollutants into surface waters loos et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 these include persistent pharmaceuticals personal care products cleaning agents residues of pesticides as well as transformation products petrie et al 2015 richardson and kimura 2016 sensitive species and communities in aquatic ecosystems have been shown to be adversely affected by chemicals released via wwtp effluent jobling et al 1998 kidd et al 2007 münze et al 2017 stalter et al 2013 triebskorn et al 2004 in order to minimize the discharge of micropollutants from wwtps into surface waters switzerland revised its water protection law in 2016 the aim is to protect flora and fauna of swiss rivers and drinking water resources as well as to reduce the amount of micropollutants released to other countries schweizerischer bundesrat 1998 update 1 january 2021 consequently the largest wwtps and those discharging to lakes or watercourses with a high proportion of wastewater must be upgraded using advanced technologies such as activated carbon treatment or ozonation both advanced treatment methods are highly effective in removing micropollutants and their ecotoxicological effects still present in wastewater after conventional biological treatment escher et al 2008b margot et al 2013 prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2013 völker et al 2019 which of these advanced treatments is best suited depends on the technical design of the wwtp as well as the type of wastewater wunderlin et al 2017 while activated carbon adsorbs micropollutants ozonation oxidizes the compounds and dissolved organic matter which produces transformation products and oxidation by products such as aldehydes and ketones which may be toxic lee and von gunten 2016 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 stalter et al 2010 problematic substances and their associated effects were shown to be removed by post treatment applied to abate assimilable organic carbon and biodegradable organic carbon hollender et al 2009 kienle et al 2011 stalter et al 2010 for this reason wwtps in switzerland which apply ozonation for advanced wastewater treatment are required by law to evaluate the suitability of their wastewater for ozonation by a defined procedure wunderlin et al 2017 and to include a biological post treatment step before effluent can be discharged to surface waters schweizerischer bundesrat 1998 wunderlin et al 2017 full scale ozonation is also implemented internationally as an advanced wastewater treatment technique e g in germany dopp et al 2021 wolf et al 2022 and canada maya et al 2018 nasuhoglu et al 2018 various methods are available as post treatments sand filters sf moving bed mb and fixed bed fb systems utilize biofilms to degrade chemicals while granular activated carbon gac filters remove chemicals mainly by adsorption schollée et al 2018 showed that these post treatment methods removed 54 83 of around 700 features formed in ozonation detected by non target screening with gac filters performing best target analysis also showed a better performance of gac filters compared to biological systems in removing ozonation transformation products otp from selected micropollutants bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021 however ozonation effluents contain a multitude of unidentified substances and it is not clear if post treatment can efficiently remove the ecotoxicity of such mixtures at a specific location or which post treatment methods are most efficient bioassays allow the detection and quantification of the combined effects of chemical mixtures in organisms or cells connon et al 2012 mode of action specific in vitro assays measure effects at the cellular level and are suitable for high throughput applications in the laboratory in vivo bioassays measure lethal and sublethal toxicity to model organisms exposed in static or flow through systems using a battery of bioassays this study evaluated the effectiveness of full scale ozonation for eliminating the ecotoxicity of wastewater constituents including micropollutants from conventionally treated wastewater and of different post treatment methods full scale and pilot scale in removing toxic reaction products it complements a previous study from the same wwtp and project bourgin et al 2018 which focused on the abatement of micropollutants and the formation of transformation products and oxidation by products performing these studies on a full scale plant provides the advantage that no extrapolation of results from laboratory to full scale is necessary bioassays were selected based on results of escher et al 2008b kienle et al 2011 margot et al 2013 and included in vitro assays to assess endocrine activity oxidative stress and mutagenicity as well as in vivo bioassays using organisms at different trophic levels long term tests with oligochaete worms and rainbow trout were performed in flow through systems on site at the wwtp in addition to standard effect endpoints rainbow trout livers were examined for histopathological alterations and expression of selected biomarker genes our specific goals were three fold i to monitor the occurrence of mutagenic potential of effluent due to ozonation ii to compare the efficacy of different post treatment technologies in removing ecotoxicity after ozonation and iii to identify a set of ecotoxicological endpoints suitable for routine monitoring of ozonated wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site in 2014 neugut dübendorf switzerland was the first wwtp in switzerland to begin operation of a full scale advanced wastewater treatment using ozonation followed by sand filtration sf in addition to a primary clarifier conventional activated sludge treatment aerobic and anaerobic including biological phosphorus removal and a secondary clarifier biological treatment the wwtp has a maximum capacity of 150 000 population equivalents with an approximate industrial contribution of 50 based on chemical oxygen demand primarily from the food and fragrance industry the quality of the treated secondary effluent is presented in detail in bourgin et al 2018 and is typical of swiss domestic wastewater schindler wildhaber et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 ozone was dosed to the effluent of the secondary clarifier in a full scale multi chamber ozonation reactor with a total volume of 530 m3 and an average retention time of 43 min during dry weather ozone was completely depleted under these conditions five post treatment technologies were investigated in addition to the existing sand filter full scale quartz sand 0 7 to 2 0 mm

the ames fluctuation assay detected no genotoxicity or mutagenicity respectively in any effluent sample when tested at higher refs several samples showed mutagenicity the ames fluctuation assay with strain ta100 without s9 showed mutagenicity at ref 10 and 20 and probable mutagenicity at ref 20 in two of 12 samples tested oz and sf campaign 1 si table s10 fig s3 while no mutagenicity was detected with strain ta100 with s9 si table s11 tests with strain ta98 without s9 classified samples after oz and sf from campaign 1 as probably mutagenic at ref 20 and 5 respectively and one sample after sf campaign 3 as mutagenic si table s12 fig s4 a b and c after metabolic activation with s9 the same strain indicated probable mutagenicity after sf campaign 3 at ref 10 si table s13 fig s4 d in samples from campaign 1 post treatments reduced sf or eliminated all other treatments the mutagenicity detected after ozonation strain ta100 without s9 tables s10 and s12 in samples from campaign 3 mutagenicity was solely observed after sf and neither after ozonation or any of the other post treatments table s12 fig s5 these results suggest that ozonation at wwtp neugut occasionally produced mutagenic compounds which were removed by fb mb gacfresh and gacloaded but not completely by sf similarly a recent review on the efficacy of advanced wastewater treatment technologies völker et al 2019 concluded that mutagenicity detected by the ames fluctuation assay with strains ta98 and ta100 occurred sporadically after ozonation as well as after different post treatments in 3 7 of samples from 11 studies other studies suggest that the formation of mutagenic compounds by ozonation depends on the type of wastewater treated schindler wildhaber et al 2015 found an increase in mutagenicity in ozone treated effluent from a wwtp treating wastewater with a high percentage of industrial wastewater the bioassay used in their study employed an additional bacterial strain yg7108 which is highly sensitive for alkylating agents yamada et al 1997 using the same assay other studies also detected mutagenicity in ozonated wastewater reduced significantly during post treatments magdeburg et al 2014 mestankova et al 2014 in our study nitrosamines one group of alkylating agents were chemically analyzed bourgin et al 2018 therefore strain yg7108 was not included another factor which might influence mutagenicity is the sample pre treatment acidification of samples before spe could lead to a decrease or an increase in mutagenicity compared to samples extracted at neutral ph depending on the composition of the wastewater sample abbas et al 2019 magdeburg et al 2014 chemical analytical results show that n nitrosodimetyhlamine ndma was formed during ozonation with a maximum concentration of 30 ng l bourgin et al 2018 this concentration can be considered unproblematic wunderlin et al 2017 and was abated during all post treatments by 41 fb to 83 gacfresh bourgin et al 2018

2013b but this effect is not seen consistently kienle et al 2013a it is possible that the effects observed were due to heavy metals or other contaminants not removed efficiently by ozonation or certain post treatments other advanced treatment methods such as activated carbon were able to remove such contaminants e g margot et al 2013 martin ruel et al 2011 3 2 flow through bioassays at wwtp

post treatment with a sand filter eliminated this effect which suggests that labile biologically active reaction products can be produced by ozonation depending on the composition of the wastewater 3

results add to findings of similar studies with rainbow trout one of which detected detrimental effects of ozone treated wastewater on development and growth stalter et al 2010 another showed that ozonation reduced rainbow trout toxicity kienle et al 2013b no toxicity due to ozonation was observed by margot et al 2013 data on water quality parameters during the test are provided in si tables

berg 1997 rubin 1998 although in our experiment low dissolved oxygen levels only occurred on a few days for maximum periods of 24 h it may have contributed to the observed effects water temperature was occasionally above the target of 12 1 5 c after 45 d of exposure but never exceeded 15 8 c maximum reached in sc treatment the average temperature in experimental treatments ranged from 12 6 to 12

direct effects of measured ammonium concentrations on fish survival and development are unlikely furthermore severity of histopathological liver lesions did not correlate with ammonium concentrations

criterion of 1 3 mg nh4 n l at ph 8 and 12 c u s environmental protection agency 2013 based on these data direct effects of periodically increased ammonium concentrations on fish survival and development in our study are unlikely the reason for the increased ammonium concentrations is presumably the increased food requirement over time leading to an increased excretion rate of the fish however if regarded over the whole test period the increased values occurred in all treatments and thus should not influence the ability to compare between different treatments histopathology results of histopathological examination fig 6 showed that fish exposed to gacfresh effluent and control water had the healthiest livers significantly different from ozonated water oz p 0 027 and 0 0022 respectively there were no significant differences between fish exposed to effluent after ozonation and other post treatments these data confirm that gacfresh was more efficient in removing reactive substances caused by ozonation than gacloaded fish exposed to ozonated wastewater plus sf fb and mb showed most tissue damage these results are not entirely consistent with other test endpoints such as 96 d post hatch or overall survival which was lowest in fish exposed to biologically treated sc or ozonated oz wastewater table 3 based on available information see above it is unlikely but cannot be fully excluded that changes in water quality parameters in particular oxygen saturation temperature and ammonium concentrations affected these results gene expression principal component analysis pca of gene expression data shows a clear separation of trout exposed to sc effluent from all other treatments including controls fig 7 fish exposed to ozonated effluent separate clearly from those exposed to sc effluent controls and post treatments with the only exception being gacloaded there was no significant correlation of oxygen saturation or temperature with expression levels of the biomarker genes included in the pca analysis expression data of several genes affected by low do hsp70 mta hmox gpx were omitted in livers of fish exposed to sc effluent several genes indicative of

proliferator activated receptor pgc 1alpha si fig s17 expression levels of some oxidative stress biomarkers were also elevated in other treatments but were significantly lower than levels measured in fish exposed to sc effluent fish exposed to ozonated effluent showed elevated levels of nrf2 and sod compared to controls and expression of cat was elevated in fish exposed to mb and gacfresh

reduced biomarker gene expression gacfresh and fb treatments were especially effective and gene expression patterns of fish exposed to these effluents were very similar to those of control fish 3 3 overall discussion and implications of the study our study demonstrates the significant beneficial effect of advanced treatment by ozonation on the water quality of wastewater effluent post treatments further reduced some ecotoxicological effects among these treatment with gacfresh sampled at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes performed best ozonation did not produce ecotoxicologically problematic levels of oxidation by products in our full scale set up at environmental concentrations i e 1 fold enrichment no mutagenicity was detected using the ames fluctuation assay with strains ta98 and ta100 at higher sample enrichment factors ref 1 in the assay mutagenicity occurred sporadically after ozonation campaign 1 or after sand filtration campaign 3 the low level occurrence of mutagenicity after sand filtration in one sample was unexpected and cannot be explained by the available chemical analytical data it should be kept in mind that the analyzed substances represent only a small fraction of those actually present several bioassays demonstrated the significant improvement of wastewater quality in the treatment process the combined algae assay photosynthesis and growth of green algae the bacterial luminescence inhibition assay and the erα estrogen receptor activation and pr progesterone receptor activation calux the average abatement of ecotoxicological effects during biological treatment varied for the assays and ranged from 36 pr calux to 97 erα calux only the combined algae r subcapitata bacterial luminescence inhibition a fischeri and pr calux assays were able to show the significant additional benefit of ozonation the average abatement of ecotoxicological effects during ozonation was 80 combined algae assay psii inhibition 75 combined algae assay growth inhibition 66 bacterial luminescence inhibition and 85 pr calux reproduction of water flea c dubia was impaired in one of three campaigns after ozonation and after three post treatments sf fb and gacloaded survival of waterflea and survival and reproduction of oligochaete worms l variegatus was neither affected by pc effluent nor by effluent of any other treatment step expression patterns of selected biomarker genes showed clear differences between control sc effluent ozonated effluent and some post treatments among post treatments however only gacfresh reduced ecotoxicological effects to the extent that multiple bioassay endpoints showed significant improvement compared to ozonation alone inhibition of algal photosynthesis rainbow trout liver histopathology and biomarker gene expression proved sufficiently sensitive to detect the relatively small improvement in water quality achieved by gacfresh sampled at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes post treatment with gacloaded which was run for a longer time than gacfresh and sampled at 35 000 43 000 bed volumes did not show an improvement in any test gene expression results further suggested that the fixed bed post treatment was effective in improving water quality however neither liver histopathology nor algal psii inhibition corroborated this finding histopathological results indicated that liver condition was negatively affected in fish exposed to ozonated wastewater as well as in fish exposed to effluents from all post treatments except gacfresh our study supports the results of other international studies which showed that wastewater ozonation removed certain ecotoxicological effects e g estrogenicity herbicidal effects but retained or even enhanced others e g certain endocrine effects for review see völker et al 2019 the study presented here is the first comparing the efficacy of various post treatments using a broad range of in vitro and in vivo bioassays together with the results of the accompanying publication on micropollutant elimination and the formation of transformation products and oxidation by products bourgin et al 2018 it provides valuable information on suitable post treatments following ozonation in addition results can guide the selection of relevant bioassays for future studies evaluating wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusions based on the results of our study using a broad range of bioassays and biomarkers we conclude that ozonation as an advanced wastewater treatment significantly reduces the ecotoxicity of treated wastewater increased mutagenicity due to ozonation reaction products was detected only sporadically and was successfully reduced or eliminated by all the post treatments applied in this study further improvement of water quality could be achieved by post treatment using a fresh activated carbon filter sampled at 13 000 20 000 bed volumes other post treatment methods such as fixed bed and moving bed could also be beneficial however a sand filter did not further improve wastewater quality in general it has to be kept in mind that water quality was already relatively good after biological treatment and ozonation therefore it was difficult to measure an additional improvement of the water quality by post treatments nevertheless biological post treatment after ozonation is required in switzerland to reduce biodegradable dissolved organic carbon and potentially toxic products formed during ozonation this study demonstrates that the combination of ozonation and activated carbon achieved the greatest reduction of ozonation reaction
